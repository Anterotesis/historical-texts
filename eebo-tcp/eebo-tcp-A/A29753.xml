            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:66147:3"/>
dreadful, then Famine, Sword and Pestilence would be) become humbled and sorrowful after a godly manner; so, upon the other hand, the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hereof should raise in us a more high esteem for the Precious Interests of Jesus Christ, and kindle in us more godly Zeal for his Truths &amp; Cause, and make us heartily receive not only the Truth, but the love of the Truth, that we may be saved; for the neglect of which Duty, it was foretold and threatned, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2:11, 12. <hi>that for this cause, God shall send strong delusion, that they</hi> (to wit, who received not the love of the truth) <hi>should beleeve a lie, that they all might be damned, who beleeved not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> When the Lion is roaring, ought not we to tremble? When the Jealous and Righteous God is sending on a generation of Undervaluers and Despisers of the great &amp; inestimable benefite of the Everlasting Gospel, a sader stroke, than his three great Plagues would be, that should make populous Countreys and Cities waste, and without Inhabitants, in a very short time, what Christian heart will not tremble and be afraied? When the Lord sends upon a Land his three great Messengers of wrath, which can but destroy the Body, that must at length however return to the dust, are not all called to consider their wayes, and to turn unto the Lord? How much more are we now called hereunto, when the Lord is saying, <hi>I will also chuse their delusions</hi>; and is giving many up unto this Spirit of Delusion and Apostasie, whereby some, that have been formerly enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, &amp;c. put themselves under that terrible impossibility, whereof the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6:6. <hi>Of being renewed againe unto Repentance, seing they crucifie to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame</hi>; and under that dreadful sentence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10:26. <hi>For if we sin wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinnes, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devoure the Adversaries</hi>; and under that <hi>much sorer punishment (ibid. vers.</hi> 29.) <hi>which they shall be thought worthy of, who have troden under foot the Son of God, and have counted the bloud of the Covenant, wherewith He was sanctified, an unholy thing, and have done despite unto the Spirit of grace</hi>? For I know not, if ever there was a Seck of Hereticks, and Apostats from the Truth once received, since the Apostasie of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> unto whom these passages are more truely and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically applicable, than to the Apostat-<hi>Quakers</hi>; who at length shall know, how fearful a thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God, though now they be so bold &amp; wicked, in their way, that it is not enough for them to Apostatize from the Truth; but they must also with a furious madness persecute the same Truth which their souls do now hate, with their blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous mouthes and pens; and with their railings and Rabshakeh-language reproach the Wayes of God, and all who follow the same. Sure I am, a due pondering of the desperat Designe, pernicious Wayes, hellish Doctrine, &amp; wicked Practices, which these Emissaries of Satan project and follow-forth with a stupenduous activity, should affect us otherwayes, than (alas!) we seem to be at present. What, are we asleep? Are we not crying to the Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:66147:3"/>
night and day, that he would arise, and vindicate His own Truth, when an enraged company of <hi>Runagadoes</hi> are destroying (so far as they can) the whole of our Religion, and driving us back to Paganisme, and betraying the whole of our sacred Interest into the hands of their Master, the Devil? Can we hear our blessed Lord and Saviour thus blasphemed, as he is by this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganish Antievangelick Seck of <hi>Quakers,</hi> and not be so much moved with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation against them, as even <hi>Turks</hi> (who blasphemously assert our Lord to be no more, than a Prophet, inferiour to their deceiver <hi>Mahomet</hi>) would be, of whose just severity, in punishing a <hi>Iew,</hi> who, in his rage, striving with a Christian, did blaspheme the blessed name of <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sentence of one of their <hi>Muftees,</hi> we have heard, and found standing on record, to the shame of Christians, who have not so much Zeal for Him, whom they profess to owne for the true and living God, and for the only Son of God, and Saviour of Man, as <hi>Turks</hi> have for a Prophet of God? Thus it ought not to be; and a redress is called for, at the hands of one and other, according to their Place and Station. And however, it is the duty of all, who love our Lord Jesus Christ, and hope to see His face, one day, with joy, and of all who would carry as true and loyal Subjects unto Him, and would not be charged with the guilt of this God-darring, Christ-blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, and Spirit-despiting generation of the prodigiously profane and arrogant Seck of <hi>Runagad-Quakers,</hi> to be this day, holding them up in their addresses unto God by prayer, to our Lord Jesus, the righteous Judge, as His sworn and stated Enemies, and as standing in perfect Opposition to His Kingdom and Interest; and to cry unto Him night and day, that He would arise and appear against them, and plead His own cause, in His good time, for the glory of His name; as also to be mourning for those sinnes, that have provoked the Just and Jealous God to suffer such Hellish Locusts to arise, and darken with their pestiferous blasphemies all the Glorious &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Truths of the Gospel; and to be manifesting the truth and sincerity of our Repentance, by the native and kindly effects thereof, mentioned by <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7:11.</p>
            <p>And if it were thus with us, sure I am, it would not be needful to say much, to move all unto a fixed abhorrence of the Errours, Wayes and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of these Men, and to a fleeing from them, as from Men, carrying about with them the very Credentials of Hell, and the Devils Commission to go forth, and pervert the right wayes of the Lord, and to destroy Souls. We would not need to inculcate the duties already pressed in the Scriptures, in reference to such Hereticks and false Teachers; <hi>to wit, to beware of them, to avoide them, turn away from them, to reject them, and not to receive them in our houses, or salute them, lest we should be partakers of their evil deeds, Mat.</hi> 7:15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16:17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3:2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2:5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3:10. 2 <hi>Ioh. vers.</hi> 10, 11. For every one would, of his own accord, by a special Christian instinct, flee from them, more hastily, then from persons having the blak botch, upon the account, that when these could endanger only the Body, those were actively
<pb facs="tcp:66147:4"/>
seeking to destroy the precious Soul: And all, who feared to fall under that sad sentence of summar Excommunication from Heaven, <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> durst ever enter into a friendly communing with them, have any followshipe with them, or give them the least token of kindness and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by word or deed, yea or by a cast of the eye, let be by more homely Discoursings and Conversings. And it is more then probable, that if this course had been followed with them at the first, they had not prevailed so much, as they have done, to our Shame, Sin, and Sorrow, this day. O that this were yet thought upon, and amended!</p>
            <p>Much less would there be any necessity to use much seriousness, in disswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, who had any love to their own souls, from hearkning to their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, even though assurance were had (which who, that know what their Principles and Designes are, can expect?) that they should say nothing, but what is consonant to Truth; seing it will be easily granted, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, speaking in whomsoever, and uttering whatsomever, should not be listned unto, lest afterward he cause these same persons either question, or deny these same truths, because held and declared by such, who by their other abominable Errours, declare whose Slaves and Emissaries they are; beside the advantage he hath, when he getteth an hearing ear, to distil and insensibly drop-in soul-destroying venome, suggared over with faire Speeches, and plausible Insinuations.</p>
            <p>Moreover, were all affected with this matter, as they ought to be, there would not be much need of Arguments, disswading from a Perusal and Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their <hi>Scripts</hi> and <hi>Pamphlets</hi>: For this impression would prompt them to an abhorrence of such Libels against the God and Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, against blessed Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> (of whom these <hi>Quakers</hi> say, as their Father the Devil did before them, <hi>what have we to do with thee, thou Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us of Nazareth</hi>?) And against the holy Spirit of grace. Is it not obvious to all, that beside the advantage the Devil hath in our losse of so much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time, spent in reading of their heretical and blasphemous writings, (which may be one end why the Devil prompteth them to be at so much paines and charges, to Write, and Printe so many pernicious Scripts, and distribute them so freely) he hath this also, that the reading of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Reavings, in and about the holy things of God, and with all, of their Presumptuous and ridiculously confident Assertions, doth oft excite the Reader to laughter, who should rather be weeping over the manifest Effrontry done to the holy and precious Truths of God; and Indignity done to the Holy Lord, when His name is thus taken in vaine: And much more, when the reading of their Blasphemous and Outragious Speaches against the Holy One; of their Profane and Temerarious Abusings and Wrestings of the holy Word of Truth; of their Audacious and Wicked Overturnings of the whole Gospel of the grace of God; of their Subdolous and Craftie Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining of the Fundamental points of our Religion; of their Supercilious and Effronted Rejectings of, and Mockings at the sacred Truths of God;
<pb facs="tcp:66147:4"/>
and of their Irreverent and Fearless Prattings about the Mysteries of Divine and Unsearchable Wisdom, cannot but insensibly debauch the spirit of the Reader into, at least, unsutable thoughts about these great Matters, if he be not more then ordinarily ballasted with the apprehension of the dreadful Majestie of that God, whose Truths these are. The consideration of which should, me thinks, coole our Curiosity; and cause us, even when some necessity is laid upon us, which we cannot evite, to read them, as when called to write against them, and to discover their abominable and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Assertions, for preventing of further mischiefe (a necessitie that lyeth not upon every one of our Common People) to live nigh to God, and to be oft praying for a stayed frame of heart, that our spirits be not debauched, by the reading of such things, as have a native tendency thereunto; nor place be given to one thought of these great and glorious matters, as if they were but indifferent, or of small moment. Who can dive into the depths of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the mysteries of their Blasphemies and Abominations, and not be in hazard of receiving hurt thereby, if the Lord do not strengthen and steel the Soul?</p>
            <p>Finally, were we as we ought to be, there would be no necessity of dehorting any from giving countenance, in the least, unto their Synagogues of Satan, and Diabolical Conventicles, where some, out of curiosity or some other corrupt ends, sisting themselves within the jurisdiction of Satan, who there reigneth, being there solemnly Served and Worshiped, have been) as the Quakers themselves do boast, and this <hi>R. Barclay</hi> professeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a clear instance) catched by the Devil, and made to drink of the same Cup of Delusion, with the rest; and to devote themselves to the same service of the Enemy of God and of Mankinde, in which these Master-workers are so active and busie. It is not good to approach too nigh to a rageing Devil, nor to tempt the Lord: The history of the two persons, that would be present at stage playes, is known; and the Reader may see the same related to his hand, by the worthy Author of the <hi>first Epistle to the Reader,</hi> prefixed to Mr <hi>Durham's Exposition of the Commands.</hi> Let any sober and judicious person consider that, which these <hi>Quakers</hi> call their <hi>Solemne Worshipe,</hi> as this <hi>R.

Nothing, that I ever heard or knew of them before, did so much confirme me of their <hi>Devilrie,</hi> as the reading and examining of that, which thou hast here <hi>Chap.</hi> XXII.

and Practices, (all so contrary to the Way and Profession, wherein they have lived from their Infancy) that they can act their wayes, and utter their Abomination, in their very dialect and tone, so exactly, as if they had seen nothing else, all their dayes; to speak nothing of Persons civilly edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, who yet, turning <hi>Quakers,</hi> can so suddenly and so perfectly imitate and follow their rude and rustick carriage, as if they had never seen civility with their eyes: All which may confirme Rational Persons, that it is not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but the work of some powerful Spirit, possessing them; And what this Spirit is, which Teacheth, Possesseth, Prompteth, Acteth, Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and Driveth them, and Speaketh in them, the Word of God doth sufficiently evidence, and may satisfie all Christians: By the fruit we know a tree; and by their doctrine, we may as infallibly know, that it is the Spirit of Satan, that rageth in them, if we will be satisfied with, and submit to the Decision of the Spirit of Truth, speaking in the Scriptures. Their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury, Pernicious, and Blasphemous Positions and Assertions will put this matter beyond all debate. I have gathered together an heap of such, to the Number of Three Hundered and Fiftie, and moe (and the Reader may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly finde yet moe, that have escaped me, and that without noticeing such things, as may be drawn by just consequence from their Positive Assertions; for if these were collected, we might soon finde out the number of the Name of the Beast, Six hundereth Sixty and Six) to which may be added Sixty and Five, found in one book of G. <hi>Keiths,</hi> set down here at the end, after the Postscript; by which, thou mayest judge, what a Masse would be found, if all their Books were searched. But I suppose, the fearer of God will say, there is here enough, and more then enough, to cause all Christians abhore them and flee from them, as from the Devil himself.</p>
            <p>I shall not trouble thee, with any <hi>Apologie</hi> for the work it self; Only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I apprehend, some will think I am too large, and might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the whole into narrower bounds; I must tell thee, that considering the genius and temper of these <hi>Quakers,</hi> and knowing how ready they would be to vaunt and triumph, as if any thing they said were unanswerable, if I had passed over any thing said by their Patron and Advocat, and had not examined particularly, not only his Erronious and Blasphemous Assertions; but also all that he did alledge for confirmation of the same; and also all that he belched out against the Truth; I was constrained to leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched: and that the book might be of more universal use, I saw a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of clearing and confirming the Truths Opposed, by other Grounds and Arguments, then this Contradicter of the wayes of Truth had taken any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of: And yet I have done it with that brevitie, that maketh me appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, Moe shall blame me, upon the other hand, for not confirming the Turths at greater length; seing, as to several Heads, here touched, Others now a dayes, beside <hi>Quakers,</hi> are appearing against the Truth, once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The Heads, it is true, are many; and I have in most, for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, adduced only our <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Catechismes,</hi> to the end, that

one and other may be enduced to peruse that book more, as a good Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote against the many Errours of this time, pointing withall the Readers to apposite passages of Scripture, for the ground of their faith. And if I had handled each Controversie, here touched, at full length, how many volumes should I have been necessitate to have written? What intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this shall finde with the <hi>Quakers</hi> (a sort of Men, that cannot be silent) I am not much concerned to enquire; And if they examine it, as Rats or Mice use to deal with books, snatching at a word here, and at half a sentence there, and no more, I suppose no man will think me called to notice the fame; nor yet to be troubled at their Railings, and Barkings: And as for any answere to the whole, that shall savoure of Reason, Religion, Candor and Plainness, I do not expect it from them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Some remarks upon his Preface to his THESES.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore this Author come to set downe his <hi>Theses,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth a Preface, wherein (1.) He giveth us the Title &amp; inscription of them. (2.) He sheweth to whom he doth particularly make his address, or to whom he directeth these his <hi>Theses,</hi> to be considered, or confuted. (3.) He is pleased, to prevent our mistake, to give us a description of himself, their Author. And (4) We have his prologue, or preliminary discourse, to those, unto whom he addresseth himself.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I shall not so far preoccupy the judgment of the Reader in the threshold, as to shew &amp; demonstrate, that his <hi>Theses,</hi> which he stileth <hi>Theological,</hi> might more fitly &amp; truely be called <hi>Ethnical,</hi> or, if you will, <hi>Diabolical:</hi> for upon the review of the whole, after the ensueing <hi>examen,</hi> this will appeare so manifest, as if written with a sun-beame, to all not blinded with prejudice, &amp; who believe the Word of God, &amp; close with it, as our only Rule of Faith &amp; Practice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His <hi>Theses</hi> he directeth to all <hi>Clerks,</hi> or clergymen, or what he will have us understand by <hi>Clericis</hi> (for thus he loveth to speak, whether Ironically (as he supposeth we call him, &amp; others of his way, <hi>Quakers</hi>) &amp; out of contempt &amp; disdain, or upon any other account, I leave every man to judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: But what <hi>Clerks</hi> are these? <hi>To Clerks</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>of all sorts of the whole Christian world.</hi> Whereby it is obvious, that he acknowledgeth a Christian world, in which are Clergy-men of various kindes, &amp; to which he himself, &amp; others whom he here
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66147:12"/>
Patronizeth, do not belong; for he speaketh of them all, as belonging to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Profession, than what he &amp; his fraternity hold: and while he thus mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly excludeth himself &amp; his party from the Christian world, every one may freely judge to what a world he &amp; they must needs belong. It is ominous to stumble thus in the very threshold. But whom doth he meane by these <hi>Clericis?</hi> The following words will not suffer us to think, that he meaneth all the people of God; nor will the expressions themselves admit that; because these <hi>Clerici</hi> must be but apart of the Christian world. And if he understand hereby <hi>Church-officers,</hi> as distinct from <hi>Church-members,</hi> he joyneth herein with Papists against Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, who account the whole Church, &amp; not the Officers thereof only, as do Papists, to be God's Clergy or Heritage, as doth the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet, 5, 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. More especially, in the next place, he directeth them to <hi>Doctors, Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, &amp; Students of Theology:</hi> (and this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot but think, is spoken indeed ironically; for in his esteem, it is not true <hi>Theologie,</hi> which is taught by these <hi>Doctors</hi> &amp; <hi>Professours,</hi> &amp; learned by these <hi>Students:)</hi> and that we may know, who these <hi>all Doctors</hi> &amp;c. are, he addeth, <hi>in all the Academies of Europe, whether Popish or Protestant:</hi> what his designe hereby is cannot be hid; for who seeth not that he intendeth his <hi>Theses</hi> as a chartal to provoke them, or any of them all, to a disput; which must needs argue too great an excess of blinde confidence in this Man: and withal, there is a subdolous Insinuation here manifest; for hereby he would make the world believe, that his opinions are equally different from &amp; repugnant to the <hi>Popish Abominations,</hi> &amp; to the <hi>Protestant Truth</hi>: which is a shreud presumption, that his ensueing doctrine will not savoure much of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian candor; seing it is so obvious, &amp; shall be made manifest, ere all be done, that his opinions homologate more with the <hi>Popish,</hi> than with the <hi>Protestant</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And if a provocation to dispute were not here intended, why would he direct his <hi>Theses</hi> more especially to <hi>Professours</hi> &amp; <hi>Students</hi> in <hi>Academies,</hi> &amp; not equally unto all Christians in common; as charity would require of one, who should intend the common good, that is, the edefication &amp; right information of such, as he supposeth to be out of the way? But I am apt to think, (and it may be every one shall judge me not far mistaken in this) that this confident brag was resolved upon, to the end common people might hear, that such a <hi>Quaker</hi> had provoked all the learned men of <hi>Europe</hi> to a disput, &amp; none durst enter the lists to fight with this <hi>Goliah:</hi> &amp; thence suspect, if not conclude, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are the only maintainers &amp; owners of <hi>Truth</hi>: &amp; their <hi>sayings</hi> must be all unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable &amp; irrefragable <hi>Assertions:</hi> But the judicious &amp; learned may at the first see, there is little cause to be moved at all this confidence, there being so little said hereby him, which hath not been examined, &amp; condemned both from Scripture &amp; found Reason, by the faithfull asserters of the orthodox truth, writt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the <hi>Pelagians, Arminians, Socinians, Enthusiasts, Anabaptists, Papists,</hi> &amp; others, to whom alone he is obliged for all that he hath said, whether in his <hi>Theses,</hi> or in his large <hi>Apologie</hi> &amp; <hi>Vindication,</hi> &amp; that before he was borne. So that once to take notice of what he hath here scraped-together out of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Heterodox,</hi> might seem a rejecting of the wise mans counsel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26:4. <hi>answere not a fool according to his follie, lest thou also be like unto him:</hi> But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration

Notwithstanding that the beginning of strife is as when one lett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out water, &amp; that therefore it were better to leave off his contention before it be medled with; yet, upon the forementioned considerations, &amp; to establish such as, it may be, are staggering, or ready to be shaken; &amp; others, who desire further clearing of, &amp; their own confirmation in the Truth, I shall, through the help of the God of Truth, (howbeit I be none of those, whom he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly here describeth, as the men he would fainest deal with) adventure to discover what evill apprehend to lye wrapped up in his <hi>fifteen Theses,</hi> &amp; in his large book entituled an <hi>Apologie,</hi> written for futher confirmation &amp; explication of his <hi>Theses;</hi> and that in the language best understood by our countrey men, whom I judge most in hazard by these mens doctrine: leaving such of those, he most particularly bespeaketh in his preface, as shall judge it convenient &amp; to edification, to emit in latine, a discovery of his pernicious, but groundless, errours.</p>

But if he speak thus, upon a more special account, as some will confidently believe he doth, he must not be offended, if I desire to see his credentials, that it may appear, he taketh not that honour to himself, but is called thereunto, as all are who run not unsent.

And they ordinarily cry out against Learning &amp; Schools of learning: what they intend hereby, is so obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously notour, that it cannot be hid; for if all books were once destroyed, &amp; all learning once banished away, how easily might they prevail with their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, &amp; lead captive silly people, with their faire flourishes of glorious-like expressions, &amp; make faire way unto their dreames &amp; pretended Revelations, &amp; to their setting up their <hi>Diana,</hi> the <hi>Light within,</hi> their Scripture &amp; all?

He proceedeth &amp; inveigheth against <hi>Scholastick divinity</hi> (as it is called) telling us, <hi>that an age were not sufficient to learne it,</hi> &amp; that <hi>it helpeth no man nearer to God, nor maketh any less a sinner, or more righteous.</hi> I must confess, that I am not a very fit person to judge in this matter, being it may be, as little, if not less, conversant in this kinde of writings, as himself; and shall willingly grant, that much of that learning might have been spared, as being more adapted, I mean as spun out by light, audacious and too too philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal braines, to the drawing of mindes off the serious study and improvment of substantial and necessary Truthes; than to the fixing of hearts, in the faith and practice of saving Truthes: and though much of it be not very necessary, yet it is not wholly to be rejected or thus condemned, as noxious or useless; for though it be (as the best things may be) abused by some, and not only idle and vaine questions handled therein, but errours and pernicious doctrines main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thereby; yet experience hath taught us, that worthy instruments have been raised up of the Lord, who, having had a competent knowledge therein, (which they acquired in far less time, than the one halfe of an age) were in case to defend the Truth against <hi>Papists,</hi> (who most study, and cry up this <hi>Scholastick Theologie,)</hi> against <hi>Socinians, Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> who make no little use of that sort of learning to maintaine their errours: as also against other hereticks, and erroneous persons; having had hereby no small advantage in detecting their shifts and evasions, and in urging them to a punctual debate, without oratorious declamations, long and tedious argumentations, and subtile subterfuges; so that such as have had most acquantance therewith, have been most fit to deal with adversaries: and I suppose (though it be little to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of that learning, upon the account of its perversion) had himself been an utter stranger hereunto, he had not been in case to have said so much (to such good purpose, as he imagineth) as he hath done, in his <hi>Apology,</hi> in the defence of his <hi>Theses.</hi> Upon which account, as also because, <hi>Papists, Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> (to whom he is so much endebted for his new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) have by their practice so much declared their approbation thereof; I cannot but wonder at the mans unadvisedness in this point; and especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, some, most acquanted with this sort of learning, can tell us, how much <hi>Quakers</hi> are beholden to it, for some of their prime notions, which have either had their first rise there, or confirmation therefrom. As to the censure, which he passeth upon this <hi>Scholastick Theology,</hi> I shall only adde, that howbeit he preferre his <hi>Script,</hi> to all learned volumes, written by <hi>Scholastick divines</hi>; yet I must needs say, That the chiefe heads of his doctrine (Theology I cannot call it) which I confess may be learned very quickly, and that without the help of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Teachers, being (so far as I can judge of it) borne with every corrupt son of <hi>Adam,</hi> and deeply seated in the dunghil of corrupt Nature, if reduced into practice (which is the end he driveth at) shall prove no less, if not more,

insufficient and inept, for the effects mentioned by him, that is, to bring Men nearer unto God, and to make them less sinners and more righteous; as our following examination will manifest.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I do the less wonder at his taking in, among the rest, the commendable labours and paines of such, as have written Commentaries, for explaining of Scripture, (though I will not say, but that, as all that proceedeth from Men, wanteth not its own dross) when I consider, how low an esteem this man and his party have of the Scriptures, which they will not look upon, as our only sure Rule, by which we are to order our Pathes, and to examine the Teachings of Men. <hi>One Francis Howgil</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Stalham</hi> sheweth in his <hi>Revilers rebuiked part.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 2.) called the Scriptures, <hi>other mens words.</hi> Commonly they deny that the Scriptures should be called <hi>the word of God;</hi> and therefore in contempt they call it, a <hi>printed bible.</hi> So did <hi>Richard Farnworth</hi> call it, as Mr. <hi>Stalham</hi> reporteth, in the forecited place: and <hi>sect.</hi> 36. he tels us, that one <hi>Iohn Lawson,</hi> another <hi>Quaker,</hi> called it, <hi>the letter, the written word, which is natural and carnal.</hi> Such like is to be seen ordinarily in their writings, as we will hear afterward.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For a ground of his prejudice against the many volumes, writen in divinity, he allaigeth, <hi>That they have more darkened, than cleared up the truth.</hi> And yet I judge, that the smallest <hi>Systeme of divinity,</hi> that ever was put forth by an Orthodox writer, is able abundantly to discover both his errour, and ignorance; and will be found a fitter mean to clear up the Truth, and to attaine the ends by himself mentioned, than Cart-loads of such <hi>Theses</hi> as his are, though backed with as many moe of his <hi>Apologies,</hi> which do manifestly both darken and deny Truth. But I am apt to think, that the real ground of his prejudice, is, that there is so much to be found in any of these books (I meane such as are written by the Orthodox, and upon the points, here touched by him; or more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally upon the wholy body of divinity) against his old errors, new broached again, and put into a new dress, that he could wish, for salving of his own credite, and for helping forward his disperate designe, that either these were all consumed, or that they were utterly laid aside; for he cannot but know, that who ever readeth these, must needs see his nakedness and folly, without much study.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The account he maketh of all the learned men of the world, beside himself and his party, is, that they are <hi>the Wisemen,</hi> the <hi>Learned,</hi> the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>the Disputers of this world, whom the Lord hath cast downe,</hi> or <hi>destroyed,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, no doubt, such as <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1;19, 20. But this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of charity that must be expected from them: However, let his esteem of them be as meane as he will, there are among them, who shall be found to be, whether he will or not, no enemies to the cross of Christ; and to whom the preaching of the cross is not foolishness, but the power of God; and who, through grace, are helped, by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe; and make it their work to preach Christ crucified, even Christ the power of God, and the wisdome of God. And on the other hand, what enemies to Christ, to his Cross, to the Preaching of His Truth, and to all His Ordinances, he and his party are, we may have occasion to shew, ere all

be done. And I am not afrayed to say, that they will be found among the Chief Enemies of the cross of Christ, howbeit he would faine equalize them to the Apostles, whom I supposeth he meaneth by, the <hi>fisher men,</hi> he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Hereby also we can see, that this new <hi>Seck,</hi> would faine become, yea make themselves, the only Compurgators of all that hithertil hath been written in Theology; and from them alone we must expect the <hi>indices expurgatorii,</hi> which will only except, or reserve, some writings of <hi>Papists, Pelagians, Semipelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Arminians, Enthusiasts, Anabaptists, Perfectionists, Antiscripturists, Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and of such as are <hi>against the Ministery and the Ordinances of Christ</hi>; or some special pieces of their writings, which serve to confirme his sentiments, which are an <hi>Hotch Potch,</hi> made up of the Quintessence of all these: and for the rest, that any way contradict him, they will have but one sentence and censure passed against them, <hi>viz, all is naught.</hi> It is remarkable also, that according to this Mans judgment, the pure and naked Truth of god was never unfolded and declared, until this Generation of <hi>Quakers</hi> arose, and (if some of themselves be to be believed, it is far from half an age, since they appeared in our Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon) which neither agreeth with truth, nor with himself.</p>

If so, he must know, that we desire only to follow that, as we have it recorded to us in the Scriptures of truth, which he and his party do not much value. And I would ask further. How it cometh to pass, that there is such a discrepancy and contradiction betwixt what these Apostles did teach, and what he and the rest of the <hi>Quakers</hi> do teach?

By all which, we may conjecture, what a Gospel this is, which they teach, even another, than we have in the Scriptures, and than that, which the Apostle taught: And what welcome such as come with another Gospel, were their credentials angelical (unto which these men are strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) should have, <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us <hi>Gal.</hi> 1:8, 9. as was mentioned above:

which is a sufficient warning for all that fear God, to beware of these men.</p>
               <p n="20">20. This man hath an high and mighty conceit of his <hi>Theses,</hi> calling them <hi>though short yet ponderous,</hi> and saying, that <hi>they comprehend many things, and denote the true original of knowledge, of that knowledge, which leadeth to life eternal.</hi> And I do indeed conceive, that they containe much (though I dar not say the whole) of the marrow of that Gospel, whereof he is a dispensator; we may look upon ourselves therefore, as called more narrowly to consider and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne them. If the matter contained in them were good, I should not quarrel at their brevity; but I see, what they want in length, the <hi>Apology</hi> hath, <hi>Ponderous</hi> he calleth them; but we know, wet sand, though of smal value, is more pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous than what is more worth; and indeed so ponderous are they, that they will sinke the poor soul, that embraceth them, without any other super added weight, into the bottomless pit. His saying, that they pointe forth the true original of saving knowledg, will never perswade me that they do so. How defective they are as to this, we may shew in the next Chapter. Nay rather: I dar say, that they discover the true original of that science (falsly so called) which leadeth to the bottomless pit: and this I hope, to make appeare, ere all be done.</p>
               <p n="21">21.

Indeed if we were called to rest upon his and his co-partners bare testimony, all further dispute were at an end, and we might cast our bibles at our heels, and learn all our divinity, at their mouth, or at the light with in us, &amp; rest thereupon, notwithstanding it contradict sound reason and experience, let be Scripture.

In fine, he tels us, that <hi>he leaveth this his testimony unto the light of Christ, illuminating every one of our consciences</hi>: which words may have a double sense, as expressed in his latine; and either import, that he leaveth this his testimony, as a confirmation of that light of Christ, which illuminateth every man: and if this be his meaning, the preaching up of this <hi>light,</hi> must be the whole of his Gospel wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But seing he leaveth this his testimony to be pondered and considered by the light of Christ, which enlighteneth every mans conscience; and thereby granteth, that every man hath this Supream light of Christ within him, and thereby may, and is allowed by him to judge of what he saith; he cannot be offended, that I judge by all that light of Christ within, enforming my soul and conscience, from that light of Christ, which is held forth in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth; and determine accordingly against his Assertions.</p>

                  </gap>od, which is through faith in Jesus Christ, and is thereby begun felicity here, and leadeth forward to the certane fruition of God. However, Christ hereby giveth us to understand, that that knowledge of God, which is eternal life begun, cannot be had without the saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jesus Christ, as the sent Ambassadour of God, in whose face and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations, God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the hearts of his owne, to give the light of the knowledge of his glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:6. Our Lord doth not meane here a bare speculative knowledge, but such a knowledge, and beholding of the glory of the Lord, as chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the beholder into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:18. and so is accompanyed with Faith, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending and closeing with the Son, in whom is this eternal life; so that he who hath the Son, hath life 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5:11, 12. And it is this Son of God, who must give us an understanding, that we may know him, that is true, and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.

It is good and necessary, I confess, to have the genuine and true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the right original and ground of this true and saving knowledge: But whether this mans doctrine hath a genuine tendency thereunto, or not, the sequel will evince. I am far mistaken, if, after tryal, his doctrine prove not a perverting of the Gospel of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1:7. and of the right wayes of the Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 13:10. and contradictory to that Gospel, whereby life and immortality is brought to light, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5:10. and which is the Gospel of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1:13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We might readily think, that one, taking upon him, with no small confidence, to teach the whole world, and to give a new discovery of pure and naked truth, which hitherto hath been (as he supposeth,) darkened and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured; and who openly declareth, in the beginning of his doctrine, that the genuine understanding of the right origin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l knowledge of that God, whom to know is life eternal, is necessary to be known and believed, should explaine to us some hidden mysteries of God, and help us by his new grounds to some more distinct apprehensions of what is revealed to us of God, in his word: But alas! this mans <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> is no sure guide to us. The grounds he layeth down are both defective and destructive: Of their <hi>destructive</hi> nature, we will have large occasion to speak hereafter: and how <hi>defective</hi> they are, a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances may clear.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

Supposeth he, that we can attaine to the true and saving knowledge of God, and yet not know Him to be a Spirit, Pure and Invisible, without a Body, Parts, or Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; nor know, that He is the only True and Living God, Infinite in Being and in all Perfection? Shall we think, that it is no part of that knowledge of God, wherein consisteth true felicity, to know Him to be Immutable, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense, Eternal, Incomprehensible, Almighty, Most Holy, Most Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, Most Just, Most Righteous, Most Wise, Most Gracious, and Long-suffering, &amp;c. Is it no part of the genuine knowledge of God, that tendeth to life, to know, that He hath all Life, Glory, Goodness and Blessedness in &amp; of Himself, &amp;c. and that He is the sole Fountaine of all Life, Glory and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which the Creature partaketh, or is capable of; and the only Author of their being? what for a knowledge of God must that be, in which all felicity consisteth, whereof the knowledge of these particulars mentioned shall make no part? And if he thinketh, that the knowledge of God doth of necessity comprehend the knowledge of these particulars; how cometh it to passe, that in his Most comprehensive <hi>Theses,</hi> and his large <hi>Apology</hi> too, which hold forth (as he would make us believe) that knowledge, which leadeth unto life eternal, there is such a deep silence of these so many particulars, so necessary to be known and beleeved? It concerneth him to answere this.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Next,</hi> Shall we think, that it is no necessary part of this saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, to know that there is one God in Essence, and Three distinct

persons in the Unity of the God head, of one Substance, Power and Eternity; <hi>viz</hi> God the Father, being of none, neither Begotten, nor Proceeding; God the Son eternally begotten of the Father; and God the Holy Ghost, eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son? And if the knowledge of this be such an essential part of Christianity, and a ground of that knowledge of God, which leadeth to salvation, and so necessary for the right uptaking of the great work of Redemption and Salvation, as it is, and cannot rationally be denyed by any sober man, who considereth what a sure basis this is unto the Christians hope, peace and comfort; how cometh it to pass, that there is no express, and distinct mention made of this fundamental point, in all his <hi>Theses?</hi> we have heard how the <hi>Quakers</hi> of N. <hi>England</hi> have denied this foundation: And Mr <hi>Stalham</hi> in his <hi>Reviler rebuked part.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 7. tels us, that the <hi>Quakers,</hi> against whom he wrote, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="10">10 Moreover. (6.) If his <hi>Theses</hi> be such an unfolding of clear and naked truth, how cometh it, that he speaketh so obscurely, and enigmatically of the fall of <hi>Adam</hi>?

What shall we then think of this Gospel, which He taketh upon him to be a publisher of?</p>
               <p n="15">15. In the next place (11.) To speak nothing of the law of God, in obedience whereunto, with a right frame of Spirit, consisteth true Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that Obedience, which is a real mark of true Love to God; and so must be necessarily known, to the end we may come to the possession of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, whereof notwithstanding he not only giveth no plaine or naked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but also, with the rest of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> layeth downe grounds destroying all obedience to the law of God, as we shall heare: How cometh it, that in all his explication of the true nature and original of that knowledge, which leadeth unto life, whether in his <hi>Theses</hi> or <hi>Apologie,</hi> we have no account given to us of that Eternal life, which we are to aime at and intend, as our last end; nor yet of its opposite, Eternal Death and Hell, whereby we might come to know some thing of the nature, worth and necessity of Glory?</p>
               <p n="16">16. Yet once more (12.) I would aske why it is, that in his <hi>Theses,</hi> he giveth us no account of the Resurrection of the Body, nor of the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? He cannot say, that the knowledge and faith of these particulars are not necessary, unless he be of the same opinion with other <hi>Quakers,</hi> who either speak dubiously thereof, or do down right deny it, Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi> sheweth us, in his Book, called, <hi>The Quakers appeal answered,</hi> Pag: 21. that one <hi>Whitehead</hi> assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hearing of many witnesses, <hi>that this body shall not rise againe,</hi> and that <hi>Will. Pen,</hi> in his Book intituled. <hi>Reas. against Rail.</hi> Pag. 133. saith, <hi>That it is inconsistent with Scripture, Reason and the beliefe of all Men right in their wits.</hi> And Pag. 134. <hi>that the absurdity of the Transubstantiation is rather outdone, than equalled, by this carnal Resurrection.</hi> And that Pag. 138. he called it <hi>a Barbarous conceit.</hi> Shall I think, that this our <hi>Apologizer</hi> is of the same minde? If not, it concerneth him to speak more positively thereunto; for his silence will go for an approbation of what his party speak expresly: and further, as concerning the last Judgment, we may suppose, that such as look on the Resurrection of the dead, as a fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will give no place in their creed unto the doctrine of Christs coming againe to judge quick and dead: and indeed, I finde in the <hi>second Dialogue</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi> Pag: 42, 43, that <hi>Whitehead,</hi> in his <hi>Christ ascend</hi>: Pag. 18, 20, 21, 69. denyeth <hi>That Christ hath a personal being, at the Right-hand of God, without all men.</hi> And <hi>Pag.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

comeing.</hi> And I finde <hi>G. Keith,</hi> in his <hi>Immediat Revel.</hi> Pag. 77. applying the second or next comeing againe of Christ, mentioned by <hi>Iames Cap.</hi> 5:7, 8. by <hi>Paul Heb.</hi> 9.28. and by <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1:13. to <hi>Christs revelation, when he shall appeare in us glorified, who before was crucified in weakness, yet now raised in power, and living by the power of God, and raising us up together with him, &amp; setting us in heavenly places in him</hi>? Whereby he cannot but meane a second coming againe of Christ, which is already past; and nothing else.</p>
               <p n="17">17. By these particulars, &amp; several others, which might be added, every one may judge, what a delineation of that knowledge, which leadeth to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, this confident man will give us, in these his <hi>Theses,</hi> when so many, so important, and so necessary and essential parts of our Christian faith, are not once by him mentioned or asserted, let be cleared up or explained; but rather, tacitely or expresly, rejected and condemned. We may also judge, what that knowledge of God, wherein is life eternal, is, which he shall pointe forth to us, in his <hi>Theses;</hi> when so many things, so manifestly belonging to true divine and saving knowledge, are, if not denied, yet waved, by him, as not necessary to be known and believed. Hereby also we see ground to suspect that Original and Foundation of knowledge, which he followeth, and would propose to our understanding &amp; faith, in the two next following <hi>Theses</hi>: for either that must be a false Original and rotten Ground of saving knowledge; or he is yet a stranger to the true and genuine Knowledge thereof; otherwise he should be in case to give us a more distinct &amp; faithful account of these and such like particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which are so necessary to be known and believed.</p>
               <p n="18">18. I Shall readily grant, that it is very necessary and usefull, to know what is the true ground and original, out of which we are to draw that knowledge of God, and of his wayes, which is necessary for us to know and believe, in order to the obtaining of that felicity, which consisteth in, and is had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by, the knowledge of God in Christ; not only because many are ready to drink-in false Notions and Principles (as he sayeth, but very obscurely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinctly in his <hi>Apology Pag.</hi> 1. and 2.) of God and of his Truth; &amp; to hold fast what they have so, through Ignorance, Misinformation, and Prejudice, imbibed; but especially because, so many Pretenders to high and great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as he and his like, are ready to imbrace a Shadow for a Substance, and take a suggestion of Satan, the Father of lies, or a dream of their own braines, or a lying Vision of the Prince of the powers of the aire, for Revelations and Manifestations of the God of Truth; and the Motions of their own corrupt minds, enlightned with the wildfire of their owne fancies, or the fire flaughts of the God of this World, for the Motions of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That such things have been, and may be, himself dar not deny; and if he should deny it, sad experience of the fantastick Enthusiasts, and false Teachers, which every age hath produced, will put it beyond all denyal; as also the Idolatry and Superstition of so many Nations and People, (as himself affirmeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 2.) which were a clear evidence of the false and fictious Opinions and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which they had of God, and a fruite of the false Divinations and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Revelations, which they trusted to. And therefore, with good warrand,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66147:20"/>
and with his own approbation, I shall say, That it is a most dangerous thing to lay a wrong foundation of Knowledge, and to draw the same out of a corrupt Original; and that we ought to be sure, that the Ground and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of our Knowledge be such, as we may saifly trust to and build upon. But whether the Original, which He and other <hi>Quakers</hi> do follow, and which he would prescribe unto us, be the true and genuine Original, and Ground of sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledge, he must allow us liberty, seing the danger here is great, (as himself confesseth) and such as enter not by the door are Theevs and Robbers, to examine; and to try, whether the Ground, he holdeth forth, be Saife; or the Ground, we build upon, be not Sufficient.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of inward and immediat Revelations.</head>
               <p n="1">1. The maine scope of his second <hi>Thesis,</hi> which is concerning <hi>Inward and Immediat Revelations,</hi> is, to give us the true and genuine understanding of the <hi>right original and fundation of Knowledge:</hi> So that this <hi>Thesis</hi> must point out unto us this Original and Ground of true and saving Knowledge: and by the title, which he hath prefixed unto this <hi>Thesis,</hi> we learne, that his opinion is, that <hi>Inward and Immediat Revelation is the only right Original and Foundation of Knowledge</hi>: and this Inward and Immediat Revelation is given us, in place of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as his adjoining the third <hi>Thesis,</hi> concerning the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and what he saith of them therein, make manifest.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We should now come to the examination of what he saith, of this Inward and Immediat Revelation; but in the entry of his explication of this <hi>Thesis,</hi> in his <hi>Apology Pag</hi> 4. we are staved off by a hudge Preoccupation, and meet with a dangerous Dilemma; for either we must give our assent unto what he saith, in this <hi>Thesis;</hi> or bear the <hi>stigma</hi> and blake mark of <hi>Carnal and Natural Christians, ignorant of the motions and operations of the Spirit of God in our hearts.</hi> But perceiving an open way of escapeing from betwixt the hornes of his <hi>dilemma,</hi> and waving his uncharitable censure of such, as oppose him, as being not only strangers to these motions of the Spirit in their hearts; but as accounting them no way ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; yea as mocking them, as foolish and ridiculous, and much more to this purpose (wherein, as he manifesteth what Spirit he is of, and with what Spirit he is led; so he bewrayeth much ignorance of the minde and assertions of his Opposites) which would be both endless and unprofitable, for me once to take any notice of, let be to answere, seing a simple contempt of his Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is sufficient: Waveing, I say, these his impertinencies, as the native fruite of his imbittered Spirit, against all that do not applaud his wilde Notions; I shall tell him, that I cordially give my assent unto that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8:9, 14.—<hi>now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. For as many as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66147:21"/>
are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sones of God.</hi> And I know no Christian, whether Private Person, or Doctor, Minister or Divine, that will not homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logate with me in this, howbeit he flander us, as not only denying this, but also as contradicting it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But he would hence deduce, that no Knowledge of God can be acquired, without a Divine and Immediat Revelation; and for this cause, he distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth betwixt a <hi>Certane</hi> and an <hi>Vncertane</hi>; a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and a <hi>Literal;</hi> a <hi>Saving</hi> and an <hi>Empty, Aery</hi> and <hi>Brainy Knowledge of God,</hi> and sayeth, the <hi>One</hi> can be <hi>many wayes</hi> acquired, but the <hi>Other not without an Inward, and Immediate Manifestation of the Spirit of God, shineing in the heart, and enlightening the understanding.</hi> By which we see, what Darkness and Confusion occupieth this mans minde; and how, either through blinde Ignorance, or wicked Prevarication, he laboureth to pervert the true state of the Question, and leadeth his Readers into the same ditch of Ignorance and Prejudice, wherein himself is fallen. If he cannot, we know, how to distinguish betwixt the Spirits Inward and Immediat Revealing and making known the minde of God, as he did of old unto the Prophets, and Apostles, whether by Dreames, Visions, Vive voice, or inward efficacious Inspirations; and the Spirits gracious In-working and Impressing the Truthes, other wayes revealed and made known mediatly, upon the soul of a man, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, through the spiritual Illumination of his minde, and the gracious and effectual Moving of his heart, grace to See, to Imbrace, and to Close with and savingly Improve the Truths revealed. These things which are most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly distinct, &amp; clearly different, he is pleased, either out of meer Ignorance, or our of Designe, all alongs, to jumble together and confound, that he might the more darken the Reader, and prejudge him, both of the right state of the Question, and at the orthodox truth, which he maliciously misrepresenteth. The difference betwixt these two Operations of the Spirit, without running forth here into a tedious and unnecessary digression, for the clear information of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and for preventing our further labour afterward, we shall thus make plaine and manifest. The first Operation of the Spirit mentioned, is that which he, &amp; the rest of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> endeavoure to assert &amp; plead for, in prejudice of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, which now to us, under the <hi>New Testam.</hi> supplieth richly, and with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the want of the Immediat and Extraordinary Revelations of the minde and will of God, concerning duty, whether as to Faith or Practice, by which the Lord was pleased formerly, after diverse manners and wayes, to make the same known. The other, which we assert and maintaine, is an <hi>Efficient</hi> and not <hi>Objective Revelation,</hi> and confirmeth the authority and truth of the <hi>Objective Revelation</hi> of the minde of God, both touching <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi>; and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth to the Scriptures their due place, as our compleet Objective Canon and Rule, and confirmeth them therein, bringing home, with power and saving grace upon the heart, the Truths therein revealed, and casting the soul into the mould of these saving Truths. The One, which they plead for, taketh away all the use of the letter of the Scriptures, all the study thereof, or all the paines to be used, in Acquireing the knowledge of the Original tongues, in Reading of Commentaries for attaining to the knowledge of the letter, in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66147:21"/>
Preaching and Hearing of preachings, &amp; in Useing other meanes, for reaching the knowledge of the Truths, delivered in the Scriptures. The Other, which we maintaine, presupposeth in ordinary this knowledge of the letter of the Scriptures, and the use of means contributing thereunto, as a meane appointed of God, whereby we may come, through his Grace coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating on our Understandings &amp; Wils, unto the saving &amp; soul-captivating know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the same Truths. As the saving and gracious beleeving and improving of the Truths of God, revealed of old by his immediatly and extraordinarily inspired Prophets, unto others, did presuppose their hearing and understanding the letter of what these Prophets and extraordinary Messengers revealed, as the minde of God; and did not destroy and make useless that meane: as the way of <hi>Quakers</hi> would necessarily have done; for they alleidge, that every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual soul, before they could savingly beleeve and understand the Truth of God, behoved of necessity to have the same, as Immediatly, Inwardly and Extraordinarily revealed to themselves, as it was to the Prophets; and thus every man was to be an immediatly inspired Prophet to himself: and what need was there then of immediatly Inspired Prophets, singularly pitched upon and raised up, for the use and benefite of others?</p>
               <p n="4">4. This being plaine, &amp; a sure basis, whereupon we may stand; and such a cleare stateing of the Question, betwixt us and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that none need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth be ignorant of the true difference betwixt us and them; we may very shortly dispatch this Man and his Doctrine: which for the most part (as we shall see) runeth upon this Confusion and Mistake, for thus he beginneth <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. to tell us, <hi>That in all ages this hath been acknowledged viz, That there is no saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God to be had, without the Spirit</hi>: and to this end citeth some passages out of <hi>Augustin, Clemens Alexandr.

But, can he produce any of the Fathers, or of our Reformers, maintaining such Inward and Immediat Revelations of the Spirit, as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> with their predecessours, the <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> do assert now to be necessary, and do pretend to? If he be so well acquanted with the writings of the Fathers, as by these his citations, he would have us beleeve, he hath done wisely for himself, but not very honestly, in concealing what several of the same Fathers, and Others, write expresly against such high Pretenders, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> now are, and in whose footsteps they, in many things, now tread, <hi>Theodoretus</hi> in <hi>Epit.

Let him, if he please, read also <hi>Epiphanius contra Haeres. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Haeres.</hi> 48. &amp; 49. Where he will meet with some things, not unworthy of his consideration.

I suppose the Spirit of God would teach them to speak more soberly of such, as they are yet great strangers unto: But to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is all this waste of words, if he meane nothing else by his <hi>Inward and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Revelation,</hi> than what we formerly §. 3. did owne and explaine, against. whom doth he fight?

never be able to inferre his Conclusion from the Premises.

And when he shall be able to inferre this Conclusion from solide Premises, we shall think our selves concerned to take notice of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6: In his §. 4. He would have us beleeving, that he doth not hereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all other second wayes or meanes, as he purposeth to cleare in the next <hi>Thesis,</hi> that is, all other Wayes and Modes of attaining to the knowledge of God; for he granteth these to be profitable, and that they may conduce to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the work; but he is here pleading (as he saith) for that which is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary. But all the question is, concerning the true meaning and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that, which he accounteth so Necessary; if it be such Revelations of Truths, as the Prophets, and such as were Immediatly inspired, had, and as <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> plead for, I deny the necessity hereof; and, as to this, what way, I pray, can other meanes and modes, as the Scriptures, conduce to facilitate these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations? have they any influence upon the person, who is to receive these Revelations, disposeing him thereunto? Let him explaine this, and then he may hear what shall be further replied. If the thing so necessary unto the saving knowledge of God, be only that operation of the Spirit, which we mentioned above, we assent; and only say, That he should speak more intelligibly, than call this an <hi>Inward and Immediat Revelation:</hi> But it is usual with this sort of men, to speak, (as did the <hi>Libertines,</hi> against whom <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.) after an high and loftie manner, as if they were alwayes ravished in an ecstasy; for as they alwayes have the Spirit in their mouth, so they use a strange idiome, that such as hear them are at the first amazed; and this they affect of purpose to deceive their hearers, and raise in them an admiration of them and their Opinions.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Having thus premised what he thought fit to say, to cleare the Question, and to make way, for vindicating of his <hi>Thesis,</hi> he cometh next to the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confirmation of his Assertion in his <hi>Thesis,</hi> where he tels us of <hi>five</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, 1. That <hi>there is no knowledge of the Father, but by the Son.</hi> 2. That <hi>there is no knowledge of the Son, but by the Spirit.</hi> 3. That <hi>God did alwayes reveal himself by the Spirit.</hi> 4. That <hi>these Revelations were the formal object of the faith of the Saints.</hi> 5. That <hi>the same object of faith remaineth.</hi> He nameth here, we see, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; and we might readily think, that he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66147:23"/>
would here hold forth the order of working of the glorious Persons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in things without, <hi>ad extra</hi>; and particularly in the Revelation of the mind of God concerning mans duty: But whether we may rest perswaded, that his judgment herein is Orthodox, and that verily he beleeveth, that there are Three Persons in the God head, equal in Power and Glory, of one Substance and Duration, may be a doubt, partly because, the <hi>Light within,</hi> which to him is the supream and only adequate Rule of Faith, cannot teach this mysterie: and hence it is, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> not only will not admit this, as an article of their creed; but do also with much industry and rage oppose it and mainly upon this ground that their Natural Reason, or the light within them (which upon the matter, so far as I can judge, differeth not from the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi>) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend it: and partly because I finde other <hi>Quakers,</hi> such as those of <hi>New England,</hi> and those against whom Mr <hi>Stalham</hi> wrote, as I hinted above, denying it. It is true, this man hath several expressions further, in the words following, which would seem to evince, that he is orthodox herein: and there are some also that may seem to look another way. But not purposeing to make more debate with him, than I must needs do, I shall not fix any thing upon him, for which I see not clear ground: only I wish, that the next time he cometh forth in publick, he would be more plain and positive, as to this.</p>

his Son? and is this a point so difficult to be proved, that he was constrained to run back to the first Creation for an argument? This would justly give ground of suspicion, that the man meaneth by the <hi>Creation</hi> in the places cited, not the First, but the Second Creation, with which Christs Revelation of the Father hath a more clear and natural connection; and so joyneth with <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers, <hi>Enjedinus, Smalcius</hi> and <hi>Schlightingius,</hi> in denying, upon this account, Christ to be God creating all. They say, that, when the Scripture saith, <hi>God made all things by the Word,</hi> &amp;c. the meaning is, <hi>God made all things by his owne word and vertue</hi>; the same expression, which this Man useth here: and thus interpret and apply the same Scriptures, which he here citeth, even that <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14:6. But admitting that he taketh the Creation in the orthodox sense, we may observe some other Abomination lurking under this; To wit, That this manifestation of the Father by the Son, is not to be understood of a Gospel Manifestation, but of a Natural Manifestation, had in and by the works of Creation; and so not of a Manifestation peculiar to the Church and people of God, but of a Manifestation common to Heathens, and all without the pale of the Church; otherwise he shall hereby destroy what afterward he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to build, <hi>viz.</hi> the Universality of this Manifestation. But whoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth the Scriptures, by us cited, shall finde, that Christ meaneth a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation and declaration of the Father, in and by the Gospel, and Gospel, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, to the destruction of this mans Universality.</p>

Answere,</hi> That the Scriptures of the Old Test. were so written, I grant: That the persons, imployed in that work, had immediat Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to this end, I grant: Nay moreover I grant, that, all other true Prophets, who were raised up of the Lord, whose Prophecies the Lord thought not fit to make a part of the Canon of the Scriptures, had Divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inward and Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat Revelations: But this Reason is as childish, as the preceeding. Doth he think, that this is enough to prove his point? Doth he think, that all the rest of the people of God, in those generations, had those Immediat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations? or that this followeth, as a clear consequence from his Argument? What folly is here? He might as well prove, that all the people of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration are <hi>Quakers,</hi> because he, and some few moe, are such.

from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Malachy.</hi> But did the Lord inspire all the people with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his will Inwardly and Immediatly, as he did these Prophets? Though this be the only thing he should say, if he would speak to purpose; Yet he dar not say it, it being so manifestly false. The Apostle tels us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1:1. That <hi>God spoke in time past unto the Fathers, by</hi> or <hi>in the Prophets;</hi> and so not Immediatly to all the Fathers: when the Lord had solemnly given the law at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and had written it once and againe in Tables of stone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34:28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4:13. &amp; 5:22. &amp; 10:4. He gave orders to <hi>Moses,</hi> to write the rest of the law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24:4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31:9, 22. And this law was to be written in a book that it might be keeped and read.

Was this teaching and instructing by books read, studied, and explained, the Immediat Revelation of the Spirit? Or was it no Revelation of the minde of God, because it was not an Immediat Revelation? Hence then we see, that even when this Immediat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation was most in use, it was not the only way of God's communicating his minde to every individual Son of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Then he telleth us, <hi>That it is confessed by all, that under the N. T. the Lord revealed himself by his Spirit, unto Apostles and Euangelists.</hi> This is very true, but maketh no more for his purpose, than what he hath already said; for we know, that all are not Apostles nor Evangelists, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:29.</p>
               <p n="15">15. His <hi>fourth Proposition,</hi> viz. <hi>That these revelations were of old the formal object of the Saints,</hi> cometh next to consideration. But before I proceed to examine what he saith of this, I must first dispatch some things, which he saith in his <hi>Thesis,</hi> which will contribute to our more compendious examination of his <hi>Apology,</hi> both as to this, and the following proposition. So then, when he speaketh thus, by this formal object of faith he must meane, the total formal Object, or all that which is the ground of faith of, and obedience to such, or such particulars. <hi>Next,</hi> I, would know, what he meaneth by these <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>? whether the Things revealed; or the Revelation of the particulars, in such or such a way; or both? If he understand hereby the Propositions, or Assertions, or Duties, or Rebukes, or Instructions and Lawes, and the like, which were Revealed: Then he cannot call these the <hi>Formal Objects</hi> of faith; because they were only the Material Object, or the particulars, which were to be received and beleeved; and not the Reason or Ground why and upon which they were to be received and beleeved, If he understand hereby the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self, either simply considered, or as so or so modified: Neither can he call this properly, the formal Object of divine faith: for, suppose the Devil should have deceived some, by Dreames, Visions, or any other way, (which was not impossible (he alwayes labouring to be God's ape) as we see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 27:9. &amp; 9:8, 24. (&amp; 23:27, 32.) here would be Revelation, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation so and so modified; and yet there was no ground of faith, as the same
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66147:25"/>
places prove. But if he say; That he speaketh of a True Divine Revelation, which must of necessity be the Ground or Formal Object of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I <hi>answere,</hi> Then it is manifest, that the Revelation, whether as considered in it self; or as so or so modified, is not the total Formal Object of divine faith: But the <hi>Veracity</hi> &amp; <hi>Truth of God,</hi> declaring by Prophets immediatly inspired his minde, must be the Formal Ground of receiving what is delivered, as Truth to be believed by a divinefaith; and the <hi>Supream Authority of God,</hi> declaring by the same men of God, hiswill and command, must be the Formal Ground of receiving what was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as a <hi>Law</hi> to be obeyed: Both which were comprehended in this sentence, <hi>Thus saith Iehovah,</hi> with which the Prophets did usually usher-in their Sermons and Prophecies. As it is not a mans bare saying, or signifying this or that to us, which is the Formal Ground of our giving credite thereto; but the Truth and Honesty of the Person speaking these words: nor is the simple Reading or Making known such or such a Command to us, the Formal Ground of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, and of yeelding Obedience thereto, as a Law; but the Legislative Authority of the Person giving out that Law, in such a manner: So it was not the Prophets their simple declaration or revelation, that did solely ground the peoples Obediential beliefe of, what they spoke; But the Veracity and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, speaking in and by them. Revelation, whether to the Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly Inspired Holy men of God, or by them Mediatly to others, was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary meane, to hold forth the particulars to be believed and obeyed; but not the total formal Ground, upon which the particulars revealed were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and obeyed; But this, <hi>Thus faith Iehovah,</hi> which was also conveyed unto the people, and made known unto them by the Sent Prophets: As a mans speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a necessary meane to make us know both what he asserts as truth, and what he would have us believe upon his report; And as Promulgation of lawes is a necessary meane to convey the knowledge of the particular Lawes, together with the authority enjoyning them, unto the Subjects concerned; and cannot be the whole, but at most a part of the formal object of faith and Obedience, or a natural meanes of the Production of the material Object: for whether the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation be to be looked upon, only as such a means (as some) or as a part of the formal object (as others) it is all one against the <hi>Quakers</hi>: and we need not fall upon that debate here. But if he understand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Both together, Then neither can that be the Formal Object of Faith divine, as is cleare from what is said. It is not from the Revelation simply, that such or such a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is true; but from the Veracity and Truth of him, that maketh the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. Nor is it from the Promulgation, that such or such Words, framed into the forme of a Command or Law, have the force of a Law; but from the legislative Authority of him, who giveth forth the command. Hence we see, That it is all one, as to the Formal Object, or Ground of Faith and Obedience, whether the Revelation be Mediat, or Immediat, One way or Other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding it hold forth the Proposition to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Believed, &amp; the Law to be Obeyed, as coming from Him, who is Truth, &amp; the undoubted &amp; supreame Legislator. So that our believing of such or such a Proposition with divine Faith is resolved into this, <hi>Thus saith Iehovah</hi> to us, who is <hi>Truth it self and cannot lie</hi>; and our divine
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66147:26"/>
Obedience to such, or such a Command resolveth into this, <hi>Thus saith to us,</hi> and <hi>thus commandeth us the Supream Lord and Lawgiver Iehovah</hi>: &amp; here the outward testification or declaration of God, is not excluded, but included rather.</p>
               <p n="16">16. That we may not walk in the dark, with our confused and confounding Author. When he calleth Revelation the Formal Object of Faith, I would gladly understand, whether by this Revelation he meaneth the Lord's making his minde known, unto the Patriarchs or Prophets themselves, by Voices, Visions, Dreames &amp;c. Or the Revelation made known by these Prophets or Patriarchs unto the people, by vive voice, or by writing &amp;c? or doth he meane Both? If he understand the <hi>first,</hi> then he speaketh only of the Formal Object of the Faith of these Patriarchs and Prophets, who received these Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Revelations from God. But I would faine know of him, what was the Formal Object of the faith of the people, to whom these divinely inspired Patriarchs and Prophets made known these Revelations, with a <hi>Thus saith the Lord</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Revelation made to the Prophets could not be the Formal Object of the Peoples faith, because it was a Revelation Immediatly made only unto the Prophets, and revealed to the people not Inwardly and Immediatly by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or Representation to their mindes; or God's Vive Voice to their ears; but Mediatly by way of Declaration, or Preaching outwardly to their senses, by the Prophets. If he understand the <hi>Second,</hi> then the Immediat Revelation is not the Formal Object of Faith; for the Revelation, which they had, was Mediat. If he mean <hi>Both.</hi> Then his <hi>Thesis</hi> is defective; and this should also have been mentioned; for a Divine Revelation, coming to us Mediatly by the ministry of Men, divinely inspired, may hold forth the Formal Object of faith to us; as the Scriptures, penned by men immediatly Inspired, do now hold forth to us the Formal Object of our Faith; for we believe with a Divine Faith what is asserted in them, because spoken and delivered to us by the Lord Jehovah, who is the God of Truth, not Immediatly, but Mediatly.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Upon this ground, we see what way to Interpret that word in his <hi>Thesis, Divine inward revelations are absolutely necessary for Founding of true Faith</hi>: For it is true, Nothing can be received by a true divine Faith, but what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by God, or revealed by the First and Prime Verity, who is Veracity it self; yet it is not necessary, that this First and Prime Verity reveal his minde Immediatly to every person; as if none could be, or were, obliged to beleeve with a true and divine Faith, what God saith, but only such, as are Immediatly inspired.

Then the People of old, to whom the Prophets were sent, with <hi>a thus saith Iehovah,</hi> might have refuised Faith and Obedience; and alleiged, that these Revelations were not made to them Immediatly; and therefore, they were not bound to Believe and Obey them. But we finde that the Lord spoke even to the Fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>Heb.</hi> 1:1. (2.) If this were true, then the people of Israel, that heard not God speaking from Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> being borne after that time, were not obleiged to receive the Law, delivered on Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> with a divine Faith: and yet <hi>the word spoken by Angels was stedfast and every transgression &amp; disobedience received a just recompence of reward Heb.</hi> 2:2. And <hi>he that despised Moses's Law</hi>

(though <hi>Moses</hi> only had that law from God by Immediat Revelation, except the Ten words) <hi>died without mercy Heb.</hi> 10:28. (3.) Then the Prophets &amp; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, or such as had the Inward and Immediat Revelations, could only be guilty of Unbeliefe and Disobedience, and not the People, to whom they spoke; contrare to the wole tenor of the book of the Prophets. How then, I pray, could <hi>Sauls</hi> disobedience to the command of God by <hi>Samuel</hi> be as the sin of witch craft 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15:19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. 23.? See <hi>Ier.</hi> 7:23. and 11:4, 7. and 26:13. and 38:20. and 42:13. and innumerable moe places. (4.) How then could this aggravate their sin, that God himself spoke unto them, and called upon them, by his Prophets? <hi>Hos.</hi> 6: <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7: <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 25. and 25: <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. and 35: <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. and 26: <hi>v.</hi> 5. and 29: <hi>v.</hi> 19. and 44: <hi>v.</hi> 4. and 11: <hi>v.</hi> 7. and 32:33. (5.) Then there was no difference, as to the yeelding of Faith and Obedience to what was spoken, to be put betwixt a True Prophet, that spoke in the name of the Lord; and a False Prophet, that prophesied out of his owne heart, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13:17. and spoke lies in the name of the Lord, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23:25. &amp; 26:36. &amp; 27:10, 14, 15, 16. &amp; 29:9, 21. (6.) Then it could not be said, at that time, that he that despised, despised not man, but God; and yet we finde this charged upon them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36:16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1:30. <hi>Esai.</hi> 5:24. <hi>Amos</hi> 2:4. It is manifest then, how Uncertane, yea how False this is, which he here asserteth: and this being the only pillar of his fabrick, we may judge how tottering it is.</p>
               <p n="18">18. He granteth in his <hi>Thesis, That these divine inward Revelations</hi> (which he maintaineth yet to be in use) <hi>neither do, nor can contradict the external testimony of Scripture and sound reason.</hi> Whence it is clear, that such inward Revelations, as do contradict either Scripture, or found Reason, are not Divine: if then, upon tryal, it be found, that he and others pretending to divine Revelations, deliver Assertions point blank contrary to the Scriptures of truth, we are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reject them, as being not Divine: And upon this ground, I may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, that these <hi>Theses</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (let the Author pretend to what Inward Revelations he pleaseth, in conceiving and frameing of them; and let him alledge, that they were given to him, by Inward Revelation, as much as he thinketh good) are not of Divine Authority: and if he had them by any Inward Revelation, it hath been a Revelation of Satan. My reason is, because they are so diametrically opposite to the testimony of God in the Scriptures of truth: and this shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare yet more manifest, ere we have done. And he cannot be offended at my trying of his Assertions and Revelations, by the touch stone of the Word, seing he here granteth, that a Divine Inward Revelation will deliver nothing contrary or contradictory to the testimony of God in the Scriptures; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that it can be no Divine Inward Revelation, which doth contradict the Scriptures; for God being a God of truth, yea Truth it self, His testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies cannot be <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. While as he addeth, <hi>That hence it will not follow; that divine Inward Revelations should be examined and tryed by the Scriptures, as by a more noble and certane rule,</hi> he gaineth nothing; for though this should not follow upon the ground, which he laid down; yet it may follow upon another more sure
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66147:27"/>
and certane ground: for albeit a divine Inward Revelation, carrying its owne divine evidence with it, needeth not be examined by him, who is thus Immediatly inspired thereby, by the Rule, of the Scriptures, as by a more noble and certane Rule: as the Prophets, truely inspired of God, received what was really and divinly manifested by the Spirit of God, without Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination: yet that same Divine Revelation, when it cometh to be published and declared to others, may justly and warrantably be brought to tryal and examination by the Scriptures, as a more sure Rule and Teste to us. Though one divine Testimony cannot be more true and certaine, in it self, than another; yet one may be more clear and evident to us, than another; and we may try that, which is less clear and evident unto us, by that, which is more clear and unquestionable, without the least impeachment of the divinity of the other; and that also by Gods allowance and approbation: For (1) we finde the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> highly commended, as acting gallantly, and more nobly then those of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> because, though they received the word of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, delivered by <hi>Paul,</hi> with all readiness of minde; yet they received it not without examination; for it is added <hi>Act.</hi> 17:11. That <hi>they searched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures dayly, whether those things were so.</hi> They would not take <hi>Paul's</hi> bare word upon it, though he was one divinely Inspired, and had the Gospel by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he preached, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.3. but brought this Revelation to the teste of the Scriptures, as a more sure Rule unto them. (2.) It was the command of the Lord, of old, <hi>Esai.</hi> 8:20. that his people should go <hi>to the law and to the testimony;</hi> and consequently examine what was brought before them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them, as Revelations; that so they might know, which were truely Divine or from God; or which were only from <hi>Wizzards,</hi> or such as had familiar spirits, pretending to divine Revelations. (3.) What meaneth, I pray, the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:19.20. to say, that the Prophecy of the Scriptures is a more sure and firme (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) word, than was even a voice from heaven? His words are remarkable <hi>verse</hi> 17, 18, 19. <hi>for He</hi> (i. e. Christ) <hi>received from the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him, from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: and this voice, which came from heaven, we heard, when we were with him, in the holy mount.</hi> And then addeth <hi>verse</hi> 19. <hi>We have also a more sure word of prophecy,</hi> or prophetical word, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) which was a standing authentick Canon; and though not more sure and firme, in it self, than was the voice from heaven; yet it was more sure as to men, and less obnoxious to Cavils, Suspicions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Adversaries. (4.) It is remarkable, that Christ himself directeth his hearers to search the Scriptures, in reference to the tryal of the truth of what He delivered, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5:39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of me</hi> (5) We are commanded to beware of false Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7:15. &amp;c. Therefore we must try and judge of their Doctrine and Revelations; and so come to know the Prophets, Pretenders or Real, by this fruite. So we are commanded <hi>not to believe every spirit, but to try the Spirits, whether they are of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4:1. and consequently, we must have a Rule, by which we must try the Revelations, both of False and of True
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66147:27"/>
Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this Rule must be more clear and unquestionable to us, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it can be no Rule. (6.) So, of old, when the people of Israel were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. not to hearken to a Prophet or Dreamer of dreames, though he should give a signe or a wonder, to confirme his commission, when he would draw them away after other Gods, contrare to the standing Law of God; this standing Law and Commandment, not to go after other Gods, to serve them, was the Teste, by which they were to try the Revelations of Prophets Divine, or meer Pretenders: and so of necessity it behoved to be more clear unto them, than a divine Revelation made known to them by a True Prophet. (7.) When <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1:8, 9. that though Apostles, or Angels from heaven, should come and preach another Gospel, they should be rejected, as accursed, he clearly sheweth, that the Gospel already delivered was such a clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Rule, that by it we may warrantably try and examine all Doctrines and Revelations of Angels, or Apostles; and so must be a more clear and certane Rule to us, than divine Revelations, brought to us by Prophets, or Apostles: (8.) The same may be cleared from these Passages, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11, 24 <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.22. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2:2. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1:4. But the matter is evident enough from what is said: I proceed.</p>

That he may grant all this, without any detriment to the maine thing he driveth at here, upon this account; that, though others may be allowed to try by the Scriptures, what some deliver, as Revelations from God, unto them; yet such as have the Revelations immediatly from God are not to try them: and consequently, that he and others of his perswasion, who have such divine Manifestations and Revelations, are to act accordingly, without any further tryal and examination, by Scripture, or any other Rule. I <hi>answer first,</hi> Then he, and the rest of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> cannot be offended with us, for not receiving their Assertions by faith, and not yeelding thereunto all submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience, as the very Assertions and Commands of God, until we finde the same to be consonant to Scripture, notwithstanding that they should, with all the confidence imaginable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affirme to us, that they have those Doctrines and Assertions delivered to them by divine Revelations. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then certane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we should have an higher esteem of the Scriptures; and not look so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously upon them, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> commonly would have us do; not say, with <hi>Nicolas Lucas, a Quaker,</hi> That <hi>if the Bible were burnt, as good an one might be write,</hi> as Mr <hi>Hicks</hi> reporteth in his 2. <hi>dialogue.

And <hi>Paul</hi> in his Apology doth plainly affirme, <hi>Act.</hi> 26:22. that he delivered no other things, than those, which the Prophets and <hi>Moses</hi> did say should come, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Either it must be granted, that some Illuminations, stro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore seing there have been, and yet may be, Satanical Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, instead of Divine Revelations; and seing these must not be received as good come, it is manifest, that they must be tryed by a Rule, and we know no other Rule, beside the Scriptures, by which we can try the Spirits, and the Insinuations of Spirits, for we owne not the Doctrine of <hi>Swenckfeldius</hi> or of the <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Familists</hi>

As of old, even when the way of Prophecy was more ordinary and common, the false Prophets might warrantably have brought their diabolical Inspirations, and phantastical Delusions, to the tryal of the Law and of the Testimony; so much more now, when that extraordinary way of the Lords manifesting of his minde is ceased, may this course be taken, to prevent a deceit; especially seing, we have a full and complete Rule, whereby we are to walk, and to regulate ourselves, both as to Faith and Manners.</p>

But, that we may put an end to this, this Mans own expression con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth what I say: for he hath a restriction or qualification spoiling all his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, while he saith, that this divine Revelation moveth <hi>an understanding, that is well disposed,</hi> to an assent. Whence we see, that every Revelation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be Divine, is not to be submitted to, as such; but that Revelation only, which proveth it self unto an intellect well disposed, and discovereth thereunto
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66147:29"/>
its own proper Evidence and Perspicuity: And therefore, all Revelations, even though supposed to be divine, ought not to passe without examination. But I had thought, that all divine Revelations and Inspirations Extraordinary and Immediat (for we speak not here of the Lords Mediat and Ordinary Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, whereof all the children of God are made partakers, in one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or other) did either finde, or make the intellect well disposed, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Impression of Light and Truth revealed, so that a graceless <hi>Balaam</hi> could say <hi>Numb:</hi> 24:4. <hi>Balaam the Son of Beor hath said, and the man, whose eyes are open, hath said: He hath said, which heard the Words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open.</hi> Hence <hi>Elisha</hi> called for a minstrel, that his Spirit might thereby be composed, and he in case to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Revelations of God, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3:15. So that while the Intellect was out of frame, through one passion or other, the man was not in case to receive the divine Illapses of Light, and Revelations of God's minde. Now, while this man insinuateth, that even divine Revelations may come into an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, not well disposed; it must be much more probable, that other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, which are not truely Divine, may affect a distempered understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And yet, I doubt, if this Man can give such clear marks of distinction, betwixt an Understanding that is Distempered; and an Understanding, that is Sound and well Disposed, at the receiving of such Revelations; whereby the Persons, under these receipts of Illumination, can certanely know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their mindes and understanding were Well or ill disposed; that thereby they may certanely know, what to judge of these Revelations. Yea, I doubt, if he can give instances of persons, so immediatly Illuminated, even by the Father of lies, sensible and convinced of a distempered understanding, while receiving these glances of new light. So that, even because of this, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is possible, that such Meteors of new Light may fall upon a distempered understanding, and be received and entertained as Divine, when nothing lesse; it is certane, that these Illuminations should passe under examination and tryal; and there must be a Rule and Measure, whereby they must be tryed: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that the Scriptures must be that Rule, seing among Protestants, nothing else can pretend to this umpireing Power.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Having premised these things, to facilitate our way in what followeth, we return to the Examination of what he saith in his <hi>Apologie,</hi> Upon the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fift Propositions,</hi> formerly mentioned. His <hi>fourth</hi> Proposition is, as we heard, That these Revelations were of old the formal Object of the Faith of the Saints, And by these <hi>Revelations,</hi> he must meane Inward and Immediat Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the minde of God by Dreames, Visions, Vive Voice or the like; such as these were, which the Patriarchs and Prophets of old had; or, as we have shown, he shall speak nothing to the purpose he would be at. New let us see what way he proveth this. He adduceth for this end the definition of faith, given by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11:1. saying, that faith is <hi>the substance of things hoped for, &amp; the evidence of things not seen.</hi> But to what purpose, I do not see; seing it is a most certane Truth, that all that have had, and now have this faith, have not had, nor yet have, these Inward and Immediat Revelations, whereof we are

speaking. That the Object, or ground of this Faith was the saying and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Iehovah, is unquestionable: but the thing that he should prove, is this. That this saying of God, which saith gripped to, and laid hold on, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly spoken by God to every individual beleever; as for example, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which was immediatly revealed to <hi>Adam,</hi> That <hi>the seed of the woman should tread down the head of the Serpent</hi>; or That immediatly revealed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> That <hi>in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed,</hi> &amp;c. and the like.

But withall I say; that all others who believed, though still the Word and Authority of God, was the formal Object of their Faith, and ground of their Obedience, had not this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Object conveyed and made known unto them by Inward and Immediat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation: and of this, beside the manifest and unquestionable evidence of the thing it self, we have Instances in that same <hi>Chapter</hi>: dar he say, that all, who beleeved from the beginning, that <hi>the Worlds were framed by the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. had this truth revealed unto them by God Immediatly, either by Dreames, or Vive Voice, or the like? where readeth he of Revelations Inward and Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat made to <hi>Abel,</hi> who yet by Faith offered unto God a more excellent Sacrifice, than <hi>Cain?</hi> Where readeth he (to passe by others) of the Inward &amp; Immediat Revelations, upon which their faith was founded, who, <hi>through faith subdued Kingdomes, wrought righteousness, stopped the mouthes of lions, Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valient in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens, received their dead raised to life againe, were tortured not accepting deliverance, that they might obtaine a better resurrection, had tryal of cruel mockings and scourgings, and moreover of bonds and imprisonments; who were stoned, sawne asunder, were tempted, were slaine with the sword, who wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented; who wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in deserts and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth?</hi> Where readeth he, I say, of such Revelations, made to all these persons, who yet had faith, and by faith were they Encouraged, Enabled, Supported and Carried thorow?</p>

But in the bye, as if he had no friendship with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> he redargueth their incogitancy, that do not acknowledge any Inward Spirit or Vertue, but a meer Natural one. But in what <hi>Socinian</hi> doth he read such a thing? I think He rather and the <hi>Socinians</hi> are one, denying this Spirit and <hi>Paraclete</hi> to be a person, and a divine person, as to Essence one with the Father and the Son, but as to subsistance distinct: The <hi>Socinians</hi> do say, that the Spirit and Holy Ghost is but the Inward Spiritual Vertue of God; and are not so carnal and natural as to say, that it is a meer Natural Spirit or Vertue.

Do we deny his Union with them, that he is in them, and dwelleth in them; or their Union with Him, that they are in Him and walk with Him? All the question, is about the way how this is Conceived and Expressed. Will he say, That the Spirit so is and dwelleth in, and abideth with beleevers, that hereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come personally united with Him, and so are one person with Him? Some indeed have said little lesse; and therupon inferred, that beleevers were <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> &amp;c. as they loved to speak: But if this be his meaning.

Then as he contradicteth himself, saying that this light and vertue is within every man, which here is but promised to believers; so he giveth us a shreud presumption, that he is a <hi>Socinian,</hi> denying the personality of the Holy Ghost, which the texts cited by himselfe, and many others of the like import, do manifestly evince. The <hi>third</hi> particular, is the work of the Spirit <hi>to guide into all truth,</hi> &amp;c. which we shall be loath to deny, whatever his friends the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> do.

see to this, who cryeth up the Light within, which is but Nature under a new name, as shall be showne, in due time. This is his first Argument: but what is his <hi>Conclusion? Ergo The holy Spirit abideth and dwelleth in and leadeth his owne. All true Christians have the Spirit of God dwelling in them, as in his Temple: and Ergo</hi> (For this Argument must be branched-out into many, so fertile is the mans invention) <hi>The Spirit moveth, instructeth and leadeth every true christian into the knowledge of such things, as are necessary unto salvation. Ans. Concedo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and what would he have more? But poor man, knoweth he not what is the point in difference? Hath he Concluded, that the Spirit communicateth the knowledge of Gods minde, to all his saints, in the same manner and way, as he did of old to the Prophets. who were extraordinarily Inspired: and that that immediat way of communication of Truths to be beleeved, and Duties to be performed, which was peculiar to Patriarchs and Prophets, or to the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, is continued, and common to all believers? No: This point is too hot for his fingers to touch: and we must be satisfied, to heare him prove, that which he can prove, though it be the same, which we assert; and so to no purpose:</p>
               <p n="28">28. Before he come to this <hi>second</hi> Argument, he tels us §. 11. That there are some who do confess, that the Spirit doth now breath upon, and lead the Saints, but this is <hi>Subjectively</hi> and in <hi>a blinde way, coeco modo</hi>; but not <hi>objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely;</hi> that is, He illuminats the understanding to beleeve what is revealed in the Scriptures, but presents not any verity objectively, and this they call <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um incognitum assentiendi,</hi> an unknown medium of assent; that is, of which the man is <hi>not certaine,</hi> nor <hi>sensible. Ans:</hi> Whom he doth particularly here meane, I know not, and so I cannot judge, whether he reporteth their opinion faithfully, or not; nor how they explaine the termes here expressed? I know men may have various conceptions of the same Truth, and so may have various and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent-like Expressions, and yet meane one and the same thing. And for my part, though I cannot assent to some expressions here used; yet I think the substance of the truth, which I owne, is held forth here. The Scriptures are a compleat Rule to us, in all things concerning Faith, and Manners, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Salvation, and hold forth the revealed Mind of God here anent, as an outward Objective meane, or an external Rule. And therefore, we need now no new Revelation, either as to Truths to be beleeved, or as to Duties to be obeyed, in order to Salvation; but we need the Breathing, Light and Power of the Spirit, both to cause us see the matters already revealed, and to close with them, as divine Truths and Commands. Let us see however, what he answereth. <hi>Though this opinion</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>be more tolerable than the former, yet it is not true,</hi> And why? <hi>First because there are many truthes, which as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect every one,</hi> (ut singulos respiciunt, it may be he meaneth and should h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Are they Truths concerning salvation? if so, I deny what he saith, and shall waite his proofs, in the <hi>Next Thesis,</hi> where he promiseth to shew this. <hi>Secondly, because</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Arguments adduced
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66147:32"/>
do also prove that he proposeth truths to us Objectively.</hi> But suppose, that several of the Scriptures by him formerly adduced should conclude this, as to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and some others; yea and more, <hi>viz.</hi> That they should be filled with the Spirit, and Immediatly and Extraordinari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But further, though I should grant, what he here sayeth, he hath gained nothing: for I would say so, that the Lord Jesus hath by his Spirit revealed Truths even <hi>Objectively</hi> unto us, and even this way made good these promises: but how? By Inspireing Apostles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to pen Scripture, wherein all New Testament Truths, necessary, and sufficient for us to be believed, and obeyed, in order to Salvation, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and revealed. Is not this a proposeing of Truths Objectively. Nay more, I say, the Spirit, to this day, is proposeing to us truths <hi>Objectively,</hi> in &amp; by the work of the Ministrie and Ordinances, which are established and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Spirit, for this end, to clear up the word of Reconciliation, and to explaine all Gospel Truths, which we are to believe and obey: Here is also an Objective proposal by the Spirit. But you will say. it is not an Immediat Objective proposal. I grant it; and yet it is sufficient to confute his reason, which mentioneth not this <hi>Immediatness</hi>; nor will he prove any such thing, out of these Scriptures, in reference to all beleevers.</p>
               <p n="29">29 Now followeth his <hi>Second Argument,</hi> taken, as he sayes, from the new Covenant, whereby he would prove, that <hi>we are to be led by the Spirit not only Immediatly, but also Objectively.</hi> A strange conclusion, as full of confusion as the former; for any would think, that by <hi>Objectively</hi> here he meaneth <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly.</hi> But I suppose, he would have said, <hi>not only Subjectively, but also Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.</hi> For clearing of the matter, and to prevent a fighting in the dark, we would know, That the work of the Spirit, in order to the beleeving of Truths, is either in and about <hi>the Soul of the man,</hi> whom he is to give a Revelation of the truth unto, or is in and about the Truth, which is revealed, and to be beleeved. The <hi>First</hi> is that which is meaned by the word <hi>subjective,</hi> because the man is the subject in which the Spirit is to work faith. The <hi>Other</hi> is that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the word <hi>Objective,</hi> because the truth revealed is the Object, which is to be beleeved and received. Now the Subjective Operation of the Spirit in this matter, is by enlightning the Understanding of the man, taking away the vail, that was over his eyes, and thus enabling him to see the Object; as when Christ cured the blinde man, he put him in case to see the light, which he could not do before; so the Spirit openeth the eyes of the minde of the man, that he may see the wonders out of his law <hi>Psal.</hi> 119:18. As to this immediat work of the Spirit (though the Lord thinketh good to do this ordinarly, in and by the use of meanes, which he hath appointed; so that the word <hi>Immediatly</hi> must
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66147:33"/>
not be so understood, as to exclude these) he maketh no debate with us. But as to the <hi>Objective</hi> operation of the Spirit, it is by proposeing of the Object, or Truth to be beleeved unto the Intellect, as true, and as spoken by God: and this is twofold, either <hi>External,</hi> or <hi>Internal</hi>; External is when the Truth is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by God to the Intellect by outward, meanes, such as the Scriptures, Preachers and the like, and this may be also called <hi>Mediat.</hi> Internal, which may be called <hi>Immediat,</hi> is when the Lord's Spirit doth immediatly propose the Truth to be believed, as true, and as spoken to them, as a truth now to be believed, because thus spoken by Him immediatly unto their souls, unto which is requisite a real secret operation of the Spirit, immediatly carrying the truth in upon the Understanding by Supernatural and Immediatly Infused intelligible Species's. The <hi>former mediat</hi> way, this man is not Satisfied with: and this <hi>last immediat</hi> way is that whereby Truths were revealed extraordinarily to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apostles and other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, who were Inspired, and is usually called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Revelation; and in this sense is the word <hi>Revelation</hi> ordinarily taken in Scripture: And this is the <hi>Revelation Immediat and Objective,</hi> which this man would plead for, and which we deny to be common to all believers, whether under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="30">30. Now let us see how he proveth his point. He adduceth two passages of Scripture <hi>Esai</hi> 59:21. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 31:33. with its parallel <hi>Heb.</hi> 8:10. where the Lord promiseth, that <hi>the words, which he shall put in their mouth, shall not depart out of their mouth, nor out of the mouth of their seed, nor out of the mouth of their seeds seed, from hence forth even for ever.</hi> And that <hi>he will put his law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And what, I pray, can all this Evince? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the Lord put his words in the mouth, and hearts of his People, Mediatly? Ay but saith he, <hi>the Lord saith not, that he will do this by Scriptures, or other Means</hi>: Nor doth he say, say I, that he will do it without them: when he opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and when he caused the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> receive the word, not as the word of Man, though preached by <hi>Paul,</hi> but as it is indeed the Word of God, did he not put his word into their mouth, and write it in their hearts? But saith he, <hi>hereby is the law and the Gospel differenced, that the law was writen in tables of stone, but the Gospel in the heart. Ans.</hi> Said not <hi>David Psal.</hi> 40:8. that <hi>the law of God was in his heart.</hi> And <hi>Ps.</hi> 119:11 that <hi>he hid Gods Word in his heart</hi>? If it be so, why said he before, and went about to prove, that the Object of faith of beleevers, under the Law, and under the Gospel, was the same? and how had all the Saints, under the Law, Immediat Revelations? Other answers might be given here, but these are sufficient to shew the mans Ignorance and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy: when he hath reconciled himself to himself, we will have less to do. What he speaks afterward of Immediat Communion, (which is not the same with Immediat Revelation) in respect whereof the state of beleevers under the Gospel, is better than that under the Law, is but to confirme further his self contradiction. Let him reconcile this with what he said before of beleevers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66147:33"/>
under the Law, and of the sameness of the Object formal of the faith of both, and we shall think ourselves concerned to notice what he saith. But further, to multiply his self contradictions, he addeth an Untruth, viz. <hi>That under the Law, they had the high Priest immediatly receiving the Word of God, in the holy of holies, to teach the people; and we say now under th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Gospel, there is nothing but the external letter of the Scripture, in the meaning of one verse of which scarce two do agree</hi>: For neither can he prove, that the High Priest had such Revelations alwayes, in the Holy of Holies: And we say, as well as he, that beleevers now have free accesse to Christ, the great Teacher of his people, alwayes, to get his minde known, and writen in their hearts; but not to get Prophetick Revelations: and even as to the Scriptures (of which this man speaketh so basely) though they also had the Law and the Testimony, <hi>Esa.</hi> 8:20. and were to search the Scriptures, <hi>Iob.</hi> 5:39. we cannot think they had the advantage of us, in respect of the many Immediat Revelations made unto the Prophets, because of what the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 2 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t.</hi> 1:19. Beside that every one may see, that the Word of God, Writen and delivered by men immediatly Inspired, is as sure a ground of faith to others, as the Word of God Spoken by a man immediatly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired; and that the former hath the moe advantages. And whereas he talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the discrepancy of mens judgments, as to the meaning of the Scriptures; is he so blinde, as not to see, that the very words of immediatly Inspired High Priests and Prophets, were obnoxious to the same mistakes, and more? Is a Set, Long, Continued Discouse more intelligible to judgments of all syzes, than the same discourse Writen, and put into every mans hand to Read, and Meditate upon, to Ponder and Consider all its Parts, Coherence, &amp;c? What shall we then say of this Man, who reasoneth thus, against Truth and common Sense?</p>

But is it not strange, that if this were the meaning of the words, that <hi>Iohn</hi> should not know it; or if he know it, that notwithstanding thereof, he should write thus unto them, and acquant them with what he judged necessary; and particularly should decyphre by so many marks the Antichrist's and Seducers? Strange it is, that this Unction, that teacheth all things, could not teach them to know the usefulness of it, until <hi>Iohn</hi> did thus signifie it unto them: and yet more strange, that if matters be thus, the Spirit of God should have Inspired and Acted <hi>Iohn,</hi> unto the writing of this Epistle, and other holy Men of God to have writen Scripture; for by their Interpretation, this Unction maketh the whole Scripture useless: And indeed this Man is not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hamed to tell us, that this Unction is a more sure Rule, for finding out and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66147:34"/>
discerning Seducers, than <hi>Iohn's</hi> writings: which not only hath no shadow of countenance from the text, but doth also render the whole Ministrie of the Apostles, in teaching, Useless and Unnecessary; and so destroyeth, at one blow, all Gospel Dispensations. But were not beleevers under the law made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Unction? if not, what do all the Immediat Revelations which they had import? where is the Onenesse or sameness of the formal Object of their faith, and ours under the <hi>New Test</hi>? And then, what is become of all his former reasonings? But if even beleevers under the Law were made partakers of this Unction, in some measure, why did the Lord raise up Prophets? Why might not they have examined and tryed all their Prophecies by this Unction? What advantage had they by the Immediat Revelations made unto the High Priests? Why were they commanded to go to the Law and to the Testimony? Why doth Christ send them to the Scriptures, and not to this Inward Unction? These things cannot well hang together. Moreover, what understandeth he by this Unction? Will he say, that by it must be understood Immediat Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Revelation? How can this be more sure and certane than the Immediat Objective Revelations, which the Apostles had, and are set down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Is one Immediat Objective Divine Revelation more sure and certane, than Another? But it may be, that by this Unction, he meaneth the <hi>Light within.</hi> Yet neither can this hold; for the <hi>Light within</hi> is common to all men; but this Unction he maketh common only to the Saints. Enough of this, which hath been abundantly answered by others; and else where, to wit, in the book against <hi>Velthusius,</hi> I had occasion to speak to it, and shall not here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what is there said.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Having thus proved, as well as he could, what he thought convenient for his purpose, he tels us, that he will now answere <hi>Objections</hi>: and the first and only objection, which he taketh notice of §. 13. is <hi>That these Revelations are uncertane.</hi> And when he hath thus ignorantly, or unfairely proposed the Objection, he cryeth out of the Ignorance of his Adversaries: and very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly tels us, that he distinguisheth betwixt the <hi>Thesis</hi> and <hi>Hypothesis</hi>; and that it is one thing to say, <hi>that the true and undoubted revelations of the Spirit of God are certane and infallible</hi>; and another thing to say, <hi>that this or that man hath infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble revelations</hi>: and that <hi>he affirmed the first.</hi> (Which his adversaries will affirme, as well as he) and <hi>that the last may be questioned.</hi> But, with his leave, I shall frame the Objection thus. If since the Apostles, and the extraordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whom God was pleased to imploy, at the laying the foundation of the Gospel Administration, fell asleep; and after the canon of the Scriptures was compleated, all that ever pretended to these Immediat Revelations and Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as a ground of Faith &amp; Obedience, have borne the signal marks of the displeasure of God, and given, by their Practices, or by their Opinions, or Both, evident toakens of their being acted and led by a Spirit of Errour and Wickedness, and of their being given up of God to strong delusions; then we may saifly inferre, that this is not the way of Christ, now the Gospel is clearly and fully revealed, the canon of the Scriptures is perfected, whereby He teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and leadeth His people; nor ought to be owned as such. But the former
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66147:34"/>
is true. Therefore so is the other. The connexion or <hi>Major Proposition,</hi> is such, I think, as no man can except against, who regairdeth the Works of the Lord, and the Operation of his hands: And who can imagine, that if such a way of God's manifesting of his minde now were the only way of God's lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all his owne, he should put such Open, Manifest, and Undoubted Marks of his displeasure upon those men, who, of all the rest of the world, were most giving up themselvs to the only, saife and Christian Way of understanding God's minde? Or that these should be specially given up to crosse and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Immediat, Objective and Infallible Revelation of the Spirit of truth, declared in the Scriptures, writen by men infallibly acted by the holy Spirit of God; and to beleeve and follow the dictats of the Father of lies? As for the <hi>second Proposition.</hi> It is unquestionable from history of all such Persons; from the <hi>Montanists, Circumcelliones, Donatists, Euchites,</hi> and the like <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> of old; from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that great Impostor, and pretender to Revelations; from the many <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which read D. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in his book above cited; Especially <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> the Father &amp; founder of the Jesuites, our <hi>Quakers</hi> great Friends, if not Fathers; from the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Swenckfeldians, Weigelians,</hi> and particularly <hi>Iohn of Leyden</hi> and his complices, in and about <hi>Munster,</hi> &amp;c. to the <hi>Quakers</hi> this very day. All which have given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted evidences of their delusions, by their Errours, Heresies, &amp; sometimes Scandalous Actings. Nay, it hath been found, that these desperat Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res have pretended to these Revelations, of purpose, to put off with more cunning their desperat Errours; and cheat souls unto the market of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Wares. If this man be of another judgment. I challenge him and all the <hi>Quakers,</hi> this day, to name to me a Seck of such Pretenders, of whom this may not be verified. And as for himself and the rest of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> if the Scriptures be the word of truth, and given out by Infallible Inspiration (wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wisdome is justified of her children. As for <hi>Munster</hi> business, he professeth §. 14. his abhorrence thereof; but with all addeth, that <hi>as great evils have been practised by such, as owne the Scriptures</hi>: which doth not touch the Objection framed by me: Beside, that it is not very probable, that God would have left these Miscreants to such acts of villany, if the way, to which they pretended, had been of God; considering how they were the first, that in that age, and at that season of Reformation, did appear for it, and openly professe it: a parallel of such, as owned any part of Truth, long under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and against so much opposition, will not, I suppose, be showne.

               <p n="34">34. What he saith §. 15. in Vindication of the last part of his <hi>Thesis,</hi> hath been obviated already. See above §. 18 and 19. only I shall take notice of a word or two, which he hath. To prove the self evidence of the Spirits working in souls, he maketh use of these words of <hi>David, Taste and see, that God is good,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Paul.</hi> saying <hi>I am perswaded nothing can separate me from the Love of God</hi> and then citeth 1 <hi>Ioh</hi> 4:13. and (as if it were to the same purpose) addeth 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5:6. and hence inferreth, that <hi>the Revelations, which they have, being the Revelations of the Spirit, who is truth, must certanely be true, and not contrary to either Scripture or Reason.</hi> Alas, doth not the man know, that the Spirit may work grace in the soul, and for a time, for holy ends, keep up the sensation thereof; and that others, may deny, or not observe, the work of the Spirit in their souls, through Mistakes, Prejudice, or other Corruption; as others may imagine a work of grace without ground? Knoweth he no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, that we are speaking here of Immediate and Objective Revelations, which are Extraordinary, and which himself, in a few lines before, said the Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles had, not naming any others; and not of the Ordinary workings of the Spirit of grace? Waving these Impertinencies, I would ask only, How came it to passe, that Others pretending as much to Immediat Revelations, as he, have been deceived? If others have been deceived, why may not he? It is true, The Spirit of God is alwayes a Spirit of Truth; but a Spirit of Errour and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion, which some may take to be the Spirit of God, is not the Spirit of Truth. Why will he not try by the Scriptures, and by sound Reason, what sort of Spirit, that is, which acteth him, &amp; the rest? No; <hi>that is needless.</hi> And why so? <hi>Because their spiritual senses are awake; so that, at the very first, they can perceive their revelations to be of the Spirit, no less infallibly, than a wise Mathematician, can diseerne the truth of the most clear mathematick demonstrations.</hi> Happy they, say I, if it be so: But hereby he must needs reproach his Predessours, the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> and <hi>Phanaticks</hi> of former

ages, as being asleep, at best, in the midst of their Revelations; and not having their spiritual senses awake; for they have been deceived; and yet, no doubt, were as confident of the contrarie, as this man is: But this man's testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is of himself, and so the less to be valued; and it is inward and invisible, and so the harder to be confuted: Only I would know, how he will perswade us of it, a Mathematician can demonstrat the grounds of his perceiving the truth of the most clear Mathematick demonstrations: can he do the like, as to his sensations?</p>
               <p n="35">35. The parting argument, which he seteth down in the last paragraph, is sufficient, (so he thinketh) to end the whole debate. Thus he frameth it. <hi>That unto which all Professors of Christianity, of whatsoever kinde, do at last recurre, and because of which, all other grounds are commended, and accounted worthy to be beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, must of necessity be the only most certane and immovable ground of all Christian faith. But the Inward, Immediat, objective revelation of the Spirit, is that. Therefore &amp;c.</hi> Now, not to carpe at the eccentrickness of this conclusion, for many such things must be passed over. This confirmation of the <hi>Minor,</hi> as to <hi>Protestants,</hi> (with whom he very charitablie joyneth <hi>Socinians,</hi> whom I cannot account Christians, notwihstanding of all the agreement, betwixt him and them) destroyeth the whole Argument, and rendereth it Useless, as to his purpose, and so concludeth only his folly, and ignorance. <hi>If we enquire</hi> (say he) <hi>at them, why they take the Scripture, for a Rule; they answere, Because in them is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the will of God, which was revealed Immediatly and objectively by the Spirit, unto holy men.</hi> Can any man of common sense inferre hence, that Protestants are for the Uncertanty of all Objective and Immediat Revelation, even of that, which holy men of God had, when acted by the Infallible Spirit to penne Scripture, as he insinuateth in the following words? or, can any man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon judgment see, what this concession, and necessary foundation of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, can make for the falsly pretended Immediat and Objective Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which <hi>Quakers</hi> boast off? Nay, doth not Protestants their owneing of this solide, and immovable foundation, sufficiently warrand their rejecting of his Delusions? yea and necessitate them thereunto, if they would be true to their principles?</p>
               <p n="36">36. As for his monitory conclusion, in the end of his vindication of this his Second <hi>Thesis,</hi> wherein he giveth us a full foretaste of his <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> because we will have occasion sufficient to speak to this matter afterward, we need only tell the <hi>Reader,</hi> what he saith here. His discourse, in short, is this: If any man will assent to what he hath said of Divine Revelations, though at present he be a stranger to them himself, yet he must know, that this is the common Privilege of all Christians, and at length shall come to know this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret light enlighting his heart &amp;c. and when, by relinquishing of sin, this divine Voice in the heart shall become more known, then shall he feel, that as the Old Naturall Man is put off, the New Man and spiritual birth shall arise; and this new birth, having Spiritual senses, can discerne the things of the Spirit, and understand the Mysteries of the kingdom of God. And therefore let every man attend to this Spirit, in the Little Revelation of that pure light, which at
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66147:36"/>
first revealeth things more notoure; and afterward, as he is fitted, he shall receive more and more, and be in case at length by quick Experience, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them, who shall enquire what way he knoweth, that he is led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. That is, in short, If one will firmly beleeve, that Natures dimme Light is the Spirit of God, and the Holy Ghost, in him; and, in the faith of this, give up himself, to the Teachings thereof; and thereby, shun outward acts of sin, and put on a forme of Godliness, and more and more give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to this Delusion, he shall at length arive at this Perfection, that he may burne the Bible, and with confidence assert, that he is acted by the Holy Ghost, let Scriptures and Common Sense say to the contrary what they will. What an extract of <hi>Pelagianisme, Enthusiasme,</hi> and <hi>dreadful Delusion,</hi> is here, every know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing person may see.</p>

               <p n="1">1. HIs third <hi>Thesis</hi> (which I finde in some things altered, and more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed in the second edition, set down in the <hi>Apology,</hi> than was in the single sheet) containing his judgment of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> cometh now to be examined. The Scriptures being owned by us, as a sure Rule, whereby we should try the Spirits; and they giving such clear and manifest Testimony against the Delusions, and bold Assertions of the <hi>Quakers</hi>; and affording us full and sufficient Ground whereupon to reject their Doctrine, and to look upon them as Impostors; it is little wonder, that we heare them speak so basely of these Scriptures of Truth, as we do. Mr <hi>Stalham,</hi> in his <hi>Reviler rebuked</hi> Pag. 1. tels us, that a <hi>Quaker</hi> denied to his face, the <hi>Scriptures to be the word of truth</hi>; or, at least, <hi>not to all, not to wicked men and unbelievers, no not condemningly.</hi> He tels us also <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. that some said to him, <hi>That the Scripture is not the word of truth, but the witness of Gods power</hi>: as if that could be the true witness of Gods Power, which were not true, nor the word of truth. He tels us also <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. that <hi>Francis Howgil</hi> said, <hi>The Scripture is other mens words, that spoke them freely,</hi> and Pag. 20. that <hi>Richard Farnworth</hi> called them in a way of disparag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>a printed bible.</hi> So <hi>Pag.</hi> 23. <hi>sect.</hi> 3. that <hi>Iohn Lawson</hi> said, <hi>we had nothing to try men by, but the letter, the Bible, or written word, which is natural and carnal.</hi> So <hi>Pag.</hi> 244. he tels us, that some of them, in a book called, <hi>a paper sent into the world,</hi> Pag, 2. have these words. <hi>They are such teachers, as tell people, that</hi> Matthew, Mark, Luk <hi>and</hi> John <hi>is the Gospel, which are but the letter: we therefore do d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66147:36"/>
give testimony against them, and that directly, that the world may bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his honesty. But we know, what account the Old &amp; N. <hi>England Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, David George,</hi> and the <hi>Familists,</hi> with whom this man and the rest agree too well, made of the Scripturs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is commonly affirmed by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that the Scriptures <hi>are not the word of God,</hi> or ought not to be so called. So <hi>Fox and Hubberthorn,</hi> cited by Mr <hi>Hicks,</hi> in his <hi>first dialogue Pag.</hi> 17. where he tels us also, that <hi>Nailor</hi> in his <hi>Answere to the jewes</hi> P. 22. said, <hi>That it is the devil that contends for the Scriptures to be the word of God.</hi> And that this is their common Assertion; and that mainly upon this ground, that Christ is called the word of God. D. <hi>Owen</hi> also witnesseth this, in his <hi>Exercit Apol. Pro. S. Script<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Adv: Fanaticos Exerc.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. which is no new thing for <hi>Phanaticks</hi> to alledge: for I finde, that it was one of <hi>Swenckfeldius's</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodoxies, <hi>de Sacris Libris</hi> P. 27, 28. and that upon the same sandy ground; as Mr <hi>Rutherfoord</hi> witnesseth, in his <hi>Spiritual Antichrist</hi> P. 19. <hi>Richard Farnworth</hi> said to Mr <hi>Stalham</hi> (as he reporteth Pag. 3. of his forecited book.) <hi>That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the word of God, and eternal life, as thou wouldest have them, thou canst not prove, nor all the Magicians to help thee.</hi> So P. 43. he tels us, that one of them, in a sheet, called <hi>Christ exalted,</hi> &amp;c. P. 4. had these words, <hi>He</hi> (Christ) <hi>is the word, and the Scripture is not; He is the light, and the Scripture is not; He is the Rule and Guide, and Teacher and Iudge, and the Scripture is not, but a Declaration of Him to be so.</hi> By which and the like we may see, how low an account they have of the Scriptures; And how fond and absurd this is to debase the Scriptures, under a pretence of exalting of Christ, who seeth not? Seing the Lord spoke in and by the Prophets, unto the Fathers; and spoke by the Mouth of the holy Prophets, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1:1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1:70. And the word of the Lord came unto them, as unto <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah Chap.</hi> 1:2, 4. &amp; 2:1. &amp; 14:1. &amp; 29:30. unto <hi>Ezechiel Chap.</hi> 1:3. &amp; 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. to <hi>Hosea Chap.</hi> 1:1. to <hi>Ioel Chap.</hi> 1:1. to <hi>Ionah Ch.</hi> 1:1. &amp; 3:1. to <hi>Micab Ch.</hi> 1:1. to <hi>Zephania Chap.</hi> 1:1. to <hi>Zechariah Chap.</hi> 1:1. &amp; 7:4. &amp; 8:1. and by <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai Chap.</hi> 1:1. And they declared what they spoke, as the word of the Lord; and the Lord owned it, as His word. See moreover 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36:21. <hi>Micah.</hi> 4:4. <hi>Act.</hi> 28:25. <hi>Esai.</hi> 1:20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30:8 <hi>Num.</hi> 25.5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23:28. and the like. And seing the Scriptures containe nothing but a Revelation of the will and good pleasure of God,; it is manifest and clear, that they are the Word of God, and should bear that title. To speak nothing of the Law, which the Lord spoke and gave himself immediatly from mount Sinai; what he inspired the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to deliver, and spoke himself in and by them, and moved them infallibly in the very writing thereof, cannot but be the Word of God. That word which was given by immediat divine Inspiration, cannot but beare the name of <hi>the Word of God.</hi> Nay, this name is expresly given unto the Scriptures; for <hi>Mark</hi> 7. what is called the commandement of God <hi>vers.</hi> 8. spoken and written by Moses <hi>vers.</hi> 10. is called <hi>the Word of God, vers.</hi> 13.

If this man be of another judgment herein, he should clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press himself, howbeit he thereby dissatisfie some of his Brethren: But instead of this, in his <hi>Apology</hi> P. 36. he alleigeth, that we but calumniate them; and, speaking in the name of all the rest, he saith, <hi>they account them the most excellent writings in the world</hi>: but how will he make this agree with their sayings, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly cited, and afterward to be adduced? He would do well to endeavour some reconciliation; but I see not how he can do it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for us, we assert, that no Prophecie of the Scripture is of any private interpretation: For they were not conceived by the mindes, nor framed and formed by the Understandings and Reasonings of men; nor were they the product of their Study &amp; Paines, as other books are of their Authors, assisted by the Spirit of God. Howbeit the penmen of the Scriptures studied the writtings of others, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did understand by books <hi>Dan.</hi> 9:2. and <hi>David</hi> was much in the meditation and study of the Law; yea they searched and made narrow enquiry after the meaning of what was spoken and delivered by themselves, so far as concerned their own faith and Practice, as <hi>Peter</hi> tels us 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:10, 11. yet the work of delivering the Scriptures, by Word and Write, was not the result of their studious Labour, wherein their Mindes, Judgments and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories were exercised and busied; nor did these Scriptures proceed from private phancied Revelations and Enthusiasmes; they were not the issue of mens Dreams, Imaginations, Conceptions of fancie, or self-Afflation, because no way of private Interpretation, or Revelation; but on the contrary, holy men of God spoke as they were, not only determined, but moved by the Holy Ghost; and that in contradistinction both from the acts of mens Phancy and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the acts of their Will 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:20, 21. The Holy Ghost did Immediatly and Extraordinarily dictat what was written, Matter and Expressions, as well such things, as they had Seen, Heard, Read, Studied and Known before, as these they were Ignorant of, or had forgotten. Hence it is, that the <hi>Lord spoke in the Prophets, by the mouth of the holy Prophets;</hi> and his word <hi>came unto them and by them,</hi> see <hi>Heb.</hi> 1:2. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14:36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3:7. &amp; 9:8. &amp; 10:15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1:

He did so inspire them, that they set down this conception, rather than that &amp;c.</hi> 3. <hi>He so ordered all the conceptions and sentences and led them so, as that this sentence was first, that next, and the other in the third place, and thus they were set downe orderly one after another; and this is properly to write and make a book: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Spirit of God properly the Author of the Scriptures.</hi> Hence is it, that the word of God, in the <hi>Old Test.</hi> is tearmed in the <hi>New,</hi> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> pointing out the word as written, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whereby we see, that as, in the frameing of the truths, contained in the Scriptures of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or as to the matter and thing revealed and written, the holy men of God had the real Inspirations of God; and spoke, as they were moved by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, or as the Holy Ghost spoke in them and by them, they giving only a concurrence of their Rational faculties: so in the very commiting of the minde of God unto writing, they acted as moved by the Holy Ghost, and not by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Skill or Knowledg, in the art of Grammer or Rhetorik, being herein as a Pen in the hand of a writer, (and therefore ought not to be called the Secondary or proxime Authors of the Scriptures, as some Papists imagine) though the Lord used One to express his minde, in one way; and Another in another way, as he thought meet, and each in a way suteable to his natural Enduements; as he used <hi>Esaias</hi> to express his minde, in an High, Loftie and Court-like stile; and <hi>Amos,</hi> being an herd man, to express his minde, in a more Mean and Low stile, suteable to herd men; in all consulting the universal good of the Church, in all ages. Whence it is manifest, that not only the Matter and Things revealed, whether as Truths to be Beleeved, or as Lawes to be Obeyed, are immediatly of God; but also the very Method, Expressions and Words, wherein these truths were uttered, (which even some Papists, as <hi>Gregor. de Valentia</hi> and <hi>Estius Swarez</hi> and others confess.) And so the Whole, and every Part, Sentence and Word is of divine Authority, and of a divine Original. Whereby every one may see, how sure the ground and basis of our Faith and Obedience is; how ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally we act, in adhereing to these Scriptures of Truth, rejecting whatever is not consonant thereunto; and especially all particular pretended divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are but the meer product of mens strong Phancies and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or of Satans Workings in mens mindes and phantasies: And withall we hereby see the divine Original of this Word of Prophecie, which we must <hi>take heed unto, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in our hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:19. and must study and meditate upon, day &amp; night <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. and be well acquanted with, They being the Oracles of God,

He saith, I confess, in his <hi>Thesis, That the Scriptures of truth did proceed from the holy Revelations of the Spirit of God</hi>: and one would think this a faire acknowledgment; But in his <hi>Apology</hi> Pag. 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he tels us, <hi>that they do not think, that the Authority of the Scriptures doth depend on any Efficacy or Vertue, placed in these Writings, but ascribe it wholly unto that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, from whom they came.</hi> What confusion and self contradiction is here? To say, that the Scriptures of Truth are the Revelations of the Spirit of God, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66147:38"/>
yet they carry no Authority impressed upon them? What shall carry the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of a divine Authority, if divine Revelations do not? why did he assert, in the preceeding <hi>Thesis,</hi> that divine Revelation was the formal Object and ground of divine Faith? How can they beleeve, with a divine Faith, the divine Revelations, which they pretend unto? why doth he plead so much for look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after divine Revelations, if divine Revelations have not the stamp of divine Authority upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he sayes, <hi>they ascribe the authority wholly unto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> And do not we so also, when we stoop unto the Authority of the Scriptures of Truth, because delivered by the Inspiration of God? when we say, the Acts and Statutes of Parliament have the authority of Lawes, and we obey and receive them, as authenticque Lawes, do we not ascribe the Legislative Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority unto the Parliament? what a fancyful distinction must this them be? and what a Notional difference doth he here imagine? But it may be, by <hi>these writings,</hi> he meaneth the Paper and Ink? But can he call the Paper and Inck the Scriptures of Truth? or say, that they did proceed from the holy Revelations of the Spirit of God?</p>
               <p n="6">6. He reduceth all the contents of the Scripture unto three heads, telling us, that they containe <hi>first, an historical narration of the acts of the people of God, in not a few ages, and of several rare testimonies of the providence of God towards them</hi>: Forgetting that we have here also a true and faithful Narration of the first creation; and that these examples are instructive. <hi>Secondly a Prophetical narration of many things, of which some are past, and some are yet to come</hi>: Making no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great and many Promises, nor yet of the threatnings. <hi>Thirdly a full and large testimony to the chiefe doctrines of the Christian faith, and that in certane excellent declarations, exhortations and sentences; which by the afflatus of the Spirit were said and written, at diverse times, to diverse churches and pastors, according to various occasions, that fell out.</hi> And here is the whole of the high account he hath of the Scriptures, and of their perfection. Not to Meddle much with that here, which he will give us occasion largely to disput of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, I would only enquire, where or in what book, beside the Scriptures, shall we finde the whole doctrine of the Christian Faith laid down? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as he saith, only give testimony to the chiefe Doctrines of Christianity: Therefore there must be other Doctrines of Christianity, that must be found out and searched for elsewhere: but where, I pray, shall we finde these? Againe I would know of him, how we shall know, what belongeth to the chiefe Heads of Christianity: and what not? we cannot know this by the Scriptures; for they are supposed by him, to be chief heads of Christianity, to us, before the Scriptures come, which only, as he saith. beareth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to some of them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Further, when he sayeth, the Scripture giveth this Testimony, only in certaine declarations &amp;c. It would seem, we have not our Christian faith from the Scriptures; but all the Articles thereof flow to us from some other Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat Fountaine; and are founded, as to us, upon some other Immediat Ground; and the Scriptures only give some testimony thereto, and that, as it were, on the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66147:39"/>
bye, in some certane Declarations, Exhortations, and Sentences. Hence it would appeare by him, that it is not the maine intendment, and principal designe of the Scriptures, to set downe, delineat and explaine to us, the articles of our Christian Faith, and the doctrine of our Religion; and so <hi>Iohn</hi> was, it seemeth, in a mistake, when he said <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20: <hi>vers.</hi> 31. <hi>These are written, that we might beleeve, that Iesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing we might have life, through his name.</hi> Why hath the Lord thus made known, and written unto us excellent things, in counsel and knowledge? Is it not, that our trust might be in the Lord? and that he might make us know, the certanty of the Words of Truth? <hi>Prov.</hi> 22: <hi>vers.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 1: <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 3, 4. Why saith <hi>Paul Rom</hi> 15: <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>that whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope</hi>? For what end, did the Spirit inspire these Holy men, and by or in them speak to us in the Scriptures, if not to give us a solide ground for our Faith to stand upon, in receiving and beleeving the articles of Salvation? Is not the whole of the Scripture given by the Inspiration of God, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:16, 17? Why doth the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> say 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:19. that we do well to take heed unto this more sure word of prophecy? If they be not the ground of our Faith, why are we desired thus to take heed unto them; and to desire the sincere milk of word, that we may grow thereby? 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2:2. Are we not said to be built upon that foundation, which the Prophets and Apostles did ministerially lay, by Word and Write? <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2:20. Thus we see, he layeth no more weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scriptures, as to the bottoming of our Faith, than he would do upon any good Book, wherein testimony were given unto the chiefe Doctrines of the Christian Faith, by some excellent Declarations, Exhortations and Sentences.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In this account he giveth us of his conceptions of the fulness and perfection of the Scriptures, It is observable, that he doth not so much as give the least hint, of any Authority, wherewith the Scripture is cloathed, to lay obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on our Consciences, to yeeld Faith and Obedience to it, as the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Soveraigne Will and pleasure of the great God and Lawgiver; (and in this is more injurious to the Scriptures, then Papists are, who grant it to be a Rule of Faith) <hi>Hos.</hi> 8:12. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. throughout, with infinite moe places, and this is in effect to destroy the Scriptures, which are given to us as the Law of God, and must be received as such, with Faith and Obedience. As if they had not been inspired by the Holy Ghost, for this end &amp; purpose, that we might thereby understand and prove what is that good, that acceptable and perfect will of God. Is it not called a <hi>Law,</hi> disobedience unto and transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of which is sin? 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:4. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2:8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and 4:11.</p>

What he saith of the Scriptures being written to certane Churches and Pastors, upon certane Occasions, which is an old Popish argument, neither will quadrate with the whole of the Scriptures; nor, though it did, will it ground any such inference, that we have little or no interest therein, as our

Law and Rule, as <hi>Quakers</hi> say: and lest, he think I caluminate, let him take notice of these few Instances, <hi>Edw. Borroughs Pag.</hi> 47. of his works, saith (as Mr <hi>Hicks</hi> citeth him Dial. 3. Pag. 58, 59.) <hi>That is no command to me, which is a command to another; neither did any of the saints act by a command, that was given to another.</hi> And againe, <hi>Such as go to duty by imitation from the letter, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to others, their sacrifice is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> And againe <hi>Pag.</hi> 105. he hence inferreth, that <hi>they who take up a command from the Scriptures, are in the witchcraft.</hi> This is a sufficient proof: And, that that inference of his Brethren is naught, we shall shew afterward.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In the following words of his <hi>Thesis,</hi> he cometh nearer to that, which is the core of the whole of his designe, which is to set up Immediat Revelations and <hi>Enthusiasmes,</hi> as the ground and adequate Rule of Faith and Manners; and to lay aside the Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, as incompetent thereunto: for he tels us, that <hi>the Scriptures are only a Declaration of the Fountaine, and not the Fountaine it self:</hi> and thence inferreth, that <hi>therefore they are not to be accounted the Principal Original of all Truth and Knowledge, nor the adequate primary Rule of Faith and Manners.</hi> But what ridiculous folly is this? did ever man dream, that the Scriptures were God, or the Spirit of God? So he reasoneth, as if one should say, The acts of Parliament, or the Lawes made by the Supream Legislator of a Kingdom or Common wealth, are but only declarations of the minde of the Law-givers, and not the Law-makers themselves, therefore they are not the principal Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of civility, or municipality; nor the adequate and primary Rule of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: And who would not smile at this? The Jewes, when they heard the law given by God upon mount Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ai, might have said likewise; This Law is not God himself, nor the fountaine it self, but only a Declaration of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; and therefore cannot be accounted our adequate and primary Rule of Faith and Manners; but we must look after something else, as our Adequate and Primary Rule. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut I wonder, that the man doth not observe, that this manner of argueing, maketh nothing for his maine designe; for he will not, I suppose, say, (though others speak little less) that the Revelations, which he pretendeth unto, or the light within, which he would have regarded as the Rule, is God himself, or the Fountaine and principal Original it self of all Truth and Knowledge; but only, at most, a Beame of Light and Truth stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the Fountaine: And so the question will only come to this; whether the Revelations or Light within, which he cryeth up; or the Scriptures of Truth, which we plead for, be the Adequate and Principal Rule of Faith and Manners: And if he speak any thing to this question, in his <hi>Apology,</hi> we shall examine it. One thing I would say here, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Prime &amp; Principal Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of all Truth and Knowledge, is no Rule of Faith and Manners to us, let be the Adequate and Primary Rule, being considered in it self; but only as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and manifested to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in manner of a Law, whether written and made legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon the Nature of Man, and his Relation to the Creator, and to the rest of the creatures; or imprinted upon the Minde of Man; or delivered by Vive Voice, as on mount Sinai; or by writing, as in the Scriptures. God's being the Fountaine and prime Original of all Truth, &amp;c. did lay no bands on <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:66147:40"/>
to forbear to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; but there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command given, and Law made thereanent God is, in Himself, and from all Eternity, was the prime Fountain and Original of all Truth and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; yet was not that a Law or Rule: for a Law or Rule is a relative thing, and supposeth Subjects to be Ruled and Governed thereby, which were not in being from eternity.</p>
               <p n="11">11. He talketh further, at the same rate of absurdity, granting that the <hi>Scriptures are, and may be accounted a secondary Rule, subordinate to the Spirit, from whom they derive all their excellency and Certainty.</hi> But what meaneth he by a <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Subordinate Rule</hi>? This would import, that the Testimony of the Spirit, which he, and others of his perswasion, do pretend unto, and plead for, is a Rule above the Scriptures: But, how can the Testimony of the Spirit, which they say, they receive, be preferred unto the Testimony of the Scriptures; seing by his owne confession, the Scriptures were written by a divine <hi>Afflatus</hi>; Is the Spirits speaking unto them more an <hi>Afflatus,</hi> and so a more Primary Rule, than the Spirits speaking in the Scriptures? This cannot be; for sure, the Scriptures, or Verity declared therein, or the Declaration of Gods minde thereby expressed, is as Immediat an Emanation from the Prime Original Truth, as any which they can receive; for the holy Men of God were as Really and as Immediatly Inspired by the Spirit, in Speaking, Dictating and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures (we are not here speaking of transumpts, or of translations) as they can suppose themselves to be; if not more. And so all the difference is; that the Inspiration, which they receive, is to them Immediate, but the Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Scriptures, is but Mediate to us: yet sure, when they come to dictate their Inspirations to others, the case cannot much differ. And further, we are taught, that the Inspirations and Revelations, which the Holy-men of God, who were his Penmen in writing the Scriptures, did receive, were not for themselves; for the Lord spoke by them, or in them, to the Fathers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1:<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He addeth a reason in his <hi>Thesis,</hi> which he prosecuteth at large in his <hi>Apology,</hi> viz. <hi>That we know the certanty of the Scriptures only by the inward testimony of the Spirit.</hi> But this reason is ambiguously expressed, for it may either have this meaning; That we know the certainty of the matter contained in the Scriptures, only by the Inward Testimony of the Spirit: Or this may be the meaning, That only by the Inward Testimony of the Spirit, we know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanely, that the Scriptures are the word of God, or that book, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the revealed will of God. If he take this Reason in the <hi>first</hi> sense, we may then in part know, what he understandeth by a Secondary and Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Rule, which title, he is pleased, as we heard, to allow unto the Scriptures; &amp; that his meaning is consonant to what <hi>Will.

There are in the Scriptures such innate marks and evidences of divine Majesty, Power and Authority, whereby, as Light and Heat prove and demonstrate themselves, so the Scriptures evince themselves to be of God by their Light, Life, Power, &amp; Majesty Divine, which is also manifested by these particulars mentioned in our <hi>Confession of faith,</hi> to wit, <hi>The Heavenliness of the matter; The Efficacy of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; The Majestie of the stile; The Consent of all the parts; The Scope of the whole, which is to give all glory to God; The full Discovery it maketh of the only Way of Mans salvation; The many other Incomparable Excellencies, and the Intire Perfection ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> These are arguments, which it carryeth alongs with it, whereby it doth abundantly evince it self to be the word of God, as the heavens declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be of God, not by any voice or testimony, but by the Characters of Infinite Power, so legible upon them, that all that run may read. The Spirit, in working up the soul unto a Conviction and Perswasion, that the Scriptures are the word of God, doth those things. <hi>First,</hi> He cleareth up the characters of divinity, that are in the Scriptures, formerly dark to the man, through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, or other causes; and so maketh the Object plaine and manifest. <hi>Next</hi> He conveyeth light into the Minde, whereby the man is enabled to discerne and perceive these Grounds and Evidences, which are the characters of divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: as a man, when clouds are removed, and his eyes are opened, to see the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of light flowing from the body of the Sun, is convinced and perswaded that the Sun is arisen in our horizon. Now this work of the Spirit, hath its various Measures and Degrees; not to mention that, which is truely saving, whereby the man is not only Enabled to see the forementioned grounds to a conviction, but, through a gracious Work of the Spirit on the whole soul, is made to close with these grounds with joy and delights and to accept of the Scriptures upon these Grounds with full perswasion of soul, as having this truth, that these Scriptures are the word of God, deeply impressed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="16">16. If any enquire, wherein this differeth from the Opinion of the <hi>Quakers</hi>? I <hi>ans.</hi> In those particulars. (1) This, which we speak of, is not the Spirits saying by any new Revelation, Voice, or Whisper or Enthusiastick inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this, and not that Book is the Word of God; The <hi>Quakers</hi> speak thus. (2) By their way, the testimony of the Spirit is an Argumentative <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> or an Inartificial Argument, adduced to prove this conclusion to themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, that this or that Book is the Word of God; so that they must first Perceive and Feel, that the Spirit saith or witnesseth, this book to be the Word of God; and then they inferre, that therefore it is to be received as the Word of God: But we make no such use of the Spirits Testimony; but Assert, that He so illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth the Minde to see the characters of divinity, as withall to work the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or Perswasion; and that so, as the Faith, or Perswasion, shall be felt often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, before the man reflect upon the Operation of the Spirit. (3) The testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony we speak of is that Operation of the Spirit, whereby the characters of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty and Authority, which are natively inprinted in, and do necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily attend the Sayings of God, are Discovered, Received and Acquiesced in: But the testimony, which they speak of, is distinct from, and hath no conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with the Objective evidence, which is in the Scriptures themselves. (4) The <hi>Quakers</hi> Revelation is purely Objective, and New, and Immediat, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a new Truth: The work of the Spirit which we speake of, as it cleareth up the Objective Evidence, which is in the Scriptures, by removing Grounds of Mistake and Prejudice, and the like; so it worketh by these Evidences, a <hi>Subjective</hi> Conviction in the soul, and a Perswasion of the truth, which only the man did not see before. (5) By their Revelation a person getteth no new disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the characters of Divinity, which the Scriptures carry along with them, unless it may be by accident: but the Perswasion, which we speak of, is rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally deduced from, and founded upon these Marks and Evidences, which the soul is now made to see clearly, through the Operation of the Spirit. (6) By our way, the Scriptures do not receive their Truth and Authority, neither in themselves, nor as to us, from this work of the Spirit; as they do, by the way of the <hi>Quakers</hi>: for whether this Operation of the Spirit, whereof we speak, be, or not, the Scriptures are what they are, the very Word of God; as the sun is a shineing sun, and light is light, whether the blinde see it, or not. The word of the Lord is cloathed with Divine Light, Majesty and Authority, whether we see it, or not; &amp; Obligeth us (though as yet wanting this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and remaining blinde, or blinded with prejudice) to Imbrace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the same; as the Word of God, and to yeeld all due Faith and Obedience thereunto, as to the Word &amp; Law of the great God &amp; Lawgiver: it is true, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this work of the Spirit, we cannot attaine to that heart-quieting Perswasion, and soul-satisfying Assurance of the infallible Truth and divine Authority of the Scripture; yet there is an infallible Truth, &amp; divine Authority, that inseparably attendeth whatsoever is spoken by God, &amp; delivered as Assertions, &amp; Lawes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66147:43"/>
we see it and beleeve it, or not: And our blindness, though it prejudge us of the rich advantage of Embraceing the Scriptures, as the very Word of God; yet it Endammageth not, in the least, the word of God it self: But by the way of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the Scriptures have no Light, nor Authority, in themselves, or to us, until this Second Testimony come: And thus it is supposed, that either the Scriptures have no Characters of Light, Power, Life and Majesty divine, in themselves; or that whatever they may have of this kinde, it is of no force to Oblige us to Faith and Obedience, (which were a contradiction) till we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this adventious and second Testimony; and so all, who want this, are under no Obligation to receive the Bible by Faith and Obedience, more then the <hi>Turks Alcoran,</hi> which sure, must be a very wilde and uncouth Position.

               <p n="19">19. In his <hi>Apolo.</hi> Pag. 38. he spendeth many words about his Conclusion, which he gave us in fewer words, in the end of his <hi>Thesis,</hi> thus, <hi>and seing</hi> (said he) <hi>we do receive and beleeve the Scriptures, because they did proceed from the Spirit: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Spirit more originally and principally the Rule</hi>: and to make all strong he addeth that philosophical axiome, <hi>propter quod unumquodque est tale, illud ipsum est magis tale</hi>: and also, in summing up, what he had in the former part of his <hi>Thesis,</hi> and we have already examined, to wit, touching the Spirits being the Principal Original of all Truth and Knowledge; to which conclusion, he saith, he annexed that axiome: which is not true. But passing this, and what hath been answered already, let us see what truth is here: and <hi>first</hi> I Observe, That he manifestly confoundeth, the <hi>prime and principal leader,</hi> with the <hi>principal and original Rule.</hi> Here he saith that the Spirit is the <hi>Principal and Original Rule,</hi> &amp; else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in his <hi>Thesis,</hi> as we shall hear, he inferreth and that out of Scripture, that the Spirit is the <hi>prime and principal leader</hi>; &amp; thus, maketh the Principal Cause and the Rule all one: He reasoneth like one; that would prove that the winde was both the Principal mover of the Shipe, and also the Compasse by which the skipper was to steer his course; or like one that would prove that the Master was the principal leader of the hand of the writting Scholar, &amp; then would prove that he were the principal copie too, after the example of which the Scholar was to write, &amp; which he was to eye, while drawing &amp; framing of the letters. Who seeth not what a vast difference is here? Supposeth he that there is no difference here? can he be so blinde as not to see it? What I pray, can be expected of such as found their fabrick, upon such a ground of confusion, but a Babel?</p>
               <p n="20">20. Moreover, if we consider the scope he driveth at, we will finde yet more, and more intolerable Confusion: for his maine purpose is to Evince, that the Revelations and inspirations, which he and the rest of the <hi>Quakers</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto; or that light within, of which we will heare him afterwards talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is to be preferred, as the more Primary and Principal Rule, unto the Scriptures, which, at most, are but a Secondary, Subordinat and Inadequate Rule to him, as we have heard. Now, if he think to prove this by what he here saith, it is obvious and palpable, that he maketh the Spirit, from whom the Scriptures did proceed, to be all one with the Revelations, which they pretend unto; or with the Light with in, which he and they so much magnifie and cry up: Otherwise all that he here saith is to no purpose, and he but <hi>reasoneth from the club to the corner,</hi> as we say. Is that Light within, or are the Revelations the increated Spirit? Then we may judge, what thoughts he must have of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and doubt, whether he can look upon the Spirit, as the true and living God; or clear himself of wicked <hi>Socinianisme,</hi> when he thus maketh him the same with a creature; as the Revelation, or the Light within must needs be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66147:44"/>
Or will he say, that the Light within him is really and indeed the increated Spirit? this must be blasphemy with a witness; and they must be looked upon, as notorious Blasphemers and idolaters; and this must be heard with horrour, and needeth no other Confutation.</p>
               <p n="21">21. He would do well to show us, how we shall understand the Spirits being a Rule unto us. Can we imagine, that he is a Rule to us any other way, than by Revealing his Will, giving us Lawes, proposeing Rules, all Obligeing us to Faith and Obedience? and is not the Rule proposed and laid downe to us by the Spirit, Inspireing Instruments to write it, our Principal and Original Rule? was not the Law, given out by Gods owne voice, on mount Sinai, a Principal and original Rule unto the jewes? How or what way is God, or can he be a Rule unto people of Faith and Manners, but by declareing His Minde, in making or proposeing (by vive Voice, or by Inward Inspirations, Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or by Dreames, Visions and the like, or by Writting) Lawes, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Rules and Statutes, whereby rational creatures are to regulate both their faith and practice? How was He a Rule to <hi>Adam,</hi> but by proposeing to him a Rule objectively, in the Creation, in his relation to his Maker, and to the other creatures &amp;c. and by imprinting this Law and Rule into his minde, and writting it in his heart; or by giving him a Law by vive voice, saying, <hi>Thou shalt not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil</hi>? How was he a Rule to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when He commanded him to sacrifice his son? was it not by enjoyning him, by an express Command? If he knoweth any other way, how the Spirit is to be looked upon, as a Principal and Original Rule, he would do will to acquant us with it. And if no other way be conceiveable, we see the Impertinency of his Argueing; as if one should say The Statutes and Lawes of a Land, are to be Obeyed by the Subjects, because they proceed from the Supream Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Therefore the Supreme Legislator himself is more their Rule and Law: for <hi>propter quod unumquodque est tale, illud ipsum est magis tale.</hi> Is not this nobly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued? and is not our <hi>Quakers</hi> Philosophy very quick? and yet a person, that never learned logick, can smile at this, and tell him, that the Supream Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator neither is, nor can be any other way, a Rule to Subjects, but by making Lawes; and these Lawes are a principal Rule to them, as his Subjects.</p>
               <p n="22">22. It might be noted, that by his latine <hi>Igitur etiam Spiritus magis originaliter,</hi> &amp;c. the Scriptures are acknowledged to be also Originally and Principally a Rule; only the Spirit is more Originally and more Principally the Rule. But to wave the darkness or ambiguity of this expression, we shall accept what he here seemeth to grant, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scripture is an Original and Principal Rule: And hence inferre; Therefore it is to be preferred to all Inferiour Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Inspirations, which he and others pretend unto: But if by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit here, he meaneth these Revelations and Inward Inspirations, and therefore he accounteth these the more Original and Principal Rule, and not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he must give us some reason, why he judgeth the Revelations, which he hath, or pretendeth unto, to be more Originally and Principally the Rule, than the Revelations, which are contained in the Scriptures, and by which the Scriptures were given out. Againe, he must shew us a Reason, why the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66147:44"/>
Revelations, which he pretendeth unto, should be called, or accounted one with the Spirit himself, more than these Revelations, by which the Scriptures were dictate.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Before we proceed, we must take notice of one thing further, in his <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</hi> There he tels us, that <hi>the Scriptures themselves testifie, that the Spirit is that Rector or guide, who is given to the Saints, by whom they are to be led in all truth</hi>: And then inferreth, that <hi>Therefore, according to the Scriptures, the Spirit is the prime and principal leader.</hi> And this is very true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but maketh nothing for his Cause: yea it militateth against him; for I would ask, whether he beleeveth this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Scripture, or not? If not, why maketh he thus use of it as an Argument? Is he of the same minde with other <hi>Quakers,</hi> who as Mr <hi>Hicks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth <hi>Dial.</hi> 1. P. 24, 25. speak thus. <hi>Thou mistakest us, we owne not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be our Rule: And whereas thou hast said many things to render us guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning this in others, whilst we ourselves seemingly allow it to be so, which is but thine own imagination: for when we make use of the Scriptures, it is only to quiet and stop their clamours, that plead for it, as their Rule: But for us, had the Scriptures never been, we could have known what is therein contained.</hi> And againe <hi>Pag.</hi> 48.49. <hi>dost thou deny perfection attainable in this life? Is any point more plainly asserted then this,</hi> (NB.) <hi>in that, which thou callest thy Rule, the Scriptures?—not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I owne it to be so, but thou dost, and I would convince thee by them—dost not thou call the Scriptures the word of God, and thy Rule—I wonder thou should insist so much upon this, since I have told thee, I owne it not as the Rule, only I would convince thee by it.</hi> If he be of this judgment, he could not with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science adduce this Argument, where he is thetically laying downe and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the grounds of his Faith. But if he be of another judgment, and beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this to be true, I would ask againe. Upon what ground? Is it because the Scriptures speak thus; or because the Light within him, or a second Testimony or Inspiration saith, that this is Truth? If this <hi>last</hi> be his meaning, he cannot say, that the Scriptures give this testimony, but that the Spirit, distinct from that Spirit which speaketh in the Scriptures, giveth this testimony; for if this distinct testimony did not speak, the Spirit speaking in the Scriptures should say nothing, or what he said should be of no value. Nor can he say, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures; but according to the Spirit speaking in him, which is distinct and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Observation may serve, once for all, both as to his <hi>Thesis,</hi> and <hi>Apology,</hi> where he citeth not a few passages of Scripture, to confirme what he saith; as we have seen, and shall see further, but with what

consonancy to his Principles, I see not. As to the thing it self, which here he saith the Scriptures confirme, we judge it a Truth, worthy of all acceptance; But I much questione, if his and our meaning be the same, Partly because of what is said, and partly because of what followeth immediatly, in his <hi>Thesis</hi>: I shall only ask him: How doth the Spirit lead his people into all truth? Is it by new Immediat Inspirations and Revelations; or is it by clearing up the Rule of the word, by Ministers and meanes by God appointed, Illuminating their eyes to understand it, and by the Influences of his grace causing them Beleeve and Obey the same? If this <hi>last</hi> be granted, we have what we desire, and his cause is destroyed; for then the Scriptures are our Only and Primary Rule. If the <hi>first</hi> be alleiged, then the Spirit by a new Immediat Revelation leadeth him into this truth, <hi>to wit,</hi> That the Spirit leadeth into all truth; and consequently, the ground of the faith of this, is not the testimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; as he seemeth here to say.</p>

(3.) If we under the <hi>New Test.</hi> must have no written Rule, why did Christ Inspire his Apostles to write to Churches, under the <hi>New Testam.</hi> and give them legible letters to Read, and to conforme their Faith and Practice unto? why did <hi>Luk</hi> write, that <hi>we might know the certanety Luk</hi> 1:4. Why did <hi>Iohn</hi> write, that we <hi>might beleeve, and beleeving might have</hi> life? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.31. Why did Christ by his servant <hi>Iohn</hi> write legible letters to the Churches in <hi>asia? Revel</hi> 1:1, 3, 4, Were all these Killing Letters? were these Letters of Condemnation? (4.) why doth this man prove his Assertions, or at least endeavour to prove them, by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the new Testament Scriptures? But it is usual with him, both to Speak and to Act, contradictory to himself and his Principles. Doth he not even here cite new Testament Scriptures <hi>Rom.</hi> 6:14. and 8:2. and 10:8. with <hi>act.</hi> 20:32? (5.) we know, that the Law of God, separated from and opposed to Christ, (as several in the Apostolick dayes were seeking to do) is but a killing letter, as the Gospel is also, when abused to the excluding of Christ: and that in the <hi>New Test.</hi> there is a clearer Manifestation of Christ, as the End of the Law, and as Life, than was under the Law; and we know, that Christ by his Spirit writteth his Law in the hearts of his children, by giving them a Spiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Obedience, and this he did also to his owne, under the Law; and all this without annulling the Letter of the Law, as a Rule; as we have showne

And yet the External Law taught him this, otherwise he citeth this passage, with an evil conscience; but <hi>Grace</hi> there is not taken for a Rule; but for that Spiritual Assistence, whereby we are enabled to withstand Corruption, and so to be more conformed Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and Inwardly unto the Law; and for the Gospel dispensation, wherein grace is promised and secured, in and through the Mediator, to help in time of need, to more Conformity unto the revealed will of God. But by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can he take <hi>Grace,</hi> here and <hi>Act.</hi> 20:32. for Immediat Revelations? The grace of Christ and the power of his Spirit, in regard of that Efficacy it hath, to Restraine from sin, and to Constraine sweetly unto duty, is assimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto a Law, the native End and Designe whereof is this, <hi>Rom</hi> 8:2. for thereby his children are Effectually and Efficiently delivered from the Tyranny and Power of Sin and Death. So that this man knoweth not what he saith, when he would reason thus against the Scriptures, as our Rule; for the Apostle in that same <hi>Epistle Chap.</hi> 13.9. urgeth the very decalogue, as a binding Law, and in several other places of the same <hi>Epistle,</hi> citeth passages out of the old <hi>Test.</hi> not only to Confirme his Doctrine, but to Enforce Duty: yea he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tels us, that the very Scriptures of the <hi>Old Test.</hi> are of this use unto us. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15:4.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Before we proceed, and examine what he saith against the Perfection of the Scriptures, in the following <hi>Pages,</hi> we would first vindicate some Grounds of our owneing of it, as our Rule, which he mentioneth afterward; and also, in the first place clear it to be so, from other Grounds, which he taketh no notice of: And in all this, we have this Advantage, that he hath already granted the Scriptures to be of divine Inspiration, and of Immediat Revelation, and to be the Scriptures of Truth; and so, without manifest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of what he hath said, and Contradicting of what he hath granted, he cannot but assent to all, which these Scriptures of truth say, as truth, and as unquestionable truth: wherefore, if they shall give testimony to their being our Rule, above any thing, that men may fancie as a Rule, the testimony must be true, and we must, without further debate, Acquiesce therein; and while he doth dispute to the contrary, he calleth in question their Truth, and in effect controleth their Truth and Authority. Let us see then, what they say of themselves, as to this? That parable, which Christ adduceth <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. speaketh faire for what we say; for who would not think, that one riseing from the dead should be hearkened to and beleeved, above all? who would doubt of the divine authority of his Message, especially when calling for Repentance? who could think, that such an One so comeing, and that with such a message: were not to be received, as cloathed with divine authority? And yet we see, by <hi>Abraham's</hi> answere, in the parable; that <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets are to be preferred; so that if the testimony of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, that is, of the writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, could not to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with a miracle, would be Ineffectual. Shall we then think, that this word, preferable to such a testimony, as every one would think were unquestionable, should not be rested upon, as our Supream Rule? will any think it reasonable, that we leave this, and betake ourselves to private Inspirations and Revelations, as a Superiour, more Sure, and Full Rule, and Declaration of the Minde of God, concerning Faith and Manners, when all men must see, that they come far short, in point of Light and Certainty, unto the testimony of One risen from the dead; beside that we know not, by any infallible toaken, out of what airth they come? Sure, this should be Madness and Folly.</p>

Further, when the Apostle is pressing <hi>Timothy</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:16, &amp;c. to sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness in the truth, and to a progress and continuance in the work of the Gospel, he assureth him, that the Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sure had the Spirit been, in his judgment, a Superiour and more adequate Rule, he had never attributed all this unto the Scriptures; and that without all exeption of one thing or other. So that place of <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:18, 19, 20, 21. evinceth the matter beyond a contradiction: for what can be more ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If modesty will not suffer them to be so bold, let them then forbeare to preferre their Fancies, in point of Rule, unto the Scriptures.

To this he saith, <hi>we have not proven, that by the Law and Testimony is meaned the Scriptures.</hi> As if any, that ever read the Bible, could be ignorant, what is all along meaned by these words. But granting this, he hath another reserve viz. <hi>That the Law was in a more special manner given to the jewes, and more principally, than to us.</hi> And hence forsooth, he will retort the Argument against us, thus, <hi>Seing they who were under the Old Covenant were to try all by the outward Law, we, who are under the new Covenant, are to try all by the word of faith, which is within us.</hi> And thus the man rants in his reaving, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting what was the great pillar of his discourse, upon the preceeding <hi>Thesis</hi>; and making differences without ground, as we lately manifested; and with all destroying by his owne expressions, what he mainly intendeth: For the Word of Faith, that he speaketh of, is distinct from Immediat Revelations, and these words, which he eyeth, cited by <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 10. were spoken to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under the Law by <hi>Moses Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> 14. and so were true of them even then. Hereby also he proveth more than he ought; for if this Argument hold, the Scriptures shall not be so much as a Lesse Principal and Subordinat Rule, which yet he granted it to be; or he must say, the case is so altered under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> that what was a Principal Rule then, is now only subordinat: but whence will this be Evinced? And will it not hence appear probable, that what is now Principal to us was Less Principal to them, that is, the Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Testimony of the Spirit? Let the man rid his feet here, if he can: as for the 70 Version, we have nothing to do with it. if he will lay any weight upon such a corrupt Version, he should not challenge other versions, that agree better with the Original.

And sure in this mans judgment, they must be more a Rule to <hi>Quakers,</hi> then to any others; for these only are men of God, with him.

His saying that the Instance, which he hath adduced, is a matter of greater moment, will not helpe the matter, for, if he will, I shall prove to him, that in the least of these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars I have hinted, he can sinne against God; and that is enough, by his owne confession here, to render the matter momentous. (2) To him, it is true, who denieth the Ministrie it self, its Work and Exercise, it cannot be that the Scriptures should Regulate particular persons, in their taking on of the Office, and in the Exercise thereof: But to us, who owne this, as an Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, and shall in due place vindicate it from his Exceptions, there is no Impossibility in the matter: For we can prove from Scripture (and shall do it, in due time, and place) that there is such a standing Ordinance in the New Testament. That there is an established Order, whereby persons shall be duely Invested with the Office: That there are certaine Qualifications requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Person, who is to be admitted to the Office: That there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring an inward Work of the Spirit, inclineing the man, whom the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, unto this Office, upon pure and spiritual grounds, and motives, and for holy and heavenly ends; and this may be cleared also out of Scripture: Ther<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And in this, the Lord may think good to consult the weakness of such well meaning persons, who cannot see that in the Rule of the Scriptures, as particularly applicable to their case, which Others, more mighty in the Scriptures, and of more spiritual sharpnesse, would easily discover. All which tendeth to the Confirmation of the Fulness and Perfection of the Rule; and no way to the crying-up and owneing of Inward and Immediat Revelations, to the disparagment of the Law of the Lord, which is Perfect. Matters than being thus, &amp; the Scripture-Rule able to regulate, as a Rule, when studied and wisely improven, in all the particulars by him mentioned, as might be showne: (Nay more, might by shown, that the Scripture can sufficiently Regulat the Christian deportment of every servant maide, as to the very sweeping of the house) how much more shall it be sufficient, to Regulat a Minister, the Man of God, as to all his Deportment in the house of God? What needs more to shame this effronted man, than to recommend to his serious thoughts, (if he will do this upon my Recommendation, without a new and distinct Revelation) the study of these words of <hi>Paul,</hi> already cited 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:16, 1—.<hi>All Scripture is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable &amp;c.—that the man of God may be perfect,</hi> perfected, <hi>or thorowly furnished to all good works.</hi> If this be true (and I doubt he hath the forehead yet, to say otherwayes) he may see <hi>Paul</hi> here answering all his Instances, and telling him, that his Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not true, And if he will not beleeve <hi>Paul,</hi> immediatly Inspired, it were unreasonable in us, to expect, that our more particular confronting his alleiged Instances out of Scripture, should prevaile with him: and, as for Others, who rest satisfied with the Testimony of the Apostle, it were needless for us, upon this light occasion, to digresse further unto a scriptural discovery of these things. Thus then we might have dismissed him; But for further satisfaction, to the Reader, we shall goe on, and see what he saith more:</p>
               <p n="32">32.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66147:50"/>
wait upon it, and performe their work; according to the proportion of faith; and such as are called to Ministry and to Giving, should wait upon it, and do it with simplicity &amp; cheerfulnesse; and these who are called to Rule, should do it with diligence. Could not the man read this in the text? But he would say. The Scriptures say not that <hi>Iohn, Iames</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> should take on this, or that Office, Nor (say I) is this required of a Rule, as such, But how <hi>Iames, Iohn</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> shall know by the Scriptures, that God calleth them to this or that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, I have showne above.</p>

Thus the man, in stricking at us, woundeth himself. But what in case any of these persons kill a man, what would the Law of the land do unto them? would it punish them? I think the Law of the Lord should warrand them, if they did right. And shall the Law of a Land reach persons, that cannot make use of it; and God's Law not? What use can Children, or Mad men, or Idiots make of the Light within? As for deaf persons they have Natures light, and that is part of God's Law; and if they have eyes, they can see many things, that may instruct them; though they cannot read the Bible, which was never penned for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat use, nor yet for the use of Infants and Idiots. But the saying that God can, and when he will doth, supply the want of Scripture, as of other of his Appointments &amp; Ordinances, in these extraordinary cases, can be no impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either of the Usefulness or Perfection of the Scriptures. Our <hi>Quakers</hi> will account their books and exhortations useful, if not necessary; and yet he shall hardly perswade me, that deafe Persons, or infants, or idiots can make any good use of them.</p>

But it is like, we must first turne <hi>Quakers</hi>; and then, it is true, we shall have the gordian knot, not loosed, but cut in pieces; for we shall lay aside the Scriptures, as useless altogether, and so need not trouble ourselves with those difficulties; but leave them as bones for dogs, to whet their teeth upon. One instance of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of their Revelations he giveth, of some of their number, who could not so much as read; and yet could discover corruptions, in our version of the Bible.

Yet this remaineth fixed among them, That the Scriptures are not made use of in their Assemblies: It is below them, to Expound any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it there, or to adduce any Testimony there from, for Confirmation of their Assertions, whatever they do, when speaking and writing to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ground their faith upon the Scriptures. And by this Man we learn, that their Opinion yet is, That the Scriptures are not our Perfect, Sufficient, Fixed and Ordinary Rule, whereby we shall know, what is our duty before God: But that we must be ruled in our walk by Immediat Revelations of the Spirit, as these were who wrote the Scriptures. And it is their constant Opinion (and if this man be of another Judgment, we shall know, when we come to heare what he saith of the Light within) that when one cometh to hearken to the Light within, he hath obtained the whole end of the Scriptures, so that they become wholly Useless to him.</p>

Or that he was not so Good and Gracious as to do it? I dar say Neither. Nay this book of the Scriptures is a called a <hi>Testament,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:6, 14. And who dar adde to God's Testament, when it is unlawful to adde to a mans Testament, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4:15?

                  </gap>husiasmes, which we know neither whither they go, nor whence they come: and let them speak never so highly of their Revelations, we judge by their doctrine, which is, for the most part, either False, or Dubious, and not consonant to the Scriptures of truth. We have heard of Impostors, who were the greatest of Pretenders, as of <hi>Simon Magus, Act.</hi> 8. of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> of several in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others; we have heard also of false Prophets, of old; and Christ hath foretold us of such, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. &amp; 24:24. and hath bid us beware of them. Are we assured, that the devil cannot, or shall not play his game under these Enthusiasmes? One thing is certane, that the Lord sendeth us not to these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasmes, to understand his Minde; but to the Law and to the Testimony, and to the more sure Word of Prophecie. One thing I would know; Whether he beleeveth, that Christ and his Apostles did teach all that was necessary to salvation? I suppose, he will not deny it, considering, what <hi>Paul</hi> alone saith <hi>Act.</hi> 20:20, 21, 27. If he confess it; then I would ask, whether we have not the summe of that doctrine, faithfully set downe to us in the Scriptures? This cannot rationally be denyed, seing <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he taught nothing, but what was foretold by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Act.</hi> 26:22. and seing, hence it would follow, that God was not so careful of the Church of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> as he was of the Church of the <hi>Old Test.</hi> nor so careful of us, as of the Primitive Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither let any say, that we have Revelations now to make up our want; For, beside that we know no warrand for us to look for such, in the primitive times, there were Persons extraordinarily Inspired, having Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, notwithstanding of which, there was a full and compleet declaration of all that was necessary to Salvation. Againe why did the Lord commit any thing to write, seing he would not commit his whole Counsel unto write? Why would he not leave us wholly to Revelations? It may be, the <hi>Quakers</hi> will say, that we are indeed left wholly to Revelations. And this is the true tendency of this Mans doctrine. But, then, of what use are the Scriptures? Can he loose this knot, and give satisfaction?</p>

So that the Scriptures are but like their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings one to another, tending to Comfort and Encourage one another: who are delighted (as he speaketh) with the words or writings, that come from the same Spirit in another: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, They containe only some profitable Admonitions.

Thinks he, that the Appointments of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ cannot be owned, as meanes, perfect in their kinde, and for their end; but the Spirit as a Principal Efficient Cause must be enjured? and that we must lay aside the Scriptures, as a Law and Rule, that the Spirit may do all, and have all the glory; I should then think, that he were more to be prayed for, than disputed with: and were it not for satisfaction to Others, whom their faire speaches may deceive, I should think it hardly worth my paines to blot so much paper, in confutation of him.</p>
               <p n="42">42. Then in the next place, he tels us, that <hi>the Lord would have us see in them</hi> (that is, in the Scriptures) <hi>as in a glase, the conditions and experiences of old saints, that observing their case and ours to agree, we may be confirmed, comforted, instructed in righteousness; and by the Spirit within us, observing the signature of the Spirit in them, we may see them fulfilled in us. Hence only the Spiritual man of God can profite by them, and of such speaketh the Apostle also Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>others pervert them as Peter tels us.</hi> By all which we see, That the Scriptures are no Law, or Rule, no not a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Rule, or Law; for what is such, must have some Obligeing force with it, binding us to conform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the <hi>Quakers</hi> join hands with the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> (that they may become a perfect Sinke of all errours.)

He seemeth to grant much concerning the Scriptures, when he saith <hi>They account them the most fit outward judge of controversies among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and what ever doctrine is contrary to them should be accounted heresie &amp;c.</hi> But, (howbeit we accept what is granted, and are content to try their doctrine by this judge, &amp; have done so hithertill; &amp; accordingly must reject their doctrine, as damnable heresie; and will finde more cause hereafter, to continue in this our judgment; yet) we cannot but take notice, That they are driven to this necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by urgency of their Adversaries; and that they know of a refuge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for they are perswaded (as we may suppose) the Spirit within them, is the very same with the Spirit speaking in the Scriptures; and he cannot in them contradict what he hath said, in the Scriptures; And if any discrepancy or contradiction be, it is but in appearance, and that unto the blinde Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of a Natural Man (as he speaketh afterward) that is, it but seemeth so to all that are not <hi>Quakers</hi>: and so, notwithstanding of this, it is no real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, let the appearance be never so great: So that it is not possible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of any mistake, out of the Scriptures; for the Spirit speaking within them, cannot speak contrary thereto. And further this is to be observed, that for all this, the Scriptures are no Rule, no Law, having any force upon our Consciences to Obedience; No man is to learne any Truth or Doctrine out of them. And thus they take away both Law and Gospel, the Scriptures both of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66147:54"/>
the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New. Testament,</hi> as a Law, upon which we are to meditate day and night; and which we are to make the men of our counsel; and to propose to ourselves as a copy, unto which we are to conforme our way and walk: and this is to destroy their main end, which is to make us wise unto Salvation; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the soul; and to hold forth to us the whole counsel of God, concerning Faith and Manners.</p>

He frameth an Objection against his owne doctrine, to this purpose; If the Scriptures be not our chiefe, only and adequate Rule, it is no compleet canon; and men, who pretend to be acted by the Spirit, may adde new Scriptures; and so incurre the curse denunced against such; &amp; they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a new Gospel; I should rather have framed the Objection thus. If his doctrine be true, the Scriptures are no Rule, or canon at all; and we are as much obliged to beleeve and Obey the dreames and dictats of phantastick <hi>Quakers,</hi> as the Scriptures. And how absurd this is, every one may judge But let us see, what he Replieth. He granteth <hi>that all false Revelations, which are contrary to the Scriptures, are to be disclamed.</hi> This is well, and therefore we reject, with his warrand, his Revelations, as false: But he will deny, that his Revelations are false; because the Spirit within him, which is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, and the same Spirit, that inspired the Prophets, and Apostles, saith, they are true, yea they cannot but be true, because proceeding from that Spirit, that can reveal nothing but truth: and thus we are no more secured then we were: yea, as I said, we are obliged to beleeve all that they say; and rather to lay aside our Iudgment and all Sense of Scripture truths, than once doubt or question the truth of what they deliver, <hi>Next,</hi> he saith, <hi>The doctrine he hath delivered is true, and therefore who adduce such consequences, accuse Christ and his Apostles.</hi> This is but a manifest declaration of his Pride and Presumption: His doctrine is tryed and found light, and Contradictory to Christ, his Prophets, and Apostles; yea and Eversive of all Christianity and Religion. <hi>We grant,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the Scriptures give ample testimony, to the chiefe doctrines of christianity.</hi> And what a reproach of the Scriptures, this concession containeth, we have showne above. <hi>We are,</hi> saith he, <hi>for no new Gospel, but for new revelations of the old Gospel.</hi> The Gospel, which Christ and his Apostles brought, was but a new Revelation of the old Gospel, and no new Gospel essentially different from the old dispensation; Thus their Revelation, may be as new and as far different from that of Christ and his Apostles, as theirs was from what was under the Old dispensation; and yet it must be received with the same Faith &amp; Obedience, that we receive the Revelation of Christ and his Apostles, is this tolerable? Thinks this man, that we are as mad, as he and his brethren are? Be it known to him, we will hold by the old foundation Christ, and the sole Revelation, which He hath given us; for sad experience hath taught the world, what devilish doctrine hath been vented under the notion of New Revelations, such as these by the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> at <hi>Munster,</hi> and by <hi>Paracelsus, Weigelius</hi> and others, <hi>That a man might have moe wives at once: That the Eternal God hath flesh: That God made to himself out of himself, a Wife, on whom he begot a Son: That God careth not for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66147:54"/>
outward sins: That the literal sense of the Scripture is antichristian: That our Christ is the Antichrist; and the Man of sin: That Christ was not born of Mary: our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is a profane thing: adamitick flesh is not capable of remission? Hearing of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and coming to the sacraments are impediments of Regeneration: There should be no preaching in Templos: Hell is Heaven, and Heaven is Hell, and both are one.</hi> What thinketh he of these, and of the blasphemies of <hi>David Georg,</hi> who said. <hi>That the doctrine of Moses, of the Apostles, yea and of Christ himself, was Imperfect, and unable to bring any to salvation; only his doctrine was perfect and efficacious for that end. That he was the true Christ and the Messias, born not of flesh, but of the holy ghost, and of the Spirit of Iesus; which Spirit of Christ, his flesh being annihilated, was wholly given to him. That he can save and condemne, &amp; that he shall judge the whole world, at the last day. That he is greater than Christ, who in the flesh was borne of a woman, but he himself was the Spiritual Christ borne of Holy Ghost</hi>? These had as much to say for their Revelations, as he hath to say for his; and if we open the door once unto such Pretenders, we way see, what will be the issue: it may be called at first but a New, more Glorious, more Excellent Revelation, and may come at length to be a quite Overturning of the Old Gospel too. Therefore we judge it the best course, to keep the door closse, which Christ hath shut, and not to receive his abominations.</p>
               <p n="45">45. He <hi>will not grant, that the Scriptures are a compleet Canon</hi>; and if they be not a Compleet Canon, they are no Canon at all; for a Rule and that which is to be Regulated thereby are Relatives, and must correspond: yet he thinks <hi>we must confesse what he saith to be true</hi>: and why so? <hi>Because in all the Scripture, we read not this necessary article of faith That these books are only canonick Scripture.</hi> But this is no new Revelation, for it was revealed long since to <hi>Bellarmine, de Verbo Dei Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. and to other <hi>Papists</hi>: and so this man is but playing their game: and yet neither he, nor they can gaine any thing; for this necessary article of faith, is declared by the whole Scripture; and so needeth not be set down, in so many words. The characters of Divine Light and Power, which are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Scriptures, do discriminate them from all Others; and so declare themselves, and themselves only, to be the Word and Law of God; and more is needless; for it is not a Rule to it self but to other things; no discipline or Science prove their own principles, Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, if this man be of the same judgment with these mentioned, we may saifly conceive, or conjecture at least, that his meaning in these words now under consideration, is this. That the Body of man, which is of the First and Earthly <hi>Adam,</hi> was degenerat, and became dead; but not the Soul, which, being a part of God's substance and being, and having relation to the Second and Spiritual <hi>Adam,</hi> who is the Bishop thereof, was not obnoxious to this Death and Degeneration; for being eternal, as well as Infinite, it could neither die, nor degenerate, nor fall. But how blasphemous an opinion this is, every one may see. This is the old damnable opinion of the <hi>Gnosticks, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> and <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> and of <hi>Cerdo,</hi> See <hi>August. Lib. de Origine Animae</hi> c. 2. and <hi>De Haeres.</hi> c. 46. and 70. <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1. q. 90.

Survey of Spiritual Antichrist. Chap.</hi> XIV. These hold that the soul was a part of God's essence. Though God's essence be most Pure, Simple and Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and cannot be a part of any composed thing. If the Soul were thus of God and a part of God, God should be the forme of man; Because the soul is the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66147:56"/>
and that there is no shadow of turning with Him; but by this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he should be Mutable, and change from Power to Act, from Ignorance to Knowledge, from Vice to Vertue, &amp;c. and back againe reciprocally. Hence also it must follow, that either no souls can go to hell, or that a part of God must be tormented in hell; And what will they say of Devils? Either they must deny that there are any, or say that they are a part of God; for they are Spiritual Substances, being Intelligences: and with the <hi>Quakers</hi> foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, spiritual substances are parts of God, and are Infinite in themselves, they are no Creatures, and if no Creatures, they must be the Creator, or a part of the Creator. It is true, Man was created, according to the Image of God, which, as to the Soul, consisted, as in the spirituality of its substance, so chiefly in Wisdome, Righteousness and Holiness, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7:29. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4:24. <hi>Col</hi> 3:10, But the Scripture tels us, that as to this Image, it was lost, even as to knowledg, nothing being left but some rubbish of that once stately Fabrick, of which afterward: and that thus the soul was corrupted and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the fall, all the Powers and Faculties thereof being perverted; so that thereby Man became not only utterly Indisposed, but also Opposite to all that is spiritually good, and wholly Inclined to all evil and that continually, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: <hi>vers.</hi> 10—20. <hi>Ehes.</hi> 2:2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:6. &amp; 8:7, 8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6:5: And this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by what this Man addeth, in the <hi>Thesis,</hi> and prosecuteth at large, in his <hi>Apology.</hi>

His expression here, <hi>in respect of the first Adam and terrestrial man,</hi> would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, That <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, or in the state of Integrity, had also a respect to the Second Adam, and Celestial man; and that as to this, he stood, and lived, and did not become degenerate: and hence it would follow, that <hi>Adam</hi> was under two Covenants, both under the covenant of Works, and under the Covenant of Grace; and that he fell, as to the Covenant of works; but stood as to the Covenant of Grace, But these things smell neither of Sense, nor of Religion. If he thinks, that I wrong him, in deduceing such Consectaries from his words, he must blame himself, that doth not express himself more clearly, and doth not speak in a language more intelligible. His doctrine, I confess, is strange; and his expressions are not ordinary; but it seemeth, an uncouth doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine must be expressed in an uncouth dialect: that unstable souls, that have not their senses exercised to discerne good and evil, may be taken herewith; but such as are wise, and feare the Lord, will look about them.</p>

He hath three general expressions, whereby he would point forth unto us the nature of this Change and Catastrophe, when he saith, that Mankinde is <hi>Fallen,</hi> is <hi>Degenerat,</hi> is <hi>Dead</hi>; and a right explication of his meaning hereby, and of his sense of these words, would give great satisfaction and clearness. It may be his following expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are added as a commentary; let us therefore consider them. <hi>Being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the sense or touch of this inward Testimony and Seed of God; and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the power of Nature, and Seed of Satan, which he did sowe into the hearts of men, while they remaine in the natural and corrupt state.</hi> Could we understand this commentary, we should be in better case, to judge of his sense of the Fall: but the truth is, these words rather darken, than cleare the matter: and I fear, the words are not more uncouth and unusual, than the thing, he understandeth thereby, is obstruse and hid. He speaketh here of a <hi>Testimony,</hi> saying <hi>the sense or touch of this Testimony;</hi> and the relative <hi>this, hujus</hi> (if pertinent,) saith, it is a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, formerly by him mentioned; but where, or when, we are left to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture He calleth it <hi>an Inward Testimony,</hi> but what is this? It is true, in the foregoing <hi>Thesis,</hi> we heard him speaking of <hi>an Inward Testimony of the Spirit,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:66147:58"/>
and in his second <hi>Thesis,</hi> of <hi>Inward Revelations and Illuminations</hi>: Shall I think, that by <hi>this Testimony,</hi> whereof he here speaketh, he meaneth the <hi>Inward Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Inward Revelations and Illuminations,</hi> of which he spoke above? If indeed he doth meane the same, and no other; I would faine know, How all Mankinde, Jewes and Heathens, (as he speaketh) was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the sense and touch of this Inward Testimony; seing himself told us above <hi>Thesis</hi> 2. that by this Inward Testimony or Revelation, and only by this, the knowledge of God was revealed to the Sones of Men, to the Patria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is there a difference with them, betwixt this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Testimony</hi> and that <hi>Light, which enlighteneth every man, that cometh into the world</hi>?

And when all that knew God, received illumination by the Testimony of the Spirit, did they not receive its Information, and its Touch? and were they not made partakers of its Sensation? and seing this was common to all from the beginning, as he endeavoured to prove above, as we heard, where was this deprivation of this sense and touch, which he speaketh o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Meaneth he by this Touch &amp; Sensation a Reflective knowledge, or such a reflexive act of the Soul or of Conscience, whereby we know that we know?

And thus we see, that this man, among other Errours, hath drunk-in the errour of <hi>Flacius Illyricus,</hi> who said, that the image of God, and Original righteousness, was a <hi>Substance,</hi> and an <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> in <hi>Demonstr.</hi> Fol 21. and 38. and 40. as also that Original sin, was not an <hi>accident</hi> but a <hi>substance:</hi> and so this man, and his party, must revive again the old condemned opinion or errour of the wicked <hi>Manichees,</hi> who affirmed that there were <hi>two Principia.</hi> Now either this Man must say, that this Seed of Satan, being a Substance, must be of God, or of the Devil: if of God, then God must be the Author and Creator of sin; if of the Devil, than the Devil is the creator of some substances. But I would enquire, whether this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which he calleth the Seed of the Serpent, be one and the same thing, with the Man, or with his Soul and Body; or not: If not: then the Man must have another Substantial and Essential part, beside the Soul and the Body; which is contrary both to Scripture and Reason: If it be the same thing, then <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall had the Seed of Satan in him, for he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Took he upon him Original sin? or came he under the power of the Seed of he Serpent? And yet this must be said, or we must say he took not upon him the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>: or that the soul and body of the Seed <hi>Abraham</hi> was not original sin? and so that Original sin is not the same substance with Mans soul and body.</p>

For if Infants must first actually sinne, before Satan sowe this seed, in their hearts, then it is false, that all actually sinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Satan can sowe his seed in their hearts; then it is false, that all actual sinnes proceed from this corrupt seed; for the Cause cannot proceed from, nor yet follow the Effect.

If only <hi>by nature,</hi> then the divine Seed was idle and useless; and then why, and for what ends, had he this divine Seed? If <hi>by the divine Seed,</hi> then the fall caused no change, for this divine Seed remained, and remained Operative, and man by it did good. One thing further I would observe. Here he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that persons in nature can do good, by vertue of the seed of God, and in so far as they do good by the seed of God, or divine seed, they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Sense and Touches of the Seed of God; and yet he told us, in the beginning of his <hi>Thesis,</hi> That all the posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> was deprived of the sense and touch of the divine seed: I know not how he shall liberate himself of this Contradiction unless he say that, howbeit the good, that a natural man doth, proceed from the seed of God, yet the man hath no feeling nor Touch of this Seed; and so it is not the Man, but the Seed that worketh, and doth good; and then it will follow, that all that good, which is done by man in nature, is purely and immediatly the work of the Seed of God, and is no Humane Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Divine, wherein the natural man is purely passive, or rather as a shope, in which a Man worketh; and consequently they must be all Perfect, Holy and Divine Actions; and so their actions shall be better, upon many accounts, than the most gracious actions of the truely regenerated children of God, Now let any judge, what this man thinketh of the fall, and of the Natural State of Man..</p>

Shall we think, that God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie against the wicked world, was only this, that howbeit Man did good and much good, by vertue of the Divine Seed that was in him; yet all that good did not proceed from his Nature, and from his owne heart? How absurd is this? And doth <hi>Ieremiah Chap.</hi> 17:9. give any hint of this Exception or Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Doth he say, that the heart of man in it self is deceitful above all things; but not the heart of natural men, as under the touches of the seed of God? Doth <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 3. speaking positively enough of man in his lapsed and corrupt state, make any exception of actions done in them by the divine Seed? Why doth this

Now, what a desperat designe this is, to bring us no further length, than to polished <hi>Heathenisme,</hi> let every Christian judge; and see if the title of my book be not true, <hi>that Quakerisme is the path way to Paganisme</hi>; But the sequel will more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this.</p>

For further manifesting of this wickedness, let us consider what he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth further, <hi>Pag.</hi> 56. toward the end, He bringeth-in this Objection, That the Apostle sayeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 2:14. <hi>that the Gentiles, who had not the Law, did by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the things contained in the Law</hi>: the meaning of which words, as we adduce them, is not to prove (as he falsely here insinuateth, and expresseth) that <hi>such by nature can do that which is good and acceptable, in the sight of God</hi>; but to prove, (as shall be made manifest afterward.) That there are some Notions of God, and of Moral honesty, as relicques of that noble image of God, with which man was endued, at the beginning, left in corrupt man, whereby he, through the dim light of nature, may see something of the Law of nature, pointing out his duty to God, to man, and to himself; and may do, upon the matter, something of that, which the Law of nature requireth; and yet when he hath improven Nature to its yondmost, shall never do that, which is well pleasing in the sight of God, who, since the fall, only accepteth of that, which is done in the strength and grace of Jesus Christ and by one reconciled unto Him, in and through Christ. Let us now see what he Answereth, <hi>This nature</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>neither may nor can be understood,</hi> of mans proper nature, <hi>which is corrupt and fallen; but of</hi> spiritual nature, <hi>which proceeds, from the seed of God, as he hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a new visitation of divine love, and is thereby quickened.</hi> For <hi>answere,</hi> I would know; whether he understandeth this <hi>Spiritual Nature,</hi> of that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Gentiles, or of that which was peculiar to some. If he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that, which is common to all, then, according to his divinity, every heathen, let be, every Christian, hath this Spiritual Nature, and Seed of God, in him, and what good they do, in Natural or Moral actions, proceeth from

this seed of God, and spiritual nature; And consequently, the thoughts of their heart concerning the being of God (which is good, because true, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law writen in every mans heart) must flow from this Principle, and from no other; and so, the devils, who beleeve that there is a God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2:19. must be partaker of this Spiritual Nature and Seed of God, Observe, <hi>Reader,</hi> whither this Mans Religion will bring us, and what the Grace of God, and that Spiritual Nature, is, which this man would lead us unto: Even that, which is common to devils. If he meane that, which is peculiar to some; I would enquire, who these some are? Doth he meane the Gentiles, who were converted by the Gospel, and become Christians? These, we grant, have a spiritual Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but sure, the Apostle is not speaking of such, as the whole scope of his discourse cleareth. If he understand this of the Heathens, who did better improve the light of nature, than others; we know no spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that such have, for all their advancement in Nature: because they are yet out of Christ, whose members only are made partakers of this new spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Nature, according to that Gospel, which we hope to be saved by: And his contrary opinion confirmeth us of their anti-evangelick Principles, and paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish designe.</p>

(2.) Where read we, that any do by nature the things declared in the New Covenant? (3.) How can such, as are under the New Covenant, be said to be without a Law, as these here? (4.)

By this accusing of conscience, <hi>Paul</hi> proveth here, that the Gentiles had the Law in their heart. (10.) He would know, that there is a twofold writing of the Law, in the heart: One is, whereby the knowledge of the Law is so fixed in their mindes, as that it cannot be utterly delet, howbeit their wils cannot and will not comply therewith; and of this the Apostle is here speaking; for the Heathens have this Law of nature so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and fixed in their Mindes, as to several things concerning God, and their carriage and walk in the world, that they cannot but see a difference betwixt Righteousness and Iniquity, Honesty and Dishonesty, in several particulars, and in their judgment preferre the one to the other, though their hearts and wills be not reconciled thereunto, and made to comply therewith, even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Other is whereby the whole will of God, revealed in Law and Gospel, is by the Spirit of God deeply imprinted in the soul of Beleevers, so that, as their Mindes know it, and their Judgments approve it, so their Wills imbrace it with love and desire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their native Endeavour is after Full, Pure, Sincere, and Spiritual conformity thereto, in the strength of the same Spirit; and it is their griefe and matter of unfaigned sorrow, when, through the workings of a remanent body of death, they come short of what is commanded, whether as to Matter or Manner, or End intended &amp;c. If he shall evince, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of this here, he shal do more than all the <hi>Socinians</hi> (no persons else ever dreamed of this) ever have been able to do, to this day; But the truth is, I apprehend, all this is a riddle to this man, who understandeth no other writing of the Law in hearts, than the first: for as he is an enemy, so is he a stranger unto the Gospel of the Grace of God: as will evidently enough appear, ere we have done.</p>

This cannot properly be said to be imputed, but being a just punishment (as well as a sin) of the sin committed by <hi>Adam,</hi> is justly inflicted, by the righteous God, and conveyed from <hi>Adam</hi> to all his posterity, as a leprosy, and infectious disease, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which therefore is seated and subjected in the man, so soon as he hath a being by natural generation, from his immediat parents; though both the guilt, and this contagion, be not received immediatly from our next parents, but immediatly from <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom we have our Nature, as our Personal being from our immediat parents, who stand in no nearer relation to <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Head of Nature, than we, but all, Father, Son and Nephew &amp;c. stand in the same near relation to him, in respect of Nature, as lines to the same centre,</p>

We need not then regaird what he addeth, saying, <hi>that the Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth nor threatneth no man, but him, that hath actually sinned</hi>; for in some sense the Gospel condemneth no man that heareth it, but the final unbeleever; but offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth life &amp; pardon to all, to whom it is preached, of all their sins actual &amp; original, upon condition of accepting of Christ offered therein: And as for the <hi>New Test.</hi> we have seen enough in it already, and will see more, to evince our point, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66147:69"/>
albeit this were not, we Judge that the <hi>Old Test.</hi> could prove the point, as we shall also see. The Gospel moreover tels us, that <hi>except a man be born againe, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God</hi>; and so, that as long as he hath but the first birth, of the flesh, he is under the wrath of God. Infants are not capable of threatnings, but they are capable of death, which we proved, in the preceeding Chapter, to be the punishment of sin.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Nor is that, which followeth, much worth the noticeing, when he sayeth <hi>God will visite the iniquities of the fathers, upon their childeren, who abide in sin, and so homologate and follow thir fathers iniquities:</hi> For there is a vast difference betwixt <hi>Adam's</hi> first sin, and the sinnes of other Parents: <hi>Adam's</hi> first sin, or breach of the Covenant, was not a personal sin, as the sinnes of other Parents are, and his after sins were; but the sin of the whole Nature, whereof he was the Head and Representative; therefore all that partake of that Nature participate of the guilt of Nature; when Infants have a being, they partake of the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> immediatly: and though they have this nature by meanes of generation of their immediat parents, yet they have not this nature from them, but from <hi>Adam,</hi> as I said: And though they have their personality from their immediat parents; yet they do not partake of their Fathers personality, but have their owne; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane personality not being a thing propagable; &amp; therefore they cannot in strick sense be guilty of their parents personal sinnes: And yet, if it were of moment to debate the matter, we might shew from Scripture, how the holy Lord, who is Just &amp; Righteous, punisheth even children for their Fathers faults: and though the children be sometimes found guilty of actual sinnes, and so homologate their Fathers transgression; yet it is not found alwayes to be so. It was not so, I suppose, with the infants of <hi>Careh, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and the rest of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, nor with the Children of <hi>Achan,</hi> nor with the Infants of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and of the Old world; nor with these that were carried away captive by the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and several other instances; to speak nothing of the Children of <hi>Cain, Ismael, Esau,</hi> and of the Jewes, when cut off the Old and Natural stock, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. And further the very expression of God, <hi>Command,</hi> 2. of <hi>visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the Children,</hi> sheweth, that whatever sinnes they may have of their owne; yet it is the fathers guilt, that bringeth on that punishment; else it could not be a visiting of their fathers iniquities; but only of their owne.</p>

He told us just now himself, That God can and doth visite the Iniquities of Fathers on their Children: and how can this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with his goodness and justice, seing their fathers sins are not properly their owne, because they were personal; when he thinketh it Incongruous to God's Iustice and Goodness to impute the sin of Nature, to all that partake of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though it be their owne, by vertue of their partaking of Nature?

But why should this Seed of Sin be more looked upon, as a stranger, so as by vertue thereof they, in whom it is, shall not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted sinners, than the Seed of Grace, of which the Scripture speaketh, and by vertue of which they, in whom it is, are denominated gracious, even when they are not actually exerceing grace?

So that all the posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> young and old, being in <hi>Adam,</hi> their Natural and Federal Head, partake of his sin, having sinned in him; and of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or just punishment of that sin. All this is so clear and manifest, both from the very words and expressions of the Apostle, and from his scope, that who ever speak against this, must do violence to the text, and weaken the Apostles argueings. This same passage did the ancients, <hi>Augustine,</hi> and others, urge against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> as is to be seen in <hi>Vossij histor. Pelag. Pag.</hi> 146, 147. By this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That sin, which is so described to us by the Apostle, that he sayeth is brought death upon all men, that men sinned by it, and were made sinners, even they who could not as yet actually sin, that thereby all became guilty of death and of condemnation, that sin by imputation is the sin of the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, included in <hi>Adam,</hi> and rendereth the whole nature obnoxious to death, and to condemnation. But the first sin of <hi>Adam</hi> is decribed to us by the Apostle &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> That sin is the sin of nature; because <hi>Adam</hi> did sustaine the person of all, who potentially were in his Ioines, and by vertue thereof all are liable to death, the punishment thereof. <hi>Vossius</hi> tels us moreover, that the Ancients took much notice of <hi>Paul's</hi> calling <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>Type,</hi> and of the particle <hi>As</hi>; and did hence gather, that as the Obedience of Christ belongeth to all such, as are spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten, not by Imitation, but by Imputation; so the Disobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> is conveyed, not by Imitation, but by Imputation, unto all such as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally come of him.

death passed upon all men, and reigned, even over Infants; and so supposeth, that Infants had sinned, otherwayes his argument <hi>vers</hi> 12. had been of no value for the Instance of Infants, who are a great part of Mankinde, had destroyed the Apostles reasoning, if they bad not been included under, <hi>all men</hi> (8.)

And thus we see, how this Man perverteth and inverteth the Words, and Arguments, and Scope and All of the Apostle, (12) If death was inflicted on old Persons, because of their actual sins: wherefore was death inflicted upon Infants? Sure the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle maketh no distinction of Deaths; nor doth he speak of distinct causes of Death; but only mentioneth an universal Cause of an universal Effect, sin the cause, and death the effect; and therefore, if the effect come upon infants, the cause must also come upon them; or the Apostle argueth very loosly; and he must impute cruelty &amp; injustice to his Maker (13.) This addition of his to the text, <hi>viz. who were capable of sinning,</hi> is the same that <hi>Castalio</hi> made, saying <hi>these, to wit, who in regaird of age, could have sinned:</hi> And in this, he was no lesse bold with the text, then our <hi>Quaker</hi> is; for as we have seen, and the text is clear, it is not all these only that die, but even such, as come not to that age; and the Apostle alwayes speaks of death, as the wages of sin: And when he here sayeth of Infants, that they sinned not after the similitude of <hi>Adam's</hi> transgression, he clearly intimateth, that they sinned some other way, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> which also the 19. <hi>verse</hi> manifestly proveth.</p>

                     </gap>r ascribed to the parents, than to the Infants; for he sayeth, in sin did my mother conceive me, not, my mother conceived me sinning, Ans.</hi> Is not this a quick observation, and worthy of a <hi>Quaker</hi>? But the misery is, it quite crosseth <hi>Davids</hi> designe. This man must think, that it was a great argument of <hi>Davids</hi> Sorrow and Repentance, to lay iniquity upon his Parents, now, in all appearance, dead; but I should look upon this, as no argument of a true penitent heart. What could his upbraiding of his Father and Mother, after this manner, contribute to the aggravating of his own sin? And that this is <hi>David's</hi> designe, I think this <hi>Quaker</hi> will not deny, if he but look upon the place, and read over the <hi>Psalm,</hi> or the first part of it. Is not <hi>David</hi> about the confessing of his owne sin? Read the title of the <hi>Psalm</hi> &amp; the preeceeding <hi>verse,</hi> and see. Is he not seeking pardon and remission of his own sin? Or shall we suppose, that he is praying for remission to the dead? all Confession of sin to God is in reference to Remission; and if <hi>David</hi> speak here only of his Parents sin, he is tacitely seeking Remission. If he speak of his Parents sin in begetting and warming him, in the womb, it must be as includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself, at least, as shareing thereof; and this will prove that <hi>David</hi> had sin upon him, from his very conception. And by his answere, he would seem to make marriage duties unlawful, contrare to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7:2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13:4. He addeth another answere, thus, <hi>Such an interpretation would contradict the Scriptures formerly cited, while it maketh infants to he hurt by their immediat parents sin: And there is no mention here of Adam. Answ.</hi> I do not prove hence, that <hi>David</hi> was guilty of his immediat Parents sins, but that original contagion doth so cleave to every ordinary Infant (unless we could suppose some singular thing in <hi>David,</hi> without all ground) that in his very warming in his Mothers womb, he is corrupted; and albeit <hi>David</hi> make no mention here of <hi>Adam,</hi> the thing which we inferre is manifest <hi>viz.</hi> the originated sin, or the corruption of nature, which here <hi>David</hi> calleth Sin. And if this <hi>Quaker</hi> think, that this came from another Original, than from <hi>Adam,</hi> let him tell us, what it is, and not joyn in with the <hi>Manichees,</hi> nor make God the Author and cause of sin, if he can.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Another of our Arguments is from that word of <hi>Paul's the wages of sin is death.</hi> And seing infants die, they must have sin, as a procuring cause. That death was and is a Punishment of sin, we cleared above, and the Apostle as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth it here so manifestly, calling it the <hi>Wages,</hi> and <hi>due Desert,</hi> that it must argue wonderful impudence, in any to question it: What sayeth this <hi>Quaker</hi>? He <hi>granteth that death is a Consequence of the fall,</hi> but <hi>denyeth, that hence we can necessarily inferre, iniquity to be in all those, that are subject to death.</hi> That is in plaine termes (but the mans modesty dar not speak it out) to say, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaketh not truth; who ever imagined, that wages were no more but a Consequent of the workmans labour? If Death be the Wages and Reward
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66147:75"/>
and just Punishment of sin, it can certanely be inflicted by the Righteous Judge of the world upon none, but such as are guilty of sin. How oft doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speak of death as the just Desert and Punishment of sin? <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Because the Lord by grace through Jesus Christ hath taken the sting of death away, and made it a passage to glory, unto his owne, shall we therefore look upon it, in it self, as no punishment of sin, or as not coming into the world because of sin? This will tend as much to prove, that Adult persons are not sinful, as that Infants have no sin, and that a womans paines in child birth, or a Mans purchaseing his bread with the sweat of his face &amp;c. are no punishments of sin, Original or Actual, because all these Paines, Troubles, Afflictions, &amp;c. worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good, to such as love God <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: <hi>vers.</hi> 28.

And beside, All in glory must sing the song of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and praise him, that hath redeemed them by his blood <hi>Revel.</hi> 5:9, 10.

But, to be more plaine with him; It is not enough for him to say, he may grant such a Consequence from his doctrine; for we must have sure Scripture grounds, ere we beleeve, that all Infants, even of Turks and Heathens, shall certanely go to heaven; The Scripture giveth more ground of hope of those that are within the Covenant, I am sure, than of those, who are without: what thinks he of the Infants of <hi>Sodom</hi>?

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66147:77"/>
that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit</hi>: And indeed the proof hence deduced is irrefragable; for Christ, the Amen and faithful witnesse, asserts with a double asseveration, <hi>verily, verily,</hi> that a man, and every man (no exception made of Infants) must be regenerated, before he can enter into the Kingdom of God; so that his first generation, if there be no change, will advantage him nothing: And the Reason is added, for by the first generation he hath a fleshly birth, which is corrupt, and not meet for the Kingdom of God, <hi>what is borne of the flesh is flesh,</hi> and nothing else: and this probation annexed sheweth, that Christ mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beside that the words <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> opposed thus to other, in Scripture, denote Natural Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and Grace reforming <hi>Rom.</hi> 7:14. &amp; 8:1, 3. &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6: <hi>vers.</hi> 16:17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: <hi>vers.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="29">29. The ancients to this purpose made use of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17:14. and said, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which these infants did violate, who were not circumcised by their Fathers neglect or carelesness, was the Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> See <hi>Vossii Hist. Pelag. Pag.</hi> 143. I shall not urge this place upon that account: only, seing the Text saith expresly, that the uncircumcised man childe was to be cut off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had broken God's Covenant, we see, that they were under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant &amp; Law, &amp; in some sense capable of breaking it, &amp; therefore obnoxious to off cuting: Now, we heard above this <hi>Quaker</hi> say, that Infants were under no Law, &amp; therefore obnoxious to no punishment: Let him chew his cood upon this place, &amp; contradict <hi>Moses,</hi> as he did lately contradict <hi>Paul.</hi> They cited also <hi>Esai.</hi> 48:8. <hi>Yea, thou heardest not; Yea, thou knewest not, yea from that time, that thine eare was not opened: for I know that thou wouldest deal very treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, and was called a transgressour from the womb.</hi> So did they make use of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7:23. <hi>I see another Law in my members: and vers.</hi> 18. <hi>for I know, that in me (that is in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing.</hi> As also 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15:22. of which we have already spoken a little. And indeed this last place clearly pointeth forth that we are made alive by Christ, through his merites conveyed to us by spiritual Regeneration, as we died in <hi>Adam,</hi> through his Sin and Corruption, made ours by Natural Generation.</p>
               <p n="30">30. <hi>Augustine</hi> (as the forecited Author sheweth us <hi>Pag.</hi> 151.152) made much use of the Paines, Torments &amp; Death, which Infants were subject to, as an irrefragable argument for Original sin: and we have spoken something of it already. The Fathers also made use of the initial Sacraments, as a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this. But I know, this <hi>Quaker</hi> will regaird little any thing, we can say of Baptisme, for among the rest of his Errours, he must not want this of <hi>Antibaptisme,</hi> of which in due place. <hi>Pelagius</hi> was much puzzled with this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Argument, &amp; was forced to grant that Baptisme to them, was not for remission of sins; &amp; so made it useless. And as for Infants, that died before baptisme, he knew not what became of them; <hi>quo non eant, scio; quo eant, nescio</hi>: and he devised a mid place betwixt hell &amp; heaven for them. And so made two kinds of felicities, one with in the Kingdom of God, &amp; one without the Kingdom of God: And he said, that by baptisme, they were brought out
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66147:77"/>
of the middle state, into the highest. See for this the forecited Author <hi>Pag.</hi> 192.193. Thus that man &amp; his followers were miserably Entangled: But this <hi>Quaker,</hi> I confess, taketh a more consequential course, (but whether more consonant to Truth &amp; Piety, I doubt) when he denyeth all Baptisme. But not to speak of Baptisme now, for which there is a proper place reserved, what will he say of Circumcision? He cannot deny but that was an ordinance appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God; And that it had reference to the body of sin, <hi>Paul</hi> tels us <hi>Col.</hi> 21 11. And therefore it could not but presuppose sin, in the Infants. It is called by <hi>Paul Rom</hi> 4:11. <hi>a seal of the righteousness of faith</hi>: and did point out the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseing of the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30:6.</p>
               <p n="31">31. The Fathers made much of this Argument. That by this opinion of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> Infants were wholly excluded from any Interest in the Death and Merites of Christ. And how this man will evite this, I know not; nor know I, how he will accord with himself, in asserting Universal Redemption, as we shall hear. But to put a close to this. I would only ask this question of this <hi>Quaker</hi>: If Infants be borne pure and free of sin, as he saith; How can this be the peculiar prerogative of Christ, to be conceived and borne without sin? And in reference to this, what necessity was there, that he should have been conceived of the Holy Ghost, and borne of a Virgine? Let him answere this, at his owne leasure.</p>

Though he made no mention of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> in his <hi>Thesis;</hi> yet he giveth us, in his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, Pag.</hi> 64. &amp;c. a large discourse thereof; and beginneth his Explication of these two <hi>Theses,</hi> with this matter; And though he spareth no paines or paper, in venting his displeasure against that, which he supposeth to be the doctrine of the Reformed Churches, concerning Reprobation; yet I cannot finde, that he giveth us any account of his owne positive Judgment, of this matter; be like he thought it his Wisdom to forbear that, lest he should entangle himself into inextricable difficulties; and howbeit his Admirers may commend him for this; yet I think his dealing the less ingenuous and upright.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is observed, that since the truth of God, in the matter, of Predestination,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66147:78"/>
began first to be questioned by <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and his Followers, in the dayes of <hi>Augustine,</hi> there hath hardly been any Seck or Heresie, wherewith the Church of Christ hath been infested, that hath not stumbled upon this stumbling stone, and encouraged themselves thereby, to continue fixed in their Errours; and not only to blaspheme, in their pride and audacity, the Truth of God; when it had favoured more of Christian sobriety to have been silent; and when they could not, with their corrupt and blinded Understandings, satisfyingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this truth, to have stooped unto God's Revelation of the mystery, rather than to have condemned it, and that in such a petulant and intolerable manner, as if God and his mysteries must stand at the bar of mans Judgment, and either conforme to the Apprehensions and Conceptions of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore, it should seem less strange to us, that these <hi>Quakers,</hi> whose chief Excellency, or rather most desperat Madness and Wickedness, lyeth in this, that they rake together all the filthiest brats of other Hereticks, and therewith patch up a compleet Cento, for their Religion; and whose chiefe and only rule, for faith and practice, is the dim Light of Nature, a light within every man; which, as to the great mysteries of God, revealed in the Gospel, is pure hellish darkness, have, following the Light of their corrupt guide, not only Rejected, but also blasphemously Inveighed against the Truth of God, in this particular: <hi>For vaine man would be wise, though man be born like a wild asses colt.</hi>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66147:78"/>
their Invention, and keenness of their Rhetorick; whereby, though they contribute to the fixing of themselves in an Errour (it may be, contrare to the very suggestions of their more Impartial, and a little more Enlightned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences) and to the raising of scruples and prejudices, in the mindes of the simple; yet they but render themselves more ridiculous unto the more understanding and exercised persons, in these debates. And this is the whole of the present work and designe of this <hi>Quaker</hi>; for not one word hath he of <hi>Election,</hi> less or more; but runeth out in such a rage, against <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> that he runeth himself blinde; so that he cannot see the most pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and obvious Contradictions and Inconsistencies, which himself uttereth; and no man, of common sense. would ever speak; and so doth his irrational rage drive him, that to all intelligent beholders, he proclameth his own bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Ignorance: Take one instance which will demonstrate both: Towards the very beginning of his discourse <hi>Pag.</hi> 64. &amp; 65. he presenteth us, as speaking thus. <hi>That God did predestinate to everlasting damnation the most part of men, without any respect had to their sin, only to demonstrate the glory of his justice.</hi> Now, let all men of common sense judge, (to speak nothing of the learned, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but look with indignation upon this ridiculously and perversely false Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of our meaning) if ever man in his wits did, or any, who understood what they said, could say, That God did predestinate any man to damnation, for the glory of his justice, without any consideration had of the mans sin? who seeth not what a palpable contradiction is here? can God have the glory of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, any other way, than in punishing of sin? And can God intend to glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his Iustice, and not intend to punish sin? and can he Intend to punish sin, or men for sin, and not consider their sin?</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Man inveigheth much against absolute Reprobation, as he calleth it, but what sort of Reprobation he maintaineth, he never once acquanteth us; why, and upon what designe, himself best knoweth. Nor doth he speak any thing of Election, that we might thereby understand his meaning better, concerning Reprobation. It is true <hi>Pag.</hi> 59. (as we took notice in the proceeding chapter) he gave us a little taste of his humore, in giving a wipe, without any true ground or real occasion, at absolute Election: and so we see, that he is equally enraged against Absolute Election, and Absolute Reprobation: But what his owne true Opinion is, he leaveth us to conjecture. Some might think, that he were of one opinion, as to this, with <hi>Pelagians, Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> who plead for Conditional decrees of Election, and Reprobation, and for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to their owne searching minde, poreing into this matter. The <hi>Iesuites</hi> do coine a <hi>Scientia Media,</hi> through which, as a necessary pair of spectacles, they consider God looking a far, to read what is written on the will of man, placed in such and such circumstances, that accordingly he may order his unchangeable decrees, either to Elect this man, who as he foreseeth, through this pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of <hi>Scientia Media,</hi> will be a good and holy man, and continue in faith and obedience to the end; or to Reprobate that other man, who, as he espyeth by the same medium, will prove a son of belial, and will not beleeve, nor
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66147:79"/>
repent. If this man be of this opinion, I am far mistaken, if his Election and Reprobation, howbeit he call it Conditional, be not more fatally Inevitable, than what we say; for by this opinion, the Lord Jehovah himself is under a Fatal necessity of Electing those that are elected, and Reprobating such as are reprobated; for according as he seeth the determination of mans will, (which he cannot alter, matters standing in the supposed circumstances,) so must He passe his decrees. But others may think, that he rather imbraceth the Opinion of the <hi>Socinians</hi> (and <hi>Arminians</hi> homologate, as to several particulars, with them) who deny all Eternal Decrees, whether of Election or Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as concerning particular individual persons, granting only one general decree, which they call Predestination, whereby the Lord decreed to Elect in time all, that should be found in time to be Beleevers and Obedient, and Consequently to Reprobate and reject the rest: and this Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation only in time they ascribe unto God; because they rob Him of all Fore knowledge: and they make it twofold, one <hi>Infirme, Conditional</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,</hi> which may alter, as men change their manners, so that a Reprobat to day may be an Elect tomorrow, and an Elect today a Reprobat the next day; another <hi>Firme, Fixed, Peremptory and Absolute,</hi> when the man hath finished his course, and ended his dayes: In all which the <hi>Arminians</hi> agree with them, except in this one thing, that the <hi>Arminians</hi> grant an eternal Election of Individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon the foresight of Faith, and Obedience, which the other grant not. Hence the greatest of my difficulty will flow from my ignorance of this mans true principles, for I shall not know how to vindicate truth, which we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, so as to convince him, and stop his mouth, upon his owne grounds; as otherwayes, I should not doubt, through the assistance of his Spirit and Grace whose cause I plead, to do.</p>

When we speak of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> (as opposed to Election, &amp; as comprehended under Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a species, or part) we consider either the Act of God Reprobating; or the thing Decreed &amp; Purposed by the act of Reprobation; that is, as the Schoolmen speak, <hi>vel quoad reprobantis actum, vel quoad reprobationis terminum.</hi> When we consider the Act of God reprobating, nothing in man can be any moving cause thereof; nay it is impossible it should be so; for, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> 1. p. <hi>quae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t.</hi> 23. <hi>art.</hi> 5. saith, there can be no cause of the will of God, a touching the act of willing; and the reason is manifest, because that act of God's will (as all immanent acts of God are) is Eternal: now man, &amp; all that is in man, is of yesterday, &amp; could not cause an eternal act; yea that act of God's will is God himself (unlesse we blasphemously say with <hi>Socinians,</hi> that the decrees of God are accidents in God, &amp; so destroy his Simplicity;) and therefore we can no more imagine a cause in man of the act of Reprobation, than we can imagine, that there is something in man, which is a cause of God himself; which were absurd blasphemy. The will of God hath no cause, no antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, is dependant on, limited &amp; determined by nothing in man, or any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The learned Doct. <hi>Twisse</hi> hath this argument further. If (saith he) sin be the cause of Reprobation, it is either so of its owne Nature, or by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God: Not the <hi>first,</hi> as all will confess. Not the <hi>second,</hi> for then God should ordaine, that upon the foresight of sin, he would ordaine man to damnation, &amp; thus an Eternal Ordination should be the object of an Eternal Ordination. When we consider Reprobation in respect of its <hi>terminus,</hi> or thing willed &amp; purposed by that act of God, we divide it into two parts, or say there are two maine things intended &amp; purposed; (presupposing, &amp; not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, what is common both to Election &amp; Reprobation, as Creation, &amp;c.) as <hi>first</hi> the denyal of Grace, whereby they may be recovered from their state of sin: the <hi>second</hi> is the denyal of Glory, or adjudging them to eternal death. This last Being for sin, &amp; a just execution of a righteous sentence, is not, neither can it be, without consideration of sin, as the meritorious procuring cause: So that, to speak properly, God doth not damne whom he will, Damnation not being an act of meer pleasure, but an act of justice, conforme to an established Law: But the other, the denying or not giving of grace, is an act of Absolute Freedom &amp; Good Pleasure; for <hi>He hath mercy on whom He will, and whom He will he hardeneth Rom.</hi> 9:15, 18. And as God's granting of grace is an absolute act of his good pleasure, &amp; free, &amp; not for any merite or goodness in man; as all, except <hi>Pelagians,</hi> will confess; (yea <hi>Pelagius</hi> himself confessed it, at the Synod

                  </gap>ace and mercy must be Absolute and not Conditional<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an act of the Lords free will and good pleasure, for the praise of his glory, there being no fixed Law constitute by God, according to which, he bestoweth Grace, or bestoweth it not; and there being no Reason imaginable, why the Lord should conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. We must therefore in this matter carefully distinguish, betwixt Gods Decree, and the Things decreed: Things decreed may have their Causes, and one may depend upon another, as on the meritorious procuring cause, but the Decree of God is absolute, having no dependence upon any thing without, being the Absolute and Free act of his Will. God may and doth Decree, that this shall be because of that; and yet because of this he cannot be said to Will that. So when the Lord decreeth to damne some persons because of their sins, though sin be the procureing meritorious cause of damnation; yet it is not the procuring meritorious cause of Gods willing or decreeing to damne: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it be true, that God decreeth to save none, but such as Beleeve and continue in Faith and Obedience to the end; and to damne none but such as are Sinners and Continue in sin to the end; yet we must not say, that as Faith and Obedience in adult persons do preceed salvation, as some way disposeing causes thereunto, and as Final Perseverance in sin preceedeth damnation, as the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cause thereof; so the Foresight of Faith, Obedience and Final Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in both preceed election, or the decree of God, as disposeing causes or prerequisites thereunto; and the Foresight of Final Perseverance in sin preceed Reprobation, or the decree of God, as the meritorious cause thereof: for as the purpose of God, according to Election, is not of works, but of him that calleth <hi>Rom.</hi> 9:11. so the purpose of God according to Reprobation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of works; <hi>for the children being not yet born, neither having done good or evil, it was said, the Elder shall serve the Younger Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12. As the potter hath power over the clay of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour <hi>Rom.</hi> 9:21. so the Lord willing to shew his wrath. &amp; to make his power known, may endure with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath, fitted to Destruction; and he may make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: <hi>vers.</hi> 22.23.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As the Scripture holdeth forth Reprobation, as we heard, and may be further gathered, even as to the name, from <hi>Ier.</hi> 6:30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6:8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:8. So it holdeth it forth to us, sometimes in Negative termes, sometimes in Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive termes. Hence some speak of a <hi>Negative Reprobation,</hi> called Preterition, or passing by; which is a real Positive act in God, and not purely Negative, as some suppose; and of a <hi>Positive</hi> and <hi>Affirmative Reprobation,</hi> which they call

               <p n="10">10. Though what we have said might suffice upon our part, for clearing of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66147:81"/>
the truth, which we owne: yet because this <hi>Quaker</hi> rageth so much against <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Reprobation,</hi> by which he doth not meane, the actual Execution of this act, but the Act it self, we shall in short propose somethings, which will serve for confirmation of what we say. And (1.) There is a certane Analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the decree of <hi>Election,</hi> &amp; the decree of <hi>Reprobation</hi>; so that the one giveth light unto the other; &amp; the one cannot be conceived without the other; for where there is an Election of some, there must be a Rejection of others, &amp; so the one is opposite to the other: from this it is manifest that if <hi>Election</hi> be Free &amp; Absolute, so must <hi>Reprobation</hi> be: for the objects of both are supposed to be in the same state &amp; condition, equally represented in the minde of God, or considered, when the act passeth upon them; none deserving <hi>Election</hi> more than the rest, nor none more meriting <hi>Reprobation</hi> than the rest. If then <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> be not upon the account of any good foreseen, in the elected, more than in others, whether it be Faith, or Obedience, or Perseverance in both to the end, or whatever else can be imagined; as all our Divines have showne, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the <hi>Arminians</hi>; it is manifest &amp; cleare, that <hi>Reprobation</hi> cannot be upon the account of the Foresight of the contrary. Sin foreseen or considered in <hi>Iudas,</hi> could not be a cause moving God to Reprobat him, more than <hi>Peter,</hi> because the same was to be seen in <hi>Peter.</hi> And the Apostle cleareth &amp; confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this, when he saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 9:11, 12, 13. <hi>for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil—it was said unto her, the Elder shall serve the Younger; as it is written, Iacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</hi> Which place (2.) Doth further confirme, what we say; for here is a Discrimination made, one Loved, &amp; the other Hated; that is, one Elected &amp; the other Reprobated &amp; Rejected, without any consideration had of good in the one, or evil in the other, as a procureing cause of these Acts of Gods will; for both <hi>Iacob</hi> &amp; <hi>Esau</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as being in a like condition, yet unborn, neither having done either good or evil. (3.) The supream wheel, moving all, is here said to be, that <hi>the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth</hi>; &amp; so there can be no procureing cause of this, in man. The one was preferred to the other, that the purpose of God, according to Election, might stand; &amp; the other consequently was made to serve, that the purpose of God, according to Reprobation, might stand. (4.) Works, both good &amp; evil, are here in plaine termes excluded, <hi>not of works</hi>; &amp; there are no works except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: if Election be without foreseen works, Reprobation must be so also; or we must say, that the Apostle argueth not acuratly; &amp; that the Spirit of the Lord, in the Apostle, doth not cleare &amp; explaine the point. (5) <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. from the instance of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>that God even for this same purpose had raised him up, that He might sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Objection, which the Apostle preoccupieth, <hi>Vers.</hi> 19. <hi>Thou wilt say then, why doth he yet find fault; for who hath resisted his will</hi>? doth manifestly speak the truth, we plead for: for if <hi>Election</hi> &amp; <hi>Reprobation</hi> were not absolute, but upon foreseen
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66147:81"/>
works, what place could this Objection have? Why would the Apostle speak to an Objection, that were no way pertinent? Should there be any colour for any to propose this scruple, if the good &amp; evil works of man, were the ground of all? (7.) The Apostles reply confirmeth this, when he sayeth. <hi>Nay, but O man, who art thou, that repliest,</hi> or dispurest, or it may be rendered <hi>responsats,</hi> or <hi>carps against God</hi>? Importing, that it is high arrogance, in the Clay creature, to call Jehovah to its barre, &amp; to judge, or quarrel with, or disput against God, whatever he do, according to the purpose of his own will: But what ground were there for such a Pride-laying, Man-humbling, Mouth-stopping, Creature-abaseing, &amp; felling answere, if all this matter did run upon the wheels of justice, or had its rise from man, or were ultimatly founded upon some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him? (8.) The answere added putteth the matter beyond all further dispute: <hi>Shall the thing formed say to him, that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour</hi>? Where we see, That man is but as a lump of clay in the hands of the great Potter; &amp; as there is nothing in one part of the same lump of clay, calling, inviteing, or moving the potter to make of it a vessel unto honour, or a vessel unto dishonour; so is there nothing in man, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or moving God to make this man a vessel unto honour, &amp; the other a vessel unto dishonour. And <hi>next</hi> we see, That all is ultimatly resolved into the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God, as the Potters mere pleasure is the cause of the discrimination of vessels, which he frameth out of the same lump (9.) These words <hi>vers.</hi> 22. further confirme our point; for, saith the Apostle, <hi>what if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted, or made up for destruction? &amp;c.</hi> Importing that it is so, and that man hath nothing, to say against it. So we see, That as the vessels of mercy are afore prepared unto glory, so the vessels of wrath are afore prepared and made up for destruction: and that, as the first is done, that <hi>He might make known the riches of his glory,</hi> so the last is done, that <hi>He might shew his wrath, and make his power known.</hi> (10.) Christ <hi>Mat.</hi> 11:25, 26. referreth the Lords hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel-manifestations of life and salvation, from some, unto the good pleasure of God! and if this part of the execution of the decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation be referred unto this Absolute Soveraignity &amp; good Pleasure of God, as its first and only spring, much more must the Decree it self be reduced to this only Fountain. (11.) The like we may observe from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. &amp; from <hi>Iud vers.</hi> 4. &amp; from <hi>Revel</hi> 13:8 &amp; 17:8. (12.) We are told, that <hi>the Lord added to the Church dayly such as should be saved Act.</hi> 2:47. and that, <hi>as many as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal life believed, Act.</hi> 13:48. where we see, that the appointing some to be saved, and ordaining them to eternal life, is given as the prime ground and cause of their being added to the Church, and Beleeving: whence it followeth, that the Lord did not adde others to the Church, nor give them grace to Beleeve, because he had not ordained and appointed them to life: the consequence of the Negation is as manifest, as the consequence of the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and is clearly intimated, when the other is expressed.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Thus the Scripture confirmeth our point: we shall adde a few reasons, as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66147:82"/>
(1.) No temporal thing, such as is mans sin, can be the cause of that, which is Eternal, as is God's act of Reprobation. If it be said, that the foresight of what is temporal may be the cause of an Eternal Decree: I <hi>answere.</hi> This cannot be; for how is it imaginable, That God's prescience should be the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause of his Decree? can one eternal Act of God be the meritorious cause (and of such a cause we speak here) of another? All the Eternal Acts of God are one, and they are the same with himself: how absurd is it then, to imagine one to be the meritorious cause of another? or the same act as terminated on one object, to be the meritorious cause of it self, as terminated upon another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? If it be said, that sin fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>een can be the cause of an Eternal act of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. <hi>Answ.</hi> But sin can not be foreseen as a thing that shall exist, without a previous decree concerning its existence, by the permission of God; and so sin must first be permitted, or decreed to be by permission, before any man can be Reprobated because of sin, by this Objection: and then, when we suppose sin to be permitted by a decree, I ask, for what end is this decreed permission? God decreeth nothing but for a certane end; and what is His End in this? is it that he may thereby be moved to Reprobat? Then his intention of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is first, for the intention of the End is before the Intention of the midss: and how absurd, and a theological is that to say, that God intended an End, and then he Intended Meanes to move him to intend that end? Againe, by this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the decree of Permitting sin, should be before the decree of Damning for sin; and so we must imagine the same order in the decrees, that we see in the things decreed; while as, how various soever the things decreed be, the decrees themselvs are all one pure act in God, who is <hi>actus purissimus &amp; sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicissimus</hi>; and therefore sin foreseen can no more be the meritorious cause of the decree of Reprobating for sin, than of the decree of Permitting sin: And if we should imagine an order betwixt these two decrees, of Permitting of sin, and of Reprobating for sin, it must be such an order, as is betwixt the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the End, and of the Meanes; and so the intention of Permitting sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first, should be of the End, which is always first in intention; and the intention of Reprobation, being the last of these two, should be of the Means: and so, we should be damned for sin, that we might be Permitted to sin: and that, which is first in Intention, as the End, being last in Execution, and that, which is a Means being first, it would follow, that man should be first damned, and then permitted to sin: which is obviously false and absurd (2.) if sin be the meritorious cause of Reprobation, then it is so either by necessity of Nature, or by the free Constitution of God. But neither can be said; as we saw above (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.) The decrees of God can have no more a cause, than himself can have: all the Acts of God's will, being his Will, and his Will being Himself, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine a cause in man of an act of his will, more than of himself (4) we should reason proportionably of the decree of <hi>Election,</hi> as we do of the decree of <hi>Reprobation</hi> (as we saw the Apostle doing) and so, if sin foreseen be the cause of Reprobation, grace foreseen must be the cause of Election: against the whole Scripture, and the Apostles expresse argueing <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. (5.) That procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cause of <hi>Reprobation</hi> God could have prevented, or taken out of the way,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66147:82"/>
if he had pleased; else we must imagine a stoical fate, overpowering God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. If he might have taken it out of the way, and did not; can any reason hereof be given beside his owne good pleasure, or his designe to manifest the glory of his justice, in the just damnation of such? and doth not this referre the decree of damning for sin ultimatly unto His good pleasure? (6.) what are those sinnes, which are the procuring cause of <hi>Reprobation</hi>? This man will not say, that Original sin is the cause; for he denieth it; as we saw, in the proceeding <hi>Chapter.</hi> And what can that actual sin be? and whatever be supposed, it must be such, as could be foreseen in no other, otherwise the foresight thereof could not be the proper meritorious or moving cause, why this man was Reprobated more then that man; for what is to be foreseen in an Elect, cannot be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cause, why the other is Reprobated. Againe whatever actual sin that be, final Unbeleef, or what you will, it must either be such as God could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or taken out of the way, if he had pleased; or not: if the <hi>first</hi> be said, then it is manifest, that the decree of <hi>Reprobation</hi> can not ultimatly be resolved into sin, as a procuring cause, but into the good pleasure of God; who would not take that sin out of the way, nor prevent its being. If this <hi>Last</hi> be said, then God was under a fatal necessitie of decreeing and doing all, which he decreed and did; and could not hinder sin, nor not create that man, nor alter any one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which did occasion that sin: and thus God himself shall be bound by the fetters of a fatal Necessity; yea and all this fatal Necessity shall have its rise from Man; which were most absurd and blasphemous, (7.) if actual sinnes be the consequent of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> and a mean whereby the execution thereof is brought about, they cannot be the procureing cause thereof. This is manifest. But the former is true. Therefore &amp;c. That the former is true, is manifest from these words of <hi>Peter</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2:8. Where we see that these stumblers at the stumbling ston, and disobedient persons, were appointed, or ordained thereunto. So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10:26: <hi>But ye beleeve not, because ye are not of my sheep</hi>: where it is manifest, that their not beleeving, was a clear consequent of their not being of his sheep. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11:7..-<hi>Israel hath not obtained-but the Election, and the rest were hardened.</hi> So that it was from Election that such obtained, as did obtaine, and from Non-election that the rest obtained not, but were hardened (8) Sin is the moving cause of Actual damnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If sin also be the moving cause of the decree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; It would follow, that because of sin God decreed to damne because of sin: which is strange language.</p>

Resp.</hi> Here are moe mistakes; for <hi>first</hi> we say not, that <hi>Reprobation</hi> imposeth any necessity of sinning. The decree to punish for sin, doth not impose a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity on the sinner to sin; nor yet the decree of denying grace, whereby they might be delivered from their sin: for that is only a decree of not delivering them out of that state, wherein they have brought themselves under a necessity

of sinning; and so imposeth no necessity. <hi>Next</hi> as to God's Decreeing or willing that sin should exist, through his permission (which doth not properly belong to this question) neither doth that impose any absolute necessity, or take away the liberty of Mans Will, or the Contingency of events, as to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes. And it would seem this man knoweth no difference, betwixt an <hi>Absolute necessity,</hi> and that <hi>necessity,</hi> which is meerly <hi>Hypothetical,</hi> But <hi>thirdly,</hi> there is another mistake here: for he would make his Reader beleeve, that we said, that all the necessity of sinning did flow from <hi>Reprobation</hi>; as if no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of sinning arose from their sinful state, wherein they are by the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of <hi>Adam:</hi> Beside, that we might observe, how, in this sentence, he contradicteth what he said in the former. He addeth, <hi>That by his Iustice, he might according to right, rebuke and afflict.</hi> This would import, that according to our judgment, Sin is permitted, or decreed to exist, the Lord permitting it, as a Meane, to the punishment, as the End; as if God intended punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as an end; and therefore suffered sin, as a mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Againe his <hi>Therefore</hi> pointeth out another mistake; for as we speak not thus, so far less do we inferre this from what he mentioned before. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> his word <hi>subtrahendo, withdrawing,</hi> pointeth forth a third mistake; for it will import, that we say, that the Gospel is once preached to every person, yea and to every Reprobate; for how else can it be said to be <hi>withdrawne.</hi> And here is a further mistake, when he addeth, <hi>and the knowledge of Christ,</hi> for hereby the Reader might think, that we thought every Reprobat had the knowledge of Christ, but because he was a Reprobat, it was taken away from him, and withdrawn, He saith moreover, that we say, <hi>God, even in these places, where the Gospel is preached, and salvation is offered by Christ, withdraweth from them all grace, whereby it was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for them to apprehend the Gospel.</hi> Here are also several mistakes; for his <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traxisse</hi> importeth, that God hath given to every one, who heareth the Gospe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let him follow what cisterns he pleaseth, we will satisfie ourselves with the Word, as the ground of our Faith; and we do look upon the Apostles, as more ancient than these Fathers, and take their positive assertions as of more authority, than the silence of these (4.)

Answ.</hi> (1.) The word Predestinate being usually taken in a good sense, as meaned of these Elected to glory, the man vents his gall, in thus misapplying the word to render the truth Odious. (2.) Though no considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin was, or could be the Meritorious, Moving or Procureing cause of God's eternal decree; yet when he decreed to puni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to punish everlastingly for sin such and such persons, and none else, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of his owne good will and pleasure; yet he cannot be said to have had no respect to sin, which punishment alwayes presupposeth, and answereth unto. (4) If God's decrees be not before man exist, or do any good or evil, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Eternal, but Temporal: and so this man is a <hi>Socinian</hi>: and the decree of God concerning every individual person, must exist when the man hath done good or evil; and so, as many men, as many decrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay according to this man, the Lord can make no decree, concerning the Everlasting state of man, so long as he liveth; and so not only we cannot, but God himself cannot say to, or of any man, before the point of death, that he is a Reprobate or an Elect: what Apprehensions these men have of God, I tremble to express (5.) What he meaneth by these words, <hi>ut in iniquitatibus illis versarentur,</hi> I know not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less their meaning be, as I have expressed it. And what would he then make of them? He cannot deny, but God did permit sin; nor will he say, that God could not have prevented sins coming into the world, if He had pleased: will he say, that God did not foresee sinnes coming into the world? If he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see it, and might have hindered it, if he had pleased, and did not hinder it; shall we say, that sin came into the world, whether he would or not? And if he willed or decreed that sin should exist, through his permission, shall we call him the author of sin? Then he must be the author of sin, because he did not hinder sin effectually by his Omnipotency: and then, whatever we say of Reprobation, whether we affirme it to be Absolute, or upon sin Foreseen, there is no remedie as to this, for God must alwayes be the Author of sin: But hallowed be his Name. (6.) The Decree of Reprobation putteth no man into a state of sin: It is true, the Execution the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eof presupposeth sin: but hence it will no more follow, that the decree of Reprobation placeth a man in sin, than that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Election doth so; for the execution here presupposeth also mans being in sin. (7.) Where readeth he that expression, among our divines, that <hi>by vertue of the decree of Reprobation, the Reprobat are secondarily led or to be led to destruction, as the end?</hi> The Lord leadeth no man to destruction, but every reprobat runeth head long thither, of his own accord; and because the Lord hath designed and decreed to let them run-on, and not restraine them by saving grace, shall he therefore be the Author of their sinnes? Then all the sins that are committed, must be charged upon the Holy one of Israel: because He did not prevent them by his grace. And thus the devils may come in play, and learne
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66147:85"/>
of this man to plead Excuse for themselves, and lay the blame of all their wickedness upon God: Sure this must be Develish doctrine. (8.) But what is it, that God is the Author and Cause of? His <hi>hujus</hi> doth not distinctly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us. That he is the Author and Cause of his own Act and Decree, is most true: But that he is the Cause and Author of sin, as this man would inferre, we see not the Antecedent, from whence this Consequence can follow.

In a word, we referre this Man to the Apostle <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 9:11, 12 13. to receive his answere, and let him dispute no more against us, till he once take the boldness to confute that: &amp; his inferring from our doctrine, that God is the Author of sin, is but the same, which the Apostle saw would be deduced from his doctrine, by men of corrupt mindes, when he addeth by way of Objection, <hi>vers.</hi>

there be a decree past, all the guilt must lye upon Iehovah: and thus either God hath made no decrees at all, touching the actions of free agents, good or evil: or all their actions must be acts of Necessity, yea Pure and Absolute Necessity; and so all contingency is taken away, and all Freedom, from second causes; or men and angels must be Absolute and independent Agents, over whom and whose actions, God must passe no decree: let every one judge, whither this doctrine tendeth: and what an exalter of <hi>Free will</hi> into the very throne of God, this <hi>Quaker</hi> is.</p>

Or how is his Will Efficacious and Irresistible? (2.) It is true, the Lord, to speak of Him, after the maner of men, for in God there are no Passions, of Joy, Delight, or Sorrow &amp;c. is not a God that taketh delight in the death of sinners, yea such delight in their hurt and distruction, that whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented &amp; amended, or not, he would notwithstanding destroy them: as these wicked Iewes, to whom this was said, did wickedly alleige.

The thing that he would inferre from hence is, that God doth not Reprobate any Absolutely; that is, doth not purpose to punish them, out of his mere pleasure, and not for their sinnes: And say we, that he punisheth, or purposeth to punish any not for their sinnes, but to satisfie his owne pleasure? No, we say no such thing: His Conclusion then can make nothing against us: nor doth his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hence reach this, which we say, that God of his meer pleasure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing to move him from without, decreeth to punish, or to inflict Death and Damnation, for sin: and if he think, that the one followeth the other, he must lay this down for a ground, that the Decree, and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the decree are all one thing, or that the decree to damne for sin, and damnation for sin is all one thing: But he, nor any man, shall never evince this: or that every thing, which is the cause of of Damnation, must also be a cause of the Decree to damne.</p>

               <p n="23">23.

               <p n="24">24. In the Sixt place, he saith, <hi>that it is injurious to mankinde, making mans condition worse then the Devils. Ans.</hi> This were an injury indeed; but the Challenge is neither True nor Honest; for we look upon Devils as already under the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the decree of Reprobation, and in the same state, as to this matter, that Reprobates are into, after death; and we suppose it is far otherwise with men, though Reprobate, before death, than it is with Devils: Devils are under no offer of mercy now, Men are: Devils know themselves to be damned; men do not: Devils are damned irrecoverably, for their first sin; man that cometh to age, sinneth himself more and more unto damnation: Man that heareth the Gospel is punished because he will not accept of the offer, but doth willingly reject it; He doth not beleeve, and he will not beleeve; can this be said of Devils? Devils are reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day <hi>Iud.</hi> 6. This cannot be said of the Reprobat yet alive: Many of the Reprobats have common graces, and favours of God, and are restrained from many sinnes: which cannot be said of Devils. But what is the matter? <hi>The Devils had once a possibility of standing: But many millions of men had never any opportunity of salvation; but because of Adams sin, of whom they never knew any thing, were to be perpetually tormented.</hi> But did not all mankinde, by our doctrine, stand in <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; fall with him? They are not then punished for anothers sin, but for their owne; as we manifested, in the foregoing <hi>Chapter.</hi> How doth this reach all mankinde, when God, according to his everlasting good pleasure hath chosen a goodly number, whom he will glorifie for ever: will the Lord do so with any of the Devils? Belike, that their condition may not be every way worse then mans, this <hi>Quaker</hi> will give them hopes, that some of them, at least, may be saved, provideing they hearken well to the Light within, &amp; they have th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if all this will not satisfy this <hi>Quaker,</hi> let me speak to him, in the words of the Apostle; for it may be, he will carry some respect to them, the words are to be found <hi>Rom.</hi> 9:20. <hi>Nay, but O man, who art thou, that replyest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him, that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? &amp;c.</hi> But he addeth, that <hi>we put man in a worse condition, than the beasts are in.</hi> Why so? <hi>Because their owners require no more of them, than they are able to do; and when they are dead, there is an end of their misery: but by our doctrine, man is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually tormented, because he doth not that, which he cannot: and thus God dealeth with man, worse than Pharaoh did with the Israelites; for though he withheld straw from them, they could get it with a little more industry. Answ.</hi> What shall we say unto this Man, who thus barketh and belcheth out against God: He supposeth,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66147:88"/>
that he is spewing out this gall against us; alas what are we, that he should thus bark against us? His barkings will be found against the Lord; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall say againe, <hi>O man, who art thou, that repliest against God</hi> &amp;c. Art thou also offended, that God hath given thee an immortal soul, and made thee a man, out of the same lump of clay, out of which he made the beast? Why art thou then angry that God, out of the same lump, maketh one, a vessel of honour, and another, a vessel of wrath fitted to destruction? But <hi>next,</hi> will he say, that all men naturally can Beleeve and Repent and fulfill the conditions, upon which salvation is offered? Yes, this he must say, or he saith nothing against us here; and then he must be as much a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> as ever <hi>Pelagius</hi> was himself. Then Faith is not the gift of God, but of ourselves, contrare to <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 9. and other Scriptures above cited. Then Faith is not the faith of God's elect, contrare to <hi>Tit.</hi> 1:1. Then a natural man, and he that is in the flesh, can please, God, contrare to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:8. Then the natural man can receive the things of the Spirit of God, contrare to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2:14 Then he contradicteth all his owne doctrine formerly examined <hi>Chap.</hi> v. Then we need not pray for faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or a Circumcised heart, or Regeneration, or a New heart, or an heart of flesh; nor give God thanks for any of these things, because they are all in our owne power, and then the Beleever maketh himself to differ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:7. What a contradiction this is to the whole Gospel, and to the whole tenor thereof, no man, that hath once read it, can be ignorant. We thank him this once, for this plaine and ingenuous insinuation. This may help us to understand him better in what is following. But if he say, that they can do, what is required, by the help of the grace of God. He knoweth, that we say so; but his Aggravations here have a far other tendency; for his instance of the beasts &amp; of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> carriage, were else utterly impertinent. Nay, what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the man to compare the matter, unto <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> withdrawing of straw; yea and make it worse? Say we that God taketh away that Grace to beleeve and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that wicked men would as faine have, as the Israelites would have had straw? or that Reprobation maketh men unbeleevers against their will, and taketh away the Power and Grace to beleeve, which they had? It is little wonder, that this man, who dar thus open his mouth against heaven, spew out lies and calumnies against us. We must beare it, knowing that he will come to Judgment; and that our Doctrine is consonant to that <hi>Rev.</hi> 22:17.—<hi>and whosoever will, let him take of the waters of life freely</hi>; and to that <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6:37.—<hi>and him that cometh to me, I will in no wayes cast out.</hi>

He proceedeth in his calumnies and saith <hi>P.</hi> 69. <hi>That by our doctrine, we place Mankinde in the same state, that the Poets feigned Tantalus to be in, who being thirsty was placed in water to his chinne, so that he could not drink</hi>: And why? <hi>because we say, that the works of creation and providence among heathens, are not to bring them to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only to convince them of sin, &amp; so serve for their condemnation.

(3.) Are the Heathen as desirous of Salvation and of the Crown of Glory, (of which they never once heard,) and of the Grace of Faith in Christ,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66147:89"/>
(of whom they never heard a report,) as <hi>Tantalus</hi> was of drinking the water, that did run by his lip; as the verse might have minded him, <hi>Tantalusà labris si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens fugientia captat—pocula</hi>—If not, is the man so transported with passion, that he seeth not his palpable impertinency? (4.) we see then, that according to his Opinion, the works of Creation, and Providence, are as effectual meanes to save the Heathen, as the Gospel is to save such as hear it; and by these may Heathens come as soon to glory, as such as live under the Gospel by it: why then came Christ into the world? Was it that the works of Creation and Providence might become preachers of the Gospel and of Salvation? but we will possibly hear more of this afterward. He addeth, that we say <hi>the preaching of the Gospel, the use of sacraments, prayers &amp;c. suffice to condemne Reprobats, that live within the visible church, and that they are all ineffectual unto them by reason of a secret impotency, which they had from their infancy &amp;c. Ans.</hi> (1.) Here still more <hi>Pelagianisme</hi>; for he would say, that all within the visible Church are borne able to beleeve the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and do duties required therein (2.) That the peaching of the Gospel is to many the favoure of death, we are told by <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2:16. and that it tendeth to the aggravation of their guilt, and condemnation, we heard lately out of Christ's owne mouth (3.) Is he angry with us, because we will not say, that every mothers son, that heareth the Gospel, can beleeve and obey the same, without the grace of God; or because we will not say, that Christ hath given sufficient grace to all that heare the Gospel, to Believe and Obey?

               <p n="2">2. When he rejected <hi>Election</hi> &amp; <hi>Reprobation Absolute,</hi> he made way, and laid a good foundation, for this other Errour of <hi>Vniversal Redemption</hi>; for these two cannot well be separated; however some of late would maintaine this Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Redemption, and withall assert an Election of grace, whereby the Lord made choice of so many, as pleased him, whom he would certainly redeem, and bring to glory; which I cannot see how they can consonantly, and satisfyingly hold, unless they can prove out of Scripture two distinct Covenants betwixt Jehovah, and the Mediator; two distinct and different Ends of Christ's death; Two distinct Prices laid down, and Two distinct Purchases made; (if the one could well be called a purchase) Two Satisfactions; Christ a Cautioner, and no-Cautioner; a Redeemer and no-Redeemer; an absolute Saviour and a Conditional Saviour, &amp;c. But the Scripture cleareth no such thing to us, for any thing I see.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As concerning the point of <hi>Vniversal Redemption,</hi> we finde various senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or various explications of the matter, given to us by Adversaries; for they do not all agree in their apprehensions of the thing. Some explaine the mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er thus, God sent his only begotten Son to be a Redeemer and Propitiator for <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Posterity; who by his death did pacifie an angry God,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66147:90"/>
and restore Mankinde to their lost inheritance; so as all, who are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, are not condemned for their former sins and guilt; for Christ hath abundantly satisfied for these; but for their Unbeleef, for not beleeving in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Redeemer of the world, and for rejecting the Reconciliation made, &amp; the grace of God declared in the word. And thus, they must say, that Christ hath died for all sinnes, but Unbeleefe; and that salvation doth not certainly follow upon this Reconciliation; and so that it is rather a Reconciliableness, than a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; and they must necessarily maintaine, that this matter is revealed unto all and every son of <hi>Adam,</hi> who otherwise cannot be guilty of Rejecting this recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, other wayes it shall be of no advantage to them; unless they say, that the want of the Revelation putteth them out of a capacity of being guilty of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe; and so they must necessarily be saved; and thus their condition shall be undoubtedly better, than is the condition of such as hear the Gospel; and then the revelation of the Gospel shall be no Favour, but a Prejudice rather. And in reference to this, they devise an Universal and Antecedanious Love, whereby God, out of his Infinite Goodness, was inclined to desire the happiness and salvation of every mothers son; and therefore to send his Son to die for all: as if God had such Natural and Necessary Inclinations; and as if all his Love to Mankinde, and every appointment of his concerning us, were not the free act of his good pleasure; and as if there were any such Antecedent and Conditional will in God, that could or might have no issue or accomplishment, but as Lord <hi>Free will</hi> would; and as if the Love that sent C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rist were only such a Poor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Inclination towards all Mankinde, which the Scripture holdeth forth, as the greatest of Loves, and as the ground of all the Effects and Grants, which mans full Salvation calleth for. But why could not this Love effectuat the good of all? Therefore, they tell us, that Iustice being injured by sin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it were satisfied, that Love of God, whereby he wisheth well to all sinners, could effectuat nothing, as to the recovery of any: and upon this ground they imagine, Christ was sent to make an Universal Atonement; and so, Iustice, being satisfied, might not obstruct the salvation of any, whose Free will would consent unto termes of new to be proposed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Others hold forth the matter thus [Christ, according to the eternal Counsel of God, did properly die for this end, and by his propitiatory sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice obtaine, that all and every man, who beleeve in Him, should for his sake actually obtaine Remission of sins, and Life Eternal, but others, in case they would Repent and Beleeve, might obtaine it] But thus we hear no word of Christs obtaining any thing to any in particular; no word of his obtaining Faith and Repantence: and what Counsel of God can this be to send Christ to die for persons, upon that condition, which he knew they would not and could not performe? And what by this meanes hath Christs Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice obtained more, than a meer possibility of salvation, to either one or other? Shall we imagine, that God designeth good to persons, who shall never enjoy it? Or that God hath Conditional Intentions and Designes? By this means, Christs death was designed, and no person designed thereby to be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66147:90"/>
saved; yea Christ should be designed to die, and that for no certain end, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to procure a meer possibility, by stopping the mouth of justice, that it should not stand in the way: but then we can not say, that God sent Christ to die, for Any man, much less for All.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Others express the matter thus [Christ, out of the gracious Decree and Purpose of God, did undergoe death, that he might procure and obtaine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God for all sinners whatsomever, without any difference, before that God would open againe the door of salvation, and enter into a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace with sinners.] But this Reconciliation hath no more force, or import, but that God might enter againe into a Covenant with sinners: and so there is no Actual Reconciliation of sinners unto God. And all that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is for God, and nothing for man, save a Possibility of Salvation by a new Covenant, nor are we told, whether Christ hath satisfied for the breach of the First Covenant, so that sin is fully pardoned unto all; or not, until the condition of the second Covenant be performed: nor are we told, upon what account the sins against the second Covenant are pardoned; Or if they be unpardonable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Others explaine the matter thus [Christ died for all and every man, not only that God might, without any violation of Justice, enter into a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with sinners, upon what condition he pleased; but that it should be upon this Condition, that man should be united with Christ the Cautioner: and not only, that Redemption and Salvation should be possible to all, but that really &amp; most certanly Salvation should be bestowed on such, as Christ thought good] But seing Christ knew, that his death would profite none, but these few, whom he had designed, to what purpose should he have laid downe his life for the rest? And how can his death be a price of Redemption for the rest? How can Christ he said to satisfie for the rest? Did he purchase Faith to these few; and would he not purchase Faith to the rest, and yet lay downe the great price for them? What was the end obtained for the rest? was it only a Possible Call of all, Iustice being satisfied? But of what import could that Possible Call be, if Salvation was not also possible unto them? And whereunto is that Call? They will not say, it is unto Salvation, but to Faith: But did not Christ know, that this call would not be obeyed by them? Did He procure Grace unto them, to obey it? then he procured Faith, and if he procured Faith, than he procured Salvation. Againe, if Iustice be satisfied for these others, why are they not liberat? If they say, the new condition is not fulfilled. Then it cannot be sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply said, that Christ satisfied Iustice on their behalfe, for he knew before hand, that these would not performe the new Condition; how can he then be supposed to die for them notwithstanding?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thus we see what Difference is among men, that hold Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, about the Proper and Immediat End and Aime, of the purpose of God, in sending Christ to die; and of Christ in comeing to die: and how, for the most part, it cometh all to little, or nothing, for <hi>it was,</hi> saith <hi>Arminius, That God might save sinners, what way it pleased Him, his Iustice, which stood
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66147:91"/>
in the way, being satisfied</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or as <hi>Corvinus: That God might will to save sinners,</hi> and <hi>That Christ intended by his death, to make such satisfaction to justice, as that he might obtaine to himself power of saving upon what conditions the Father pleased.</hi> And thus Christ is said to have obtained Reconciliation and Redemption to all, not that they should actually be partakers thereof, but that God, his justice now being satisfied, might prescribe a condition, which when they had preform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he might and would actually make them partakers thereof: Some say, that all men are put into a new Covenant, in which <hi>Adam</hi> was a common person, as well, as in the old, by vertue whereof, none shall be damned that do not sin actually against the condition, and fall thereby from that new state, whereunto they are borne.

               <p n="12">12. Though grounds sufficient, considering the places of Scripture, annexed in the margine of the Confession, confirming all, are clearly hinted and laid downe, in these passages cited; yet I shall, with what brevity is possible, point forth our grounds in plaine termes. And (1.) The Scripture is full and plaine, in holding forth a Covenant betwixt Iehovah, and the Mediator, a transaction concerning man; or the purposes of God concerning the Salvation of Man, in way of a mutual Compact; both for our better understanding of that solide ground of our Peace and Hope, and for the confirming of our staggering and weak Faith. And though the full explication and confirmation hereof, would, I judge, fully undermine and destroy the rotten grounds of <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and of all, who are for the <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Free will,</hi> and enemies to the Grace of God; yet I cannot digresse thereunto here; and shall only referre such, as would see the same confirmed, unto Mr. <hi>Dicksons Therapeutica sacra,</hi> and Mr <hi>Rutherfords</hi> book upon the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Taking it therefore for granted, till what is by these Worthies said anent it be confuted; and finding that <hi>Arminius</hi> himself in his <hi>Orat. de Sacerdotio Christi,</hi> saith, there was a Covenant betwixt the Lord and Christ, I shall but shortly inferre therefrom, That it is repugnant to reason, to say, that the result of that Eternal Transaction: and the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it, was only to procure a meer Possibility of Salvation; and that such a Possibility, as that though it was equally for all; yet it might so fall out, that not one person should be saved, among all the sones of <hi>Adam.</hi> How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable is it to imagine such a bargane betwixt the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her and the Son, as among men, considering what they are doing, can have no place? If Christ was to see his seed, by vertue of this Contract, then certainly God had a special eye and respect unto that seed; and that seed must be distinguished from all the rest, for it cannot be All, else all should be saved: and so Christ did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to buy all, nor did the Father give him All, for his seed: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that seed, the Redemption purchased must be an Actual, and not a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66147:92"/>
meer Potential, or Possible Redemption; and the Lord must have full Power and Dominion over the Will of that Seed, whereby he may determine their hearts unto a following of the Method, which he was to prescribe; and all these meanes, whereby this actual Closeing with the Conditions was to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually wrought, must have been secured: for a transaction betwixt persons, infinite in Wisdom, must of necessity be, in all things, contrived in deep Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. So then, if by vertue of this Covenant, a seed was ensured to Christ, it was these concerning whom the transaction was made; for what interest could others have in this, or advantage by it? And so the Redemption was neither Universal; nor yet meerly Possible, and no more.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Againe (2.) The Scripture every where pointeth out the end of Christs coming and dying, to have been, to Procure and Obtaine some good to man; it were endless to cite the Scriptures speaking this out plainely: But if it had been only to have procured a Possibility, then the proper and immediat end of his dying, had been only to have procured something to God, <hi>viz.</hi> a Power to Him, that he might, without hurt to his Justice, prescribe a possible way of salvation. Now, not to discusse that question, agitated among Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, <hi>viz.</hi> whether it was impossible for God to have pardoned the sins of man, without a satisfaction made by his Son, or not; meaning antecedently to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, determineing this way of manifestation of the Iustice of God; only I must say, that as yet I can see nothing from Scripture, determineing the egresses of the Relative Iustice of God, to be more essential to God, and less subject to the free determinations of his good will and pleasure, than are the egresses of his Mercy; nor do I see any necessity for asserting this against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> seing our ground, walking upon a decree, is proof against all their Assaults; far less see I any necessity of founding our whole debate with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> upon that ground; yea I cannot but judge it the result of great imprudence so to do, seing the <hi>Socinians</hi> may reply, that the sole ground of that Opposition to them is not only questioned, but plainly denyed, by such as we account Orthodox and learned; and may hence gather, that we have no other solide ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to debate with them, but such as the learned of our owne side overthrow. The depths of God's Counsel are beyond our fathoming; and it is hard for us to say, hithertil the omnipotent can come, but not one ince further.

But whatever may be said of this, what Scripture tels us, that Christ was sent to die, that he might obtean this Power unto God? And further, what was this power? Was it a meer Power and Liberty, that should never have any Effect? If it was to have an Effect, what was that? Was it only to make a new Transaction with man, in order to his salvation? If that was all, notwithstanding of all this Power and Ability, not one man might have been saved. Was it certanely to save some? Then, the Redemption cannot be called Universal, nor yet meerly Possible. Nay, if by the death of Christ a Right and Power only was obtained to God, God was at full liberty to have
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66147:93"/>
exerced that Right and Power, or not, as he pleased; and so notwithstanding thereof man might have remained in the same condition, whereinto he was, and never so much as have had one offer of life, upon any termes what ever; or only upon the old termes of the Covenant of works; and what then should the advantage of this have been? The whole Scripture, speaking of the death of Christ, mentioneth far other Ends, respecting man.</p>

Consider how the Scripture mentioneth, a number given of the Father to Christ, to be Redeemed and Saved, we shall see, that there is neither an Universal, nor yet a meer Possible Redemption: for this gift is utterly repugnant to, and destructive of both: for if, conforme to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or was this purchased equally for all? Then such as received it, might have thanked their owne well natured <hi>Free will,</hi> upon that account. But let us consider some other fruits. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1:4. <hi>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2:24.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But for what end and purpose? <hi>That they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him, which died for them, and rose againe. See Col.</hi> 1:22. These and the like passages do clearly pointe forth a special end of Christ's Death, which was designed both by the Father, that sent him, and by himself: and shall we suppose, that this great and chiefe designe was made to hang upon the lubrick and uncertain will of man? Shall Christ be beholden to mans good will for the purchase he made, at so dear a rate? If not, why are not all these ends attained, in all, for whom he died? Did Christ fail in laying down the Ransome? Or doth not the Father keep condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Who can say either of these? Then surely, there can be no reason to say, that Christ made an uncertain bargan, and purchased only a Possibility of these fruites, which he knew not if ever he should attaine, in any one; Nor to say, that he died for all.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Let us further (8.) take notice: That for whom Christ died, he died to take away their sins; And that so, as they may be fully Pardoned, &amp; never brought on reckoning againe: that is, that they be Remitted and Pardoned; and that the poor sinner may not suffer therefore. This sure must be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that prayer, <hi>forgive us our trespasses.</hi> If then Christ by his death hath taken away sin, and purged it away, making satisfaction to justice therefore, how can we think, that justice can punish the sinner in hell fire, for these same sinns?

Shall we now say, that Christ hath died, to purchase this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, the Forgiveness and blotting out, as a thick cloud, and casting into the depths of the sea, of sin; and yet multitudes of those, for whom this was purchased, and that by the blood of God, should never obtaine this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, but have all their sins charged upon their owne score? This so pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Adversaries, that the best evasion they can fall upon, is to say, that none shall have Original sin charged upon them: But the Scripture no where estricteth this Remission to that sin only. Others therefore say, That no sin now shall be charged upon any, but the sin of Unbeleef. Then <hi>Iudas</hi> doth not suffer to day, for betraying his master: was it for this sin only, that the Old World was drowned; or that the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> are suffering the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of eternal fire? <hi>Iude</hi> seemeth to say some other thing <hi>vers.</hi> 7. so are there other sins there reckoned up <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>to which is reserved the blakness of darkness for ever, vers.</hi> 13. But some say, that these are all but pardoned upon condition. Then the Redemption is neither Actual and Real, nor Compleat, but a poor <hi>May be,</hi> and a may be may not be: and how can such sins be said to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given or blotted out, and casten behinde God's back, and into the depths of the sea? Did Christ know, whether or not this condition would be performed? If not, then He is not the omniscient God. If he knew, that it would not be performed by the greatest part, how can we imagine, that he would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing lay downe his life to purchase a Remission for them? And how can we think, that He should purchase a Pardon to all, and let the event hang upon the pendulous tottering will of a sinfull creature? But as to that condition, we shall</p>
               <p n="20">20. Propose (9.) this consideration. The not performance of that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was no doubt a sin, and if Christ died for all the sinnes of the world, he died for that too: And if he died for that too, that is taken out of the way, or there must be another condition imagined, upon performance of which, that is to be taken out of the way; and the non-performance of this condition being also a sin, our proposition will recurre upon this, and so <hi>in infinitum</hi>: but if this sin be taken out of the way, it cannot prejudge them of the pardon of the rest: and thus all their sins being pardoned, they must needs be saved: and yet it is not so. But it is said, that Christ died not for the sin of Final Unbeleef yet it seemeth, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Who seeth not,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66147:96"/>
how little ground there is for such an imagination? But the thing I would have mainly here considered, is this. That for whose sinnes Christ hath died, he hath died for all their sins; and therefore, if he died for the sinnes of all the world, he died for the final Unbeleefe of all the world: But this will not be granted; therefore neither can it be said, that he died for the sinnes of all men. Whose sinnes he took upon him to make satisfaction for, he left none for them to answere for; for he is a compleat Mediator, and is sole Mediator. If he died for all the rest of the sinnes of the Reprobat, and of the whole world, why not for that also? Sure, when the Scripture speaketh of Christs taking away of sin, and of the Redemption, that is, forgiveness of sins, which people enjoy through him, there is no sin excepted, <hi>He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities Esa.</hi> 53:5. the <hi>Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all vers.</hi> 6. or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea, if this exception was to be made, which would null and destroy all, what consolation could the declaration of this redemption, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, yeeld unto poor sinners? <hi>Col.</hi> 1:14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1:7. When the Lord <hi>made him to be sin for us,</hi> was it only in part? how then could we <hi>be made the righteousness of God in Him</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5:21? was the Lord in Christ reconcileing the world unto himself, not imputing only part of their trespasses to them? but the imputing of one sin would mar the reconciliation for ever. Is not final unbeleef a dead work? Doubtless: yet the blood of Christ purgeth consciences from dead works <hi>Heb.</hi> 9:14. Did the blood of buls and goats so sanctify, as to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the flesh, as to leave the most defileing spot of all untaken away? How could healing come by his stripes, if he bear but part of our sins, in his body on the tree, seing final unbeleef alone would mar all? for where that is, there is no coming to God imaginable. But moreover the Scripture tels us, that <hi>the blood Iesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1:7. and that <hi>if any man sin, there is an Advocat with the Father,</hi> who is a <hi>propitiation for sins,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2: <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2. and so must be for all sins, otherwayes there were little ground of comfort here: And it was foretold by <hi>Daniel Chap.</hi> 9:24. that he <hi>should make an end of sin,</hi> and <hi>finish the transgression,</hi> and so <hi>bring-in everlasting righteousness.</hi> Doth this admit of exceptions, and of such an exception, as would unavoidably make all null? No certanely. But you will ask of me, If I think, that Christ did die for final unbeleefe? I <hi>Answ.</hi> Not: for I judge, it is the sin only of Reprobates, who hear the Gospel: and I judge that Christ did not die for any sin of Reprobats: But this I hold, and have cleared, That for whose sinnes soever Christ hath died, he hath died for all their sins: And because he hath not died for final Unbeleef, therefore he hath not died, for any sin of such, as shall be guilty of this: and as for his owne, he died to prevent their falling into, and to keep them from this sin; for he died <hi>to bring them unto God, that they might have the Adoption of sons,</hi> that <hi>they might be sanctified,</hi> and

Final unbeleef is certainly a sin; and Christ either died for it, or not: if he died for it, than it can be laid to no mans charge; or Christ's death is of no value.

It cannot be said, that Christ's death was not a satisfactory price, nor that the Father did not accept of it: If then he shed his blood for the remission of sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26:28. are not all these sins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned

virtually and fundamentally? or shall they not all actually be pardoned in due time? If it be said, they shall be pardoned upon condition of their faith. But if the sinnes of all be equally payed for, and equally in a virtual manner discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in Christ's being actually discharged from that debt, in the day of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; and the actual disharge depending upon the uncertain condition of mans Will; man, who willingly performeth the condition, shall praise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for the actual pardon, and none else; for Christ did no more for him, as to the Actual Pardon, than for others, who never shall be blessed with actual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness: and yet forgiveness is held forth, as a special act of free grace; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of sinnes is according to the riches of his grace <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1:7. Moreover as to that condition, whether did Christ purchase it, or not? If he did not purchase it, than man is not beholden to Christ, for the Condition; be it faith, or what ye will, it is no purchased mercy, but man is beholden to his good Lord <hi>Free Will,</hi> for it, and so he may sacrifice to his own net, and sing glory to himself, for making himself to differ, and for obtaining to himself Actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all his sinnes, and consequently blessedness <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. for had not his owne well disposed Lord <hi>Free Will</hi> performed that condition, all that Christ did had never more advantaged him, than it did others that perish.

No other thing, beside this Application, can be supposed to have been the end of the Impetration; And sure, Christ was herein a Rational Agent: Nay, it was the Intention and designe of the Father, that the Application of these good things should be by the meanes of this Impetration, as is abundantly cleared above. (2.) We cannot suppose that either Christ, or his Father, should faile, or co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66147:101"/>
Christ, then it must be said, that both were uncertain, as to what the Event should have been, or at least Regardless and Unconcerned; either of which to affirme were blasphemy. (4.) The very word <hi>Impetrate,</hi> having the same force and import with, <hi>Purchase, Procure, Obtaine, Merite,</hi> and the like, doth say, that such, for whom this Impetration was made, have a right, upon the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, to the thing Acquired and Purchased: And if they have a right thereto, that Possession should follow. (5.) Yea the word importeth, the actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of the good, to be the very end of the Purchaseing and Impetrating; and so, in this case, the very Impetration is ground of Assurance of the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, considering, who did impetrate, and at whose hands, and withall, what was the ground of the Fathers sending of Christ, and of Christs coming to impetrate, even inconceiveably wonderful and great Love. Nor doth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening of a condition, required before the actual collation of some of the good things purchased, hinder at all; for all these Blessings, some whereof are as a condition to others, are the one good thing Impetrated, and the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are also Impetrated, as we declared above: and so this pointeth forth only the methode of the actual bestowing of these good things purchased. (6.) How absurd is it to say, a thing is Impetrated or Obtained, and yet may, or may not be Bestowed; may be Possessed, or not Possessed? Or to say, that such a good thing is Obtained by price or petitioning, and yet the same good t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How unreasonable is it, that such should have right to the Merites, that have no right to the thing Merited? Doth not an interest in the Merites, procureing any thing, include an interest in the thing Merited? When a ransome is payed for captives, to the end they may be delivered, have not these Captives a right to the deliverance, upon the payment of that ransome? (8.)

(12.) This matter is abundantly confirmed from what we said above, concerning Christs purchasing of Faith, and dying for our sanctification, and to bring us to God, &amp;c. so that more needeth not be added h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For further confirmation of this, and because our Adversaries think to salve the forementioned separation of Impetration and Application, by telling us, that where good things are Absolutely purchased, then Application must follow; But not where good things are purchased only Conditionally, as in our case: we shall therefore shew, how this will not hold, nor advantage their cause: for (1.) If all be Redeemed Conditionally, that condition, whatever it be, must in equity be revealed to all. I know this <hi>Quaker</hi> will grant this, and say, that it is revealed to all persons, come to age; but how this is, and what he understandeth hereby, we shall afterward have occasion to enquire: However, others are put to sory shifts here. (2.) Either God and Christ knew, who would performe this condition, or not: If not, then they were not omniscient: If they did know; then sure, this death was more particularly and designedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for them, than for the rest: and upon what account, and to what end, should Christ lay down his life a ransome for such, as he knew certainly should never be the better thereof? And why would the Father send him to die for such? (3.) This Condition is either in mans sole power, without the help of the grace of God, to performe, or not: If it be in mans power, from what Scripture shall this <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> be confirmed?

If he will worke it in all, then all shall certainly be saved. Againe, if this Condition be the free gift of God, then either God will give it Absolutely to all; and so all shall certainly be saved: or Absolutely to some, and then none but they shall be saved, and why should Christ die for the rest? Or Conditionally to all: And if so, the doubt will recurre concerning that Condition, which either must be Absolutely given, and so we are where we were, or Conditionally, and so still the doubt recurreth. (4.) This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is either purchased by Christ, or it is not. If not, then we owe no thanks to Christ for it, nor for what is obtained upon that condition, more then others who performe not the condition, and so obtaine nothing: but to Ourselves only, who make ourselves to differ; and so may we sing praises to ourselve,

The Apostle so joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them together <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:34. that they must do manifest violence to the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les reasoning, who would pull them asunder, and separate the one from the other. <hi>It is</hi> (sais he) <hi>Christ that died, yea rather that is risen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</hi> (8.) Yea, they are so joyned together here, that his death alone considered could not yeeld that ground of triumph and boasting, nor security from Accusations: <hi>Yea rather that is risen againe, &amp;c.</hi> (9.) So that the separating and taking of these asunder, is greatly prejudicial to the consolation of his people; for though they should attaine to some apprehensions of Christ's dying for them, as an Advocate with the Father, upon new sinnes 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2:1, 2. Though Christ died, yet they might be condemned, for he must also Interceed; and if he do not Intercede for them, their Hopes, and Comforts are gone: And so there should be no force in that, <hi>who is he that condemneth, it is Christ that died?

(10) And that place <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:33. restricteth both equally unto the Elect: <hi>who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect</hi>? (11.) When Christ laid down his life a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for sinners, he could not but know, that by that Ransome none should be actually saved, without his Intercession, it being accorded betwixt Father and Son, that the mediator should mediate both by Price and by Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And he could not but know, for whom he purposed and intended to Interceed; how shall we then suppose, that he would lay down his life for those, for whom he was purposed not to Pray? Or that he would do the most for them, For whom he would not do the least? (12.) Christ's intercession is really a presenting unto God the Oblation made: Therefore sayes the Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 9:24. that <hi>Christ is entered into heaven it self, to appear in the presence of God for us</hi>: And so by appearing he Interceedeth: and his appearing is in his owne blood, whereby he obtained Eternal Redemption <hi>Heb.</hi> 5:12. and so his Intercession must be for all, for whom the Oblation was, and the eternal Redemption was obtained. (13.) Yea both these are so joyned together by <hi>Esaias Chap.</hi> 53:12. as that they are made one ground, and procureing cause of God's divideing him a portion with the great, and of Christs own divideing the spoile with the strong; <hi>Because he hath poured out his soul unto death, and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressours.</hi> (14.) This is further clear from the reasons, we gave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that fast connexion betwixt Christ's <hi>Impetration</hi> &amp; <hi>Application,</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going paragraph, for the Actual Application of the benefite and fruit of his oblation is attributed to his Intercession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (15.) Nay, that whole <hi>Chapter Ioh</hi> 17. confirmeth this; for there Christ is both Offering himself, or sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himself thereunto <hi>vers.</hi> 19. and Interceding: and these are so lincked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both in themselves, and as to the persons for whom, that it must argue, at least, much incogitancy, to imagine a divulsion, &amp; separation of these
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66147:103"/>
two acts of his Priesthood. (16.) If Christ Intercede not for the same persons, for whom he died, we ask for whom he Intercedeth? Is it for actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers? Then we ask a Scripture ground for this restriction? And then it is manifest hence, that Christ Intercedeth not for the working of faith in any: And yet <hi>Esaias</hi> tels us, that <hi>he maketh Intercession for transgressours</hi>: And we see <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17:20. that he prayeth not only for those, who were already beleevers, but for such also, as were not yet beleevers. He told us Himself also, that he would pray the Father for the Spirit, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14: <hi>vers.</hi> 16. And among other things, this is one work of the Spirit, to cause a sinner beleeve, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:13. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1:17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="33">33. The point we are upon will be further cleare, if we consider (22.) That Christ's death was a <hi>Redemption,</hi> and we are said to be Redeemed thereby <hi>Gal.</hi> 4:5. and 3:13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:24. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1:7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1:14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:8. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5:9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2:14. And therefore, all such, as he laid down this Redemption, or Redemption-money for, must of necessity be redeemed and saved; and consequently he died not for all, seing all are not redeemed and saved. His Ransome, or Price of redemption, which he laid down, <hi>viz.</hi> his blood, which he shed, is called <gap reason="foreign">

Other wayes it were no Redemption, a ransome given for Captives doth say, that these Captives, in law and justice, ought to be set at liberty (2.) This Redemption is the same with, (as to the effect,) or hath attending it, <hi>forgiveness of sins. Col.</hi> 1:14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1:7. and forgiveness of sins, is with justification, &amp; hath blessedness attending it <hi>Rom.</hi> 4:6, 7, 8. (3.) Salvation necessarily followeth upon this Ransome and Redemption, as is clear 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2:4. compared with <hi>vers.</hi> 6. (4.) This redemption is from a vaine Conversation 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:18. and consequently is attended with Salvation. (5.) It is attended with justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:24. <hi>being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Iesus Christ</hi> (6.) Hence it is called the <hi>Redemption of the transgressions Heb</hi> 9:15. that is, either <hi>of Transgressours,</hi> by a metonimy, or <hi>of us from the evil of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,</hi> &amp; that upon a valuable compensation and satisfaction; for <gap reason="foreign">

This was a Redemption from the law, <hi>for God sent forth his son—made under the law, to redeem them, who were under the law Gal.</hi> 4:4, 5. &amp; so by this redemption, there is a liberation had from the Law, and its Curse and Penality (8.) And it is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of such as were under the law, for this end, that <hi>they might receive the adoption of sones Gal.</hi> 4:5. But this Adoption of sones is not common to all (9.) All which receiveth confirmation from this, that the Father, who received this ransome, did himself send his Son to lay it down, and so it was his own Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; and therefore must have been payed, upon a certaine designe of actually Redeeming and delivering from Sin, Satan, Death and Hell, those, for whom it was laid downe. (10.) So is there an other end of this redemption mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 3:13, 14. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law—that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Iesus Christ.</hi> (1.)

and exacted all of the sinners themselves, that they lay under by the law, it was a great condescendence in love of this great Lord, and a gracious act of Soveraignity, to accept of a mediation; and of Love and free grace to provide a Red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="34">34. Further (23.) Christ's death had a real <hi>Merite</hi> in it, that is, a worth and value, to procure the good things, it was given for; so that thereby there was a Purchase made. <hi>Act.</hi> 20:28. And therefore, we cannot suppose, that all that was Procured and Purchased hereby, was a General, Uncertane, and meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Possible thing.

               <p n="35">35. (24.) Christ's death is to be considered as the death of a <hi>Testator Heb.</hi> 9:15, 16, 17. <hi>And for this cause, he is the Mediatour of the New Testament, that by meanes of death, for the redemption of transgressions, that were under the first Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they which are called, might receive the promise of eternal inheritance: for where a Testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the Testatour: for a Testament is of force after men are dead, otherwise it is of no strength, at all, while the Testatour liveth.</hi> So he said himself of the cup, in the Sacrament, that it <hi>was the blood of the New Testament Mat.</hi> 26:28. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14:24. and that it was <hi>the cup of the New Testament in his blood Luk.</hi> 22:20. and <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it, <hi>the New Testament in his blood</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11:25. So that his Death and Bloodshed was the death of a Testatour, for the confirmation of the New Testament, and for ascertaneing of the Legatees, of the good things bequathed to them in legacy, by the Testament. Now a Testament commonly is a declaration of the Testatours free, Absolute and Voluntary Purpose of bestowing such and such benefites, to such and such friends; and so it is the Testatours letter will, whereby he willeth that <hi>this</hi> legacy be given to this person, and <hi>that</hi> to another. It is true, men may insert some conditions, as to some legacies, because they are but men, and know not contingent future things, nor have they the wils and dispositions of such, they appoint legatees, in their own hand and power; But it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with our Testatour: and therefore we cannot think, that He left the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies in his Testament, at the uncertanty of conditions, to be performed by men; especially considering, how as he died to ratify the Testament, so he rose againe to administrate the same, as the sole executor thereof by his Spirit, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66147:104"/>
that what legacies he left to be bestowed, upon such and such conditions, he left not the matter at an uncertanty; for the condition it self was bequathed, as the necessary good of the Testament, without which all would have been to no purpose. It is unreasonable then to think, that Christ died to give force to his Testament; &amp; yet it might come to passe, that he should have no heire, to enjoy the goods left in legacy. Nor is it reasonable to think, that all the world were equally his heires, seing the Inheritance, and Kingdom is for the little fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="36">36. Christ's death moreover (25.) is to be considered, as the death of a <hi>Sponsor</hi> and Cautioner, and this will further confirme our point: Hence he is called a <hi>Surety Heb.</hi> 7:22. and is said to <hi>die for the ungodly Rom.</hi> 5:6. to <hi>be made a curse for us</hi> Gal. 3:13. and to <hi>be made sin</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5:21. and other expressions of the like kinde have the same import: From whence it is evident, that Christ took the debt upon him, that was justly to be charged upon the account of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that he became one person in Law, with sinners the principal debtor; that he payed and satisfied for all the debt, and that in their roome and place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that therefore all these, for whom he died, must certainly be delivered from the Debt, and from the Charge and Consequences thereof. These things are manifest of themselves, and need no further confirmation. Now seing all are not delivered from the debt of sin, nor from the punishment due because of sin, we cannot say, that Christ died, as a Cautioner, for all; for sure his death was a compleat payment of all the debt he undertook to pay, and to satisfie for. Nor can we say, that he died as a Cautioner for he knew not whom; far lesse, that he died as a Cautioner, and yet none might possibly receive advantage thereby. Nor yet can we say, that he died, as a Cautioner, and payed for some sinnes of all, and not for all their sinnes, for whom he died; seing he was a Compleet Cautioner. So then, as Christ died in their roome and stead, as their Cautioner, and Sponsor, for whom he died, wrong should be done to Him, if all these, for whom he was a Cautioner, should not at length actually be delivered out of prison, &amp; freed from the accusation of the law: They, for whom he died, being in him legally, when he died, and morally and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dying in him, and with him, must not, in justice, be made to pay their own debt, and satisfie the law over againe: Christ's stricking hands (as the phrase is <hi>Prov.</hi> 22:26.) and so putting his name in the obligation, and accordingly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king satisfaction, the Principal's name is blotted out, and he freed in the time appointed: for <hi>he beare our griefs, and carryed our sorrowes &amp;c.

                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:66147:105"/>37. This matter will be further clear, if we consider (26.) How the death of Christ was a <hi>Satisfaction</hi>: and none can deny this, but Antichristian <hi>Socinians</hi>: Others willingly grant, that Christ did substitute himself, in the room of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and was willing to undergo the punishment, threatned in the Law against sin, that the sinners, for whom he undertook satisfaction, might be freed: So he <hi>bear their sins Esai.</hi> 53:11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2:24 And <hi>he was made sin</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 21. Hence he is called a <hi>Propitiation</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2:3. &amp; 4:10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:25. Whereby we see, that Christ took upon him the whole Punishment, that was due to sin; and that God, whom sinners had offended, was well pleased with what he did and suffered, according to that undertaking, yea more pleased, than he was displeased with all the sinnes of those, for whom he suffered: for hereby His Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and justice was made to appear more glorious &amp; excellent. How then can we think, that many of those, &amp; it may be all, for whom he gave that satisfaction, may, notwithstanding, possibly be made to make satisfaction for themselves, as they may by our Adversaries way? Was not his satisfaction full &amp; compleat? Why should any then, for whom he gave that satisfaction, be liable to Punishment? Is this consonant to justice? Did not the Lord Jehovah send Christ and fit him with a body for this end <hi>Psal.</hi> 40:6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10:5. &amp; laid upon Him the iniquities of us all <hi>Esai.</hi> 53:6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that He might make full satisfaction for them to justice, &amp; suffer for them all that the Law could demande of them, or they were liable unto by the broken Law? Did not Christ do &amp; suffer all, which he undertook to do, &amp; suffer for this end? And did not the Father accept of what he did &amp; suffered, as a full Compensation, &amp; Satisfaction? And seing this cannot be denied, &amp; it is manifest that this was done by Christ as a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner <hi>Heb.</hi> 7:22. how can it be imagined, that the Principal debtor shall not thereupon have a fundamental right to freedom &amp; pardon, &amp; in due time, after the Gospel method, be actually Discharged, &amp; delivered from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law, &amp; Redeemed by the Satisfactory Price payed by the Cautioner, &amp; accepted of the Creditour? Doth not the denying of this certain &amp; infallible Effect, call in question the value &amp; worth of Christ's satisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and give ground to say, that Jehovah was not Satisfied with the price; or that Christ made no Satisfaction? Did not Christ make Reconciliation for the sinnes of his people? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2:17? <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="38">38. Adde for a further confirmation of this (27.) That Christ's death was a propitiating sacrifice. He <hi>gave himself for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God, for a sweet smelling savour Ephes.</hi> 5:2. He <hi>offered up himself once Heb.</hi> 7:27.

               <p n="39">39. Adde to this (28.) How upon this Sacrifice, which Christ offered up, in his death, we read of a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> made <hi>Ephes</hi> 2:<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now this Reconciliation being of parties, that are at varience, must be a Reconciliation of both to other, and so a mutual Reconciliation: and Christ effectuateth both: and both are purchased by his death: we cannot then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with <hi>Socinians,</hi> that all the Reconciliation, mentioned in Scripture, is of us to God; as if God's Anger and Wrath were not appeased and taken out of the way; nor with <hi>Arminians,</hi> that Christ obtained an Universal Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God to all, but no Reconciliation of man to God: friendship betwixt enemies must be mutual, if a Reconciliation be; and our state before this was enmity <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1:20, 21. and God's wrath was against us and upon us, <hi>Ephes</hi> 2:3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:36. But now, how will this agree with Universal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is God Reconciled to all, when many perish under his wrath, for ever? Can God be said to be, upon the death of Christ, Reconciled to all, when it may so fall out, that not one soul shall have peace with God? How cometh it to passe, that many, whose Reconciliation Christ hath purchased, live and die enemies to God? Sure the Apostle tels us 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5:19. that to whom God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, to them he doth not impute sin: and he assureth us, that all such, as are reconciled to God, by the death of his Son, shall be saved <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:10.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Adde (29.) That it seemeth hard to say, That Christ laid down his life a Price, a Ransome, a Sacrifice, an Atonement &amp; Propitiation, &amp;c. to Purchase, Procure, Merite Grace, &amp; Glory, &amp; to make Reconciliation &amp; Peace betwixt God, &amp; such, as were already suffering the vengeance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire, &amp; to satisfie for their sinnes, who were already condemned to the torments of hell fire: and yet this must be said by such, as assert Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Was Christ so prodigal of his blood, as to cast it away, for such as were irrecoverably gone? If it be said, that this is no more hard, than to say, that Christ suffered for such, as were already glorified. Any may see, how vast the difference is, for such as were glorified, were glorified upon the account of Christ Death, which was to be, in the time appointed &amp; designed by Father &amp; Son. When one promiseth a summe for redeeming of so many slaves, and the summe, according to mutual agreement, is to be payed at such a day, the slaves may be presently relieved, in contemplation of the price, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and is to be payed hereafter at the time appointed: But when one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to lay down Ransome-money, he cannot be said to lay it downe for such as are dead, &amp; that he knoweth to be dead many yeers ago, &amp; so uncapable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p n="41">
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:66147:106"/>41. Further (30.) If Christ died for all, then he intended to die for all; then the Father also intended, that he should die for all; then he intended that it should be a Redemption for all, &amp; that thereby all should be Redeemed: for to what end else should Christ die &amp; redeem, if not that such, as he died for &amp; Redeemed, be Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deemed &amp; Delivered? Or to what other end should God intend that Christ should die for all, than to the ends mentioned in Scripture, of which we have spoken? And how can we say, that God did intend the Redemption of all, when all are not actually redeemed? Are his intentions so fallible, and frustrable? If it be said, that he Intended only a Possible Salvation, and not Actual. I <hi>Ans.</hi> The Scripture speaketh no such thing as we have seen: And how unsuteable is it to the wisdom of God, to send his Son, actually to die, and bear the curse, and only intend thereby a Possible Redemption, which might never prove Actual to any one soul? If it be said, That he Intended an Actual Redemption, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally. I <hi>Answer</hi> Redemption upon a condition is but a Conditional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and that is but a Potential, Possible Redemption, unlesse you say, that the condition is also purchased: and then, as to God, it is an Absolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and intended as such: doth it suite the wisdom of God, to intend Redemption to all, and not intend also the Condition, by which alone it must become Actual, and which he alone can work, but will not? Must we thus ascribe such intentions to God, as must hang upon mans will, and be subordinate thereunto? Or if he see, that the Condition will never be performed, how can we think, that he intendeth any thing upon a Condition, that shall never be? But enough of this, at present.</p>
               <p n="42">42. Moreover (31.) This doctrine of Universal Redemption is derogatory to the solide consolation of the Redeemed, and Weakeneth the grounds of their long; and therefore it is not to be admitted. This Argument is fully and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidely prosecuted, and vindicated from what can be allaiged against it, by the learned and solide divine Mr <hi>Durham,</hi> in his Comment on the <hi>Revelation Pag.</hi> 304. and 305. And to him shall I referre the Reader: only I shall crave leave to adde this: That by our Adversaries grounds, the song of the Saved shall not run, as it doth <hi>Revel.</hi> 5:9, 10. But rather thus, We have saved ourselves, out of every kinred, and tongue, and people, and nation, and have made our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto God, Kings and Priests: For whereas Christ by his blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed all of every kinred, and tongue, and people, and nation, and not some only out of them; we ourselves have, by our own free good will, made a difference betwixt ourselves, and the rest; and we are no more beholden to Christ for all that we have attained to, then the damned in hell are, for whom Christ shed his blood, as well as for us, and to whom he purchased by his blood and death, as much, as for us; as Adversaries say. So that I see not how <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> can think to joine in this Song, and have any share of this Consolation, which is solely founded upon the Redemption of Christ, as a peculiar and no common blessing. Let them consider it, for it concerneth them not a little, seing all that come to glory will sing to the honour of their Redeemer, upon other grounds, as we see, then these are, which our Adversaries lay
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66147:106"/>
down, and plead so earnestly for. If any say, that Christ moreover hath purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faith to some, even to all that are actually saved. I <hi>Answere</hi> As neither the <hi>Arminians,</hi> nor <hi>semi Arminians.</hi> I mean the followers of <hi>Camero</hi> will say this, or grant so much; so the granting of it, will evert the other Universal Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Redemption; for the Scripture speaketh but of one kinde of Redemption, of one Price laid down, of one Covenant betwixt Jehovah and the Mediator; and of one Giving unto Christ of Persons to be redeemed. Shall we think, that Christ would lay down as great a ransome for such, as he was not to purchase faith unto, as for the rest? Shall we think that he would lay down his life in vaine, and make no purchase thereby? And of the Reprobat, for whom he was not to purchase faith, he knew he could make no purchase; for without faith his death would be of no advantage unto them. And where do we read, that all were given unto him to redeem? Yea, are not the given ones clearly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the rest? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17:6, 9. as we cleared above.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Againe (32.) If the Redemption of Christ be Universal, and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional: it must necessarily follow, that Christ laid down his life, and the price of his blood, as much for <hi>Iudas,</hi> and all the Reprobate, as he did for <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all the Elect: for the Redemption being conditionally for all, it cannot be more for one, then for another. And yet this cannot be said, as appeareth from the reasons formerly adduced. This would say, that the Fathers and Christs love was equal towards all; and that no more was purchased for the one, than for the other; and that the Elect have no more benefite by Christs death, than the Reprobat have; and that Christ had no more an eye to Redeem the Elect by his death, than to Redeem the Reprobat; and was no more a Cautioner for the one, than for the other: all which and the like cannot but be looked upon, as most absurd. Shall we think, that Christ became sin, as well, or as much, for <hi>Iudas,</hi> as for <hi>Peter</hi>? Shall we think, that He redeemed all alike from the curse of the Law? These sound ill to Christian ears.</p>
               <p n="44">44. So (33.) we may thus reason: Either Christ's Redemption is Conditional and Universal, as to the Price laid down and Satisfaction made; or as to the Application and Actual bestowing of the benefites purchased: But neither can be said to the advantage of the Adversaries cause; for if the <hi>last</hi> be said, we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant that some of the benefites, as Justification, Adoption, and actuall Glorification, are conferred in a manner conditionally: but some, as faith and the New heart, are given absolutely: and this cannot help the Adversaries cause, for they will not say, that either all have faith bestowed upon them, or that all are by believing Justified and Adopted &amp;c. and so this is not Universall: and if the <hi>first</hi> be said, to wit, That Christ laid down his life Conditionally, it must be said, that Christ did not lay down his life Absolutely, but upon some condition; and what can that Condition be, upon which the death of Christ was suspended? If it be said, that the faith of those, to whom it was to be preached, was the condition: then it must be said, that Christ did not die untill these beleeved; or that his death was no satisfaction or price, untill they actually beleeved: and then the Father could not be well pleased with the price as a satisfaction, until
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66147:107"/>
mens Faith came to make it an Actual price: which is both absurd, and contrary to Scripture. <hi>If it be said</hi> That Christ did absolutely lay down his life a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Ransom, and that for all, yet so as none, that would not fulfill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, should be redeemed. I <hi>Answer</hi> If it was an Absolute satisfactory Ransome, and accepted as such, something must have been purchased thereby, and all behoved actually and really to be delivered from the Law and from the curse, or from something, by vertue of that Absolute Price; and they could not be made to pay over againe what was payed by the price of his blood; for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice could not call for two satisfactions. And if all were, upon this Absolute Price payed. Redeemed from the Law, the Curse, and the Sentence of the first Covenant, no man shall now die for that broken Covenant. <hi>If it be said,</hi> No man was Absolutely delivered even from that, but only Conditionally. I <hi>Ans.</hi> How then was it an Absolute Price? Or what was purchased thereby? <hi>If it be said,</hi> That a possibility of Freedom was absolutely purchased. <hi>Ans.</hi> This was rejected above: and the Scripture inferreth Actual Redemption from Christs purchase. <hi>He shall justifie many, for he shall bear their iniquities</hi> Esai 53:11. which saith, That all whose iniquities he did bear, shall be Actually and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Justified by him, and not have a meer Possibility of justification.</p>
               <p n="45">45 Further (34.) We may thus argue, If Christ died for all and every one, He either died for all <hi>Absolutely</hi> or <hi>Conditionally.</hi> The first cannot be said, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons already adduced militate against that. Nor can it be said, that He died for all <hi>Conditionally</hi>: for then either he died to purchase Life and Salvation to all upon condition of their performance of something proposed as a Condition; or to purchase salvation, and all the meanes thereunto or conditions thereof, Conditionally, But neither of these can be said. Therefore &amp;c. The <hi>major</hi> is clear from this, that the enumeration is full, and no other way can this Conditional Redemption be conceived or explained. The <hi>minor</hi> may be thus confirmed. The <hi>first</hi> way cannot be said, to wit, that life and salvation was purchased to all, upon a condition to be by them performed, that is, upon Condition of their believing: for either this Condition is in the power of every son of <hi>Adam,</hi> or not: if it be not in their power (as all but <hi>Pelagians</hi> will confess) then this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is no Redemption; for a Redemption of Captives upon a condition impossible to them, is as good as no Redemption. Nor can the <hi>last</hi> way be said, to wit, that Redemption, and all the Conditions and Means thereof were Conditionally purchased; for what can be assigned as the Condition of these Conditions? And though there were a Condition of the Lords working of faith assigned, (which yet we finde not in Scripture) yet that would not help the matter; for that Condition of faith would it self be a mean to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so purchased Conditionally upon another Condition, and that other Condition must be purchased upon another Condition, and so <hi>in infinitum</hi>: which is absurd.</p>
               <p n="46">46. As also (35.) this is considerable, That the asserting of Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption goeth not alone; but there are several other Universalities also affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and maintained, either as Consequences, or Concomitants, or Grounds
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66147:107"/>

An Universal Love and Philanthropie, towards all and every one, without any difference: which they lay down, as the ground of the Sending of Christ to die for all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discriminatly. (2.) An Universal Will in God to save all, which they call an <hi>Antecedent Will</hi>; and hold forth as a Velleity, or a wish and desire, that all might be saved; as if God could not effectuat whatever he desired, or could have a velleity towards any thing, which either he could not, or would not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuat.

An Universal Covenant of grace made with all mankinde in <hi>Adam.</hi> wherein is a free universal deed of gift of Christ first, and of Pardon, Spirit and Glory, in and by him, to all Mankinde without exception, upon condition of acceptance; as also an offer of Faith, Repentance, Conversion, with all the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="47">47. Finally (36.) This assertion of Universal Redemption laith the ground of, and maketh way to a new frame of the Covenant of Grace, quite overturning its Nature, and transforming it into a new covenant of works, making it one and the same with that, as to kinde, and only to differ, as to the change of conditions to be performed by man: for as, in the first covenant, <hi>Adam</hi> was to obtaine right to, and possession of life promised, in, by, for, through and upon the account of his fulfilling the condition of perfect obedience, imposed by the Lord; so, in the New covenant, man is to obtaine and acquire to himself a right to and possession of the Life promised, in, by, for, through and upon the account of his performance of the Condition of Faith and new obedience, now imposed in the Gospel; and all the difference is, that instead of perfect obedience to the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66147:108"/>
which was the condition of the first covenant, now Faith and sincere Gospel Obedience is made the condition: And thus we can no less be said to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by works of the Law, or which we do, then <hi>Adam</hi> should have been said to have been so justified, had he stood; and this justification giveth as great ground of boasting unto man, and of making the reward of debt, and not of grace, as justification by the first covenant would have done; for though it be said, that Christ hath made satisfaction to justice, for the breach of the first Law, and thereby purchased to all, upon Condition, Iustification &amp; Salvation; yet this removeth not the difficulty; for what is purchased by Christ's death is made Universal &amp; Common to all; and so can be nothing (according to our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries) but a putting of all men, <hi>in statu quo prius,</hi> in case to run &amp; obtaine the prize for themselves; as God's absolute free love put <hi>Adam</hi> in that condition at first: Christ's death (though thereby, as they say, he purchased the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which with them is the chiefe, if not the only, effect and fruit of his Death &amp; Merites) can be no more, than a very remote ground of Right to Life and Salvation, unto any person; for it is made Universal &amp; Common to all, so that all have equal share therein, and advantage thereby; man himself, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the new conditions, only making the difference; so that the immediat ground of the Right to life, which any have, is their own Faith and Obedience, or performance of the New Covenant-conditions. Whereby it is manifest, that as to our Particular, and Immediat Right to Happiness, we are to plead our own works, &amp; lean to them, as our ground whereupon we may stand and appear before God's Tribunal; and upon the account thereof plead for the crown, as our due debt, having now run for it, &amp; performed the condition, agreed upon; and so sing praises to ourselves, instead of singing praises to our Redeemer. Hence the righteousness, wherein we must appear before God, is not the Righteousness of Christ, but our own; for the Righteousness of Christ, say they, is only imputed in regaird of its effects, whereof the new Covenant is the All, or the Chiefe; and so that doth not become the Righteousness of any man, nor can be said to be imputed to any man properly, (which also they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert)) but his own Faith is only imputed properly (which also they plead for) as his Righteousness; not, as a Way, Medium, or Methode, of Gospel-Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness (especially when Gospel-Obedience is adjoyned) The Righteousness of Christ bein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sition</hi> is false: for the decree of God, which maketh things possible, or impossible, in the sense, wherein we take these termes here, not being revealed to us, is no rule for our prayers, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will, and Law of God, that is the proper and only ground of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. (3.) His confirmation of this is no confirmation, for it concludeth not the Proposition denyed, Nor doth it conclude the Assumption; but is really the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66147:110"/>
first argument dressed up in equipollent termes; and so must be satisfied with the same answere; for it is false, <hi>that every man is commanded to pray for all.</hi> Infants are men, and yet they are not commanded to pray for any, far less for all, No man is commanded to pray for <hi>all men,</hi> as we shewed, far less for <hi>all,</hi> devils and damned, and all dead, and all creatures; for these come under the tearme <hi>all.</hi> Againe, I say, it is false, that no man is bound to pray for that which is impossible, in respect of God's decree: I may pray for the life of my Father, or my friend, and yet it may be decreed by the Lord, that he shall die: But I must pray therefore with submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to God's holy will and pleasure, if he thinketh fit, and have not decreed the contrary. Christ foretold, that <hi>Peter</hi> should deny him thrice; and because it was impossible that Christ should be a liar, it was also impossible, upon this supposition, that <hi>Peter</hi> should not so deny his master; yet it was lawfull for <hi>Peter</hi> to pray against th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(4.) His next argument seemeth to be a proof of the proposition of the second argument, for it seemeth to conclude; that no man is bound to pray for what is impossible. And as to it, I say, it is true, no man is bound to pray, but in faith, that is in confidence, that what he prayeth for is Lawfull, and consonant to the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will of God; and that if the Lord seeth it good, and good for him, being a beleever, it shall be granted; and this includeth, an holy submission to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream will of God, as to what is not revealed, and a submission to his wise providence and care, and to his supream power in disposeing and giving out the good things promised, when, or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> what time, and in what manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, he seeth meet and expedient. But that no man can pray in faith for what the Lord hath not decreed to do, or grant, I deny for reasons already given. It was impossible, but Christ should have died, for, for that end came he into the world, and he came to suffer the wrath of God, for sin; and yet he prayed <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12:27. <hi>father save me from this hour.</hi> And I suppose this <hi>Quaker</hi> dar not say, that this prayer was not in faith, But it was, it is true, with submission, as the next words evidence, and is cleare <hi>Mat.</hi> 26:39. So should our prayers be, with submission, and if it be possible. (5.) As to his next argument; to the <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> I say. What God willeth, with his will of Purpose, Decree and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is about events, is not impossible, it is true; for it is certane, and is not only possible, but a thing that shall certainely come to passe, for who hath resisted his will? and He is of one minde, and who can turne him? His will thus is Effectual. But the <hi>Assumption</hi> is most false in this sense, for if God would thus have all men to be saved, they should all be certanely saved, unlesse by <hi>all men</hi> he understand not all and every individual man, but indefinitely. his owne Elect, among all Nations, Kindes, and Sorts of people, whether High or Low, Rich or Poor, Greek or Barbarian, Iew or Gentile; and if he take it in this sense, his Conclusion will be most sound, and we shall accept of it; yea we shall say more, to wit, That most certanely, all these men shall be sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea, that it is impossible it should be other wayes. But againe, as to the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66147:110"/>
                  <hi>Proposition,</hi> we say, what God willeth, by his Command and Precept, may be &amp; oft is impossible, in respect of God's decree, for God commandeth all men, (it may be devils and damned, who remaine God's creatures) to love him perfectly with their whole soul and minde and strength, and yet this is not now possible. And so, as to the <hi>Assumption,</hi> though God should will thus all men to be saved. (which yet is not true, because, the Gospel, which bringeth salvation, is not revealed to all men) it would not follow, that it were possible, that all men should be saved (6.) As to his last argument, I say, for whom Christ gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a price of Redemption, to them salvation is not only Possible, but Certain: And as to the <hi>Assumption,</hi> That Christ gave himself a price of Redemption for all, is true in this sense, that Christ gave himself for all his Owne, all his Sheep, all his People, all that were Given to him of the Father, all that shall be Saved, all the Elect, of whatever Nation, Kindred, Tongue or Language, or whatever Condition they be in the world, Magistrates or Subjects, Rich or Poor, Iewes or Gentiles &amp;c. But it is not true, in this sense, that Christ gave himself a ransome for all and every individual person, for he gave not himself for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, who yet may come under <hi>all;</hi> nor for Infants (as himself must confess, seing he said above, that they had no sin, but must certainely be saved) and yet Infants come under <hi>all</hi>; nor for the Reprobate (as we proved above) who yet come under <hi>all</hi>; to say nothing of all other Creatures; Birds and Beasts, &amp;c. who may come under this <hi>all.</hi>

And here, the very circumstances of the place evidence, that it must be so taken; not as if it were necessary thereby to assert, that out of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular distinctive condition of men, God would take some; for if such a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sense were urged, it would follow, that some of the damned, some of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally impenitents, and the like, should be saved: but it must be taken in a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and Restricked sense, thus, That there is no condition of men, (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Civil, Political, or Rational conditions) now excepted; no Nations, no States, no Sexes, no Ages, and the like, of such as are salvable, now excepted: And that thus it is here to be taken, is manifest, for (1.) we cannot suppose, that the Apostle would have us praying for all and every individual person brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

to the secret Counsel and Purpose of God; and so it is the mean, by which the Lord effectuateth the purposed and designed end; and as it answereth to the Revealed Will of God, and is his Law. In the <hi>first</hi> sense, the promises in the Gospel do peculiarly belong unto, &amp; are made for the Chosen ones, the Elect company, for whom Grace and Glory is prepared; and for whom the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is appointed.

But as to the Gospel, considered in the <hi>second</hi> sense, it is the Ministry and Word of Reconciliation committed unto Men, 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 5:18, 19. who, as Ambassadours for Christ, must pray in Christ's stead that people would be reconciled to God <hi>vers.</hi> 20. The dispensation of the Gospel is committed unto them 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9:17. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3:2.

It is then a groundless mistake, to inferre the Universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Purpose of God, from the Universality of the Offer; or to think that Christ died for all and every one, because ministers must dispense the word, and hold forth Christ as an al sufficient mediator, and command all and every one, to whom they preach, to beleeve and repent. It is unreasonable to make the will of God, as the supream and absolute Disposer of all things; and his will as the only supream Lawgiver, to be of the same complexion and latitude; or to inferre the one from the other; for that were to commensurate Duty with the Event, as if nothing could come to passe but what were duty, and nothing duty, but what came to passe.</p>

(5.) This man, I hope, will not deny; that God might, if he pleased, give grace to such as he expostulateth with, whereby they might certainly be wrought up to a compliance with the word of Command: And because it seemeth not good in his eyes, to do so, shall his Dispensations, and the Ministry of his Gospel be looked upon, as a stage play and a comoedie? O! who art thou, O man, that will thus bring God to thy barr, and passe such a shameful sentence upon his proceedings?

Sometimes <hi>Many Mat.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4:42. and 12:19 and 16:8 and 17:21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:9. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13:3. Sometimes <hi>a great part of the World Rom.</hi> 1:8. and 10:18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24:14. and 26:13. Sometimes the <hi>Roman Impire Luk.</hi> 2:1. Sometimes the wicked; and sometimes God's owne scattered up and down the world <hi>Psal.</hi> 22:27. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:16. and 6:36, 51. <hi>Rom</hi> 4:13. and 11:12, 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5:19. <hi>Col.</hi> 1:6. (2.) Nor can the phrase <hi>whole world,</hi> or <hi>all the world,</hi> prove any thing; for that also is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously taken, and never (except once <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:19. where it is in a necessary matter) taken for all and every individual person? See <hi>Revel.</hi> 3:10. and 12:9. and 13:3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2:1. and in other places, it doth not denote men. (3.) It is but rational to suppose, that the <hi>whole world</hi> here denoteth no more, than the like expressions elsewhere, to wit, <hi>all nations, all flesh, all the ends of the earth, all the families of the earth</hi> &amp;c. and we did shew above, that these, used in the matter whereof we are now speaking, could not be taken in their most comprehensive sense, otherwayes it would follow that all and every man should have grace, and glory; see for instance <hi>Psal.</hi> 22:27. and 72:11. and 93:3. But <hi>Peter</hi> tels us how such ought to be interpreted, <hi>Act.</hi> 2:17. expounding that universal <hi>Ioel</hi> 2:18. (4.) That there must here be a restriction, himself must grant, otherwise he must bring-in the Devils; and say, that Christ is a propitiation for them, and not for us only who are men upon earth, because the word <hi>world,</hi> in its universal extent, will comprehend them also: Especially considering, how the second place may contribute to strengthen this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, seing the Devils lye in evil? But if he take liberty to restrick it, to Men, he must not be offended with us, for taking the same liberty to restrick it to a certane sort of Men: as elsewhere it is restricked to signifie Wicked men; so here it may signifie Beleevers, or the Elect, as the like phrase of <hi>all nations</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth <hi>Esai</hi> 66:18. and 2:2. and elsewhere. (5.) And that it must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricked so here, is manifest, from the very word <hi>Propitiation</hi>; for if it be taken for the actual <hi>Application</hi> of the benefites of Christs death, according to the parallel place <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:25. where it is said to be by faith, then it is manifest, that Beleevers only are intended here; and indeed the whole discourse is intended
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:66147:116"/>
for the comfort of Beleevers, against incident sinnes; and not for the comfort of Others. And if it be meaned of <hi>Impetration</hi>; even then there must be a restriction, to such as either are, or through grace shall be made beleevers; for only such (as we did shew above) are they, for whom Christ is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation. Shall Christ be looked upon, as an Advocate with the Father, for the wicked Reprobate? In this word <hi>propitiation,</hi> there is an allusion to the cover of the Ark, and Mercy seat, called <gap reason="foreign">

And shall we say, that this is common to all the world? Or that all this importeth only a Possible Reconciliation and Remission? or that it is for such, as shall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves suffer the vengeance of eternal fire for ever? Let <hi>Quakers</hi> beleeve this, if they will, for my part, I cannot (6.) Why the Apostle should use this general terme, in a restricted sense, we formerly gave a reason: see §. 59. and 60. This Apostle conversing most with Jewes <hi>Gal.</hi> 2:9. wrote this Epistle, unto them, as is most probable, they having first had the offer made unto them, which is hinted in this same <hi>Chapter vers.</hi> 7. And so he useth the word <hi>World,</hi> in a sense, which they understood well, to wit as importing the Gentiles, whom he would hereby insinuate, to be now taken-in, and no more strangers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, the partition wall being broken down. And hereby it appeareth, that there is no tautologie in the words, when he sayes, <hi>he is a propitiation for our sinnes,</hi> who are beleevers of the Jewes: but <hi>also for the sinnes of the people of God among the Gentiles,</hi> (who are expresly called the world, in opposition to the Jewes <hi>Rom.</hi> 11:15.) or of the children of God through the world as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11:51, 52. where this same Apostle giveth us the plaine meaning of this word. (7.) As for 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5:13. It is manifest, how impertinent that is to this purpose, and if this man will urge it, in its latitude, he shall make the Apostle contradict himself, for the <hi>whole World</hi> may take in beleevers; and whereas he thinks the word <hi>world,</hi> used in one and the same Epistle, must necessarily import one and the same thing, he sheweth himself a stranger in the Scriptures, where several times an antanaclasis, or the same word having distinct significations, is used, not only in the same Book or Epistle, but in the same verse, pronunced with the same breath as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>and</hi> 3: <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8: <hi>v.</hi> 22. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: <hi>v.</hi> 16. to name no moe.</p>

Because I do not lay much weight upon the Authority of men, in this matter (and this man for all his faire shew of respect to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, in citing some five or six sentences, out of all their writtings, within few lines condemneth them all, pretending that the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are but of

and Gospel, the knowledge of which, he saith, they have gote by the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jesus Christ, and have it confirmed by their sensible Experience, and sealed by the Inward Testimony of the Spirit, in their hearts. He layeth downe the mater in three Propositions <hi>Pag.</hi> 79. § 11.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re I proceed in the examination of the grounds thereof, I must premise these two things, <hi>first.</hi> That all this is founded upon the errour of <hi>Vniversal Redemption,</hi> which we have rejected and confuted in the preceeding <hi>Chapter,</hi> and when the only pillar, on which this new Fabrick is erected, is taken away, by such force of Scripture and Reason, as this Man, I suppose, shall be forced to yeeld unto, or declare himself to be self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, the building setled thereupon, needeth no more than its owne weight, to bring it downe headlong. And when further <hi>Chap.</hi> VII. we have vindicated the doctrine of <hi>Reprobation</hi> and free <hi>Election,</hi> (which this man laboured with all his might to take out of the way, knowing that if that should stand, his New Religion or rather Old <hi>Pelagian</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminian</hi> Delusion, should finde no footing, we might forbear the further examination of his following doctrine, which is but so many native consequences, flowing from false Grounds and Positions. But <hi>Secondly.</hi> I cannot well understand, how he can say, that he and the rest of the <hi>Quakers</hi> have this confirmed unto them by their sensible Experience, it not being a matter, that can come under that manner of cognition: it seemeth, that their inward senses are so quick and lively, that they can sensate what is not sensible. But I finde it usual with him, to say so much weight upon his owne Experience and Feeling, as if it were the whole basis of his new Inventions and Doctrine, that it is no wonder, he make use of it, in all cases, pertinent, or impertinent, all is a matter, <hi>valeat quantum valere potest,</hi> every one will not advert to its imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, but beleeve the man speaking from his owne Experience, what his owne Experience can never make him sensib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. We have seen what his Proposition is; and the meaning of it is in short this, so farr as I can take it up, That because God hath an inconceivably great love to all, &amp; desire to save all, &amp; for this end sent his Son to die alike for all, &amp; every man &amp; mothers son, he granteth to all &amp; every man a certain space of time, within which if they accept of the offer of peace, &amp; hearken to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it is well, they shall be saved: but if not, they must perish: But if now we enquire; How this matter cometh to the knowledge of every son of <hi>Adam:</hi> for it is but reasonable they hear of the termes, on which they may be saved, before they be condemned for rejecting of them? He will tell us afterward of an <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66147:118"/>
Gospel,</hi> making the matter known to all &amp; every one. But againe, if we enquire, Whether or not every one of <hi>Adam's</hi> posterity hath Power in himself &amp; gracious Ability, qualifying his Natural Faculties, to accept of this offer? He will tell us afterward, that there is <hi>an Universal Saving Grace and Light</hi> given to every man, whereby this may be brought to passe, if <hi>Freewill</hi> be so kinde, and tender of the mans salvation. Whence we see, that Salvation lyeth equally at every mans door, be he <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Gentile, Schythian</hi> or <hi>Barbarian, Turk</hi> or <hi>Christian</hi>: And every man hath Power and Ability, Moral, to lay hold on Salvation, if he be disposed to accept thereof: This, and nothing else, must be the Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, whereof he speaketh; so that there is not requisite hereunto any new grant of Grace, or Divine Helpe, to quicken the man, or to work Faith or any other grace requisite in him, he hath a stock, from his Mothers womb, which is sufficient, if he will but improve it, and that notwithstanding of any thing he lost in <hi>Adam</hi>: (it was not then, we see, for nothing, that this <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> was so much against <hi>Original sin,</hi> as we heard.) Now this being the proper and native face of this mans doctrine, let any man tell me, wherein it differeth from the Old <hi>Pelagian</hi> and late <hi>Popish, Iesuitical, Arminian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Errour? And yet so vaine and confident is the man, in his Ignorance and Self Admiration, that he holdeth these things forth, as a New Revelation (from the lying Spirit that hath bin a lyar and murderer from the beginning, no doubt) communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated only unto the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are but a company of ignorant mechanicks, not acquanted with controversies, or read in the writtings of <hi>Pelagians, Iesuites, Arminians and Socinians.</hi> And it may be, this is all the ground of his conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, as to the unlearned and unread <hi>Quakers,</hi> to be from Revelation, little knowing or observing, how deeply this erroneous imagination is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted and rooted in the corrupt heart of every son of <hi>Adam,</hi> so that they learne it without book, or study; yea so that all the preaching of the Gospel of truth will never be able to eradicate these Natural errours, particularly this Natural <hi>Pelagianisme, Iesuitisme, Arminianisme and Socinianisme,</hi> out of their mindes and hearts, till the Grace of God come: and hence is it, that the Gospel, which is the doctrine of the Grace of God, diametrically opposite to this delusion, which is, in all points, a sworne enemy to the grace of God, is so little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and closed with by many, who live and die under the clear Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof. And it is no wonder, that these false imaginations, being natural &amp; in laid in our corrupt natures, have so deep an Impression, &amp; be looked upon, by this Corruption, that is as blinde as self conceity, as Impressions of the Spirit, especially when the God of this world, who is in them blinding their mindes, doth concurre to fortifie this Prejudice against the doctrine of the true grace of God, and withall transformeth himself into an Angel of light, for this effect: which consideration moderateth our astonishment at the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Confidence of the <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. When he cometh to explaine this proposition <hi>Pag.</hi> 82. §. 12. he tels us what he meaneth by <hi>this day and time of visitation, that God hath granted unto all
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66147:118"/>
men:</hi> And negatively he sayes he <hi>doth not mean, every man's tearme of life, though as to some, as for example the penitent thiefe, it may extend so far.</hi> But wherein consisteth this visitation? This was the chiefe thing that was here to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained: we must, it seems, waite for his meaning till a fitter season afterward. A day of gracious visitation and invitation in the Gospel offer, we acknowledge; But what it is, which is granted to the Heathens, that can go under this name, I am yet to learne, knowing no dispensation of God, that can be called a day of Visitation, in reference to Salvation, but what it is in and through the preaching of the Gospel, which bringeth life and immortality to light, and which therefore cannot be said to be granted to such, as never heard of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then he tels us positively, that it is <hi>only such a time, in which God is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently exonered of the condemnation of every man, which may be longer to some, and shorter to others, as it seemeth good unto God, according to his wisdom.</hi> That no flesh shall have any ground of quarrelling with God, I am past all doubt; But if this man think, that in some cases, God is in hazard to be impanneled by man, it concernes him to make this matter more plaine to us, who see no such hazard, and can apprehend no such danger. If he learne any thing of this out of the Scriptures, he would do well to acquaint us therewith; if he have it only by Revelation, I am not like to bottome my faith upon his said or supposed Revelations. Sure, I think he should have given us some other ground for all this difference, that God maketh among men, granting to some a longer day, and to others a shorter day of Visitation, than is the good pleasure of God; for he cannot but know, that we lay this down for a ground, why some get no such day of Visitation, I mean as to the preaching of the Gospel; and yet this will not satisfy him, and others of his kinde, who take upon them with no small boldness, to tell us of Rules of Justice, of their owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, which God must not transgress. What if some say, That God is not Iust and Righteous enough, if he grant not to all an equally long day of Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Will he think to satisfy them with saying, <hi>So it seemeth good to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Wisdom?</hi> If so, he must be very partial, who will not accept of this answere out of our mouth, when, sure, it may sufficiently serve to stop his mouth; seing it can not helpe him, to say, that in the other case God should be less Unjust; for in no degree, how small so ever, can God be Unjust. But all this is but what some <hi>Papists</hi> say, who will not have this sufficient grace alwayes at hand, but say that some sinne it away, as may be seen in <hi>Bellarmin.

May it not come to passe that such, after that day, may heare the Gospel preached? no doubt, he will say, yea: is not then the Lord mocking them, when he inviteth them to Repentance &amp; Salvation, after it is Impossible for them to Repent &amp; be saved?

They were these, whom the Apostle looked upon, as having <hi>obtained like pretious faith,</hi> with him and others, <hi>through the righteousness of God, and our Saviour Iesus Christ</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:1. and whom he stileth <hi>beloved Chap.</hi> 3:1, 8, 14, 17. and such as were <hi>looking for the comeing of the day of God, and for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness vers.</hi> 12, 13, 14 and such as were in case to <hi>grow in grace, &amp; in the knowledge of Iesus Christ vers.</hi> 18: Now to these only, and such as belonged to the Election of grace, whom the Lord was yet to bring-in, the Lord's delay to destroy the world with fire (which is the long suffering here spoken of, as <hi>vers.</hi> 9. cleareth) was salvation, because he would want none of them, that his body (to which they belonged as members) might be compleat. But he tels us further, to as little purpose, <hi>that Peter in this matter looketh to Paul's writt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, insinuating that this was the Catholick and common doctrine of the Church.</hi> And why should it not be so, as we have cleared it. And <hi>Paul</hi> also, in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> (which is the writing of <hi>Paul</hi> to them, to whom <hi>Peter</hi> is now writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as appeares 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:1.) speaketh to this same purpose <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35. to the end.

possible, in his sense, to all and every person. And I suppose these words of the Apostle <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well doing, seek for glory and honour and immortality; Eternal life,</hi> will import some other thing. This seeking <hi>after glory and honour and immortality</hi> &amp; that by <hi>well doing</hi> (or, as the opposition made <hi>vers.</hi> 8. cleareth, by <hi>doing the truth,</hi> &amp; <hi>obeying righteousness,</hi> &amp; <hi>by working good</hi> as <hi>vers.</hi> 10.) and by <hi>continuance in well doing,</hi> &amp; by <hi>patient continuance in well doing,</hi> cannot sure be performed by any, by the meer strength of Nature, and without the Grace of God. And how shall it be performed by them, that know nothing of an Eternal life, or of Glory and Honour and Immortality; &amp; so cannot seek after it, &amp; that in such a manner? Will he say, that all the Heathens &amp; Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, the Cannibals, &amp; Men-eaters, &amp; such as have little more of Men, than the outward visage, &amp; positure of the body, are acquainted with these things; &amp; can by their owne Industry &amp; Paines reach the crowne of immortal glory?

All which this man deduceth from all of them is this. <hi>That this parable could be no wayes Apposite to them, to whom it was spoken, unlesse these labourers might have brought forth frute; such a possibility had they, that Christ by the Prophet saith,</hi> what was more to be done to my vineyard, which I have not done? <hi>Answere.</hi> (1.) What can this prove for them, who had not such paines taken upon them? had no vineyaird erected among them? This man is good at concluding an Unlimited Universal from a plainly Restricted Particular. (2.) That it was their duty to have brought forth fruite, is certane; that they had power of themselves, without the grace of God, to have brought forth saving fruite, he hath not proved, neither can reprove 3.) To say, that therefore they could not be blamed, is <hi>a Pelagian</hi> Erour, &amp; such as himself cannot allow of, if he will not contradict himself; for after the day of Visitation is past with a man, that man hath no more Power or possibility of doing any good, and yet he will not say. that therefore he cannot sinne, &amp; become blame worthy after that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. (4.) Any may see, that the parable, mentioned by the Evangelists, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mainly the Priests &amp; Rulers, &amp; not the People, though in their hearing it was spoken; and that it was to exaggerat their cruelty, &amp; rage against his faithful servants, and that, which they wert shortly to exercise against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the true Son &amp; Heire. And who knoweth not, that even without saving grace, they might have foreborne these acts of cruelty, &amp; that it was really in their power? And thence to inferre a power of doing all requisite to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, must be such logick, as is hateht in a distempered braine, &amp; a clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof (5.) When the Lord said by his prophet, <hi>what could be more done &amp;c.</hi> He speaketh only of external meanes, whereof there was no defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; but these they had were sufficient in their own kinde, and enough, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66147:123"/>
more than enough to convince all of the height of the wickedness of the Jewes, who under all this plenty of means brought forth (as to the generality, and body of the people, concerning whom he is speaking) nothing but wild grapes, yea stincking grapes, as the word importeth; so that their deeds were worse, then the deeds of the heathens, who neither had such Meanes, nor outward Favoures conferred upon them <hi>Ier.</hi> 5: <hi>ver.</hi> 28. He citeth as of the same import, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1:24, 25, 26. <hi>Ier.</hi> 18:9, 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18:32, 33, 34. &amp; <hi>Act</hi> 13:46. But he tels us not what use he would make of them. That persons may and will refuse the Lords call, who doubteth? Because they can do evil, have they therefore a Power to do good? Or because they may forbear some acts of cruelty towards others, will it thence follow, that they have a power to do that which hath a certain connexion with Salvation? These are <hi>Quaker</hi>-like Inferences, that want all solidity, and no little of sobriety.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In the last place he citeth <hi>Mat.</hi> 23:37. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13:34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19:41, 42. whence he Inferreth <hi>first, that there was a day, wherein the inhabitants of Ierusalem might have known the things, that belong to their peace.</hi> Nex, <hi>that in that day, God would have gathered their children, as an hen her chickens</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that they would not; and because they would not, they were now hid from their eyes, so as they could not see, that day being expired; and therefore they were justly condemned and obdured. Ans.</hi> (1.) That the inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had a faire sun shine day of the Gospel, at that time, is most certain: but had all the world, and every city of the world, from the beginning of the world, unto that day, and since to this day, such a faire day light? If <hi>yea,</hi> whence is it proved? This text proveth no such thing, but in the rare phancy of this <hi>Quaker,</hi> who supposeth that a Particular will prove a General: Just as if he should say, He, and some few others are, <hi>Quakers</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world are turned <hi>Quakers,</hi> and were <hi>Quakers</hi> from the beginning, &amp; shall be <hi>Quakers</hi> to the end of the world. But if <hi>not,</hi> how then doth he conclude the thing, that is in question? (2.) The text speaketh nothing of this Power and Ability to know: But Christ, as man, Pathetically expresseth his vehement and earnest desire, that they had known: And therefore there is no ground for any such conclusion, as he would hence inferre. (3.) That the Lord Jesus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with earnestness and love, to have gathered their children, as a hen doth her chickens under her wings, is very true; but hence he cannot prove, that God hath Ineffectual Desires and Wishes after the salvation of the damned: what is spoken of Christ, as man, and a preacher of Righteousness, can with no shew of reason be applied to God. (4.) That the Lord punisheth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Gospel, with Darkness, Judicial strokes, and Desolation, is true, and asserted by us above; but none can hence inferre, what this man would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that knoweth what he saith.</p>
               <p n="18">18. What followeth Pag. 96.97. is but what we willingly confess, &amp; have asserted above, to wit, that after the Contempt of Mercy &amp; Salvation offered, God giveth up to hardness of heart, as <hi>Esai.</hi> 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13:14. <hi>Mark.</hi> 4:12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8:10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12:40. <hi>Act</hi> 28:26. But when he speaketh of the talents given <hi>Mat.</hi> 25:14 &amp;c. he insinuateth that the one talent was sufficient, being of the same kinde with the rest: But how hath he proved, that by these talents is meaned

saving grace? And that by persons, or servants, to whom these talents were given, are meant all and every man, from the beginning of the world to the end; and that their tradeing with the same, importeth power and ability in themselves, without divine help and grace, to improve these gifts or graces to a spiritual and saving advantage? Sure, the Scripture tels us, <hi>that without Christ we can do nothing Ioh.</hi> 15:3, 1, 5, 7. and that it is <hi>the grace of God, that doth all in us,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15:10. And <hi>that of ourselves, as of ourselves, we are not sufficient to think anything, but our sufficiency is of God.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:5. and that it <hi>is God, that worketh in us, both to will and to do Phil.</hi> 2:<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay this, with them, is the Spirit of God, it is Christ, God Father, Son &amp; holy Ghost, and what not?

(5.) The Scripture tels us, that the seed of God remaineth, and that it is proper to such as are borne of God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:9. and so it is not common to all, nor can it be exstinguished or killed (6.)

He saith, this <hi>seed</hi> &amp;c. is not the very essence of God: &amp; how in this, he contradicteth others, whose expressions to the contrary we mentioned just now, let all judge. But he lenifieth the mater, by saying, that <hi>it is not the essence and nature of God taken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely in it self;</hi> So then it seemeth, that it is the Essence of God, considered some other way; whence it appeareth, that all men are partakers of the very Essence of God, though not as considered precisely in it self, but some other way, What blasphemy is wraped up here, let any ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If of saving and gracious actions, how is it given to and implanted in every man, how Atheistical and wicked soever he be?

(5.) He saith, God dwelleth in this Principle and Organ; but how can that be? That God is said to dwell among his people, in respect of the signes of his Presence, and of the effects of his Love, Care and Tenderness of them, we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 25: <hi>vers.</hi> 8. &amp; 29:45, 46. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5:3. &amp; 35:34. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12:11. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33:12. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6:13. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 43:7, 9, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.10, 11. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23:25. But this was not common to all Nations, but was the special privilege of that people. So we hear of God's, of the Spirits, and of Christs dwelling in the souls of his beloved and sanctified ones, by more special significations of his Favour, and gracious Workings of his Love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:9, 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6:16. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3:17. <hi>Revel</hi> 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14:17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:16. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 1:14. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:24. &amp; 4:12, 15, 16.

But grace is not propagat by nature. Had <hi>Adam</hi> this seed in him after he fell, and before the promise of the seed of the woman was made to him? Then he lost it not by the fall; but by the fall, sure, he lost all inclination to spiritual good. If he represented all Mankinde, in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, as he did in the Old Covenant of works, then, as his fall did redound, in the one, to the actual condemnation of his posterity, so should his faith (for we charitably suppose, he was a beleever) redound, in the other, to the actual salvation of all: of what necessity then should the sacrifice of Christ be? (2.) All were partakers of the evil fruits of <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, actually and not potentially only; for there is none that escapeth: but the feeling of the vertue of this divine seed, is but a possibility; so that, notwithstanding this divine seed be said to be in all, yet it might so fall out, that not one should be saved; for to have a power only to feel this seed, importeth no actual feeling, till Free will come in, and determine the matter; nor hath it any efficacious influence upon Free will to determine it, but leaveth it to its free choice. (3.) Is this all the benefite, that is had by Christ's Obedience and Death, that people <hi>may</hi> be turned from evil to good? then it seemeth Christ's death was not so effectual for the good of any, as <hi>Adam's</hi> sin was for the hurt of all. Is this to magnifie and exalt the Sacrifice of Christ? (4.) If this be all that Christ purchased, to wit, a power to turne from evil to good, and to feel the vertue of this seed, if men will, he hath purchased nothing but what is Natural, or what is inferiour to common moral vertues; for it is natural to have a power to do or not do, as men will, and a moral vertue is more than such a power; because it leaveth not the man in a state of pure indifferency, but inclineth him to acts of such a vertue, and only to such acts. And if Christ purchased only this power, he purchased no more a power to do good, than a power to do evil; for the power of it self is indifferent to both, no more inclined to the one, then to the other: So that Christ hath purchased <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The light of Nature, and of Common honesty, and the knowledge of some things of that kinde, is neither Soul nor Faculty; and yet it is no grace, nor any thing but Nature, &amp; some Reliques or rubbish of the old building; And, forsooth, to make us think, that he is no <hi>Socinian,</hi> nor <hi>Pelagian,</hi> he tels us againe, that the Light
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:66147:134"/>
he speaketh of, is not only different from the Soul and its Faculties, but is of another Nature; as if the <hi>Socinians Reason,</hi> and the <hi>Pelagians</hi> Nature or Grace, could not also be distinguished from the Soul and its faculties. The acts and exercise of the Faculties, is not the same with the soul, or with the faculties of the soul themselves: no more than seeing or hearing is the same with the eye &amp; eare. But he addeth. <hi>That meer rationality cannot savingly understand any thing in things spiritual, yea is a great impediment thereof, and enemy thereto.</hi> And the same we say of the Seed and Principle, he talketh of, and saith is in all men, though he give it goodly names, and call it the Spirit, supposing that <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 3:16. main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man breathing, when he saith, <hi>know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you</hi>? and not remembering that the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:9. maketh this the peculiar privilege of the Saints, saying, <hi>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be, that the Spirit of God dwell in you: Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</hi> But this is a maine business, &amp; it doth not a little concerne him and his cause, to shew a clear difference (if there be any) betwixt his opinion, and that of <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi>: and yet, instead of doing this, he runneth out in extravagancies, to bewilder his Reader, telling us <hi>Pag.</hi> 87. &amp; 88. that <hi>when the principle or rational propriety exalts it self, to reigne and rule in spiritual things above the seed, then the seed is wounded.</hi> We know, that corruption and carnal reason, can and doth fight and strive against the grace of God, in God's people; and that in others it will rise up against the Truth and authority of God, in the Scriptures: But to imagine such a thing, as either of these, in persons living in heathenisme, without God, and without Christ, &amp; without the very report of the Gospel, is to dream wakeing. And to call it An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, riseing-up against Christ (as he doth call it) is but a Notional juggle, to hide their blasphemies.</p>
               <p n="21">21. He goeth on to tell us his dreams, for he saith, as <hi>God created the sun to give light by day, and the moon by night; so he hath given to men the spiritual and divine light of his Son, to rule them in Spiritual things, and the light of reason to rule them in Natural things &amp;c.</hi> These are but impertinent fancies; for he should cleare to us here, how that, which he calleth the Spiritual and divine Light of Christ, which is in every man, differeth from Nature, or the Natural Enduements, which accompany the Rational soul; that it may appear, that he is no <hi>Pelagian,</hi> nor <hi>Socinian</hi>: for we grant, that there is a spiritual and divine light of Christ, which only can savingly make the spiritual things of God manifest to the soul; but this is not common to all, but peculiar to God's peculiar ones, if we may believe the Scripture: and in this sense, it is true, which he saith, That reason must be illuminated with this divine light, before it can rightly take up Spiritual things; but that divine light is some other thing, then the Light within.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Againe He would make us beleeve, that this Light in every man, he tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, is distinguished from the Natural Conscience, upon this ground, that the Natural Conscience can be defiled <hi>Tit.</hi> 1:15. but the light cannot, for it maketh manifest all things that are to be reproved <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5:13. But how cleareth he that the light, that is in every man by nature, cannot be defiled?
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:66147:135"/>
The Apostle in that cited place <hi>Tit.</hi> 1:15. sayes that the Mindes and Conscience (and what light is in men is there) of unbeleevers are defiled. And as for that light mentioned <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5:13. He will never prove, that is a light com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, especially when the next <hi>verse</hi> restricketh it to them, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake out of sleep, and are arisen from the dead (which cannot, I suppose, be said of all men) &amp; get this light from Christ.

So that the whole scope of the place manifesteth this mans detorsion thereof. The Apostle is exhorting them, who sometimes were darkness, but now were light in the Lord, to walk as Children of light, and to reprove the unfruitful works of darkness <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 11. shewing what is the true nature of that light, whereof they are now made partakers, being light in the Lord, and brought out of the state of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>viz.</hi> to discover, and make manifest such unworthy actions, to the end they may be shuned, and thought shame of. What he addeth of conscience challenging and vexing, for what is not wrong, according to its misinforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is nothing to the purpose, now in hand, unless to give a convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against himself; and to shew, that the Light in <hi>Turks,</hi> who are chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by their misinformed and deceived consciences, for drinking of wine, prohibited by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> is nothing different from the darkness of their blinded consciences; for how will he prove, that there is any spiritual light in them, witnessing the contrary, of what their blinded and misguided conscience saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of the same nature and import is that which he addeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 89. of the blinded conscience of Papists, challenging for eating flesh in Lent. But he addeth, that <hi>the light of Christ, will never consent to such abominations, but taketh away blindness, openeth the Intellect, and directeth judgment and conscience.</hi> All which is very true of the true light of Christ, bestowed upon beleevers, and revealed in his word; but is most false of his Light, which is in all men naturally, and common to all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> Heathens, Turks, and Cannibals, as well as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in name and thing. And while the <hi>Quakers</hi> preach up this, as a sure guide to life eternal, they are abominable <hi>Pelagian,</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> deceivers, who should be fled from, as the most impudent and sworne enemies of the Grace of God, and of His Gospel, that ever appeared out of the bottomless Pit; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of pure Pagan-preachers, whose doctrine is Paganisme, and driveth thereunto.</p>
               <p n="23">23. In the last place, as a plaister to cover all the deformities of his opinion, hithertil held forth, he tels us, that <hi>this light and seed is not the power and faculty of the mans soul, whereof a man is master, and can exercise when he will, if no natural defect hinder; for a man cannot stirre up, when he pleaseth, this Light and seed, but it moveth and breatheth and contendeth with men, as the Lord seeth good; so that a man, even though he hath some sense of his misery, cannot, when he will by his stirring up of this light, attaine tenderness of heart; but he must attend to that, which at certain times
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66147:135"/>
cometh upon all, in which it wonderfully mollifieth and warmeth the heart, and worketh in the man; at which, time, if the man resist not, but joyn with it, he obtaineth salvation thereby</hi>: And he compareth it with the Spirits moving the waters of <hi>Bethesda</hi> (not <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> as he saith) and addeth, that <hi>God, in love to all mankinde, worketh so in the heart, by this seed, at certain singular times, setting their sins in order, before their eyes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting to repentance, and offering remission of sinnes and salvation, which if man refuse not, he may be saved.</hi> Then he is so perswaded of the truth hereof, that he is <hi>assured, no man that readeth this, and dealeth honestly with his own heart, in the sight of God, will not acquiesce thereunto, and in some measure be sensible thereof:</hi> Closeing with this <hi>Epiphonema.</hi> That <hi>this is the pretious day of visitation, which who soever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not, shall be happy for ever. This is the day of the Lord, which is as lightning shining from east to west; and as the winde, or the Spirit, breathing into the soul, and its sound is heard, but we know not, whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.</hi>

                  </gap> But it is usual for these men, to play thus boldly with the Scriptures, as men, that have not the fear of God before their eyes. (3.) He taketh no notice, that his writings are not likely to come into the hands of Heathens, Pagans, Turks and Barbarians. And so his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of this day of visitation and faire opportunity of Salvation, to all, is but vaine. (4.) We are to see afterward, if he can prove from Scripture, that God hath planted such a Seed in every man. (5.) He saith here, that God hath certain singular times, wherein he thus cometh; but in the preceding <hi>Chapter,</hi> we observed another account of this day of Visitation, as of a day, that did not goe and come againe, as the Angels moving of the waters of <hi>Bethesda.</hi> Or he must say, that this day cometh but once, in a mans whole life time; so that, if men repent not at that very houre or moment, they shall never be saved. And if this be his doctrine, it is neither consonont to his expressions elsewhere, not to the Scriptures; nor is it comfortable to either one or other. (6) It is absolutely false, That God offereth remission of sins &amp; salvation to every man, upon condition of non-refusal; for He offereth remission and salvation to none, but in Christ, and that upon the condition of faith in Jesus: as the whole Gospel cleareth. And this offer is not made to any, to whom the Gospel is not preached; for it is the Gospel, wherby life and immortality is brought to light, and wherein Christ is held forth, as the Propitiation: it is the power of God unto salvation, to every one that beleeveth, for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1:16, 17. So that this mans doctrine destroyeth the whole Gospel, and rendreth the whole administration thereof useless; yea it taketh away the death of Christ and his merites and blood shed, when it taketh away faith, that must lay hold upon it. (7.) What is this <hi>not-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66147:136"/>
&amp; not-refusing,</hi> that he talks of? The <hi>Arminians</hi> spoke at this rate. Is this any thing else, than the use of Free will at whose devotion, Christ and his Salvation is? This even this, with the <hi>Pelagianizing, Socinianizing</hi> and <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianizing Quakers,</hi> is the thing, that must weare the crowne, and have all the glory of our Salvation, and to it must the everlasting songs be sung. Glory, honour and Praise must be given to our owne noble and well inclined <hi>Freewill,</hi> that did not resist, nor refuse, in the day of visitation. <hi>Let never my soul come into these mens secrete</hi>? (8.) That God wonderfully warmeth and mollifieth the heart of every son of <hi>Adam,</hi> at some one time or other, is meer <hi>Quakerisme,</hi> that is to say, a vaine dream. And that God wonderfully mollifieth &amp; warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart of a man, in reference to salvation, and that yet the man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the call, and perish, may be true or false, according as that mollifying &amp; warming is interpreted; But if it be taken for the gracious working of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God (as, it may be, he will take it) he proclameth <hi>Armianisme:</hi> If he take it for some common operation of the Spirit, &amp; yet say, that mans not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of this, alone without any more, will certainly prove saving, he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> and denieth the necessity of the grace of God. (9.) <hi>In fine</hi> we see, that this Plaister will not cover the sore; Nor free him from the charge of <hi>Pelagianisme</hi>: For <hi>Pelagius</hi> said as much and more, as <hi>Vossius Hist. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. cleareth, out of <hi>Augustine:</hi> for he tels us that <hi>Pelagius,</hi> explaining the nature of that grace, which he at length came to acknowledge, said it did nor consist in the Law only, but in the help and <hi>adjutorium</hi> of God. But this <hi>Quaker</hi> will not admit the grace of the Law, or doctrine of Christ; for the preaching of the Gospel with him is not necessary unto Salvation. Yet hear <hi>Pelagius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Lord helpeth us</hi> (said he) <hi>by his Doctrine and Revelation, while be openeth the eyes of our heart—while he illuminateth us with the ineffable gift of his heavenly grace.</hi> Is not this as much, as this <hi>Quaker</hi> saith, when he speaketh of Gods stirring up this light that is within every man? Nay it is more; for <hi>Pelagiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> hereby granted a real operation of the Spirit upon the Minde, illuminating it by an unspeakable gift of heavenly grace; but our <hi>Quakers</hi> illumination is nothing but God's putting the natural conscience to work. And will this <hi>Quaker</hi> say more then, or as much a <hi>Pelagius</hi> said, on these words, <hi>God worketh in us both to will and to do. God doth this</hi> (said he) <hi>while he stirreth us up by the greatness of future glory, and the promise of reward; and while by the revelation of wisdom, he stirreth up the lazie will unto the love of God, and while he perswadeth to every thing that is good.</hi> Will this <hi>Quaker</hi> say, that God doth even this much to every one of the Heathens? What Knowledge of the greatness of future glory, or of the promise of the rich recompence of reward; what Revelation of Wisdom; What Love to the true and only God, is or can be imagined to be, among all, and every one of the Heathens? <hi>Pelagius</hi> did very carefully distinguish betwixt <hi>Posse, Velle</hi> &amp; <hi>Agere.</hi> And he said, the <hi>first</hi> did properly belong to God, who bestowed it upon his Creature: But the other two were wholly of man. Now all that this <hi>Quaker</hi> ascribeth here to God, is but he first possibility; for the man is left at liberty to will or nill, as he pleaseth, and to operate, or not operate, as he thinketh good. This Possibility, <hi>Pelagius</hi> said, every man had, whether he would or
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:66147:136"/>
not; but the will and the deed was in his own power Hath not our <hi>Quake</hi> sucked this mans brests? And as <hi>Pelagius</hi> would acknowledge no necessity of grace to help us to will and to do, or to cause us will and do, beside this Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or illumination of the minde; So this <hi>Quaker</hi> restricketh all the grace of God unto the stirring up of the Light. Saith he any thing of Grace, causing the Man to consent? Or taking away that resistance? No; <hi>Pelagians, Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Socinians</hi> and <hi>Iesuites,</hi> are dearer friends to him, than that he should put any dishonour on their <hi>Diana, Free will.</hi>

               <p n="25">25. Having thus traversed this mans explication of that Universal Grace, Light or Seed, which he asserteth; and having traced him to his denne: We come to examine his grounds for this wilde Assertion, held forth §. 21. <hi>Pag.</hi> 98. &amp;c. He first adduceth <hi>Ioh</hi> 1: <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> And this, he saith, some call the <hi>Quakers</hi> text: but I would rather call it their stumbling block, and neck-break; because it is a passage, which they do wrest, as they do also other Scriptures, unto their owne destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh, of some in his dayes 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3:16. Concerning these words of <hi>Iohn,</hi> it would be noticed (1.) Some joyn these words, which we have rendered, <hi>that cometh into the world,</hi> not with <hi>every man,</hi> as in our transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but with the word <hi>light,</hi> rendering the words thus, <hi>that true light, which lighteth man, was coming into the world,</hi> according to the like phrases, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10:32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5:16. &amp; 15:1. <hi>Act.</hi> 8:28. Not as if the meaning were, that Christ did enlighten every man, by coming into the world, as if he did not enlighten them before: But this they give to be the meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Iohn</hi> hereby is point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the incarnation of the word, showing that the light, the true light, which lighteneth every man, did come into the world: and why we may not thus take the words, rather than as they are commonly rendered, I do not yet see any cogent reason. (2.) As to this illumination, which this light commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth, when it is said to enlighten, it is not one and the same way understood by all; Some take it to be understood of the common light of nature, whereof all are in one measure, or other, partakers: So <hi>Calvin, Musculus</hi> and others, on the place, and among the Ancients <hi>Cyrillus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>in Ioan. Cap.</hi> 9. The <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> bend all their strength against this exposition, because they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg this Light, Life, and Word, to be the true &amp; living God, equal with the Father in power and glory; And with these <hi>Socinians</hi> this <hi>Quaker</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in his opposition to this sense. Others mean hereby Spiritual Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by true and saving grace; but yet do not say, that this is actually commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to every man; but that the meaning is, all that are spiritually illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated have this Illumination from that Light. And this way <hi>Augustine</hi> of old, and others of late, interpret the words, explaining it by this simile, a School-master may be said to reach all the children of such a place, though all &amp; every one without exception are not taught by him, because all that are taught in that place, are taught by him alone: But why both may not be here included, I see not; this serving the more to set forth the excellency of Christ, yea and his Godhead, which <hi>Iohn</hi> principally here intendeth, as is apparent from almost every verse, from the beginning, where he is spoken of, whatever the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:66147:137"/>
                  <hi>Socinians</hi> invent, and say to the contrary: And this being true, that Jesus Christ, the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> here spoken of, is true God <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and the creator of all things <hi>vers.</hi> 3. it cannot be denyed, that he is the Author of all that light, wherewith men are enlightened, and that even the light of Nature and Reason is from Him, who is the fountaine of all Light and Life. Nor must we therefore say, that the Spiritual light is as common as the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: Nor is the intendment of the <hi>Euangelist</hi> here, to assert this; because he had said <hi>vers.</hi> 7. that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> came to bear witness of this Light, that all men through him might beleeve, pointing out, that the way of partaking of the spiritual light and life, which Christ, as a fountaine, communicateth, was by faith: and it is notoure enough, that all men have not Faith, and therefore all men are not partakers of this Illumination. And further <hi>Iohn</hi> tels us afterward <hi>vers.</hi> 10. that the <hi>world knew not Christ</hi>: And yet all that are spiritually illuminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have gotten an understanding from Christ, <hi>know him, that is true, &amp; are in him, that is true, even in his Son Iesus Christ. This is the true God, &amp; eternal life,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5:20. And <hi>vers.</hi> 11. that Christ <hi>came unto his owne, &amp; his owne received him not</hi>: But certain it is, that all, who are spiritually illuminated, receive Christ; They who have the eyes of their understandings enlightened, &amp; have the Spirit of Wisdom &amp; Revelation, in the knowledge of Christ, cannot but imbrace him. Nay the whole Scripture confirmeth this. And if it be enquired, why is it then said, that He enlighteneth every man? I <hi>Answere,</hi> To shew the enlargement of the object of this rich favour bestowed by Christ, beyond what light, <hi>Iohn,</hi> held forth, who, in his witnessing ministrie, was restricted unto <hi>Iudea</hi>: and further seing it is said of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he came to <hi>bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might beleeve,</hi> when yet <hi>Iohn</hi> did bear witness unto a very small part of all men: We see no reason, why the <hi>every man</hi> mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 9. should be understood so universally, except with this restriction, <hi>every man that beleeveth.</hi> But mainely it is said, that this Light doth thus Spiritually enlighten every man because it is he alone that hath enlightened, in all ages and under all dispe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sations of the Covenant, both before and after the Law, and now, all Nations, without such distinction, or discrimination, as was under the Law. <hi>Finally</hi> if all and every man be Spiritually Illuminated by Christ, all and every man must be saved, for this Spiritual Illumination is wrought by the indwelling Spirit, which is not given to all, but to Christs peculiar ones <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:9. And the Scripture tels us of many, whose <hi>understandings are darkened Ephes.</hi> 4:18. who are <hi>of night and of darkness</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5:5. and <hi>under the power of darkness Col.</hi> 1:13. are <hi>in darkness, and abideth in darkness, and walke in darkness Ioh.</hi> 8:12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12:35, 46. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5:4 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1:6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2:9, 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2:9. <hi>Act.</hi> 26:18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1:79. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2:19. And who can think, that these and such like expressions can be used of those, whom Christ doth enlighten with Grace and Spirituall Illumination?</p>
               <p n="26">26. Hence it appeareth, that however we take these words, they can afford no countenance unto the <hi>Quakers</hi> Imagination; for though it be true, that all men are enlightened, one way or other, in one measure or other, by Christ; yet it will not follow, that all men are enlightened by him Spiritually, Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and Savingly; for there is a light of Reason, and Conscience Natural,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:66147:137"/>
which Christ being God giveth, and this is not Supernatural, spiritual nor sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: So there is a Light of the Word, which is not so common, as is the Light of Nature and of the Natural Conscience, which is from Christ also, and is different from the Spiritual and Supernatural light. And if this light be wholly restricted to Spiritual and Supernatural Light, it is not intelligible out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how this can be said to be bestowed on all and every man; but on the contrary the Scripture sheweth, that many are not enlightened thus, but in darkness, and blinded with darkness; and so that this Illumination is proper and peculiar to a few, if the Scripture be to be beleeved. Let us now see, what he can make out of this place of Scripture, for his purpose.</p>
               <p n="27">27. He observeth <hi>first,</hi> That <hi>the divine Apostle doth call Christ the light of men. Ans.</hi> The Apostle indeed saith, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>That the life was the light of men.</hi> But the question is, what may be the meaning hereof? <hi>Calvin</hi> hereby meaneth that common light of Nature and Reason, that is granted to men above beasts, whereby they are said not only to live, as beasts do, and vegetables, but to have the light of an understanding. And so did <hi>Origen Tom.</hi> 3. and <hi>Cyrillus Lib.</hi> 1: <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. in <hi>Ioan.</hi> of old; and <hi>Marlorat</hi> and others of late. Others, I know understand this light of a Spiritual and Supernatural Light. But why may we not comprehend both, seing all the light of men, or whereof men are partakers, is from this life, whether Natural or Supernatural, whether Common or Saving, whether the Light of Knowledge, of Sanctification and Holiness, or of Joy and Consolation; whether that, which at first was conferred upon man, in his Creation; or that which afterward is conferred in his Restauration, through grace <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8:12. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4:24. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14:17, 18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 5:4? But I know, our <hi>Quaker</hi> will astrick this to a spiritual, supernatural and saving light, and thereupon inferre, that this is common to all. But Iesus Christ himself teacheth us otherwayes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8:12. saying, <hi>I am the light of the World, he that followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</hi> So that though Christ be the light of the world; yet every one hath not the light of life, but they only who follow him by faith: all others walk in darkness; and are void of this light of life? So <hi>Iohn</hi> 12:46. <hi>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever beleeveth on me should not abide in darkness.</hi> Whence we see, that though Christ be come a light in the world, yet all are not actually savingly enlightened, but many are in darkness, and abide in darkness; even all that beleeve not on him. Hence, though light be come into the world, yet <hi>men love darkness</hi> better <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:19. yea, <hi>hate the light, verse</hi> 20. And howbeit Christ be the light, yet none become children of the light, but by beleeving in him <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12:36. and all are not children of light <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5:8, 14. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5:5.</p>
               <p n="28">28. He observeth <hi>next, That this light shineth in darkness, though the darkness doth not comprehend it. Ans.</hi> True, <hi>Iohn</hi> saith so <hi>vers.</hi> 5. the meaning whereof <hi>Calvin</hi> giveth to be this, That when man did generat into a state of darkness, the light of his understanding was not wholly extinct, but there remained some sparkles of the old light, in which he was created, in the midst of the masse of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which sin caused, which might have discovered a Deity: but such was
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:66147:138"/>
the power of darkness, that the minde of man was rather filled with vanity, and enmity against God, than did perceive this great Author and Donor; and so was driven further away from God, by sin and superstition. But I shall gratifie the <hi>Quaker</hi> so far, as to acknowledge, that more is here comprehended, than a meer shineing by the Light &amp; Law of Nature; even the shineing of the light of the New Covenant, in Christ Jesus the Mediator, which in all ages, since the fall, hath, in some measure, been declared unto a dead &amp; darkened people, who, for the most part, did not perceive, nor lay hold upon this light. Christ was pleased to reveal himself by degrees and piece-meals <hi>Heb.</hi> 1:1. more darkly in the first promise of the Seed of the woman, that should tread the head of the Serpent; somewhat againe more clearly under the Law, and now most clearly under the Gospel, when the day spring from on high hath visited us, to give light to them, that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death <hi>Luk.</hi> 1:78, 79. But all that light, which was left in man after the fall, being but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in comparison with what once it was, was not able to discerne and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor willing to imbrace, this light, without supervenient Divine &amp; Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual light and grace. Hence the people of Israel could not improve all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations of this light, which they had; for God <hi>had not given unto them an heart to perceive, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear. Deut.</hi> 29:3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And still it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth true, that the <hi>natural man perceiveth not the things of God</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2:14. and that <hi>the carnal minde is enmity against God Rom</hi> 8:7. for darkness cannot comprehend this light.</p>
               <p n="29">29. In the <hi>third</hi> place, he observeth, that <hi>this true light enlighteneth every man, that cometh into the world</hi>: Of which we have said enough before. As for what he addeth, that <hi>all</hi> will admit of no exclusion: we said enough <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII. and as to spiritual Illumination, the text it self enforceth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction, when it tels, that <hi>darkness did not comprehend this light vers.</hi> 5: and that the <hi>world knew not this light vers.</hi> 10. and that <hi>his owne received him not.</hi> But he saith, <hi>This light shineth even in their hearts, who comprehend him not, and dispelleth darkness, where men close not their eyes.</hi> But in this the Man bewrayeth his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the nature of spiritual Illumination, which so dispelleth darkness, and so shineth into the soul, as that it giveth a spiritual visive faculty; or so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth the Understanding, as that the man cannot but see: when <hi>the eyes of the understanding are enlightened, they cannot but see, what is the hope of his calling, and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints &amp;c. Ephes.</hi> 1:8. <hi>Christ is given for a light to open the blinde eyes Esa.</hi> 42:6, 7. <hi>when God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,</hi> shineth into <hi>our hearts, he giveth the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the glory of God, in the face of Iesus Christ</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:6. so that <hi>with open face, they behold, as in a glasse, the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:18. The text saith not that this light is and was, &amp; shall be in every man. <hi>Quakers</hi> are good at dreaming.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Then be saith, That <hi>Iohn</hi> tels us <hi>vers.</hi> 7. to what end this light is given, <hi>viz. that all might beleeve by it</hi>; for he will have <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to be meaned of the <hi>Light,</hi> and not of <hi>Iohn.</hi> But the man is busie here seeking a knot in a rush. The Euangelist tels us, what was the end for which <hi>Iohn</hi> was sent; to wit, to bear witness of the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:66147:138"/>
Light, that all through him might beleeve; that is, through him as an instrument, for he was the <hi>Eliah,</hi> the Prophet, that was to come, to <hi>turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers Mal.</hi> 4:5.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11:14. <hi>Mark</hi> 9:11. he was to <hi>turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God</hi>; for he <hi>was to go before him, in the Spirit and power of Elias,</hi> to <hi>turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and disobedient to the wisdome of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord Luk.</hi> 1:16, 17. He was <hi>the prophet of the Highest, and was to goe before the face of the Lord, to prepare his wayes. To give knowledg of salvation unto his people, by the remission of their sinnes</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1:76, 77, 78, 79. So that this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth properly referre to <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was but an Instrument, by whom his hearers were brought to beleeve in Christ, the true Light: And to <hi>Iohn</hi> do <hi>Cyrillus, Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomus,</hi> and all the Latine &amp; Greek Commentators, except <hi>Theophylact,</hi> referre it. And the very genuine aspect and series of the words enforce it; this being the end of <hi>Iohns</hi> ministrie and witness-bearing, that by him and through his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie, all his hearers might be brought to faith in the true Light, for this was the intendment of all his labour and paines; as we see <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:36. <hi>Act.</hi> 19:4. But this <hi>Quaker</hi> would make us beleeve, that to interpret the words so, is to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the scope of the context; <hi>for it is Christ,</hi> sayes he, <hi>that enlightens all with this light; And is not this, that they might beleeve by it? Ans.</hi> It is true, it is the true Light, that enlighteneth all. And He, as an efficient cause, doth thereby work faith in all that are enlightened; but nevertheless by <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, might his hearers be brought to beleeve in Christ, the true Light: and what way doth this contradict the scope? He addeth, <hi>All could not beleeve by Iohn, for his Ministrie came not to all Ans.</hi> Thence let him learne, how to interpret these universal particles. So it is said <hi>Mat.</hi> 21:26. <hi>all held Iohn for a prophet,</hi> &amp; yet many in the world never heard of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but the meaning is, all, that knew his ministrie; and so here, all to whom his ministrie came, indefinitely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception of any. <hi>But all,</hi> sayes he, <hi>enlightened with the light might have beleeved thereby. Ans.</hi> Nay, all, enlightened with this saving light, should certainly have believed; for this Illumination giveth not a bare power to believe; but certainly worketh the effect. <hi>Iohn</hi> (saith he further) <hi>did not shine in darkness, but this Light shineth in darkness, that darkness being dissipated, it might beget faith Ans.</hi> And what then? <hi>Ergo</hi> by <hi>Iohns</hi> ministrie men could not be brought to beleeve in the true light? This is a <hi>Quakers</hi> Consequence, that is, ridiculous. But lastly he sayes, <hi>we must beleeve by that, in which communion is had with God; but by walking in the Light we obtaine this communion, not by walking in Iohn. Answ.</hi> Our walking in the light is our enjoying communion with God, as the text, at which he glanceth 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1:7. doth cleare? Our walking in the light is a fruite of faith, and not the cause of it, though it may be a cause of its increase, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. What is that, to beleeve by walking in the light? Though not by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Iohn</hi>; yet by hearing &amp; receiving of his doctrine, men might be brought to beleeve in Christ; for he came to beare witness of the true Light, and faith cometh by hearing. As we have received Christ, so must we walk in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2:6. but receiving goeth before walking, and is not effectuated by walking.</p>
               <p n="31">
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:66147:139"/>31. He spends sometime <hi>Pag.</hi> 99. to prove, that this Light, here mentioned, is <hi>supernatural, saving &amp; sufficient,</hi> and foundeth all upon this, that it is the <hi>light of Christ, whereby all ought to beleeve.</hi> And thus subdolously foisteth-in his corrupt errours, his <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> conceipts, with a special artifice, that the unwarry Reader may be infected with his poison. But (1) we know no Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and Saving Light or Grace, which is only Sufficient, and not Efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Effectual, or such as will certainly produce the effect. Supernatural &amp; sufficient grace to believe, not only giveth the man a spiritual Power to beleeve; but powerfully, insuperably, invincibly &amp; effectually Inclineth, Moveth, Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and Determineth the heart to beleeve; and efficaciously worketh the Effect, and produceth Faith, in the soul. As for his meerly Sufficient Grace, he hath learned it in the <hi>Iesuites, Arminians</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> school, not in the Scriptures, Though there be a Light granted even in the works of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which may convince of a Deity and of several duties, called for at the hands of men, which may and doth render such as come short, inexcusable <hi>Rom.</hi> 1:20. And though a greater Light be granted in the dispensation of the Gospel, to convince and render more inexcusable such as beleeve not: yet we know of no Saving Light Sufficient to salvation granted to all, even of such as heare the Gospel; far less to all Heathens; for as to this, all naturally are blinde and dead; and no grace can be sufficient, but that which quickeneth, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth eyes to see, and eares to hear, and hearts to understand, and overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all in the man, that maketh head against Christ. In what sense then can it be true, that saving sufficient Light is given to all? Can that, which is a meerly Natural Power, produce a spiritual and Supernatural effect? As soon may a beast produce acts of reason, or a vegetable plant do acts of sense; for these are effects of another Nature, and of an higher sphere, and require a suteable principle. <hi>If it be said,</hi> By acting that which is Natural, we may procure, or make way for what is Spiritual and Supernatural, <hi>We enquire,</hi> where there is any such promise, or appointment of God, giving ground for this assertion? Nay, if it were so, we should be called, according to our works, and not according to his grace, contrare to 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1:9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3:5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9:15, 16. <hi>If it be said,</hi> That these words, <hi>To him that hath, shall be given,</hi> include such a promise, that such as improve nature aright, shall obtaine grace. <hi>We reply,</hi> That it must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that what is promised to be given, is of a different nature, and not of the same nature, with what the man hath. Both these parables, to which this is annexed, cleare, that the more promised is but of the same kinde with what was had and improved: To say then, that one that improveth nature shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine grace, is as much, as to say, that one improving health shall obtaine wealth or honour, or one by improving wealth and honour shall obtaine health. But the meaning of the saying, is, that such as improve gifts and talents, given of God, shall get more of the same kinde; as he that improveth wealth getteth more wealth (2.) What meaneth that, <hi>by which all ought to beleeve</hi>? doth Spiritual Grace and Light bestowed only lay on an obligation to beleeve? Then it doth nothing; for the obligation lay upon the man before to believe (3.) Is every thing, that layeth on an obligation to beleeve, Supernatural and Saving? Then
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:66147:139"/>
the law is supernatural and saving. But our <hi>Quaker</hi> talks, he knoweth not what (4) we do not exclude supernatural &amp; saving Light, as appeareth from what we said: But let us hear, why this man would have nothing else here understood?</p>
               <p n="32">32. His <hi>first</hi> reason is, because <hi>we are not said to receive what is common and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to our nature, from Christ, and the Evangelist is here declaring Christ's office, as Mediator, and the benefites which we get from him, as such. Answ.</hi> If we receive not what is natural and common from Christ, we have neither our Being, nor Conservation of him; contrare to <hi>Heb.</hi> 1:3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1:16, 17. And that the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist is here chiefly clearing and confirming the Deity of Christ, none but <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> will deny. His <hi>Second</hi> reason is, because <hi>the light is said to shine in darkness and yet not to be comprehended by darkness: but this darkness, is nothing but the natural state of man, and yet in his natural state man can comprehend what is common and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to him, as such. Ans.</hi> Not to take notice of his calling something both Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Peculiar, which is a sort of repugnancy here: we grant, that mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural state is a state of darkness; and therefore inferre, that while in that state, he is voide of all spiritual and supernatural Light; for when this cometh, the man becometh light in the Lord: And though man, in his natural state, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that which is natural, yet he cannot comprehend the God of Nature, who is here called Light. This Light may shine by natural effects, of Reason and a Natural Conscience, in a natural man, and yet the man nor comprehend, or understand this Light. Our <hi>Quaker,</hi> whose light of reason is darkness, taketh the light here to be meant of the effect, and not of the efficient; &amp; so practically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth himself. His <hi>third</hi> reason is but a repetition of what he said before, &amp; was answered §. 30. He ade<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h more, <hi>That, in which we are commanded to beleeve, that we may become the children of light, is supernatural, sufficient and saving. But we are commanded to beleeve in the light Iohn.</hi> 12:36. <hi>Ans.</hi> That we are commanded to beleeve in the light, which is God, is most true. But that we are commanded to beleeve in the light, which is but a meer Creature, and a work in us (as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth) is not true: <hi>Iohn,</hi> who came to bear witness of the light, <hi>said unto the people, that they should beleeve on him, which should come after him, that is, on Christ Iesus Act</hi> 19:4 And told them, that <hi>he that beleeveth on the Son, hath everlasting life, and he that beleeveth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him Ioh.</hi> 3 36. <hi>To him gave all the prophets witness, that through his name, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beleeveth in him, shall receive remission of sinnes Act.</hi> 10:43. But why do we cite particular places, seing the whole Bible confirmeth it. Here his <hi>Quakerisme</hi> setteth up its head, while he will have that Light, mentioned <hi>Ioh</hi> 12:36. not to be meaned of Christ himself, but of some created thing in every man, that is but meer Nature, contrare to the very obvious import of the words, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the preceeding <hi>verse</hi> 34. where Christ and the Son of man is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whom the <hi>Iewes</hi> thought should abide for ever, and not be lifted up; but he tels them, that he was not to stay alwayes, and that therefore, they should be wise unto salvation, and lay hold on him, now by Faith, and walk in him; for darkness would come, when he, and his dispensations of the Gospel, should be removed; conforme to that <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8:12. I <hi>am the light of the world, he that followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</hi> See also <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9:5. But
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:66147:140"/>
(sayes he <hi>Pag.</hi> 100.) they <hi>could beleeve in his person, although he was removed.</hi> And himself addeth an Answere, when he mentioneth afterward a day of visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: so that if they did not lay hold on the faire opportunity they had, the day would come, when Christ himself, and also in his Dispensations and Offers of mercy, in the Gospel administration, should goe away; and then they should walk in darkness. His conclusion, being so ill founded, and destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of true Christianity, substituting some Natural (and consequently now cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt) thing, common to all men, both within and without the Church, both barbarous and more moralized, in the roome of Christ, is to be rejected with all detestation, and deserveth not to be once more repeated. What he citeth at large, out of <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> if it be considered alone, without this mans corrupt glosse, which we are not to regaird, speaketh nothing against the Truth, which we owne, as might easily be made to appear, if we judged it worth so much paines, as to clear it.</p>
               <p n="33">33. The <hi>Second</hi> ground of his Universal Grace, set down, <hi>Pag.</hi> 101. § 22. is taken from the parable of the sower, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. and this, he saith is the <hi>word of faith, Rom.</hi> 10. and the <hi>engrafted word, Jam.</hi> 1:21. But is any so blinde, as not to see, that this is utterly impertinent to his purpose, seing it is so manifest, that our Lord is here speaking of the ordinary fruite of a preached Gospel; and that among those, that seem to be most docile, and are not of the prophane and flagitious mockers, opposers and persecuters of the truth. Is he not speaking of that word, which is heard with the eare? And doth not <hi>Paul</hi> speak of such an outward word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. which is preached by such, whose feet are beautiful? And that word, whereof <hi>James</hi> speaketh, is the same, which should be received with meekness, that it may become an ingrafted word, and prove saving. Is this word a substantial thing, lying in every mans heart? Is this word communicated to all the world, to all and every man in the world, since the very day, that <hi>Adam</hi> fell? What uncouth phansies must these <hi>Quakers</hi> have, that are carryed away with such dottages? Either sure, these men are meer mockers, or they are under a judicial stroke of blindness and infatuation. But sayes he, <hi>This word is really sowne in the stonny and thorny ground, as well as in the good.</hi> Alas, poor man, thinks he, that every word in a parable must be pressed thus, till it bleed? Who ever heard rational men speak thus? And though it were so, this will not speak for all the world, a great part whereof heare noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this word; Nay nor for all within the Church, or that heare the word; for open mockers, contemners and persecuters of the word, belong neither to the rocky, nor thorny ground, nor to the way side. What he citeth out of <hi>Victor Antiochemis,</hi> from <hi>Vossius Hist. Pelag.</hi> is utterly impertinent; for it speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing of all the world, but of such only, as hear the word preached; and to this end only <hi>Vossius</hi> himsef adduceth it, as may be seen by his <hi>Thesis</hi>: And any that read <hi>Victor's</hi> words may see, that he speaketh of the preached word, and not of the <hi>Quakers</hi> substance, and vehicle: a fanciful dream.</p>

He urgeth next <hi>Pag.</hi> 102. the Parable of the Talents <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. saying, <hi>he that had but two talents and had improved them for his masters advantage, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as well as he, who had five; and he that had but one, might have done the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:66147:140"/>
same.</hi>—And hence he inferreth, that <hi>though every one hath not the same measure of grace, yet every one hath that measure, which is sufficient, Ans.</hi> The maine thing is not here confirmed, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Talent is a substantial thing; and not that grace, which is but an accident: I beleeve he saw, that what is spoken of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving these talents could not well agree to his substantial Seed and Light; and far less the hideing of the one talent. Nor (2.) Hath he proved, that these ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents signifie saving grace, and not meer gifts of the Spirit, which are given for the good of the Church. Nor (3.) Hath he said any thing, to cleare, that by these servants, are meant all the men and women, in the world; and not the officers of the Church, or others that are gifted, living within the Church. These things he must clear and demonstrate, before he can make any use of this Parable: and till he finde himself in case to do this, we proceed.</p>
               <p n="35">35. In the <hi>third</hi> place, he saith, §. 23. <hi>This saving seed is the Gospel, which the Apostle saith, Col.</hi> 1:23. <hi>was preached in every creature: And the Gospel is not a bare declaration of good things, but the power of God, Rom.</hi> 1:16. <hi>for though the word, figuratively and by a metonimy signifie the outward declaration; yet properly it is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward power, vertue and life, whereby the Annunciation of good things is preached in the hearts of all, offering salvation unto them, and willing to redeem them from their sinnes; and therefore it is said to be preached in every creature, when many hear not the external Gospel. Ans.</hi> (1.) The Gospel, which was preached, was the doctrine delivered by men, &amp; whereof <hi>Paul</hi> himself was a Minister; But that seed, which he talketh of, &amp; which he saith is abideing, as a substance, in every man, is not that, which <hi>Paul</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> others, whose feet were beautiful, did preach. That needeth no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acher; for it is its owne preacher, and requireth no more, but hearing and obedience. (2.) Thus also the vanity of that criticisme, upon the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which before we had occasion to shew to have various significations) is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, for how could that, which was already in every creature, be said to be preached in every creature? And when was this preached in every creature? Was it from the beginning of the world? This he must say, or he saith noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And doth this place prove that? (3.) The Gospel, which was preached in every creature (to follow the <hi>Quakers</hi> interpretation) was the same Gospel, which the <hi>Colossians</hi> had heard of their faithful Ministers; and that was not a substance within them, that belonged neither to soul, nor body. (4.) The terme <hi>every creature,</hi> is but an hyperbolick expression (as the words following <hi>under heaven,</hi> are a Pleonasmus) shewing the large and illimited spreading of the newes of salvation, to all Nations indifferently, without Restriction, or Exception, whereby the New Testament is differenced from the Old Test. as we fully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII. and is sufficiently explained, <hi>vers</hi> 28. where <hi>every man</hi> must not betaken in its full extent, as if <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, had spoken in the hearing of every man, then breathing; far less can it be meaned of every man, that died before they were borne, and are borne since their death. Here also we hear of <hi>all wisdom</hi>; yet we must not think, that <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest taught <hi>Physicks, Metaphysickes</hi> or <hi>Politicks,</hi> &amp;c. (5.) The Gospel, which was preached to every Creature, is explained, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. and called <hi>the word of God,</hi>

The Gospel, which <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and whereof he was not ashamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1:16. is that meane, which God is pleased to make use of, whereby to exert his power, in the conversion of souls; and upon this account is called <hi>the power of God.</hi> So that the very preaching of the Gospel, when blessed of God, is a powerful meane of salvation, being accompanied with faith in the hearers, &amp; is a meane of begetting faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> tels us <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. when he saith, <hi>that faith cometh by hearing.</hi> (7.) He should have told us, in what place of Scripture, the word <hi>Gospel</hi> is taken properly, in his sense, for that inward Strength, Power &amp; Life, which is common to all Men: for till he do this, we shall account him but a babler. (8.) We deny all such thing, within every man, be it a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or an accidens, that offereth salvation, and redemption from sins, to every man: And account it a greater Antichristian expression, and assertion, than ever <hi>Pelagius</hi> had the confidence to maintaine. And beyond what any <hi>Socinian</hi> ever durst vent. Yea, I look upon it, as a real and substantial overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Gospel of the Grace of God, and of our Salvation; being nothing but pure paganisme: and this Man doth hereby sufficiently declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a <hi>Pagan preacher.</hi>

Ans.</hi> This is most false; for the Law and Light of Nature, with the works of Creation and Providence, do make known much of God. But this is not the Gospel of the grace of God, whereby life and immortality is brought to light. It is like indeed, that this is all the <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> Gospel. Many things have we met with hitherto, which confirmeth us in this Apprehension; &amp; thisi expression here putteth it beyond all doubt. Doth this Gospel manifest the righteousness of God from faith to faith? <hi>Yes,</hi> saith he, <hi>that is, it revealeth to the soul, what is good, just and equitable: And as the soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth and beleeveeth that divine righteousness, it is more and more revealed from one measure to another. Ans.</hi> What ignorant babling is this? What effront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bold playing with the word of God is this? Is every thing that revealeth, what is good, just and equitable, the Gospel? Then the Law must be the Gospel. Then <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had the Gospel. Then the dim light of nature is all the <hi>Quakers</hi> Gospel; this is their Grace, their
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:66147:141"/>
Substantial thing, their Light within, their Seed. Are they not then noble Divines? And is their Religion any thing but heathenisme? Is it not worse then <hi>Pelagianisme, Socinianisme, Arminianisme and Iesuitisme</hi>? The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words cannot, I confesse, be well answered: for they are nothing but a rabble of non-sense, though fit lettuce for their lips. And though he should say (as some of them use to speak) that I am in the witchcraft, and cannot understand his meaning, I must forbear noticeing of him, and his tattles, and see if any thing worth an answer followeth, <hi>for though</hi> (sayes he) <hi>the outward creation declareth the power of God; yet that which is known of God is revealed within, by which inward revelation, we are made fit to see and discerne the eternal power of the God head, in the outward creation, for if that inward revelation, were not, man could no more understand the invisible things of God by the visible and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward creation, than a blinde man see colours &amp;c. Ans.</hi> (1.) What is that Inward Revelation, distinct from the Outward Revelation? It is, it may be, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or actual intellection of what is outwardly revealed; and so the Natural Faculties, acting as such, must be Evangelick Preachers, and Inward Revealers, with the <hi>Quakers.</hi> (2.) The text speaks of no such Inward Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, distinct from what was had by the outward Creation: For that which may be known of God, was shewed unto them by the things, which were made <hi>vers.</hi> 19:20. (3.) There is no more aptitude requisite to see and discerne God's eternal Power and God-head (not <hi>the eternal power of the God-head,</hi> as he speaketh) in a natural way (and <hi>Paul</hi> is not here speaking of a spiritual and saving way) by the works of Creation, than to have a natural faculty of Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and Reason, freed of prejudices, and contracted byasses and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for this matter is so deeply rooted in their mindes, that will they, nill they, it cannot be thrust out (4.) It seemeth by his <hi>simile,</hi> that this Inward Revelation is the same to the actual understanding of these things, that the eye of the body is to seeing and discerning of colours; and so it is manifest, that it can be nothing else, but the inward faculty of the soul, whereby such things are known and understood: And so this Inward Faculty of the soul, with the Light of Reason, is the <hi>Quakers</hi> Preacher and Gospel. Poor souls! and what will this teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the new Covenant, and the way of salvation through a crucified Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator? Do the <hi>Quakers</hi> know no other Gospel then this, whereof all the fruite was, that it left the poor miserable heathen without excuse, when they fell to their idolatrous courses? O how are they to be pitied, that, under the clear manifestation of the Gospel, do thus run back to the Heathens Theology, that they may be made much more inexcusable then ever the Heathens were? Do they glory so much in Paganisme?</p>

He tels us moreover, <hi>that the Apostle saith first,</hi> that that which is known of God, or the knowledge of God, is manifest in them; and <hi>next, that in and by that manifestation granted inwardly and received, they were able to read and understand the power of God in visible things.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:66147:142"/>
Objection thus, <hi>if any should say, That the external creation of it self, without any inward supernatural and saving grace, or seed, did declare to a natural man, that God is.</hi> And will he deny this? He must then contradict the Apostle. But what answereth he? <hi>What good I pray, would that knowledge do, if it did not also communicat to me, what was the will of God, and how I should do that, that is acceptable to him? Ans.</hi> And what would this answere say? Either the Inward Revelation, which the heathens had, (that I may speak in his language) did also reveal what was the will of God, &amp;c. Or not: if not, to what purpose is all this said? If it did, then the Apostle is quite out, and destroyeth hereby his owne cause. But I shall help the <hi>Quaker</hi> with a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. That same Inward Revelation (as he calleth it) could and did reveal to the Heathens part of the will of God, concerning duties, legible by the Law of nature, and written upon the creation of God; but could reveal noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mysteries of the Gospel; because these did depend upon pure Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, there being no lineaments thereof written upon the Creation; nor no vestige thereof impressed in the heart of man. Hence, though the Heathens knew, or might have known, to have put a difference betwixt somethings good and evil; yet they could never understand the Revelation of Iesus Christ, in the Gospel.

The following words confirme this, where the Apostle <hi>vers.</hi> 14, 15. sheweth the necessity of hearing, and of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of sending, for the begetting of faith, saying, <hi>how shall they call on him in whom they have not beleeved? And how shall they beleeve in him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?

(4.] As for that <hi>vers.</hi> 18. It is to stop the mouthes of both Iewes and Gentiles, especially the Iewes, who whould pretend ignorance of this preached Gospel, &amp; say, that they had never heard thereof; therefore saith the Apostle, <hi>Have they not heard?</hi> Yes, would he say, That is unquestionable, for <hi>their sound went into all the earth,</hi> &amp;c. What sound is this? Is this a sound of something, that is lodged in Heathens, who never heard of the Gospel? None can fancie this, but a <hi>Quaker</hi>; Or will this <hi>Quaker</hi> say, that the sound of the Gospel preached came unto the eares of all and every man breathing? No, he saith expresly the contrary. What can he then make out of this? Hath the Light within such a sound and words, as that Gospel, which the Apostles preached; or as the preaching of the Apostles, which went far and neer into all the earth, and to the ends of the world, in a manner? for the Apostle is alludeing unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> useth <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. speaking of the Sun and heavens, these great and universal preachers of the glory of God, but not of the Gospel.

I must therefore turn back to <hi>Pag.</hi> 90. of his <hi>Apology</hi> §. 17. where he tels us, he must speak somethings of the way, how this seed worketh in the hearts of men, and this he saith, he the rather doth, that it may thereby appear, how they ascribe all their salvation, unto the Grace and Spirit of God; and differ from <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> In this designe, if he be in case to effectuate the thing, I cannot but commend him; and because I am loath to Father any more upon them, then their expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons give me just ground, I shall the more narrowly take notice of what he saith.</p>

He who resisteth, is the cause of his own damnation; who resisteth not, it becometh his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: In him that is saved, the work is of grace, not of man; and that which is mans, is rather a passion, than an action.—The first progress is not by co-operating, but by not opposeing or counter-working. Moreover we beleeve</hi> (saith he) <hi>that in that special time of every mans visitation, as man of himself is wholly impotent for working with grace; so neither can he make the least progress out of his natural state, till grace lay hold on him. So that it is possible for him to suffer and not resist, as it is also possible for many to resist.</hi> But this answere is not satisfactory: For (1.) By what Scripture it can be asserted, that the Spirit of God, or his Grace, is given to all, and that in a measure sufficient to save all; even as well to such as are without the Visible Church, and live in heathenisme, as to such as are within the visible Church, and are actual beleevers.

(3.) The <hi>Iesuites,</hi> I know, with their foreman <hi>Molina,</hi> make much of the distinction of grace, into that which is only <hi>Sufficient,</hi> and that which is <hi>effectual</hi> or <hi>efficacious</hi>: and with them the <hi>Arminians</hi> joine themselves, in the asserting of this distinction, and in the explication thereof: other <hi>Papists</hi> also, such as the late <hi>Thomists,</hi> and <hi>Iansenists,</hi> do use this distinction, but diversly explained, and both in a way far different from the way of the <hi>Molinists,</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> Now because our <hi>Quaker,</hi> in this mater, so far as I see, joineth with the <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Arminians;</hi> and is not pleased to give us his plaine and full meaning, we must see what way these <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> explaine this mater, that we may thereb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his meaning the better. The <hi>Iesuites</hi> foreman <hi>Molina</hi> will have that called <hi>sufficient grace,</hi> which alone, without any more on God's part, can produce the effect; so that thereby alone, man may be wrought up to Faith &amp; Conversion, if he will; and this <hi>Quaker</hi> ordinarily saith, <hi>if he do not resist,</hi> which is one and the same thing upon the mater. This Sufficient Grace and Help, is said to be given as well to such as shall never be converted, as to such as shall be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and this saith our <hi>Quaker</hi> also. This <hi>Sufficient Grace</hi> is with them distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed into that which is <hi>Effectual,</hi> when the effect and work followeth; and that which is <hi>Ineffectual,</hi> when the effect and work followeth not. So that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt <hi>Sufficient</hi> and <hi>Effectual grace</hi> is only taken from the Effect, and this effect doth wholly depend upon Mans will; and mans will maketh this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or maketh this <hi>sufficient grace,</hi> become Effectual, or ineffectual, &amp; nothing
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:66147:146"/>
else; for there is nothing in that grace, which is called <hi>Effectual,</hi> more then in that which is <hi>Sufficient; Sufficient grace</hi> being, upon God's part, absolutely sufficient to worke the effect, if man will be tractable, and not resist, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre and comply therewith, without any further addition of grace, yea and without any other requisite, beside the actual consent of man; and no more can be said of that grace, which is called <hi>Effectual.</hi> And thus all the difference is from the Event, and the Event doth wholly depend upon man; so that when the same measure of Sufficient Grace is given to two persons, the one beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, because he willingly consenteth, the other beleeveth not because he will not comply, but resist: yea they tell us, that it may so fall out, that he who beleeveth not, may have a greater measure of that <hi>Sufficient Grace,</hi> then he who beleeved; and this mans will was better natured, and more pliable, then the will of the other; and he complied because he would, when he might, had he pleased, refused, and not have been converted, not only <hi>in sensu diviso,</hi> as they speak, but even <hi>in sensu composito.</hi> With these the <hi>Arminians</hi> do wholly agree, upon the mater; for they say, that <hi>Sufficient grace</hi> is the same with <hi>Effectual,</hi> only distinguished by the effects following the one, and not the other, through mans free will consenting, when the other put a bar in the way. They will not have the Efficacy of grace placed in any omnipotent manner of its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor in the determination of the will of man thereby, but in its obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effect through mans not resisting, when he might resist if he pleased; so that of two, having the same measure of sufficient grace, (then which no more is requisite, on God's part, for effectuating the work) the one beleeveth, because he doth put no bar in the way; the other beleeveth not, because he resisteth, and doth put a bar in the way. (4.) Hence it is manifest, why this answer of the <hi>Quaker,</hi> who taketh part with <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> cannot satisfie: to wit, because all the actual efficacy of grace is made to depend on mans will; for, as we saw, the same Sufficient Grace, that is bestowed upon two Persons, can of it self produce the actual conversion of neither, but must leave both to their free liberty and choice; and one beleeveth, not properly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly by the power and efficacy of this grace, even suppose it were in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er measure, (for then it should worke the same effect in both,) but because his will did freely of its own accord, consent and yeeld, when it might have done otherwise, even <hi>in sensu composito,</hi> as they speak; and the other beleeveth not, because he opposeth and resisteth, when he might, had he so thought good, have yeelded. If our <hi>Quaker</hi> should run to the foreseen congruity and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the call of God with Free will, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Vasques</hi> devise, to alleviat the mater, it will be of no advantage: for <hi>first,</hi> this <hi>Scientia Media,</hi> by which they imagine God to foresee what will be, in such and such cases, is gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undless; and <hi>Next,</hi> at the long run, the crown is put upon Man, &amp; not upon the Grace of God; for this Grace, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:66147:146"/>
and so Ineffectual. So that <hi>Effectual Grace</hi> &amp; <hi>Sufficient Grace</hi> is still the same, Physically, and as to its real entity; and all the difference is from mans good or evil disposition, whose evil disposition can make a Greater measure of grace Ineffectual, and good disposition can make a Lesser measure Effectual, if it come in its congruous season. From whence we see, it is clear as the sun, that mans Free Will, and not the Grace of God, according to our <hi>Quakers,</hi> is to be praised for Faith, Repentance, &amp; Conversion; and mans free consent maketh that grace Effectual, which otherwise would have been Ineffectual; &amp; his Opposition or Resistance maketh that grace Ineffectual, which otherwise might have been Effectual. And thus, their <hi>Sufficient grace</hi> is, with them, absolutely sufficient upon God's part, and all its Efficacy and Effectualness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon, and hath its being from, mans free Consent. Will this <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> or any of his Masters, the <hi>Molinists,</hi> or <hi>Arminians</hi> say, that beside that <hi>Sufficient Grace,</hi> which is made common to all, there is necessarily required a further work of Preveening Grace upon the will of man, physically determining the same, and certainly and efficaciously effectuating the actual consent thereof, and removing or overcoming its Opposition, or Resistance? As for the <hi>Gratia Cooperans,</hi> which they say, he who beleeveth and complieth with the call, hath, and which the other, who resisteth, wanteth, it doth not helpe them; for it is also made to depend wholly upon mans Consent; so that God cooperateth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the man consenteth; and cooperateth not in the other, because he resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth; and it is made the same upon the mater with Sufficient Preventing Grace, only now having a new denomination, because of its cooperating with mans will, which goeth before, and upon which it dependeth. I know, the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> say, that God worketh upon the will, granting to it a Supernatural Power, to obey and yeeld; but yet they will not grant, that this grace shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the will, and certainly and efficaciously bow, and incline the will to consent: for the will must still retaine its power to obey, or not, as it pleaseth; and all the work of grace upon the will must remaine resistible; and be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Moral Swasion; so that when Antecedent &amp; Preveening Grace hath done all it can do, it may so fall out, that no conversion shall follow; so that conversion is still contingent and uncertain, (though not in respect of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of God, yet) in respect of its dependance upon that cause, and doth not follow <hi>necessitate causae, five consequentis</hi>; because for all that grace, man was alwayes free to resist; and the grace, (<hi>Preventing,</hi> I meane, and <hi>Antecedent</hi>) granted to him that resisteth, was equal to that, which was granted, to him that yeeldeth: And therefore, with them, there is no grace granted, that Effectually or Efficaciously &amp; Certainly taketh away the wills resistance, &amp; causeth it infallibly to bow and yeeld; otherwise their <hi>Sufficient grace</hi> should not be simply, and absolutly sufficient, but only so far, and in its own kinde. And seing they deny any concession of more Prevening and Antecedent Grace, then what is purely sufficient, as all <hi>Papists</hi> must do, who will follow the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi> Sess. 6.. can. 4. &amp; 5. It is undeniable, that with them, and our <hi>Quakers,</hi> who follow them, the Efficacy of Grace is from man, and man must thank himself and his own Free Will, that he is saved, if not wholly, because of coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:66147:147"/>
grace, which is yeelded to, yet principally. (5.) So that though he who resisteth is clearly guilty of his own damnation; yet that Grace, which is only Sufficient, cannot be truely and simply called that mans Salvation, who resisteth not; but his salvation must principally, or rather only, be ascribed to himself, for that Sufficient grace did no more upon its part to him, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not, than it did to him, who resisteth; and it hath no more Influence or Efficacy, as from it self, upon the one, than upon the other. It cannot then be said, that the Salvation of him, that is saved, is merely of grace, and not of himself; seing he and not grace made the difference, and made Sufficient grace become Effectual. (6.) Nor is it true, that Man is wholly passive, with our <hi>Quakers</hi>; for the mans actual consent is requisite, and his non-resistance is rather an Action than a Passion, as it is in the will; for not only the will must positively will this non-resistance; but this non-resistance in the will is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive yeelding: for, in Scripture construction, a suspension of actual consent is a resistance, and a non-yeelding. (7.) Hence we see, that it is all one thing, whether the first progress (as he speaketh) be by cooperating, or only by not counterworking; for whatever way we name it, the will is positively acting: when the will yeeldeth, it doth it willingly, and when it doth not repugne nor resist, it yeeldeth; non-resistance is a kinde of consenting. But whatever we call it, it is, according to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> with the <hi>Iesuites</hi> or <hi>Molinists,</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi>; (with whom we may joine as to this, the <hi>Lutherans</hi>) that upon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth the efficacy of grace; and it self is not the proper Effect of grace, because they will not grant, that God, whatever way he work upon the will, doth, by his Preventing and Antecedent grace, produce and infallibly effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate this Non-resistance, or Consent; or that he doth more by this Grace; to produce and effectuate this non-resisting in him that yeeldeth, than in him that yeeldeth not. (8.) Though the man can make no progress out of his natural state, until grace lay hold upon him (as sufficient grace, in the judgment of <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> layeth hold on all) he can and may resist; and all that grace of God can cause no progress, till the man, of his owne Free accord and good will, yeeld and lay aside his resistance: And this yeelding, or laying aside of the resisting humore, is not caused by grace; because the same measure, yea a greater measure, of the same grace, could not cause it, in another, who would continue in his unwillingness and resistance. (9.) Though it be possible for man, in that case, to suffer, and not resist, because it is possible with <hi>Quakers, Iesuites and Arminians,</hi> that Lord <hi>Free will</hi> shall be good natured and well disposed; yet all the grace of God cannot make it certain and infallible; for Grace, must not enter within the Wills Iurisdiction, but stand cap in hand, without doors: Lord <hi>Free will</hi> must not be encroached upon. (10.) One thing more, I would desire to know of this <hi>Quaker,</hi> what he meaneth properly by this <hi>Sufficient grace</hi>? Hitherto he hath given us big words; but yet, upon the mater, nothing but the meer Light of Nature, or some common gifts and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voures, wherein he is worse, then some <hi>Arminians, Pelagians and Iesuites</hi>; who will grant the necessity of the outward preaching and dispensation of the

What would he say more? He compareth <hi>God to a Physitian, that putteth the Physick in the sick mans mouth; and layeth him on his bed; and if the sick man will but be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, the physick will work; but if he be unwilling, and rise up, &amp; eat what he should not eat, it cannot work because he hindereth its operation, and so though the physick of its own nature be wholesome, &amp; tend to health; yet it proveth deadly to that man, &amp; he is the cause of his owne death: &amp; yet if he had been quiet &amp; passive, the physick had wrought; &amp; he could not have said, that he healed himself, but that the physick did it. Ans.</hi> (1.) Physick cannot work upon a dead man, but must have some strength of Natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

co-operat, and yet here nature must co-operate, or nothing will be done (2.) Bodily physick worketh only upon the body and humors, but reacheth not the will of the man; but the soul humors lye most in the will; and grace, that would cure these, must work upon the will; for till the will be cured, the man is never cured. So that (3.) This <hi>simile</hi> doth more sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate him to be a <hi>Pelagian, Arminian</hi> and <hi>Iesuite,</hi> than any thing, he hath yet said; for let the physician give what physick he will, the patients will is wholly at liberty; so let God work what he will, and employ all his grace, the mans will is at freedome; and so at freedome, that all that God can do shall not availe; the man will, if he be ill disposed, hinder the physick to work; as the patient may do, in the similitude. (4.) Though the man cannot properly say, that he purged away his own humors, because the physick did that; yet he was truely the concurring cause of his owne health, and may thank himself therefore: For had he been so ill disposed as his neighbour, all the physick should not have saved his life, more than it saved his neighbours, who hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its operation.

Have we not here enough to Demonstrate to us, how devoted the <hi>Quakers</hi> are unto Lord <hi>Free will</hi>; And how, according to them, Christ and the grace of God must be beholden to <hi>Free will,</hi> for every soul, that is saved; and must come pray and beseech <hi>Free will,</hi> to be good, and quiet, that grace may work, and Christ may not misse his errand.

And I would faine know, what he will do with his former doctrine concerning the Talents? And what doth his Light within, his Christ and all serve for now? I pray him, the next time he writeth, to reconcile these. But how proposeth he the case? <hi>I suppose</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Redeemer cometh at certain times, and manifestly declareth unto them, what and how great their misery is, if they remaine in that place, yea and impresseth upon them a certain sense of their misery and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:66147:148"/>
not only so, but apprehendeth them, draweth them out, and plucketh them up, that he may bring them out of their misery; and if they resist not, they will be saved. Ans.</hi> (1.) The Lord's coming at certain times to convince all and every man of his misery, in reference to his salvation, and delivery, is but a dream for <hi>Paul</hi> tels the people of <hi>Athens, Act.</hi> 17:30. <hi>that God winked at the times of ignorance, but now commandeth all men every where to repent.</hi> (2.) It is also a groundless imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to think, that God impresseth upon every man breathing a sense of his misery. (3.) If God draw them up, and pluck them out of that pit, they must be out of it, whether they resist or not: Or doth he imagine, that God by the Sufficient Grace, which he bestoweth, plucketh them only halfe up, and, when they begin to resist and spurn, letteth them fall againe, that they may perish in the pit? But how or what way doth God thus pluck all men half out of the pit? I wish he would explaine this, and then we should see, whether his hands be clean of <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> &amp;c. or not. (4.) Though he will not say, that he is a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> or <hi>Semipelagian,</hi> or <hi>Socinian,</hi> or <hi>Arminian,</hi> or <hi>Iesuite</hi>; yet he must put the crown of Salvation on <hi>Free wills</hi> head, and sing praises to <hi>Free will,</hi> that was so good and kinde, as not to spurn and resist. But whence came this Non resistance? Not from the arme of him, that was pulling them up, but from their owne innate kinde and gentle disposition, he must say; Then glory and thanks must be given to this kinde disposition, that the man is saved, outright, and brought fully out of the pit: for what grace did, was but halfe work, and a common thing, that others, who are lying in the pit, met with, as well as he. And yet this is the man, that would make us beleeve, that he is neither <hi>Pelagian,</hi> nor <hi>Semipelagian,</hi> not <hi>Arminian,</hi> &amp;c. but his speach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth him to be that, and worse: For wherein doth his doctrine differ from all the <hi>Papists,</hi> who are this day against the <hi>Iansenists,</hi> upon this account, that these assert Christ's grace, to be <hi>adjutorium quo,</hi> that is, such help as maketh the man to will; and so effectuateth the actual will and consent?</p>

It might be objected, <hi>that grace should hereby be frustrated</hi>; And indeed grace is at mans devotion, by his opinion; for if man will not, grace shall never save a soul, for grace cannot change the Will, nor come near to its Territory: And man, being alwayes left at his natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt liberty, and his corrupt nature being enmity to God, and all the wayes of God; how is it imaginable, that any one soul can be saved?

Had not God gotten the glory of his justice, though never one of <hi>Adams</hi> sons had been saved? He told us before <hi>Pag.</hi> 90. <hi>that grace of its own nature will save all, and worketh with every one that it may save them.</hi> And as to this, which is its native and proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe and end, it can be frustrated by mans refractariness; and so grace attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing of its proper end, but as man will. What he speaketh of the Suns hardning clay, and softening wax, is but a further confirmation of what we say, of this <hi>Quaker,</hi> to wit, that as the Sun can never soften clay, so, with this
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:66147:149"/>
                  <hi>Quaker,</hi> all the grace in heaven shall never soften a mans heart, till man, of himself, without the grace of God, lay aside his hardened dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and take on a new Nature, and become wax, that the Sun of grace may melt him: Was ever <hi>Pelagius</hi> more a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> or <hi>Arminius,</hi> more an <hi>Arminian,</hi> than is this man? Grace with him, is but a general common thing, concurring with a general Influence, as is the influence of the sun, causing the dunghill stinck, and the flowr to smell well; and as the nature of the flowr is the immediat cause of the good smell, so mans good nature and disposition is the immediat particular and proper cause of all the good that is done. All which he confirmeth, in the close of that paragraph, saying, <hi>so the Sun of righteousness shineth upon every one, dureing the time of his visitation, that they may bring forth good fruit, and send forth a good smell: And by the rayes hereof their hearts can be mollified and warmed; but if they suffer that day to passe, the same sun doth more harden them, as clay, &amp;c.</hi> But the Sun can never make a thistle bring forth grapes, or a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casse to smell as a rose; so neither can the Sun of righteousness, by this Man's opinion, cause a dead man live, or a rotten withered branch bring forth fruit: And the change of the corrupt nature of man is not from the Sun of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but from himself: and it lyeth at the mans own door, and is in his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether he will bring forth fruite or not, let the sun shine, as it will. And further, let him explaine to me, How grace can properly harden a man. I know, that by accident of mans corruption, abusing it, the man may thereby grow worse, but this is not the proper work of grace: as the heat of the sun hardeneth the clay, as natively and properly, as it causeth the flower to smell fragrantly. However we see clearly, what are this mans thoughts of grace: and let any tell me, if ever a <hi>Pelagian, Semipelagian, Socinian, Arminian,</hi> or <hi>Iesuite,</hi> spoke more to the undervalueing and disparagment of the grace of God?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Finally he tels us, §. 18. that <hi>he acknowledgeth, that God doth operat in some, in a certain special manner, in whom grace so far prevaileth, that salvation necessarily followeth, and God suffereth them not to resist</hi>: This, I confess, is the expression, that seemeth most orthodox, of any he hath yet had, in this matter; and yet <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> will say the same. But is it not thus with all, whom God effectually Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and Converteth? Or are there any really converted and saved without this special operation of grace? If it be not thus with all, then all are not alike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to God and his free grace, for Conversion: and out of what Scripture can we learne this? If it be thus with all, and it must be so with all, who are truely converted; why doth he trouble us with his Sufficient Grace, which alone, without this special manner of operation, never brought a soul to heaven? Was ever, or will ever, a man, that is born in sin, be converted, till grace take away that resistence, which is in him naturally? And did ever that sufficient grace alone do it? Yet (saith he) <hi>in that none did want that measure of grace, whereby they might be saved, they are made justly inexcusable—and they that perish, while they remember the dayes of Visitation, wherein God by his Spirit and light did strive with them, are forced to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor do we understand, how that grace can absolutely be called Sufficient, which removeth not the greatest of impediments, that is to say, Mans Reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy.

We come now to see, what way he proveth the necessity of this light unto salvation, or how such as hear the Gospel are saved by the operations of this Light. <hi>Pag</hi> 107. &amp;c. He citeth that <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:3. <hi>except a man be born againe, or from above, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</hi> And what can this evince? That the outward preaching of the Gospel alone, the literal knowledge of Christ, &amp; historical faith in him, doth or can save a soul, we never said; though he falsly insinuateth so much, in the following words: Yet we see here the mans wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed designe; to wit, to cry up this grace, to the end he may destroy all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Christ, which he hath appointed as meanes, whereby he is pleased to bring about this effect. We never said, that the external preaching of the Gospel alone could save any; yet we know, that by the foolishness of preaching the Lord saveth such as beleeve 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:21. And <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that he begote the <hi>Corinthians</hi> through the Gospel 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:15.

But the maine thing here to be noticed, is that this can make nothing for his point: we grant, that a man must be regenerated by the Grace and Spirit of God; but we deny that any thing, call it as he will, that is common to all the Heathen, is the Seed, or Cause of this new birth. It is wholly from above, and of the Spirit, who is not given to all persons: only such as were foreknown, are predestinate to be conforme to the image of Christ, and they who are thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated are effectually called <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:29, 30.

               <p n="13">13. He tels us afterward <hi>Pag.</hi> 108. that <hi>the new creation, whereof the Apostle speaketh</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5:16, 17. <hi>proceedeth from the operation of this Light and Grace.</hi> And this is the thing, which he should prove; for we deny it, of the Light and Grace, whereof he talketh, and which he will have common to all men breathing. His saying, that <hi>the Word, of which he spoke, is lively and penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp;c.</hi> Is no proofe. For that word, is not a Word, or Seed, or Grace, implanted in every man, as we shewed. He addeth, <hi>this seed is called,</hi> the manifestation of the Spirit given to every man to profite; <hi>for it is written, that</hi> by one Spirit, we are all baptized into one body. <hi>And</hi> Peter <hi>ascribeth this birth unto this seed</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. being born againe not of corruptible seed, &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) If this <hi>Seed</hi> be <hi>the manifestation of the Spirit,</hi> whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:7. It is not common to all the world; for the Apostle is there speaking of the Church, whereof the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (who were sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:1.) were a part; and being an homogeneal part, are called the Body of Christ 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:27. Where doth this <hi>Quaker</hi> read, in the Scriptures, that Heathens, and such as are without the Church, are called the Body of Christ? (2.) Nay, if this <hi>seed</hi> be the <hi>manifestation of the Spirit,</hi> it is so far from being common to all men, that it is not common to all Church members: For these gifts (as they are called <hi>vers.</hi> 4.) were peculiar only to some members of the Church, &amp; given in order to Administrations &amp; Operations <hi>vers.</hi> 5, 6. &amp; are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly specified <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9, 10. Therefore saith the Apostle <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit, divideing to every man severally, as he will; for as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.</hi> Which is abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the scope and whole contexture of the discourse. (3.) The Apostle, for pressing of union and concord, among the members of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> with an edifying use of their several gifts, saith <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>That by one Spirit all we are baptized into one body,</hi> &amp;c. that is, that by baptisme, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours of the Name of Iesus, are outwardly made members of the visible body of Christ; and such, as are really baptized by the Spirit and made partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his grace, are made members of the invisible &amp; mystical body of Christ; and so should lay forth themselves, in the use of their gifts and graces, for the common good of the whole body. And what, I pray, can this make for the <hi>Quakers</hi> point? Doth the Apostle say, that this is common to all such, as never were baptized, nor heard thereof, or did never partake of the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, imported by these words <hi>made to drink</hi> &amp;c. in the end of the verse, as some suppose? And if not, what way will this <hi>Quaker</hi> hence prove, the operation of the new birth, by that which is common to all men breathing? The Apostle,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66147:150"/>
it is true, saith here, <hi>whether Iewes or Gentiles:</hi> Yet he meaneth only such, as are comprehended under <hi>we</hi>; that is such, as were already members of the Church. Will this <hi>Quaker</hi> say, that all and every man are baptized by the Spirit, and have bin made to drink into one Spirit? Then I suppose, he will next say. That all must needs be saved. (4.) As for that <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Seed,</hi> whereof <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh, every one may see, that will beleeve <hi>Peter</hi> himself <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> last, that this word of the Lord, which is the incorruptible seed, &amp; which liveth &amp; abideth for ever, is not any thing abideing in all men; but is that, which is preached by the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="14">14. He proceedeth and saith, <hi>Though this seed, in the first manifestation, be small, as a graine of mustard seed Mat</hi> 13:31, 32. <hi>and though it be hid in the earthy part of mans heart, yet life and salvation is hid in it, and is revealed according as they yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: And in this seed the kingdom of heaven doth potentially lurk, to be produced, or rather exhibited, as it getteth ground, is nourished, and is not suffocated. Answ.</hi> (1.) Are not these noble proofs? Do the <hi>Quakers</hi> think, that we are bound to take their groundless and inconsistent assertions, for probations? (2.) How can this seed have its manifestation; and yet be hid and latent? (3.) Hath a natural, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, unregenerat and heathen man, a spiritual part of an heart? or is the heart of every man partly earthly, and partly heavenly? and why doth this seed lye hid in the earthy part, and not in the heavenly part of the heart? are these any thing but <hi>Quakers</hi> dreames, or new <hi>Pelagian</hi> Notions, sufficiently confuted above? (4.) This must needs be a hid salvation which is hid in a seed, which is hid in the earthy part of mans heart, and that even in its first manifestation; What idle fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies do these men feed upon? (5.) This hid salvation must be a wonderful salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it is revealed, according as these, in whom it is hid, yeeld unto it. But must it not first work &amp; appear in its operations, before men can yeeld to it? who can yeeld to a latent lurking thing, that worketh not, nor appeareth not? (6.) If Salvation be hid in this seed, the kingdom of heaven is more then potentially in it; for we say not that an apple is hid in the seed, especially seing he saith, that this kingdom of heaven is <hi>not produced,</hi> (as the seed can produce, in its way, a tree &amp; its fruit) but <hi>rather exhibited.</hi> (7.) This seed, he saith is already hid in the earthy part of mans heart: and if so, sure, it hath ground: how can he then say, that it is exhibited, as it getteth ground? (8.)

And that summe of the Gospel, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> preach, repeated so often <hi>Pag.</hi> 110. and 111. to wit, <hi>That they call, request, &amp; invite all, to turn in unto the Light within them, &amp; beleeve in Christ, as he is in them,</hi> is enough, and more then enough, to make all wise men abhore their doctrine, and all that love their souls to keep far from them; seing, by what we have said, it is apparent, what this Christ within every man is, and what is this Light, to which he would have all turning in; to wit, nothing but Pelagian or rather Heathenish darkness, which overturneth the Gospel, and its whole administration; for it is but that which every mans conscience can teach: and what the conscience of an <hi>Hannibal, Caesar, Catalin,</hi> yea or of the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished heathen, can teach of that Salvation, Light, Life and Immortality, which is brought to light by the Gospel, who but <hi>Quakers</hi> can imagine? And though this conscience even of a natural heathen wakened, and armed by God in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, would make them tremble, as <hi>Quakers</hi> do, as he saith; yet this will not prove, that it could informe them of the way of salvation by a crucified Christ, without ever hearing of the same preached; as he ignorantly imagineth. And we deny not, that to be a most sure truth, which <hi>Paul</hi> saith 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13:5. but see not of what advantage it can be to him. And this is all which we have for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the first part of his Position.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. Of the Salvation of Heathens without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe second part of this <hi>Quakers</hi> last Assertion, is set down and prosecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed §. 25. <hi>Pag.</hi> 111. It is this in short, <hi>That by the working of this light and feed, some have been saved, and may yet be saved, who never heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or shall hear of Christ, or the Gospel externally preached.</hi> And this must be true with this <hi>Quaker,</hi> though the Apostle faith the contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10:14. <hi>How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not beleeved? And how shall they beleeve on him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? v.</hi> 17. <hi>So then, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> And though he tell us <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2:12. <hi>that the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision—were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the Common wealth of Israel, strangers from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:20, 21, 22, 23.—<hi>That God mad foolish the wisdome of this world; for after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that beleeve: For the Iewes require a signe, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Iewes a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness.</hi> And though Peter tell us <hi>Act.</hi> 4:12 <hi>That there is not salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The first Argument, whereby he would prove this, is deduced from some things formerly asserted by him; and is thus set down <hi>Pag.</hi> 112. <hi>They, to whom the Gospel, which is the power of God unto Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is made manifest, may be saved, what ever external knowledge they want. But this Gospel is preached in every creature, under whom are comprehended even they, who want the outward knowledge. Therefore, &amp;c. Answ.</hi> (1.) This doth not conclude that any such have been, or shall be saved: a <hi>may be</hi> will not evince a <hi>shall be,</hi> (2.) The <hi>Major</hi> in his sense is false, &amp; non-sense, for it is made up of inconsistencies, to wit, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Gospel, which is the power of God, can be made manifest; and yet such, to whom it is made manifest, may not hear of it. And the man, it seemeth, was aware of this, and therefore used these sophistical and ambiguous words, <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque externâ scientiâ careant, whatever outward knowledge they want.</hi> (3.) The <hi>minor</hi> is false, as we cleared above, and vindicated that abused place of <hi>Paul, Col</hi> 1:23. And the Gospel, whereof he speaketh there, is a Gospel, which was heard, and whereof <hi>Paul</hi> was a Minister, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. and was the word of God, which he was commissionated to preach, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. the mystery, which was formerly hid from ages and generations, <hi>vers.</hi> 26. and which he preached by warning and teaching <hi>vers.</hi> 28. And as this could not be without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, so it is certain, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not preach this to every creature,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:66147:152"/>
for <hi>Chap.</hi> 2:1. he speaketh of some, that had not yet seen his face in the flesh See <hi>Beza</hi> on the place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A maine argument he bringeth from <hi>Tit.</hi> 2:11. <hi>for the grace of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared unto all men.</hi> But that particle, <hi>all,</hi> doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cary an universal sense, as we manifested above <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII. And until he prove, that it is thus universally to be taken here, he can prove nothing. And whatever he think, who is not, it seemeth, very well acquanted with the laws of disput, a negation is sufficient to elide a naked affirmation; and he that affirmeth, must prove. Nor regard we his saying, that the interpreting of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, as importing <hi>genera singulorum,</hi> is abusing of the Scripture; or that this universal particle cannot be taken for an indefinite; Seing there are so many instances thereof in the N. T. as <hi>Mat.</hi> 4:33. and others formerly cited. And his grounding his opinion upon mistaken and thus misinterpreted words and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, is not a founding of it upon express Scripture; but upon abused and perverted Scripture. Let him consider, what <hi>Beza</hi> (a man better acquanted with the Greek tongue, than he is) saith in his <hi>Annot.</hi> on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2:1. where he tels us, that he hath observed almost in every page, that the universal parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is taken for an indefinite, and is used to take away a difference, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1:16. it is used to take away the difference, that was betwixt Jew and Gentile: and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6:12. where it removeth the Jewish distinction of meats. And he tels us moreover, that this manner of speaking is used among the Latines, as well as among the Greeks, as by <hi>Cicero</hi> in <hi>orat. pro Roscio Amerino: Non omnem fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nis fert omnia tellus.</hi> And as for this passage of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> the context cleareth, that the universal is to be here taken for an indefinite: For he was before speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Servants; and here he sheweth, that the Gospel is revealed unto them, as well as to others, to the end, they should know how to carry themselves, so as to adorne the doctrine of God our Saviour, in all things. And if he read that Epistle, he will finde the universal particle, oftener than once, taken for an indefinite, as <hi>Tit.</hi> 1:16. &amp; 2:15. &amp; 3:1, 2. And beside, what will all this make for his point? He must prove, that it was thus, as well under the Law, as now it is under the Gospel; and sure, no such thing can hence be made to appear; for these universal particles, in this matter, do denote the largeness of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Gospel administration, beyond what was under the Law, as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and proved above: And in this same Epistle <hi>Chap.</hi> 1:3. he saith, <hi>That in due times, God manifested his word through preaching, which was committed unto him.</hi> Out of which words also we learne, that this Gospel and word is manifested through preaching of men, such as <hi>Paul,</hi> to the outward eares of people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare to what this man imagineth. And so, if this Gospel or Grace of God, hath appeared to every man, without exception, every man, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any, hath outwardly heard the Gospel, preached by men, sent of God to speak with an audible voice: Yet I suppose, this <hi>Quaker</hi> will blush to say, that every man, all the world over, heareth Gospel preachers, or men sent to preach the Gospel, &amp; hath heard such since the beginning. And if he say not this, and prove it not too, he must quite his Assertion, and laugh at his owne ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:66147:153"/>
folly and boldness, or rather weep over it. What he saith <hi>Pag.</hi> 113. of our taking <hi>All</hi> for the lesser part, is both false, and Childish pedantry in him; for we say, that it is taken in this matter indefinitly, and so doth neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a greater nor a lesser number, or part; as when Christ is said to have cured <hi>all diseases</hi>; though upon the matter, the number of diseases he cured, being within the confines of Iudea, for the most part, was the far lesser part, in comparison of all the diseases, that were through the whole world; yet we say not, that the particle <hi>all</hi> there denoteth the lesser number, but that it is taken indefinitly. I must also take notice here, that when the Apostle on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saith, that <hi>the grace of God, that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</hi> that is, was preached, and plainly declared and made manifest in the Gospel administration, he dreameth of a saving grace given to every man, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every man: and so what the Apostle speaketh of Outward grace, or of the Outward Dispensation of grace, he understandeth of Inward grace, wrought and rooted in the heart. <hi>Finally,</hi> neither can he hence prove, that ever any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church was or shall be really saved; for, as we said, a possibility, or <hi>may be,</hi> will not inferre a <hi>shall be,</hi> or <hi>must have been.</hi> And will he say, that this grace; which teacheth to live soberly, righteously and godly, in this present world, hath appeared to all heathens, who never understood the right way of worshiping of God, in Christ, according to his word? Whatever the light of nature might teach them darkly, concerning Sobriety and Temperance, as to themselves; and concerning Righteousness in their dealings with others; as also concerning the unreasonableness of their Idolatry <hi>Act.</hi> 14:16, 17. &amp; 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. Another argument, to prove this possibility of salvation to heathens, he bringeth from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:18. <hi>Therefore, as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life</hi>: And he will needs have <hi>all men</hi> in the last part, to be of as large an extention, as it is in the first part; little considering, that hereby, he shall not only prove a possibility of salvation to all men (which is the thing he intendeth here) but also, that all men are and shall be actually saved; for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came upon all the posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> not potentially only, but actually: and this Justification of life; is actual and real justification, through the imputed righteousness of Christ, which who ever hath shall really obtaine life. But he perverteth the words of the Apostle, to evite this absurdity, when he frameth his argument thus, <hi>If all men received by Adam evil leading to damnation; then all men did also receive benefite by Christ, leading to justification</hi>; while as the Apostle saith, that <hi>judgment came upon all men to condemnation</hi>; and <hi>Beza</hi> well sheweth, that it is <hi>reatus</hi> or <hi>guilt,</hi> or <hi>judgment,</hi> that is here to be understood, as is clear from <hi>vers.</hi> 16. <hi>for the judgment was by one to condemnation</hi>: &amp; the <hi>free gift,</hi> (which must also here be supplied from <hi>vers.</hi> 16) <hi>came upon all men unto justification of life</hi>; So that it was not any thing, having a kinde of tendency or manuducency unto Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Justification, which yet might fail; but it was that which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:66147:153"/>
attended with Condemnation in the one, and Justification in the other; or rather was Condemnation and Iustification it self, as the <hi>Syriak</hi> version hath it. But whatever this man imagineth, the sense and meaning of the place is clear, that as all, whom <hi>Adam</hi> represented, did by his one Offence incurre Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; so all, whom the second <hi>Adam</hi> Christ Iesus did represent, did by his Righteousness obtaine Iustification; as we cleared above, on another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and therefore need say no more to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. He citeth to this same purpose <hi>Esai.</hi> 49<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. Where Christ is said to be <hi>given for a Light to the Gentiles:</hi> But its impertinency is obvious; for though Christ be given fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And further, Christ becometh a light to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, by opening the blinde eyes, by bringing out the prisoners from the prison, and them that fit in darkness out of the prison house, as the parallel place <hi>Esai.</hi> 42 6.7. cleareth. And all this is done by preaching of the Gospel, as we see in <hi>Pauls</hi> commission <hi>Act.</hi> 26:18. And as this same Prophet cleareth <hi>Esai.</hi> 61:1, 2, 3.

               <p n="6">6. In the next place, he assayeth to prove, that some such have been really saved, and he saith, <hi>that to think otherwise is against all charity,</hi> and he seeth not <hi>how it can be made good.</hi> But our charity is not to be blinde, but is to be ruled by the word: And he should know, that he is now the affirmer, and should prove what he asserteth. What saith he to <hi>Act.</hi> 4:12? He answereth. <hi>That though outwardly they do not know, yet inwardly feeling his power and vertue, they know inwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly his name really, redeeming them from sin and iniquity, and so may be saved.</hi> But how proveth he, that such as are without the Church and Covenant, and hear not of Christ in the Gospel, and have no external knowledge, can have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward feeling of the power of Christ, as a Saviour? And how can he show to us, that this gloss doth agree with, and not manifestly cross, the scope of <hi>Peter,</hi> in that place? Both these I deny, and in this he goeth further than <hi>Vasques,</hi> and other <hi>Papists,</hi> who say that even heathens and such as have no faith in Christ may get of his grace to do things morally good. See <hi>Estius</hi> also in secund. sent. dist. 41. §. 3. His adding <hi>Pag.</hi> 114 <hi>that salvation is not in a literal knowledge</hi>; is impertinent; for he should prove, that salvation is, where there is no literal knowledge, nor meanes thereunto. His supposing, that there can be a real inward and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental knowledge of Christ, where there is no outward or literal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is but a dream, which we cannot receive without clear proof. His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is a plaine <hi>non-sequitur, If</hi> (saith he) <hi>a distinct &amp; outward knowledge of Christ be necessary to me, before I receive any benefite by him, then, by the rule of contraries, it will follow, that I can incurre no dammage, unless I have a distinct knowledge of him.</hi> For when capt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if the man will here understand that dammage, which followeth upon a rejected Mediator, and the wo of <hi>Bethsaida</hi> above the wo of <hi>Tyrus</hi> &amp; <hi>Sydon</hi>; &amp; the wo of <hi>Capernaum</hi> above the wo of the men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> I shall grant his consequence to be good; though it be absurd and ridiculous, in a general sense. His question, asking, <hi>why such as never heard of Christ's death &amp; resurrection cannot be saved, as well as such, as never heard of Adam's first sin, can be damned therefore</hi>? Is no proof: And the answere is manifest, because, all were naturally and foederally in <hi>Adam</hi>: But all are not so in Christ: And it hath pleased the Lord to appoint this way of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith in Christ, which cannot be without knowledge of Christ, and the Lord hath thought it good to apply the benefites of Christs death by bringing such, who are to partake thereof, within the bond of the Covenant, within the visible Church, and under the administrations of the Gospel; and so to joyn to the Church such as should be saved <hi>Act.</hi> 2:47. Therefore the Lord saith <hi>Esai</hi> 53:11.—<hi>by his knowledge</hi> (or by knowledge of him) <hi>shall my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous servant justifie many.</hi> And the <hi>predestinated ones</hi> are made <hi>partakers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchased by Christ, according to the riches of God's grace, wherein he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded towards them, in all wisdom and prudence: having made known unto them the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in himself Ephes.</hi> 1:7, 8, 9. And if the will and good pleasure of God, so ordaining maters, for the praise of the glory of his grace, will not satisfie this <hi>Quaker,</hi> but he will frame a Gospel, out of his own braines, we cannot helpe it; but must tell him, we will rather beleeve God, and submit to his wise dispensations, than embrace the delusions of fantastical <hi>Quakers,</hi> who purpose to overturne the whole Gospel of the grace of God, and destroy souls.

His questions then may easily be answered, without that inward common grace, which he dreameth of; to wit, that God taught <hi>Iob,</hi> as he did other holy men before the giving of the Law; and that without Scripture, which was not then written. His supposing thereafter <hi>Pag.</hi> 116. that <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh of this light <hi>Chap.</hi> 24:13. is another of his fond imaginations.

That the Gentiles were not without all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what was just and unjust, honest and dishonest, is most certain; for so much was remaining ingraven in their hearts, that could not be delete: and this was evidenced by their commanding and forbidding, by their Laws, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things commanded and forbidden by the Law of God, as appeareth by their Laws against <hi>Theft, Adultery, Manslaughter,</hi> and the like; which yet was not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal. It is in the original only thus, <hi>they do by nature the things of the Law</hi>; And as <hi>Beza</hi> well observeth, this differeth from doing what the Law commandeth, being a doing of what the Law doth, that is commanding or prohibiting what the Law commandeth or prohibiteth: And therefore is it added, <hi>these, having not a Law, are a Law unto themselves.</hi> (2.) Hence it appeareth, that it will not follow, that they therefore feared God, and wrought righteousness; for the same Apostle tels us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1:21. that <hi>when they knew God, they glorified him not, as God, neither were thankful, but became vaine in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</hi> Is this to fear God, and work righteousness? And though hereby the Apostle evinceth the Gentiles to be without excuse: Yet he tels us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3:9. <hi>that he hath proved both Iewes and Gentiles, that they are all under sin.</hi> And will this <hi>Quaker</hi> contradict the Apostle; and say, it is not true, that the Gentiles are under sin, though the Apostle hath charged it home upon them; for they feared God and wrought righteousness? This were indeed blasphemous boldness, suiteing only a <hi>Quaker.</hi> But he thinks that <hi>vers.</hi> 13. confirmeth all; where <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>the doers of the Law are justified.</hi> As if <hi>Paul</hi> were speaking that of the Gentiles, which is spoken of the Jewes, who heard the Law, which the Gentiles did not: And as if <hi>Paul</hi> did hereby insinuat, that any man, Jew or

Vers.</hi> 20. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be justified in his sight.</hi> What shall we think of this <hi>Quaker,</hi> who thus maketh the Apostle contradict himself; and inferreth out of the Apostles words perverted, the contrary of what the Apostle himself (who knew the force of his owne premises best) concludeth? And what bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and blasphemy is comparable to this?

His repetitions <hi>Pag.</hi> 117. I wave, they being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly confuted: and repititions being jejune probations, need not be againe examined.

And if he doubt whether we can prove it, it is no great matter, if he doubt not himself of the thing: And if he do doubt of the thing, Where is his charity to the Patriarchs and Saints? What charity can this be, which is so large to Heathens, and so straitned to the Saints of God? Can this be divine charity? No, it is a <hi>Pagans</hi> charity, suting him, who would have us all turn <hi>Pagans.</hi> But seing the Scripture tels us, that <hi>they all obtained a good report by faith, which is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen, Heb.</hi> 11:1, 2.

Mr <hi>Clapham</hi> in his book against the <hi>Quakers Sect.</hi> 5. tels us, that I. <hi>Nayler,</hi> in his <hi>Love to the lost</hi> P. 3. joyneth with the Papists, and pleads <hi>for our being made righteous, by Gods putting in righteousness in us, and by righteousness wrought in the creature.</hi> And P. 50. with Papists, he confounds Justification, Sanctification and Mortificat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; and argueth for it, as they do. So Mr <hi>Stalham,</hi> in his book against them <hi>Part.</hi> 1 <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. sheweth out of their owne words, what friends they are unto the man of sin, by laying the bottome of a believers justification, not upon Christs obedience, but upon sanctification. And <hi>Sect.</hi> 25. he tels us, that <hi>I. Nailer</hi> said, <hi>that the man of sin is discovered in them, who say, beleevers are pure and spoteless too, by reason of imputation:</hi> and <hi>in his Love to the lost</hi> p. 51. that <hi>men are so justified, as they are sanctified and mortified, and no further.</hi> And that <hi>F. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> in <hi>The inheritance of Iacob</hi> Pag. 29. hath these words <hi>Christ fulfilled the Law, and he fulfils it in them, who know him and his work, and herein man becomes to be justified in Gods sight by Christ, who works all our works in us and for us. Mr Hicks</hi> in his 2 <hi>Dialogue</hi> Pag. 4. tels us, that <hi>Isaak Pennington</hi> asks this question, <hi>Can outward blood cleanse</hi>? And saith, <hi>Therefore, we must enquire, whether it was the blood of the vail, that is, of the humane nature, or the blood within the vail</hi> viz. <hi>of that spiritual man, consisting of flesh, bloud and bones, which took on him the vail; or humane nature? It is not the bloud of the vail, that is but outward; and can outward blood cleanse</hi>? And that <hi>Edward Billing</hi> most wickedly said, that <hi>the mystery of iniquity lyes in the bloud of Christ.</hi> And that these words frequently drop from their mouthes, <hi>dost thou look at Christs death afar off? What will that bloud avail? Didst ever see any of it? That carnal bloud cleanse? If thou hadst a great deal of it, would it do thee any good</hi>? If such, as speak thus of the precious bloud of Christ, can have right thoughts of Justification, the sober may easily judge. And what intimation <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> giveth about this, may be seen there P. 18,—22, &amp;c. I love not to transcribe the words, only that which he hath <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. seemeth to be plaine. <hi>Thou beast—who would have another righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than that which Christ works in the saints and by them.</hi> He tels us likewise ib. <hi>Pag.</hi> 31. <hi>that Will.

And how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an errour this is, undermineing the very cardinal point of Christianity, every true Christian may know. The <hi>Quakers</hi> in this are one with their Predecessours, the old <hi>Anabaptists</hi> too.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We come now to our <hi>Quaker,</hi> and must see, how he expresseth himself in this matter: In his <hi>Thesis</hi> he saith, <hi>who receive the illumination of this light</hi> (that is, as we evinced above, the dim light of nature) <hi>it</hi> (that must be the Light or the Natural Conscience) <hi>becometh in them a holy pure and spiritual birth, produceing piety, righteousness, purity and other excellent fruites, most acceptable to God.</hi> This, sure, is a wonderful metamorphosis. But how cometh it, that this light is so much beholden to man, in whom it is, that if he do not resist it, but receive its illumination religiously, it will become a glorious and mighty powerful thing; but if he do resist it, and receive not its illumination, it remaineth what it was? Is this the Christian New birth, and Regeneration, whereof the Scripture speaketh? Is this to be borne of the Spirit? There is no infusion of any gracious principle or habite of grace and virtue here; for the seed of all was in the man from his mothers womb, and his kinde nature, in receiving the illumination of this connatural light, blew the coale, and it became a burning fire, warming the soul into all Christian vertues. Is this Gospel doctrine? or rather is it not Pelagian-quakerisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What followeth upon this? <hi>By this holy birth</hi> (saith he) <hi>to wit,

Christ Iesus formed within</hi> (a goodly title; but it is but the <hi>Quakers</hi> Jesus; that is, blake Nature, or the product of Corrupt nature,) <hi>produceing his works in us,</hi> (these, sure, are nothing but works of darkness) <hi>as we are sanctified, so are we justified in the sight of God.</hi> Then Iustification, and Sanctification, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tand upon one and the same ground; and if there be any difference betwixt them, Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation must follow Sanctification. Thus it is manifest, how he homologateth with other <hi>Quakers,</hi> and how they all agree with <hi>Papists,</hi> in the doctrine of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. He addeth (and one may wonder at the mans confidence and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) <hi>according to the Apostles words, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, in the name of the Lord Iesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> But if either his sanctification or Iustification, as now explained to us, be either in the name of the Lord Iesus, or by the Spirit of God, <hi>I</hi> am far deceived: Nay, it is manifest, that they are rather by the Power and Authority, Vertue and Efficacy of Free will, and the Natural Spirit of man, receiving kindly the Illumination of that natural Light, in every man, and so transforming that natural thing to produce such works, as by which the man is both Sanctified and justified. Though this be the native sense and import of his words; yet marke his effrontedness. <hi>Therefore</hi> (sayes he) <hi>it is not done by our works, produced by our will, nor yet by good works, considered by themselves.</hi> What a shameless man is this, to deny these works to be mans owne works, which flow from a principle, borne and brought into the world with him; and not only so, but actuated, and transformed into a new pure and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual spring, by the sole will of the man, not resisting its light, but receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same. If these be not properly the mans owne works, it is a great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, if man have any works, that can be called his owne. But let it be so, that they goe under the name of works done by a new infused principle (and yet the <hi>Quakers</hi> are more <hi>Pelagian,</hi> then the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and all the <hi>Papists</hi>; for these acknowledge infused habites, which <hi>Quakers</hi> know nothing of) yet they may be called mans works, and works produced by mans will; to wit, now regenerated and principled of new; otherwise they are produced in man, and mans will hath no elicite or imperat acts thereanent, This is indeed Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisme <hi>in folio.</hi> But how can men be Sanctified, or Iustified (according to the <hi>Quakers,</hi>) by that which is none of theirs, nor wrought by them? Againe, he must know, that the Scripture excludeth all these holy works, even produced by that new principle, from being the ground or formal reason, or <hi>ratio for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis objectiva,</hi> of our Iustification; as all our Divines shew, writting against the Papists, on this head: And in this he giveth further evidence of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spireing with <hi>Papists</hi> against the truth. <hi>Finally,</hi> I wish he had explained that to us, <hi>nor by good works considered in themselves,</hi> for it importeth, that good works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered some other way, possibly in conjunction with some other thing (and what that is, I know not,) are the ground of our Iustification: But seing Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Sanctification, stand upon the same ground, with him, he must also say, that we are not Sanctified by good works considered by themselves: and if good works, or works of Sanctification and holiness, considered as such, will not ground the denomination of Sanctification, I would faine know what will?</p>

But if they neither be Sanctified, nor Iustified by these good works, by what are they Sanctified, or Iustified? <hi>It is by Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>who is the gift, and the giver, and the cause produceing the effects in us.</hi> But this Christ is nothing else but a Creature, produced in man, by mans industry and goodwill, not stubbornly resisting, but piously receiving the illumination of the light; and that out of this light, which is in every Son of <hi>Adam</hi>; for he told us, that this Light, when thus religiously entertained, becometh a holy, pure and spiritual birth; and this is the Christ formed in us, who is the gift and the giver, and producer of all the fruits of holiness, which are acceptable unto God: Are we not then Iustified by our works, when Iustified by this Christ, or Principle produceing these works in us; especially seing this Christ, is a Christ formed within; and not that Christ, who laid downe his life a ransome for sinners, and offered up himself a sacrifice to divine justice, to satisfie justice and the Law, by his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Death, for the Redemption of his people? We heard lately, that this Christ, and his Blood, is far off, in their account, and cannot cleanse, or do us any good. But further I think, that, even in this, <hi>Quakers</hi> are far worse then <hi>Papists</hi>; for when <hi>Papists</hi> will have us Iustified by works, they speak of works wrought in the soul by the Spirit, real works of grace, flowing from an inward principle of grace; but our <hi>Quakers,</hi> though they give goodly words, yet really their works, by which they are Sanctified and Iustified, are but works wrought (at best) by the Power of Nature: For that Light within every man, (as was shewed above) is but pure Nature, and whatever is borne of or proceedeth from this seed, is but Nature; for <hi>that which is borne of the flesh, it flesh, Ioh.</hi> 3:6. And from nothing that is in man by nature, or in all men, can that which is heavenly and spiritual spring: unless we turne <hi>Pelagians,</hi> this is to be held.

And when all the Efficient cause, that we hear of from him, produceing this pure and spiritual birth, or educeing it out of its matter, or causing its change, and being some other thing than it was, is only man, and man doing nothing but receiving the illumination of this light; can we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, this to be any thing else, than a pure product of nature, which <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pagans, Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> who never heard one word of Christ, may be partakers of? And can this Sanctification and Justification, be that mentioned in the Scriptures, when it is common to infidels, who are without God and without Christ, in the world, if they will but obey the light of nature? Is this which he talketh of, to be borne of God? No certainly, but rather it is to be borne of bloud, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man; but so are not any borne, that receive Christ, and beleeve in his name, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1:12, 13. One thing more, Seing this Light, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> say, is in every man, is in Devils, and that in a greater measure, than in man; may it not also be said of them, that if they will receive this light, and not resist it, it shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an holy, pure and spiritual Birth, and Christ formed within?

(3.) Nor doth these words of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus Chap.</hi> 3:5, 6. any way confirme his fancy; but rather establish the contrary truth: to wit, that all the favours, which God conferreth upon us, in order to salvation, are of free grace, and not by works of righteousness (or works, which are done in righteousness, and righteously, as the words in the original bear) which we have done: Grace and Mercy here are set in opposition to all our works, yea to our best works; and therefore, if Iustification be an act of God's grace, (as the Scripture saith it is) it is not, nor can it be, because, or upon the account of our works of righteousness.

Therefore cannot Iustification passe upon the account of any thing framed, and done in us, or by us; because, that is not, nor can it be, that which will passe for a Righteousness, in the eyes of God, and a Righteousness answerable to the Law, in all points; it being, when it is at its best, but imperfect; nor can it have any merite or deserving in it, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensat for former transgressions, being alwayes that only, which we are obliged unto; so that when we have done all, we must say, that we are but unprofitable servants, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17: <hi>vers.</hi> 10. we have done but what was our duty to do.</p>

purifieing us, delivering us from the power of corruption, and bringing into favour, union, and familiarity with God. Answ.</hi> (1.) That the Lord Jesus Redeemeth by Power, through his Spirit, from sin and corruption, all such as he hath Redeemed by Price, from Law and justice, we willingly grant: But how can he say, that these two are inseparable, seing then they must be of equal extent; and so, as the first Redemption was, in his judgment, for all and every man; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond must extend to all and every man; and so all and every man must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the power of corruption; and consequently must be saved. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, how can he say this, who pleadeth afterward for the Apostasie of the Saints? But (2.) This purifying and delivering from corruption, as would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by his words, is not wrought by the second Redemption; but only a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that that pure and perfect Redemption is in us, purifying us &amp;c. And so all that is had by this second Redemption, is but a sight of what the fruite of the first Redemption is doing: So that by the first Redemption, not only man hath power, to subdue corruption, but he actually doth subdue it, without any new grace or divine help, and by the second Redemption he is only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from darkness, which hindered his actual perceiving of the operation of the gift and grace bestowed, upon the first Redemption. (3.) whether is this second Redemption necessary unto salvation, or not? I suppose he will say, yes. Then what shall become of the childe of God, that walketh in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp; hath no light? what shall become of them, that have true grace, and grace uniteing them to Christ, &amp; to God through Christ, &amp; yet through dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (the Lord dispensing so, partly as a punishment, &amp; partly for tryal &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise) can see and acknowledge no such thing?</p>

Principle of grace, and the sanctification, which is defined in the Larger Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme, as we saw above; and by this himself afterward tels us, we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the divine nature; and this, as <hi>Contarenus</hi> said with truth, belongeth to an Inherent Righteousness: and so still he holds with the <hi>Tridentine Papists,</hi> who will have us justified by a Righteousness inherent in us; and that in opposition to a Righteousness imputed. And when afterward he saith, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others disput against this, and other Papists understood it not, he should have named the place (2.) That God is well pleased with this, will say nothing, for he is well pleased also with good works, that flow from this Principle, betwixt which two, this <hi>Quaker</hi> would distinguish, in this question.

But we are not so properly by Christ formed within us; for this is a consequent of, and in nature, though not in time, posteriour to our union to Christ by Faith, which is brought about in effectual calling: and as a consequent of this union followeth also Justification; the formal objective reason of which is not either this union, or begun san<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Seing in these matters, he seemeth to be an utter stranger, I would advise him to read our Larger Catechisme better, if he think not himself too far advanced, to turne a catechumene againe. What followeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 128. is but a specimen of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Spirit, in abusing of Scripture with their sensless allegorick glosses, and hath no Interest in this queston; and therefore I have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. He tels us next, that <hi>though we be not justified for good works, yet we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in them: and they are necessary, as causa sine qua non. Ans.</hi> That good works are called for from Justified persons, we acknowledge; but what Interest they have in putting us into a state of Justification, we see not. His giving them an interest of a <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> contradicteth what he said before: for he would have us Justified by Christ formed within; and this is antecedent to good works, as the tree is unto the fruit. And he also said in the preceeding <hi>Pag,</hi> that good works follow Justification, as the effects thereof: and how then, they can come in, as a <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> he must help us by his next to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand; and cleare to us, how the Effect can be the <hi>causa sine qua non</hi> of the Cause: But this man must have liberty to contradict himself.

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66147:164"/>
he mean, not a justification as to state, but a justification as to particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is impertinent.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In the last place he saith, <hi>that if he and his fraternity held the same opinion about good works, that Protestants hold, they would easily confess, that they were not only not nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssary, but that they were noxious.</hi> Though Protestants assert the necessity of good works, in justified persons, come to age; they assert notwithstanding their noxiousness in Justification; that is if they be considered, as any part of that Righteousness, upon consideration whereof the person is declared just, &amp; Justified before God; or as any part of the formal Objective reason of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; or, as others speak, as any part of the formal cause of Justification. But what is his ground? <hi>for they affirme,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the best works of saints are corrupted and defiled.</hi> It is true, we say indeed, that our best works are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but have ad mixture of dross, and of much imperfection; but that is not all the cause, why we deny such an interest to works in Justification, as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> and he plead for; but this Interest we deny to works mainly because, it would spoile Christ of the glory of our Justification, and of being our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that is due to him; and give man ground of boasting, which by Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Justification is wholly excluded. But do not Quakers say the same of good works? <hi>we judge</hi> (saith he) <hi>the best works, done by man, intending conformity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Law, in his owne strength, natural power, and proper will, to be such, that is, polluted.</hi> But protestants do not account these properly good works, but only materially such, as not flowing from a principle of grace, and from the Spirit of sanctification. What doth he say of these? <hi>These are pure and holy</hi> (sayes he) <hi>as is the root they come from, and therefore God accepts them, and justifieth us in them, and rewardeth us for them of his proper and free grace.</hi> But the question is, whether they be perfect, and can stand before the tribunal of Justice, and so become any part of that Righteousness, answering the Law, which requireth perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in all points, which is the formal objective reason of our Justification before God, whose judgment is according to truth?</p>
               <p n="18">18. Thus we have seen his explication of their Opinion, which in short is this, That the formal objective reason, or, as he with others speak, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cause of Justification, is a Principle of grace within, or Christ formed there; that is, the spring and principle of good works, which is begun sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. This I say, is it, according to his words; but if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is true, the methode of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requireth, that the Persons be first united to Christ by faith, before they can obtaine these benefites of his Redemption; but this is not the thing, he speaketh of. (2.) This grace and seed is, with him, common to all flesh: But the Scriptures tell us not, as we have showne above, that Christ's righteousness was for all, or that all receive grace, by vertue thereof. (3.) Christ formed within by the inward operations of that grace and seed, which is common to Pagans, is but a Natural Christ, and Birth: for such as the cause is, such must the effect be: And so, what followeth upon this, is but a Pagan righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Justification. (4.) It is false, as we have already manifested, that God is said to be Reconciled only in respect of this capacity, and offer of grace. (5.)

mention, and dreames that have no sense, but with men of distracted braines.</p>
               <p n="21">21. We are nothing the wiser by this proof, let us see the next. <hi>If God</hi> (saith he) <hi>should be totally reconciled unto men, and repute them just, while they were actually unjust, why doth he so oft complean of his people, as Esai</hi> 59:2. <hi>where there is perfect and compleat reconciliation, there is no separation; or it will follow, that sins can make no separation, and that their good works and worst sinnes are the same, in Gods account, This giveth too great liberty to sin.</hi> And in the margine, he saith, <hi>he speaketh not here of persons not yet converted, whom Antinomians, their adversaries, say were justified from the beginning; but of persons converted, according to Protestants, who may fall into grievous sinnes, and yet are said by them, to remaine perfectly and wholly justified. Answ.</hi> (1.) Here beginne we to understand something of his Proposition, and of its designe: And for answere we say, That there is a twofold unrighteousness; one of State, or of Person, another of Condition, and particular Actions. As to the <hi>first,</hi> no unrighteous person is justified; because, before Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he must be cloathed with the imputed righteousness of Christ, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted just; and in Justification declared just, because constituted just. And as to the <hi>second,</hi> though such an one, as committeth sin, be in so far unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to his actions; and in that, not justified, or approven of God: Yet, being united to Christ by faith, and thereby put in a justified state, he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Gods account, a justified person, as to his State, which is not broken off by these sinnes. This may be further cleared, when we come to speak of perseverence. (2.) Not to insist on <hi>Esai.</hi> 59. and other such Scripture places, which may be understood of the generality and body of a Church, which are Gods people <hi>by profession,</hi> but not by real union, through faith; and so speak nothing to the point in hand: We say, that sin in the justified, though it mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a separation from God, in respect of his fatherly smileing countenance, &amp; so procureth fatherly displeasure, wrath and anger, and sad chaftnings; Yet maketh not a separation from the state of favour; nor putteth them againe into that state of separation, wherein they were before conversion. (3.) We grant, that sins in the Regenerat can so far make a separation, as that by such sinnes, the regenerat may incurre Gods displeasure, <hi>Esa.</hi> 64:5, 6, 9. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11:27. grieve the Spirit of God <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4:30. lose some measure of their graces and comforts <hi>Psal.</hi> 51:8, 10, 12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5:2, 3, 4, 6. have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences wounded <hi>Psal.</hi> 37:3, 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 51:8. and bring temporal judgments on themselves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11:32. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89: <hi>ver.</hi> 31 32. (4.) Hence we see a manifest difference, betwixt their best works and worst sinnes, even in Gods account. (5.) And also we see, how false it is to say, that our doctrine openeth a door to licentiousness. (6.) Though he call <hi>Antinomians</hi> his adversaries; Yet he and they agree in this principal thing against the Orthodox, that both say there is no difference to be put, betwixt God's Fatherly-displeasure, and his Law-wrath.</p>
               <p n="22">22. His <hi>third</hi> argument followeth, which in summe, is this, <hi>The Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth faith and repentance, and other like conditions, before Iustification; which is in vaine, if we be justified before. Ans.</hi> This saith something against <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who plead for a Justification before faith: But the man knoweth, that we are not of that judgment; for our <hi>Confession of faith</hi> saith <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. § 4. <hi>That though
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:66147:166"/>
God did from all eternity decree to justifie all the elect (Gal.</hi> 3:8, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:2, 19, 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:30) <hi>and Christ did, in the fulness of time, die for their sinnes, and rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for their Iustification (Gal.</hi> 4:4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2:6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4:25.) <hi>yet they are not justified, until the holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them (Col.</hi> 1:21, 22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2:16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3:4, 5, 6, 7.) What followeth in that <hi>Page</hi> 131. speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing against us; for we maintaine not <hi>Antinomian</hi> doctrine. But <hi>Pag.</hi> 132. he saith, <hi>that the Intercession of Christ should be made vaine and unnecessary, if he should pray for such, as are already reconciled and perfectly justified. Ans.</hi> Neither doth this make against us: for we say not, with <hi>Antinomians,</hi> that sinnes not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, are actually pardoned. And as for the state of Reconciliation, and Justification, which we owne; as it maketh not after-sinnes to be already par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, so it rather establisheth the use and necessity of Christs intercession, to the end, they, who are justified, may obtaine remission of these after-sins, after the Gospel methode; that is, after they have repented of them, and gone by faith to the bloud of Christ; and that they may get grace to recover them out of sin, by Faith and Repentance. And this may serve for confutation of what followeth, being nothing but a repetition of his corrupt doctrine, and a renewed act of his wonted manner of perverting Scripture, to the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of his dreames, without any coloure of verity.</p>
               <p n="23">23. He sayes <hi>next,</hi> he will answere Objections, and proposeth one <hi>Pag.</hi> 133. §. 6. And that he saith, <hi>is taken from</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5:18, 19. whence he sayes, <hi>they</hi> (and who these are. he telleth not) <hi>inferre that Christ perfected totally the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, while he was upon the earth. Ans.</hi> If the meaning of the Objection be, that Christ did so perfect the work of reconciliation, on earth, that there was nothing to be done by man, in order to his actual Justification, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God; we owne it not: And by his answere it seemeth this is the meaning thereof. Of the place we spoke above, and rejected his corrupt sense thereof, which here againe he repeateth. The next Objection is from <hi>vers.</hi> 21. and he thus frameth it, <hi>As our sin is imputed to Christ, so is his Righteousness imputed to us, though we be not just; and we are just only by imputation, as Christ was a sinner.</hi> How this is brought in here, I see not: but he must take his liberty. Let us hear what he answereth. <hi>Albeit</hi> (saith he) <hi>Christ is said to have borne our sinnes, and to have suffered for them, and to be reputed among men, for a sinner; Yet God did not repute him a sinner, for he was holy. Ans.</hi> That Christ was personally and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently holy, is very true; and that God looked upon him, as such, is true also; but yet, as a Cautioner, taking on the debt of his people, he became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively a sinner; And the Father constituting him thus a cautioner, in the room and place of the chosen ones, is here said to have <hi>made him sin, who knew no sin, that we through him might be made the righteousness of God.</hi> He addeth. <hi>Nor did Christ die, that we might be accounted just, though no more really just, than Christ was really unjust. Ans.</hi> Nor do we speak so; but this we say, as Christ, who was inherently and personally holy; Yet, as our Cautioner, was by imputation accounted a sinner, our sinnes being laid upon him, and caused to meet upon him, as <hi>Esa.</hi> 53:6. So, though we be unrighteous in ourselves, and inherently sinful and guilty; Yet, by imputation of Christs righteousness, we are really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:66147:166"/>
just. He proceedeth, <hi>If we be made just, as Christ was a sinner, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, then, as there was not the least sin in Christ, so there is no necessity for the least righteousness in us. Answ.</hi> Neither is there any necessity of our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, (if we except faith closeing with Christ) in order to our becoming Righteous by imputation, or being justified upon that account. But as to other ends and uses, he knoweth we plead for a necessity of inherent righteousness. He saith, <hi>This is to be understood only in that he did undergo torments in soul and body, which were due to our sins, that we might be partakers of that grace, which he by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obteaned for us, by the operations of which grace, we are made the righteousness of God in him. Ans.</hi> This is said but not proven; and is contradictory to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive import of the words, and scope of the place: His undergoing the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment due to our sinnes, as our Sponsor and Cautioner, presupposeth his standing in our room, and being charged with our guilt, else he could not have suffered, and payed our debt, as our Surety, He proveth, <hi>That this righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is meaned of infused righteousness, because the Apostle speaketh of such a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the</hi> 14, 15, <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. <hi>verses of the following Chapter. Answ.</hi> This Argument is fit for a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and for a desperat cause; but a wise man will laugh at it. But saith he, <hi>There should be concord betwixt light and darkness, and betwixt righteousness &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness, if men were said to be in Christ by an imputative righteousness without them, while they are actually unjust. Ans.</hi> He knoweth, that though we say, persons are justified only by a righteousness imputed, whereby they are declared to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally righteous in the sight of God, &amp; accepted of as such: Yet we say with all, that the same perso<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s are really sanctified; &amp; that sanctification is inseparably joyned with Justification: And so the discord is in his owne imagination. But he loveth to drink in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> muddy waters. He saith, that <hi>Christ would never, in all his sermons, have people resting upon such a righteousness; but did alwayes recommend to them good works, as instruments of Iustification. Ans.</hi> This is a notorious untruth. See <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6:29. &amp; 9:35, 36. &amp; 10:38. &amp; 12:36. &amp; 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. &amp; 16:9. Nor do we regard his saying, <hi>that to his observation, there is no mention of the imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ in the Scriptures</hi>: For his observation is small, and of little worth: But were he as much acquanted with the Scriptures, as he is with <hi>Popish</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and <hi>Quakers</hi> vanities, he would be in case to speak otherwayes; However we know, this is <hi>Bellarm:</hi> argument de <hi>Iustif. lib.</hi> 2. c 7.

               <p n="24">24. His <hi>second proposition</hi> followeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 135. which is this. <hi>That by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward birth, or Christ formed within, we are formally justified.</hi> That is, in <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> words. That <hi>Inherent righteousness is the formal cause of our Iustification.</hi> Let us heare, what way our <hi>Quaker</hi> proveth this. He adduceth 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6:11. which is <hi>Bellarm.</hi> 3. Argument. But what saith he of this place? <hi>Iustification here</hi> (saith he) <hi>must be understood of making really just.</hi> And if by <hi>really just</hi> he mean inherently just; as he must, or speak non-sense, I enquire, why so? <hi>Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi> (saith he) <hi>washing and Sanctification must be also understood imputatively.</hi> What necessity is there for this? <hi>for</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the foregoing verses the Apostle was shewing, how no unrighteous person shall inherite the Kingdom of God.</hi> Very

good, what then? <hi>And here he subsumeth, saying such were some of you &amp;c.</hi> And what then? <hi>And because they were now washen and sanctified therefore they were also justified.</hi> Though this may be true, in one sense; to wit, that their sanctification and washing was a proof and evidence, that they were justified, because all justified persons are also sanctified and washen: Yet it is not true in the <hi>Quakers</hi> sense, to wit, that by their Sanctification they were justified; that is, really made inherently just, and thereupon justified: And where findeth he his, <hi>because</hi> and <hi>therefore,</hi> in the text? He proceedeth, <hi>for if this justification were not real.</hi> (And who saith, that it is imaginary; or a fictitious thing? He should have said, if this justification were not a making inherently holy;) <hi>then it might be said, that the Corinthians, not having left their evil courses, but abideing in them, were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified. Ans.</hi> This consequence is false, and hath no appearance of truth in it: we say with him, that there was a real change upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that their faith was not a meer fruitless assent; but this real change was in Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and not in Justification.</p>
               <p n="25">25. He tels us next very gravely, <hi>that he could never read or see, nor with any colour of reason conceive what could evince justification to be here taken imputatively.</hi> And what wonder, seing no man ever spoke of a justification here taken impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively: As if there were two justifications, one real, another imputative; will he name the man that speaketh so. But if his meaning be, that he never read nor saw, nor could conceive, what could evince Justification to be taken here in the orthodox sense: We cannot help it; for when men put out their own eyes, or give up themselves to the Devil, that he may do it, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy? Justification, with we, being alwayes (at least most rarely otherwise) in Scripture taken in a farensical sense: And though it were granted, that here, and some where else, it did import the same, that sanctification doth; yet this man could not hence prove, that the word <hi>Iustification</hi> did never signifie another thing, seing one and the same word may signify various things in Scripture; nor could he hence prove, that this was the proper import of the word, seing the Apostle is not here defineing the nature of Justification, but shewing what a change was made upon them, both a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>relative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26. But, as a learned grammarian, he tels us, that the word <hi>Iustificare</hi> is eith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er derived from the substantive <hi>Iustitia,</hi> or from the adjective <hi>Iustus,</hi> and both these are used to signify truely &amp; really, not suppositively, that vertue of the soul, which is expressed by the word <hi>Iustitia.</hi> Yea the adjective <hi>Iustus</hi> signifieth a man, in whom that vertue is: for not only is it a great impropriety, but a lie, to call a man just, who is suppositivly and not really such. And <hi>Iustisico</hi> formed from <hi>Iustitia</hi> signifieth him, who is made just, seing it is but a composition of the verb <hi>Facio,</hi> and of the adjective <hi>Iustus</hi>; and so <hi>Iustifico,</hi> is <hi>Iustum facio,</hi> I make just, and <hi>Iustificatus</hi> is <hi>justus facius,</hi> made just. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o all which, I <hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) If this man would have given us a seasonable taste of his gammatical pulp, he should have showne us, that the Hebrew and Greek words, which are render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the latine by <hi>Iustifico</hi> and <hi>Iustificatus,</hi> have this import, that he would prove the latine words to have; for whatever he may think with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (who hath helped him here) of the latine vulgar version, as it is called, we do not account
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:66147:167"/>
it authentick. So that though all that he hath said were true, it would prove nothing, but that these latine words were not fit enough to expresse the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew and Greek words by. (2.) But he must know, that use is the master of words, and that they goe not alwayes by the rules of etymology: and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know, that <hi>Iustifico</hi> and <hi>Iustificatus</hi> do usually import a judicial, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridical absolution, by the sentence of a judge, from what was laid to the charge of the impanelled; as they do also signify in our owne language. When do we say, that a man is justified, by infused justice? Or let him tell me, when or in what sentences, we use these words, when we would signifie thereby infusion of righteousness, or making just? Let him consider these passages of Scripture, &amp; see how his sense will agree; <hi>Exod.</hi> 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7 <hi>Deut</hi> 25:1, 2. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15:4. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8:3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not to mention other passages, where justification of a sinner before God is handled, because he may think to affix his vaine glosse unto them; as we have seen in part, and shall see more (3.) How <hi>Iustifico,</hi> I <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify,</hi> can signifie him, who is made just, I would faine know, of what Master he hath learned.</p>
               <p n="27">27. This man will needs be the master of words, and therefore he will have <hi>Iustifico</hi> to be like <hi>sanctifico, honorifico, sacrifico. Ans.</hi> And why not also as <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fico</hi>? Sure, <hi>honorificare</hi> signifieth not to infuse honour, but publickly to declare our respect, for such a person: and he knoweth the common saying, <hi>honor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis est in honorante, quam in honorato.</hi> And Sacrifico signifieth sometimes <hi>I sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and <hi>offer in sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>ask God pardon.</hi> Is that to make holy? But sayes he, <hi>all these are spoken of a subject really endued with that vertue, from which he hath that denomination. No man is said to be sanctified, who is really profane; so nor can any man be said to be Iustified, who is not really just. Ans.</hi> And do we say, that a man is said to be Justified, who is not really just? No. He is really just by Righteousness imputed, and then declared and pronunced just, by Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But he should show, that as to <hi>sanctify,</hi> signifieth sometimes, to infuse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, so to <hi>Iustify</hi> is to infuse righteousness; or that a man can not be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Iustified,</hi> but upon the account of infused and inherent righteousness, as one cannot be denominated <hi>sanctified,</hi> without inherent holiness. But this is too hard for him.</p>
               <p n="28">28. His perversness discovereth it self, in the following words, where play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the forensical use of the word <hi>Iustify,</hi> he sayes, <hi>it is, as when one really guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is freed from the punishment, and so he is Iustified. that is, put in the place of him, who is just</hi>; Insinuating hereby, that in our justification there is nothing but a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from punishment, while as we say, that the cautionary righteousness of the Lord our Surety is imputed to the beleever, and he thereupon Justified. He proceedeth, and telleth us, that <hi>this use,</hi> (to wit forensical) <hi>of the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from this supposition, that none should be liberated but innocents. Ans.</hi> Rather from this supposition, that none ought to be absolved, but either he who is not guilty of what is charged, or hath satisfied the Law and accusation by a Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. What he addeth is nothing to the purpose: <hi>Hence we say,</hi> (saith he) <hi>I shall
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:66147:168"/>
Iustifie this, or that, meaning that such a thing is Iustifiable.</hi> For beleevers are Justifiable, by the imputation of Christ's righteousness. What he citeth out of <hi>Pareus</hi> against <hi>Bellarm de justific.</hi> p. 469. where <hi>Pareus</hi> is shewing how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> at length cometh to his hand, is nothing to the purpose, for when he sayes, we are not formally righteous or so called, by the imputation of Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, his meaning is, that thereby we are not made such, as never sinned; as his following words import: but that the Righteousness of Christ is not so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, as that it becometh the formal objective reason of our Justification, <hi>Pareus</hi> saith not. The matter is cleared thus; though a man, who is <hi>not solven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> can not be made, by his cautioners paying of the debt for him, one that is formally just, and that hath never failed in paying his debt, nor can the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toners payment be so imputed to him, when he is absolved; yet the Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners payment is so imputed to him, as that thereupon he is absolved and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and so declared one that hath payed his debt, by his cautioner; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently free from any execution of the Law against him; &amp; that payment of the cautioner is so imputed to him, as that it becometh the Formal Objective Reason, why he is absolved.</p>

He wonders, that <hi>we should place our hope and confidence, in a matter of such moment, upon a figurative use of a word, and exclude that, or at least not account it necessary, without which we cannot see God. Ans.</hi> We deny, that our use of the word is figurative; and though it were, yet the thing imported thereby, is such a sure ground, that if he misse it, it may cost him his soul. We account not holiness and good works unnecessary; but only exclude them from being any part of the Formal Objective Reason in our Justification. And though he could not but know this; Yet he would maliciously calumniate us. Then he tels us, that the <hi>word is sometimes used in Scripture of them, who arrogat righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to themselves, though it do not belong to them,</hi> citeing <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.7, <hi>Iob</hi> 9:20. &amp; 27:5 <hi>Prov.</hi> 17:15. <hi>Esai.</hi> 5:23. <hi>Luk</hi> 10:29. &amp; 16:15. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11:2, 3, 22. <hi>Ier.</hi> 3:11. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16:5. &amp; 15:2. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though impertinency enough might be observed here, Yet this satisfieth us, that both in some of those places, and others cited by us before, the word is not taken in his sense. I wonder how he can say, that all these places speak of men Justifying the ungodly, when the very first is spoken of God himself: And some of them speak of a not justifying, as <hi>Iob</hi> 9:20. &amp; 27:5. Many of them speak nothing of Justifying at all, as <hi>Esai.</hi> 5:23. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11:2, 3, 22. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16:5. &amp; 15:2. So unhappy is the man in his citations.</p>

And another ignorant cheat he useth, saying, <hi>that the signification, which he putteth on the word, is genuine, and ours but figurative</hi>; Whileas our sense of it is proper, ordinary, &amp; for any thing I know, constant; sure he hath given no one instance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and his is fictitious, forged at <hi>Rome,</hi> confirmed by no appoven author.

But sayes he, <hi>In pauls Epistles to the Romans, Corinth. Galat. and else where, where this doctrine is handled, he saith frequently, that we are not justified by the Law, nor by the Law of Moses; and here the word may be taken in its proper and genuine sense, without any absurdity. Ans.</hi> But what is this proper and genuine sense? Is it that we are made just by infused righteousness? Then this absurdity will follow, that the Apostles meaning is, the Law doth not infuse righteousness; and who dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it did. Is it, that we are declared just, because of Inherent Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Righteousness; then this proper and genuine sense should be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect contradiction to what <hi>Paul</hi> saith: or his meaning must be, when he saith, we are not Justified by the Law, that we are indeed justified by Inherent Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or Conformity to the law.

His citing of some Protestants so saying. I passe, finding no argument alleiged by them, to enforce this acceptation. <hi>Melanthon's</hi> saying <hi>that to be Iustified by faith, doth not only signify to be pronunced just, but to be made just.</hi> May admit of a saife interpretation: for he saith not, to <hi>be made just by inherent righteousness.</hi> And it is certain, that all that are Justified, are first made just, not by inherent righteousness, but by the Imputed righteousness of Christ. What he citeth out of one <hi>Martinus Boraeus,</hi> I cannot examine, having never seen the book, <hi>Bucer's</hi> words cited make nothing for him. <hi>B. Forbes's</hi> words I will not justify, but judge that Cardinal <hi>Contarenus</hi> spoke more ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxly, then he. The Fathers so taking the word sometimes moveth not me, more nor it did <hi>Calvin. Chemnitius</hi> and <hi>Zanchius,</hi> cited by himself. And further, if <hi>to justify</hi> signifie to <hi>make righteous</hi>; to accuse, and to condemne (which are opposite terms) must signifie to make unrighteous, or unjust.</p>
               <p n="33">33. After this §. <hi>Pag.</hi> 140. he bringeth in his conclusion from what he hath said, and it is a bold one. <hi>Having now sufficiently</hi> (saith he) <hi>proved, that by Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, must be understood, to be made really just.</hi> This is concluded, like a <hi>Quaker,</hi> with unparalleled falshood, impudency and boldness. He undertook only to prove, that the word might, without absurdity, be so understood, and how weakly he hath done this, we have seen: But now he wonderfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth a <hi>must be,</hi> from a <hi>may be,</hi> and that too no wayes satisfyingly proved. But I have said already, that the beleever, who is Justified, may be said to be really made just, but not in his sense, nor because, of the import of the word, as he alleigeth; but because the judgment of God is according to truth, and God will not justifie an unjust man. The Justified person therefore is first made just, not by Inherent Holiness and Righteousness, but by the Righteousness of Christ Imputed to him, and Received by faith. What saith he next? <hi>I do confidently affirme from real and sensible experience</hi> (but the delusory sensations, or impressions of an erroneous Spirit, on the mindes of persons, given up to strong delusion, is no demonstration to us of the verity of what they boldly affirme) <hi>that the immediat, next and formal cause, whereby a man is Iustified, in the sight of God, is the revelation of Christ in the soul, who converteth and reneweth the minde; and he, who is the Author of this work, being so formed and revealed, we are truely Iustified and accepted in the sight of God. Ans.</hi> (1.) Who seeth not, that these things, as here expressed, are not such, as can fall under the inward sensations of the soul? Can the soul feel what is the Immediat, Nearest, or Formal Cause, of God's acts? What needs more proof of a desperat delusion? (2.) If the revelation of Jesus Christ be such a cause of Justification, Justification cannot be a making just; for it is not, as he sayes, the revelation that converteth and reneweth, but Christ revealed: and if Christ revealed maketh the change, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ustification doth it not; nor can Justification be a declareing of one righteous because of inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:66147:169"/>
for here the man is Justified, upon the revelation; and yet the man is not renewed, for he is not renewed by the revelation, but by Christ revealed, and the Revelation of Christ, is before this Operation of Christ. (3.) If the man be not justified, till Christ be formed in him, as his last words seem to say, then the revelation of Christ cannot be the Immediat cause of Justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that is before this forming of Christ in the man, for it is before the work of Christ reforming, and renewing the minde. (4.) I see all this Renovation is but upon the minde, and this Formation of Christ is but a Revelation in the minde; But where is the work of grace upon the will? This would say, that the Papists opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is more tolerable then this, for they include graces seated in the will. (5.) Where doth the Scripture speak of Justification after this manner? We are oft said to be justified by faith; but never are we said to be justified by such a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. (6.) Therefore I may as confidently affirme, that this his sensation is but a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delusion of Satan, the grand enemy of the Grace of God, and of the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Yet he goeth about to prove this, and tels us <hi>first,</hi> that this methode of salvation is set down by <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 5:10. for, saith he, <hi>The Apostle doth signify, that reconciliation is made by the death of Christ. Ans.</hi> This is true of that Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, which is actual, and is had by faith in the death of Christ; but not of that Reconciliation, which he imagineth; whereby, to wit, God is prone to Receive and Redeem man. What next? <hi>He affirmeth Iustification, that is, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to be in Christs life. Ans.</hi> And what ground is there for this Interpretation, seing the sense is obvious; to wit, that seing by the propitiatory death of Christ, beleevers, laying hold upon him by faith, are brought into a state of Peace and Reconciliation with God, they need not fear, but they shall be brought thorow all difficulties and steps, to the enjoyment of life eternal, and full salvation, Christ being now alive, to bestow all that he hath purchased? What more? He saith, <hi>That this life of Christ is something inward and spiritual in the heart, whereby he is renewed and brought out of death, where naturally he lay; and raised up, and revived unto God, the same Apostle sheweth Ephes.</hi> 2:5. <hi>Ans.</hi> This is nothing but a palpable perversion of the words of the Apostle: for the <hi>life</hi> can no more be understood here of some inward thing, wrought in man, than Christ's <hi>death</hi> can be so interpreted. And if he had so expounded the words, he had spoke more like himself above; as also more like other <hi>Quakers,</hi> who talk of Christs sufferings and death, &amp;c. as all done within man. (2.) That the Apostle <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2:5. is speaking of beleevers being by grace quickened together with Christ, and risen together with him, &amp;c. is true: But what saith this, for the corrupt glosse of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:10. where the life of Christ is only spoken of; and that as it, by which beleevers may be assured of their salvation? (3.) What is there in all this, for Justification by the Revelation of Christ within, reforming the minde, &amp;c, Hath the man forgote his Conclusion already? Ay but, sayes he, <hi>the Apostle mentioneth a Revelation of this inward life,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:10, 11. <hi>and this inward life is that whereby, he said, we were justified Ans.</hi> The life of Christ is indeed said by <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:10, 11. to be made manifest, in and by its effects supporting &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the persecuted Apostles, through so many miseries and deaths: But who,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:66147:170"/>
except a <hi>Quaker,</hi> could say, that the Apostle sayes, we are justified by this life? And what vestige is there of this, in the Apostles words?</p>
               <p n="35">35. In the <hi>next</hi> place he citeth <hi>Tit.</hi> 3:5. And hence thus argueth, <hi>we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by that, by which we are saved. Ans.</hi> Yes, by the grace of God we are freely justified and saved, and that without works of righteousness, which we have done. <hi>Here the Apostle</hi> (sayes he moreover) <hi>doth manifestly ascribe the immediat cause of Iustification, unto the inward work of regeneration, that is, to Christ revealed in the soul, by which we are formally accepted of God. Ans.</hi> (1.) What immediat cause is this? That a soul must be wrought up to faith in Christ, before it can be justified, we grant; and that this faith must be wrought by the operation of the Spirit, is also true: But that this faith, or any other work of the Spirit in the soul, is the Formal Objective Cause of Justification, the Apostle saith neither here, nor elsewhere. (2.) To say, that we are formally accepted of God, that is, as fully righteous, with a righteousness answering the Law, in all points, and satisfying justice for b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ans.</hi> The Apostle, to the end, that the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who at the instigation of false Teachers, were beginning to have undervalueing thoughts of him, might be convinced, that he was an Apostle of Christ, and so continue in esteeming of him as such, doth here presse them to goe in to their owne hearts, and see, if there were any fruits and effects of Christ's living among them by his Spirit, through his ministrie, that, if not, they might not account themselves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but persons rejected. And what would this say? <hi>It appeareth hence</hi> 2. (sayes he) <hi>that the cause of reprobation, or of non-justification, was the want of the inhabitation of Christ revealed: And, by the rule of contraries, where Christ is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known and revealed, there the persons are approven and justified: And nothing can be more cleare.

It is very true, that by the rule of contraries, where Christ is indeed revealed and working in the soul, that soul is justified; but it is most false, that therefore, Christ revealed in the soul is the Formal Cause, or to speak more properly, the Formal Objective Reason, of Justification; for himself said above, that good works were properly the effects and fruits of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ustification: and yet he knoweth, the fruits and effects may be an evidence of the cause in being. (4.) And so,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:66147:170"/>
there is nothing more plaine and evident, then that this citation is impertinent, and his argueing therefrom a <hi>non sequitur</hi>; and that he is still the old man, a Quaker-disputant.</p>
               <p n="37">37. As a parallel place he citeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 142, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4:19. And saith, <hi>this Christ is the inward hope of glory, Col.</hi> 1:27, 28. <hi>And what is the hope of Glory, must be that, to which we nextly and immediatly lean unto in Iustification. Answ.</hi> And how is this proven? We must beleeve it, because he saith it; and so there is an end. When the Apostle saith <hi>Phil.</hi> 1: <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is—to you an evident toaken of salvation,</hi> he pointed at something, which might be looked upon, as a ground for hope of glory; must we also leane to that in justification? After some lines, wherein, after his usual manner, he must extravage, he saith, <hi>And such as feel Christ, after this manner raised, and reigning in them, have a true ground of hope to beleeve, that they are justified.</hi> Which is very true, because these works of Christ are inseparable fruites and effects of Justification. After some few words againe, to no purpose, he tels us that <hi>Borhaeus &amp; Claudius Albericus Inuncunanus &amp; Essius</hi> (three, whose books I never saw, and whose names I never heard, before I read this <hi>Quakers</hi> book) are for Justification by this Revelation: And he calleth them Protestants: but if so I have read of some Papists more sound, then they are, if their meaning be one and the same with this <hi>Quakers.</hi> And finally he citeth some words of Mr. <hi>Baxters Aphorismes.</hi> But he cannot be ignorant, that Mr <hi>Baxters</hi> notions, in this particular, are little satisfying; beside that Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> himself will have none citeing that book, as expressing his plaine and full meaning. And if he would put the mater to the issue of tryal by humane testimony, we should give him Twenty for one.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Now followeth his <hi>Third</hi> proposition, wherein he asserteth two things, <hi>first.</hi> That good works; seing they naturally proceed from this birth, as heat from the fire, are absolutely necessary unto justification, as <hi>a causa sine qua non,</hi> &amp; <hi>in which we are</hi> justified, and <hi>without which we cannot</hi> be justified. <hi>Secondly, That such good works are pure and perfect.</hi> These he cometh to prove <hi>Pag.</hi> 144. &amp;c. And they would appear to be a contradiction; for seing good works are the fruites of this birth, and by the birth we are justified, good works must follow justification, and so cannot be a cause; no not a <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> for even a <hi>causa sine qua non</hi> must be before the effect. Againe what is that to say, <hi>in which we are justified</hi>? Is the meaning only, that these works are approven of God, &amp; we, upon the account of them, so farr as they are done according to a Gospel rule? What will this say, for justification of State, whereof we are here speaking? <hi>finally,</hi> How can it be said, that without good works we cannot be justified, seing we are justified by the Birth, and the Birth is but the cause of good works; and so it hath been said, that good works are the Effects and Consequences of Justification? This would suspend justification until good works appeared, &amp; so we should be justified by the Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th only Initially, or in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory way, but not fully. And further, in this, he is worse then <hi>Papists,</hi> who will not say, that the good works by which we are justified, are such as

can stand before Gods tribunal, if He follow the strick rigour of Law, and not the Gospels admixture of mercy.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Let us hear his proofs: The <hi>first</hi> is our of <hi>Iames</hi> 2. whence he frameth this Argument. <hi>If no man be justified without faith, and no faith be lively and valide unto justification without works; then works are necessary unto justification: But the former is true, &amp;c. Answ.</hi> (1.) Though it be true, that no man, at least come to yeers of discretion, is justified without faith, as an instrumental cause laying hold on, and applying Christ and his righteousness; yet this faith is not the <hi>Causa formalis objectiva</hi> of justification; and far less can works be a part of this cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, seing they are but fruites and consequences of this faith. (2.) These words, <hi>and no faith is lively and valide unto justification, without works,</hi> may admit of a double sense; either the meaning may be, that no faith is valide unto ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, but that which is true and lively, and apt to produce good works; or that no faith is valide unto justification, but that which is actually produceing good works, and in so far as it is attended with good works. If the <hi>first</hi> be the meaning, then it is apparent, that good works cannot be said to be necessary unto justification, as a cause thereof, for it may be in actual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eing, when they are but <hi>in potentia.</hi> If the <hi>last</hi> be the true sense, this place of <hi>Iames</hi> will not evince it; for <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified before he offered up his Son <hi>Isaac</hi>: And then it would follow, that no man is justified in his sleep, or when he is not actually doing some good work. (3.) Thus we see, and the place of <hi>Iames</hi> is clear for it, that good works are only necessary, in the person justified; and necessary to prove the truth and reality of a justif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing faith, to the man self, and to others: And so notwithstanding hereof that is alwayes true, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness, Iames</hi> 2:23. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15:6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4:3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3:6.</p>

                  </gap> and he thus frameth it, <hi>If these only shall enter into the Kingdom, who do the will of the Father; if these only be called wise builders &amp; blessed, that do the sayings of Christ &amp;c. then good works are necessary to salvation and to justification, The former is true &amp;c. Answ.</hi> Not to quarrel at the Proposition, as containing words in it, which are not in the places cited. We shortly answ. that not one of these places speak of Justification, or mention the necessity of works thereunto: But only of their necessity unto final salvation; which we deny not: And if his Argument hold, no man shall be justified, before he be in heaven: All therefore that can hence be concluded is, that good works are necessary in the person justified, in order to glory; but not that they are necessary unto justification.</p>
               <p n="41">41. These two are all his arguments, and how slender proofs they are of what he undertook to prove, let any judge. He cometh in the next place §. 10. to answere some Objections, The first is taken from <hi>Luk.</hi> 17:10. <hi>When ye have done all that is commanded, say, we are unprofitable servants.</hi> Which is a clear proof, that our works, being but a doing of that, which is commanded, and so a doing of duty; and such as bring no advantage unto God, as a reparation of his Glory, or satisfaction to his justice for the wrongs done; and therefore
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:66147:171"/>
can have no interest in that, which is the <hi>causa formalis objectiva</hi> of our justification; or in that, which we must lean to, as the ground of our justification before God; or in that, upon which we may expect absolution from the sentence of the Law, and freedom from the wrath and curse of God, due for the breach of the Law. What sayes he to this Argument? He grants, <hi>they are not profitable unto God</hi>; but yet he saith, <hi>they are profitable unto us:</hi> he might adde, <hi>and to others too</hi>; and he might say, that they are useful to set forth the Glory of God, and several things more might he say, of this kinde; but all is to no purpose, as to our present question. The second Objection is from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:20, 21, <hi>by the righteousness of the Law shall no flesh be justified &amp;c.</hi> But he might have cited to this end whole Chapters of that Epistle, as also of the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where the Apostle in downe right termes is disputing against the interest of works, in the matter of Justification. But what replyeth he? He saith, <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle excludes the works of the Law, that is, such as are done by mans strength and will, while he studieth conformity unto the outward letter of the Law, which therefore are imperfect: but not the works of the Gospel, done by the Spirit of grace in the heart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inward and Spiritual Law, which are therefore pure and perfect. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> (1.) This explication of Law works and Gospel works, is nakedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to us here, without any proof; and is an arrow out of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> quiver: all works done by mans meer strength and will without the Grace of God, and the help of the Spirit, are no good works at all, because not performed in the right manner, nor flowing from a principle of grace. (2.) That Gospel works, even performed by the Spirit, are not pure and perfect, (as he with <hi>Papists</hi> say) shall be seen in due time. (3.) The Apostle excludeth all such works, which are not that Righteousness of God without the Law, which was witnessed to by the Law and the Prophets: nor the Righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all, them that beleeve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:21, 22: And all such as marre justification freely by grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ <hi>vers.</hi> 24 As also, all such, as darken that declaration of the righteousness of God, who must be just, when he is the justifier of him, which beleeveth in Jesus, whereof mention is made <hi>vers,</hi> 25, 26.

afterward of the necessity of good works, we stand to, in the sense maintained by Our against <hi>Papists,</hi> that is, as antecedent adjuncts, and dispositions unto glory; not as any way meritorious either of Justification, or Salvation: nor do we approve of the <hi>Papists</hi> second Justification by works. He urgeth againe <hi>Tit.</hi> 3:5. And thence speaketh thus, <hi>all grant that such as are saved, are Iustified.</hi> True: what more? <hi>Therefore when he saith he hath saved us he saith also he hath Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us. Ans.</hi> True, yet it will not follow, that all that is antecedent to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is also antecedent to Justification; or that all, that is requisite, in order to final Salvation, is also requisite in order to Justification. The Apostle <hi>vers.</hi> 5. presupposing Justification, is shewing what way the Lord bringeth about their salvation, to wit, <hi>by washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost</hi>; &amp; that he may clear up the first step of the work, he speaks to Justification <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>that being Iustified by his grace</hi> &amp;c. and this grace excludeth all works, for what is of grace, it not of works, otherwise grace is no more grace, and what is of works is not of grace, otherwise works are no more works. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11:6 and to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt <hi>Rom.</hi> 4:4. What he saith afterward <hi>Pag.</hi> 147. of the difference betwixt works done by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons unrenewed, and persons regenerated, is not much to the matter in hand, and tendeth clearly to disparage his own doctrine, concerning the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Salvation of Heathens. And withall I see no ground, to take in these last, into Justification, as he would have us; for then, as no man is say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until all these works be ended; so also shall no man be justified, until he be glorified.</p>
               <p n="42">42. The third Objection is taken from the impurity of our best works: And he answereth with <hi>Bellarmine</hi>; That <hi>works done by the Spirit and grace of God, that is, of persons regenerated, are perfect; Ans.</hi> His meaning must be, that they do agree to the Law, in all points, otherwise a curse attendeth them <hi>Deut.</hi> 27:26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 10.

His saying, that <hi>hereby is not meant these works, that Christ worketh in us; but the works, which we ourselves do, in our owne strength.</hi> Is vaine, for such as are done, in our owne strength, cannot be called Righteousness. But then, sayes he, <hi>it would follow, that all holiness must be cast away, as filthy rags.</hi> So they must be cast away, in the matter of Justification; for we must not found our hope of acceptance with God, and Justification before him, on these: but it will not follow, that they must be laid aside in our practice, and

What is of God should be acknowledged good &amp; acceptable, though the defilements, that adhere to the best of God's works in us here, because of our continueing corruption, and because of the lustings of the flesh in us, should be mourned over, and keep us humble. One thing I would further note here. That if our Gospel-works be such, why are we not Justified because of them, as well, as in them? He further answereth <hi>pag.</hi> 149. §. 12 <hi>That though it were granted, that the best of men are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; Yet God can produce perfect works in them, by his Spirit. Ans.</hi> the qustion is not what God can do; but what he doth. God can make all his perfect; Yet the supposition made, saith he doth not so: He hath thought it fit for his owne glory, so to work in his Saints, as they may have, so long as they are here, a body of death to wrestle with, and occasion to pray dayly, <hi>forgive us our sinnes,</hi> and to run to the fountaine opened to the house of <hi>David,</hi> and to the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for sin and for uncleanness, that they may be washen. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth; <hi>The Spirit of God is not capable of a blot, and therefore all Christ's works, wrought in his children, are pure and perfect. Ans.</hi> The Spirit, it is true, is not capable of pollution; yet his works, as received by us, and as we are the formal actors of them, are obnoxious to pollution. And doth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tell us, that God first beginneth a good work, in us, and afterward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth it. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1:6.? How can then, all the works of Christ in us be perfect? And if it were so, his children here should be as holy, as they will be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for what is higher than perfection? Thus we see, this man, will outstripe <hi>Bellarm.</hi> who confessed, that our actual righteousness was imperfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the admixtion of venial faults, and stood in need of dayly remission: And will run the length of bold <hi>Vasques,</hi> who thinketh, that such have no need of remission. <hi>in</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Disp.</hi> 204. c. 2. &amp; 3. He further argueth. <hi>It would then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the miracles and works of the Apostles themselves, as the conversion of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, gathering of Churches, writting of Scripture, and giving of themselves to the death for Christ, were defiled with sin. Ans.</hi> we must distinguish betwixt these works, which were extraordinary (I meane, as to the manner of their performance) and so peculiar to such extraordinary persons; in which they were not, in a manner, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal actors, but passive organs; such as working of miracles, and writting of Scripture: in these the Apostles moved, as they were immediatly Acted, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired, and Led of the Spirit; so that these were not properly their formal acts. And these, which are of a more ordinary nature, &amp; wherein they were more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal actors; through the assistance of the Spirit, whether in works, belonging to their office, as preaching, and gathering of Churches, or in works of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, as giving themselvs to the death, and the like. As to the <hi>first sort,</hi> we may grant that they were undefiled, as being pure acts of the Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Apostles were but organs, used by the Spirit, as he saw meet. But as to others, I see no absurdity to say, that they needed to use that petition, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give

               <p n="43">43. Thereafter he giveth unto works <hi>an instrumental part in Iustification,</hi> which is true of faith laying hold on the righteousness of Christ, the only Objective Formal cause of Justification; but cannot agree to works. But he citeth some Protestants, assenting to this, as <hi>Polanus Symphon.</hi> c. 27. whose words, if understood of after pardon, that is, of sinnes committed after Justification, as they may, containe nothing but truth; and that truth, which we question not, acknowledging, that even iustified persons before remission of after sins, must repent, confesse, and mourne for their sinnes, and act faith on Christ. <hi>Zanchius,</hi> in the words he citeth, is expresly speaking of salvation, not of Justification: and to this end, he might cite all the Protestants, that I know of. <hi>Amesius</hi> is speaking of the same. As for <hi>Mr Baxter,</hi> I have told already, that his notions about Justification, are not acceptable to all. As for what he addeth about the word <hi>merite,</hi> I shall not contend, only I would say, that seing it sounds so ill, because of the common and known abuse thereof by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> the less we use it the better, seing <hi>Verba valent usu.</hi>

               <p n="44">44. Nor shall I say much against his conclusion of this mater; Only while he tels us, that <hi>such may confidently appear before God, who, sensible of their owne unworthiness, and of the unprofitableness of all their works, and endeavours, &amp;c. did apply themselves unto the light within, and suffered that grace to work in them, and thereby are renewed, quickened and have Christ risen in them, and working in them to will &amp; to do, having thus put on Christ, and being clothed with him, and made partakers of his righteousness</hi>: When, I say, he speaketh thus, he but cheateth his Reader, giving him faire words, and no more: for, as we have formerly seen, in the examination of his Principles. This light, is but a <hi>Pelagian</hi> Grace, if not worse, common to all men, <hi>Scythian</hi> and <hi>Barbarian.</hi> And by vertue of this light, without the least help of the grace of God, (for of grace assisting, far lesse regenerating such as are in nature, and so beginning every good work, there is not, in his writings, the least mention) if the man will but yeeld, (and of power and full ability to do this, he maketh no question) he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth regenerated, begotten of God, partaker of the divine nature, and what not?

               <p n="1">1. WE heard, toward the end of the preceeding Chapter, how he pleaded for the Perfection of the Saints, and of the work of grace in them. Here in his S. <hi>Thesis,</hi> and its explication, he giveth us his minde more fully. In his <hi>Thesis</hi> he saith, <hi>That this holy and immaculate birth, when it is fully produced in any, the body of sin and death is crucified and tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But yet this perfection admitteth of an increase; and there remaineth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, in some respect, a possibility of sinning, if the minde doth not diligently and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly attend unto God.</hi> And so high and confident is he, in this mater, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the answere given to the 149. Question, in our Larger Cathechisme, Impious, and spoken against the power of divine grace; because it is there said, <hi>No man is able, either of himself (Iam.</hi> 3:2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15:5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:3.) <hi>or by any grace received in this life, perfectly to keep the commandements of God Eccles.</hi> 7:20. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1:8, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7:18:19.) <hi>but doth dayly break them in thought (Gen.</hi> 6:5 <hi>&amp;</hi> 8:11.) <hi>word and deed (Rom.</hi> 3:9. to 21. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3:3, to 13.)

owne words and arguments. And though it may be matter of amazement to some, to hear men speak so, who of all others, one would think, have least cause to preach this doctrine, without a publick declaration withal, that they are not the men, who are thus Perfect; and consequently according to their owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are not Christians, upon the account that he shall not ordinarily meet with, in any hereticks writings, so much Ignorance, Boldness, Foolish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, Abusing of Scripture, Untruth, Heresie, Blasphemy, Reproaching, Revileing, Calumnies, Scolding, &amp;c. As is every where to be found in theirs. Yet, when we consider what blasphemous grounds they lay downe, we shall see, that it is a native consequence of their doctrine. For Mr <hi>Hicks</hi> in his 2. <hi>Dialog.</hi> showeth us, that <hi>Edw. Burroughs</hi> calleth <hi>Sanctification, Christ himself</hi>; and hence concludeth, <hi>that to say Sanctification is imperfect, is as much as to say, Christ is imperfect: But Christ is perfect, therefore Sanctification is perfect.</hi> And againe. <hi>The Law in the minde is</hi> the Spirit of God: <hi>To say the Law in the minde is imperfect, is errour in the highest degree, this is an abominable corrupt principle of errour: the new man is perfect Peace, and perfect Sanctification.</hi> And Mr <hi>Clapham</hi> in his book against them <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. affirmeth out of a book called <hi>Saul's errand to Damascus</hi> that <hi>they maintaine themselves to be equal with God;</hi> And that <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> in his book against <hi>Sherlock Pag.</hi> 30. doth alleige that place <hi>Phil.</hi> 2:5, 6. to confirme it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It might also seem strange, to hear men asserting their own Perfection, who pretend so much to spiritual inward experiences, and to so much acquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with their owne hearts; for who, that will not wilfully put out their own eyes, may not see, and be assured of the deceitfulness of their heart above all things, &amp; finde corruption riseing up on all occasions, and setting forward to sin, or hindering from good: But when persons are given up of God to strong delusions, as a punishment of their Pride and Vanity, what high thoughts may they not have of themselvespunc; seing such a doolful state is attended with more pride, puffing them up, and that blinding their eyes, that they cannot see their spots, nor see what the Law of God requireth; and all this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ignorance of God, and of his holy and Spiritual Law and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe? And it may be this man supposeth, with some Papists, that venial faults, as they call them, are not against the Law of God; or that command, which they violat, is not properly a command of the Law.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What the truth is, in this matter, is declared above, out of our <hi>Confession</hi> &amp; <hi>Catechisme</hi>: and the passages of Scripture, which are there cited to confirme the truth, may be there seen and considered: But before I speak any thing more for clearing of the Truth, in this particular, I would have the Reader take notice of one thing: To wit, That it cannot but be a stupenduous and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing thing, and a manifest demonstration of the dreadful power of delusion, when the Lord giveth up any unto that Spirit, to hear men, who pretend to Reason, and to Religion, and have not yet openly renunced all Faith of a God, and all natural and humane Reason, talke at this rate, upon such grounds; and assert, with such boldness and confidence, a Perfection of Degrees, or a possibility of not sinning, attaineable, upon the principles and grounds, which they lay downe: what these are, we have, on several occasions, hinted,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:66147:174"/>
&amp; now shall do it yet once more: The first rise and beginning of all their Religion and Perfection, is a Light within every man, which serveth both for an Internal light, &amp; for an Objective Light; so that it is, in their account, both Grace &amp; the Bible, &amp; serveth instead of both: To this they give big names, &amp; no less name give they to it, then <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>the seed of Christ,</hi> and they call it <hi>saving,</hi> yea and <hi>sufficient to salvation</hi>; hence is it, that they alwayes presse people, to look and hearken to the Light within, as if they needed no other Teacher, nor Bible; This is the theam and subject of their preaching. Now this Light, that is within every man, can be no saife, saving nor sufficient light, it hath no affin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity with the grace of Illumination, being nothing but that natural Light of a Natural Conscience, which is truely natural, being planted in man, in his very creation, and abideing yet after the fall, in some measure, in all men; and flowing from the principles of nature, giving testimony of and assent to, in a greater or lesser measure, according as it is more or lesse freed from preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, prevailing wickednesses, corrupt education, and the like) maximes or principles of moral duties, according to the Law of nature. What natural Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude or rather how great an Ineptitude is and must be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this natural light, now through the fall so much weakened, to understand and discover the saving truthes of the Gospel, which are not written in the book of nature, but are a mystery revealed by degrees, according to the good pleasure of God, who may not see? Especially considering, how since the fall, the minde and all the powers of the soul, and whole man, are stated enemies to God and his grace, and will not submit to, nor beleeve, his very Revelations, so often inculcated; nor indeed can they understand them, or submit unto them, until the mighty power of God be exerted, in working a change, in minde, will and affections: And yet, though these things be certain, attested both by the Word and by Experience, in all ages; behold, this generation of <hi>Quakers</hi> will cry up this Light as saving, and sufficient, though it never came from the grace of God, in a Mediator, nor was never promised in the Covenant of grace; but is, as the soile it groweth in, Flesh, Blindness, Enmity to God, Natural and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, savouring nothing but the things of the Flesh and of Nature. This is the <hi>first</hi> ground stone of their building. The <hi>next</hi> is this, When the motions dictats and workings of this Light are yeelded unto, then doth that same Light become a new birth, Christ formed within, and what not? And thus the man, is a Regenerated man, a New creature, Partaker of the divine nature, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Sanctified and Justified, Effectually called, Adopted, and what not? Though not one ray of divine Illumination hath shined into his soul, nor one act of grace hath reatched either his Intellect; Will or Affections, to cause this change: Nay, though he hath had no touch of assistance from the Spirit of God, to draw or move him hereunto: Nay more, though he hath never heard, whether there was a Christ and a Spirit, or not; and whether there was a Covenant of Grace, or not; or what are the termes thereof; and thus the man is borne againe, not of watter, not of the word, nor yet of the Spirit; but of this Light, and of his owne will; that is, of the Will of the Flesh, of the Will of Man, and not of God. Upon these two pillars, do they raise

So the word is used 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2:5. <hi>But who so keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,</hi> that is, in him is the love of God truely, and really, and not feigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by mere profession. See <hi>Beza</hi> on the place: As also 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4:12. where
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66147:175"/>
the word hath the same import: And the ground is clear, because, obedience to God's command must flow from love, and love to God and our neighbours, is the summe of all the commands: Hence love is the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13:10. So <hi>Iames</hi> 3:2. the same is a <hi>perfect man,</hi> who showeth, by bridling his tongue, that he offends not in word, that he is a real Christian: For the Apostle is here, in the first <hi>verse,</hi> meaning men, like our <hi>Quakers,</hi> of a supercilious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, masterly, quarreling with, and superciliously inveighing against all, though it be a certain truth that we offend all in many things: And therefore he saith to such, that if they would shew themselves good and excellent Christians, who are so ready, to be masters in their reprehensions of others, they would first bridle their owne tongues. I wish <hi>Quakers</hi> would learne this. See <hi>Calv.</hi> on the place. (3.) They may be called Perfect, in regard of the Uprightness, Sincerity, Honesty, godly Simplicity, and Singleness, that is in their way: thus the word frequently signifieth, as we saw above, and is rendered b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence oft, <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>upright,</hi> are joined together as <hi>Iob</hi> 1:1, 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2:2. (4) They may be and are called Perfect, in regaird of Perfection of Parts, as being compleet, and wanting nothing of the integral parts of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; thus a childe may be called a perfect man, as having all the Essential and Integral parts of a man, though but in their infant and tender grouth. The saints are thus perfect, as having the Spirit, and thereby the seeds and beginnings of all grace. In regeneration, the whole man is changed; so that he is new borne, a new creature, sanctified wholly, in Minde, Heart, Spirit, Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Conscience, Memory and Body, though but in a small degree and measure. See 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5:23. (5.)

(6.) In that their good works have all the Essential Parts requisite, as proceeding from a right principle, done for a right end, &amp;c. though not in the degree called for by the Law. (7.) They may be called Perfect, in regard, that the state, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they are, is a state, that certainly tendeth to perfection; they are advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, and shall certainly reach that top of perfection in end, which they look for, and strive to attaine, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4:13. <hi>Phil,</hi> 3:15. For as the several lusts of the body of death are more &amp; more weakened and mortified dayly; so they are more and more quickened and strengthened in all saving graces, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6:6, 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5:14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:13. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3:16, 17, 18, 19.

They may be called Perfect Comparatively, in respect of others, who are yet lying in nature: And they may be so called, in comparison of what sometimes they were themselves, while Blinde, Ignorant, Dead and Lifeless, lying in the state of nature, which is indeed a fearful state of imperfection, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and woe. (9.) So in respect of young believers, weak in knowledge, and babes in Christ, Others, who are further avanced, may be, and are called
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:66147:176"/>
Perfect, as having attained an higher degree, and measure of grouth in grace. Thus <hi>Beza</hi> thinketh the word is taken, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3:15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2:6. And it is clearly so taken, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14:20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5:14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4:13. where each hath his owne sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to the measure of the gift of Christ, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12:3, 6. and its meaning and import we may see, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:1. where such an one is only called <hi>spiritual,</hi> &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13:11. where such is called a <hi>man.</hi> (10.) Why may they not also be called perfect, in regard of Justification; seing the Righteousness wherewith they are cloathed, &amp; which is imputed unto them; upon the account of which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And (4.) So this maketh these petitions in the Lords prayer useless, <hi>forgive us our sins, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</hi> (5.) This saith that either beleevers are fully freed from an indwelling body of death; contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 7:11, 17, 18, 23, 24. or that the motions of this body of death are not sin, or sinful; contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 7:5, 7, 8, 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5: <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1: <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15.

The <hi>first</hi> is this, <hi>we place not</hi> (saith he) <hi>this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi> (to wit of not sinning) <hi>in mans owne will and capacity, as he is a son of Adam, or as in a natural state, &amp; Ans.</hi> But what if his Perfectionist be never translated out of the state of nature? And sure, according to his doctrine, we cannot see, how such can be said to be translated from darkness to light: For the Scripture tels us, that that cannot be, without the infusion of new habites, and faith in Jesus Christ; and also that this cannot be without the powerful operation of God's Spirit, on Minde, Will and Affections, discovering to them their Sin and Misery, and the Necessity of Christ, and Christ's Fulness, Sutableness, and Readiness to help; As also Perswading, Bowing, Inclineing, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineing the Will unto an Acceptance of and Closeing with Christ, for union and communion: And therefore if such be capable of this Perfection, who are strangers to this work, it riseth only from the Will of corrupt man, &amp; is founded on meer Nature. But what sayes he <hi>next</hi>? We ascribe <hi>it wholly unto man,</hi> (sayes he) <hi>as he is renewed by Christ, whom he knoweth to be reigning in him, and leading by his Spirit, and revealing within the Law of the Spirit of life, whereby power is obtained to be rid of sin. Ans.</hi> (1.) But we have not yet heard, that Renovation and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by Christ explained to us, according to the Gospel; but rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> as was manifested several times above. (2) What is ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly unto man, even as renewed, is not ascribed immediatly to God, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:66147:177"/>
to his grace. (3.) If it be ascribed to man as renewed, it must be ascribed to all renewed persons; and so is not a privilege of some, but is common to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; and consequently none are beleevers, but such as are thus perfect: and so, no man that sinneth, or yeeldeth to temptations, is a regenerat man; and therefore <hi>David</hi> was not regenerated, when he fell with <hi>Bathsheba</hi>; Nor any man, that yeeldeth but to a sinful thought, or word. What shall then be said of <hi>Quakers,</hi> whose books are so full of Railings, Lies, Slanders, Errours and Blasphemies, beside their other practices? (4.) It is not true, that every renewed person knoweth alwayes, that Christ is reigning in him, and ruling him by his Spirit, &amp;c. (5,) Though power be had from Christ, living and reigning in the soul, whereby sin is resisted, and striven against; Yet not in such a measure and degree, as the sou shall be fully freed from its lustings and oppositions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5:17.</p>
               <p n="9">9. What is his <hi>third</hi> Position? <hi>By this perfection</hi> (saith he) <hi>we understand not that, which cannot receive dayly increase; neither that, which is as just and perfect as God is; but a proportionable perfection, answering the measure of every one, whereby they are keeped from sinning and strengthened for fulfilling the Law. Answ.</hi> (1,) If he understand not such an absolute perfection, he contradicteth other <hi>Quakers,</hi> as we heard above. (2.) Howbeit every renewed man hath not the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable perfection, or perfection of degrees; yet every one hath that measure of degrees, that maketh him love God, with all his Heart, Minde, Soul, and Strength, and fulfil the whole Law, and do no sin, in Thought, Word, or Deed, in this <hi>Quakers</hi> judgment; and this belongeth even to Babes in Christ; as an Infant hath all the proportioned members of a man: and then it is clear, that no regenerated person can sin; and no man that sinneth, is regenerate. And so freedom from sin must be essential, or <hi>proprium quarto modo,</hi> unto the Regenerate. Give us an instance, in all the Scriptures, of such a Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate person? (3.) The <hi>Arminians</hi> speak of a perfection consistent with some small sinnes; but this <hi>Quaker</hi> excepteth not the least sin. The <hi>Arminians</hi> also speak of a perfection, that admitteth degrees <hi>Apol. Fol.</hi> 128. b.</p>
               <p n="10">10. What is his <hi>fourth</hi> Position? <hi>Albeit</hi> (saith he) <hi>some may attaine unto this freedome from sin, and all should endeavour after it; yet he who once getteth it may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward loss it, through the temptations of Satan, unless he diligently attend to the Light within. Answ.</hi> (1.) These some, who may attaine to this, and should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after it, are not among the renewed ones; for they all have it already: As we heard. (2.) If he afterward come to loss it, he loseth also his state of Regeneration; for to sin, were it but in a wrong thought, or in coming short in the least measure of the right manner of doing a duty, is inconsistent with regeneration, say our <hi>Quaker</hi>; and yet he saith within a line or two, that every sin doth not destroy a spiritual condition. These things cannot hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; a person, wanting a leg, or an arme, cannot be called a perfect man, as to his integral parts; gold having drosse admixed, cannot be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pure.</p>
               <p n="11">11. His <hi>last</hi> Position is, <hi>That he will not affirme that such a state is not attaineable here, in which, to do righteousness becometh natural unto the regenerat soul, that in the stability of that state they cannot sin. Answ.</hi> This is an higher degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:66147:177"/>
than what he mentioned before, for the former was such a state, in which one was able not to sin, though he might also sin, <hi>possit non peccare, Item &amp; possit</hi>? But this is such, in which he cannot sin, <hi>peccare non possit.</hi> And as to this, <hi>he ingenuously confesseth, he himself hath not yet attained it,</hi> in which his modesty and ingenuity is commendable. But <hi>he dar not deny, but there may be such a state, seing it seemeth to be expresly affirmed by the Apostle</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:9. <hi>Answ.</hi> But if he so interpret the words of the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> as importing this highest degree of perfection, he must also grant, that this highest perfection is not only attainable in this life; but that it is common to all renewed persons; for <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh this as a truth of all, that are borne of God, and of all that have this seed in them; and this is true of all that are truely Regenerated; all such are borne of God, and Gods seed is in them.

                  <hi>grace</hi> was but a cheat, for <hi>Pelagius</hi> put another meaning on it, than they did: and they maintained, that no saint did ever attaine to that measure of grace, as to live without sin; for that should take away the necessity of Christs death: and say, that Salvation might be by the Law; and further to say so, were to make themselves equal to Christ.</p>

That man, in this life, can acquire such a degree of perfection, that he shall become wholly impeccable; and cannot advance further in grace. 2. That a man attaining to this degree of perfection, needeth no more to fast and pray; because then Sensuality is so perfectly subject to the Spirit, and to Reason, that he may let his body do what he will. 3. That such, as have attained to this degree of Perfection, are no more obnoxious to mans Law; for where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 4. That man may be as happy, in this life, as in heaven. 6. That it is the part of an imperfect man, to exercise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in acts of vertue.

And if we were sober, we might here mark wonderful wisdome, and see a piece of the manifold wisdome of God. But when we be come distracted, (as doubtless we are, when we will be wise above what is written) no wonder we become blinde, and speak as fools: as this man doth here, and in the following words, which I shall not so much as honour with a transcribing.</p>
               <p n="20">20. He sayes, <hi>our doctrine is repugnant to the justice of God, requireing them to abstaine from all sin, and not enabling them hereunto; and requireing more then he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ability to do. Ans.</hi> (1.) The man runneth so hard, that he runneth himself
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:66147:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blinde: Seeth he not, that if this argument prove any thing, it will prove that all the wicked world are perfect, for God requireth of them obedience to his Law: and it may be a question, if hence it may not likewise be proven, that the damned, and the Devils, are all perfect, and without sin; seing it may be a doubt, if they be loosed from the Law of their Creation. But (2.) Though it were granted they had power, I mean moral power, for no other can be here understood, yet this will not prove their perfection, or freedom from sin: many may have power, and yet not use it: <hi>Adam</hi> had power to resist Satans suggestion, yet did it not. His perfect ones may grow slack in their watch, and so sin, though he will grant they have power to do otherwise.

Either God gave commandements that were possible, or that were impossible: if possible, it is in our power to do them, if we will; if impossible, we are not guilty, if we do them not, seing we cannot. And thus, whether the Lords command be possible, or Impossible, man may be without sin, if he will</hi>: Our <hi>Quaker</hi> is yet worse; for the <hi>Pelagian</hi> would hence prove but a possibility of Perfection; but he will hence evince the real being of Perfection, and that common to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.

                  </gap>) God made man upright, and able to fulfil all his Law; and when he hath dilapidated his stock of strength, must God be unjust, if he require due debt? Or doth mans inability dissolve his obligation? Seing God is pleased of his grace, to help his owne to performance of duty in part, upon a new score, let them mourne for shortcomings, and flee to the bloud of Christ, conforme to the Gospel, that there they may get extracts of pardon; and be thankful, that the Lord hath so secured the matter, that they shall never come into condemnation.</p>
               <p n="21">21. As to the saints he reasoneth further thus; <hi>Their imperfection is either from themselves, or from God: If from themselves, then it is because they use not the power they have for that effect, and if they have a power, it is not impossible; if from God, as not giving them that measure of grace, whereby they may be enabled to do all his will, then He should be unrighteous. Ans.</hi> Thus reasoned the <hi>Pelagian Caelestius</hi> of old, and <hi>Crellius</hi> the <hi>Socinian</hi> of late. See <hi>Hoornb. ubisupra. Pag.</hi> 103. And we say. (1.) This will at most conclude only for a possibility of Perfection, or immunity from sin: and so will not serve his point. (2.) If he mean a culpable cause, I say, it is from themselves, and that not because they have any moral power now, for keeping the whole Law perfectly, (though I grant withall, that they have more, than they make good use of) but because that power, which was once given, was sinfully cast away. (3.) It is false, that God should be unrighteous, if he gave not that measure of grace, whereby they should become perfect. <hi>Nay,</hi> sayes he, <hi>God shall be more unjust than are the vilest of men, who will not give to their children asking bread a stone, nor a serpent to them, when asking for fish. Ans.</hi> The Lord rebuke this blasphemous tongue! what ground is there for this? <hi>They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,</hi> sayes he, <hi>that they must ask of God deliverance from sin.</hi> Very true: <hi>And yet such a thing is never to be expected.</hi> The Lord forbid. We expect and hope for growing deliverance, and final and full deliverance in end, when the saints shall say and sing, <hi>O grave where is thy victory, and O death where is thy sting</hi>? And
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:66147:181"/>
they shall <hi>come unto</hi> the upper <hi>mount Zion, the city of the living God,—&amp; to the Spirits of just men made perfect</hi>; &amp; when all teares shall be wiped away from off their faces. But it seemeth our <hi>Quakers</hi> expect all their heaven here. Where is now the stones that God giveth instead of bread, &amp; the serpents he giveth instead of fish? His following calumnious insinuation hath been spoken to already elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="22">22. His <hi>third argument</hi> followeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 156. §. 5. He sayes, <hi>our opinion is injurious to Christ, and his sacrifice: Christ was manifested chiefly for this end, to take away sin, and gather a people to himself, zealous of good works Tit.</hi> 2:14. <hi>and to bring in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting righteousness, that is, Evangelical perfection Answ</hi> So hote is this man in his pursuite, that to reach us, he careth not though he pierce his owne bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; for by this one argument, he destroyeth all that he said of <hi>Vniversal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi>; as we cleared above <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII. But as to us, it reacheth us not; for we grant, that Christ came to take away sin, both as to <hi>guilt,</hi> and this he did by the sacrifice of himself; and as to the <hi>staine</hi> and being of it, and this he doth by his Spirit, piece and piece, till in end he give full victory; and so he hath a people redeemed from the guilt and power of iniquity, though not fully from its presence and stirrings; and a people zealous of good works, which is not inconsistent with the stirrings of a crucified body of death. That that <hi>everlasting righteounsess</hi> mentioned by <hi>Daniel Chap.</hi> 9. is to be understood of <hi>Evangelical</hi> perfection, is said, but not proved. <hi>Againe,</hi> he sayes, <hi>It is said</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:5, 8. <hi>that the Son of God appeared for this end, to take away our sinnes, and to destroy the works of the devil. Answ.</hi> True; and so he hath done, by taking away the guilt, and by destroying daily the works of the devil in his people, mortifying lust and corruption, and carrying on the work of grace, till at length it be perfected. <hi>Ay but,</hi> he sayes, <hi>it is added,</hi> he that is borne of God doth not commit sin, <hi>that is, doth not break the Law, in thought, word or deed Answ.</hi> What that is, <hi>to commit sin,</hi> we shewed above; and also that by this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage thus interpreted, he shall prove, what is against himself; to wit, that that highest degree of Perfection, which whosoever hath attained, cannot sin any more, is not peculiar to some, but common to all, that are borne of God. <hi>Is not Christ sent</hi> (saith he further) <hi>to turne a people from sin unto righteousness, and from the Kingdom of Satan, unto the Kingdom of his dear Son? Answ.</hi> Yes. <hi>Are not these thus converted, his servants, children, brethren, friends? Ans.</hi> They are. <hi>Are they not as he in the world, holy, pure, and immaculate. Answ.</hi> The text saith not this, Read againe 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4:27, <hi>Doth not Christ watch over them, care and pray for them, save them by his Spirit, walking in them and among them?

                  </gap>hence we inferre, that they shall certainly be perfected in end, and shall persevere unto the end; contrare to what he saith, as we shall see in the next <hi>Chap.</hi> But all this will not prove a sinless Perfection common to all the saints. <hi>But will not Christ have them perfect: or is he not able to make them perfect? Ans.</hi> Yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he will do it in his owne time and way. He himself will not deny, but Christ is able to make them all perfect, in the highest degree, so as not to be able to sin any more; yet for all that, he will not say, that it is so. He citeth also <hi>Ephes</hi> 5:25, 26, 27. But nothing to his purpose, for we grant, that the Lord will present his Bride to himself one day, faire and cleane
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:66147:182"/>
without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; and that he is about this work, bringing all his forward unto this state of perfection, washing them, &amp; cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in his blond, and by his Spirit sanctifying them more and more. But saith he, <hi>if they do sin in thought word and deed dayly, there is no difference, betwixt the holy and profane, the cleane and unclean, &amp;c. Answ.</hi> Notwithstanding of this, the difference is great; for what the profane doth is nothing but sin, and in nothing accepted of God, through Christ; and is done with full purpose of heart, without any contrary lusting of the Spirit: all they do, as it floweth from an evil principle; so it is done for an evil end, and in a corrupt sinful manner; and so is wholly defiled. But it is not so with the child of God, He mourneth over and repenteth of his shortcomings, and striveth against sin; The other not: So there are many moe differences, too many here to be insisted upon.</p>
               <p n="23">23. His <hi>fourth Argument Pag.</hi> 157 §. 6. is, <hi>That our doctrine maketh the work of the ministry, preaching, prayers, &amp;c. useless; while as Paul sayes Ephes.</hi> 4:11. <hi>that past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors are given for the perfecting of the Saints, &amp;c. till we all come unto the unity of faith &amp;c. Answ.</hi> (1.) Hence we see the necessity of a standing Ministrie, which yet he and is brethren are against, as we shall heare. (2.) The Ministrie is to bring them on toward perfection; and is for the edifying and building up of the body, and of particular souls, till we all come at length into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. How is it proved, that this ultimat end is attained here? And further, we told above, that there was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection comparative, and in parts, here attainable and attained, according to the measure of grace, &amp; of the gift given to every man <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:11. But not a perfection of degrees, which excludeth all increase and grouth, contrare to 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3:18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3:12:2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1:3. not such a perfection as exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all sin.

                  </gap>l. How doth our doctrine make Prayers useless? <hi>Are not these prayers</hi> (saith he) <hi>useless and without faith, that are made for preservation from sin, if withall they beleeve that God will not give them, what they ask. Answ.</hi> So said <hi>Crellius</hi> the <hi>Socinian.</hi> But the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Perfection seemeth rather to take away all use of such Prayer; for who will pray for that, which they have? (2.) If saints pray for a sinless state here, they pray without warrand. He that taught us to pray, that <hi>we be not led into temptation,</hi> taught us also to pray for <hi>forgiveness of sinnes.</hi> But saith he, <hi>what shall we say of the prayers of the Apostles Col.</hi> 4:12. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3:13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5:22 <hi>&amp;c. Did they pray so without faith. Ans..</hi> This is another of <hi>Crellius</hi> arguments: But we say, The Prayers of the Apostles were not for a sinless state; nor did they beleeve, that the Saints here could be in such a state, as to sinne no more: Nay, while they prayed thus for the saints, they supposed, that the saints had not yet attained to it. <hi>Epaphras</hi> (not the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>) is said <hi>Col.</hi> 4:12. to

                  <hi>labour fervently in prayer, that the Colossians might stand perfect and compleat in all the will of God</hi>; that is, might set the will of God only before them, as their Rule; and hang upon no man, as to their Christian conduct, but walk in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, as becometh Christians, following the rule of Gods Law; and might not be alwayes c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ildren tossed to and fro, with every winde of doctrine, and spoiled through Philosophy and vaine deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ; as there was ground to feare, as we see <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3:12, 13. is clear against this imagined Perfection; for he prayeth, <hi>that God would make them to increase and abound in love,</hi> (so that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re was yet some shortcoming) <hi>to the end he might establish their hearts, unblameable in holiness—at the coming of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> So that he sheweth not, what a measure of love and holiness, they will attaine unto here; but prayeth, that it might alwayes be growing, untill it attaine its full perfection, at the coming of the Lord. The same is clear from 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5:23. Which maketh against this imagined perfection, and speaketh only of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of parts, not of degrees.</p>
               <p n="24">24. In the <hi>fift</hi> place he reasoneth thus <hi>Pag.</hi> 158. §. 7. <hi>Our doctrine is repugnant to common sense and reason.</hi> Why so? <hi>for these two opposite principles in the children of darkness, and in the children of light, are sin and righteousness. And as men are respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively fermented with the one or the other, so are they to be called justified or reprobated; seing he that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just; even they both are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord Prov.</hi> 17:15. <hi>Ans.</hi> This argument would prove as well, that full perfection, which he denieth to be common to all the Regenerat, to be essential to the state of Christianity; and therefore he must answere it, as well as we. But (2.) That there are contrary principles, in the godly, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is true; and it is as true, that there remaineth sin in the godly, which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from a principle of corruption; yet the Godly man is not fermented (to speak in the dialect of the <hi>Quaker,</hi>) or rather (to speak in the dialect of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) is not under the dominion of that principle, nor given up thereunto, as the wicked are. with full will, consent and pleasure, without any reluctancy or lusting of a contrary principle. (3.) It is not saife, to call all not yet justified, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat (4.) The Lord justifieth none, upon the account of their Inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; and indeed this mans opinion, tendeth to a setting up of Justification by the works of the law, or inherent righteousness; for if man can abide in all things, that are written in the Law, he should be free of the curse. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3:10.

account the man is approven of God; but not because he is sinless; for then no man should goe under that denomination.

Let him of now apply his answere to this argument, and see what it will say. Or thus we may frame the Argument: If we finde no instances in Scripture such persons, as were so perfect, as that they did not sin, then to imagine such a perfection is but a groundless fancy &amp; a dream. But the former is true. Or, If we finde sin consisting with a state of Regeneration, than it is false, that all Regenerat persons are in a sinless state. Hereby also is that, which he addeth in the second place, obviated. And further we say, that from these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, we do not prove, that the godly sin, in all they do, because of a body of death, and corruption cleaving to them; other Arguments evince that: But from these instances, we shew, that his sinless state is but a <hi>Quakeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> dream.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In his <hi>ninth thesis,</hi> he layeth down his judgment concerning that question, first brought upon the stage, by the subtile adversary of the grace of God, <hi>Pelagius,</hi> concerning the final Perseverance, or full and final Apostasie of the Saints; and hath since been agitated by <hi>Iesuites, Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi>: and he asserteth two things, <hi>first. They in whom the light, the seed, the gift of God, the inward sufficient grace,</hi> (for it hath many names) <hi>hath wrought something to their purifying, tending forward to a perfecting of them, may goe backward, and depart from

it by disobedience,</hi> That is, in plainer termes (for these men must have liberty to speak in their owne dialect) They who are Regenerated, Purified and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, may Apostatize, and fall from that state of Regeneration and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and in this he taketh part with <hi>Pelagians, Iesuites, Socinians</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians,</hi> against the orthodox. <hi>Next</hi> He asserteth, <hi>That some may attaine in this life, to such a measure of fixedness and stability in the truth, that they cannot fall away from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is observable, that all such, who, in the doctrine of grace, erre from the right pathes of the Lord; and so speak and write of it, as to exalt Man, &amp; Free will, and acknowledge nothing, in the way of grace's working in souls first and last, but what may consist with their project, and resolution of setting the crown upon mans head, as making himself to differ from others; do also, in correspondency with their o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her principles &amp; positions, assert this full &amp; final Apostacy of the Saints: for, as they put it in mans power to accept or reject grace when offered; so they put it in his power to stand in grace, or depart from it, as he pleaseth: that man may be Lord of the whole, and wear all the glory of it. And therefore as they would admit nothing to be said, concerning the Lords working of grace, in the souls of his people, that might in the least seem to encroach upon the <hi>Free Will</hi> of man (though the Gospel doctrine of the grace of God rather advantageth, than disadvantageth, true Free Will) so will they admit nothing to be said, concerning the further progress of the work of this grace, in the soul, to the end, that will not consist with Free Will's absolute Lordshipe. <hi>Smalcius</hi> hath said the matter fully, in few words, <hi>Refut. lib. de Error. nov. Arian.</hi> lib. 1. c. 1. p. 7. <hi>as it is free for all men</hi> (saith he) <hi>to beleeve, who before were infidels, when they have occasion to beleeve; so againe it is free to all men, after they have once beleeved, to fall from faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I cannot in the least wonder, why this man should be for the Apostasie of the Saints, when I consider what his Saints are, and what his Principles, formerly examined, savoure of. Nay, I rather wonder, how it cometh to passe that any of these, he calleth or supposeth to be saints, should ever come to that measure or fixedness of stability, in good, as not to depart therefrom. Only because, in his former <hi>Thesis,</hi> as we heard in the former <hi>Chapter,</hi> he asserted such a perfection attaineable, as might put men out of all hazard or possibility of sinning; he could not but now assert, that such a state and degree of perfection, that took away all possibility of sinning, would also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a possibility of defection; sin being that, which only can make souls stagger, and fall from their stability; and defection being only by sin. All the Grace &amp; Regeneration &amp; Sanctification, which his saints attaine unto, is, as we saw above, the pure and meer result of Natures Light, and of the power of Nature, without the least assistance, as necessary, of the outward sound and knowledge of the very letter of the declaration of God's minde, in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or of the bare report of a crucified Saviour; let be of the effectual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit of grace, renewing the whole man, and working him up to an union and closeing with Christ, conforme to the tenor of the Gospel, that thereby he may come to the actual participation of the great and saving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:66147:187"/>
which Christ hath purchased by his bloud. What can we then judge or say of this state, let us imagine it to be in its perfection, but that it is a pure state of Nature, and as the perfection of this state, formerly mentioned, can be nothing, but corrupt Nature (the constant and irreconcileable enemy of the grace of God, and of the Gospel,) in its strongest fort of opposition, and resistance to the Gospel-grace of God, and in its strongest citadel of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, wherein it is freest from the invasions and attacques of the grace of God: whence experience hath proven it true, that none have been greater enemies to the Gospel-grace of God, and furthest from a yeelding thereunto, than such as have attained unto the highest improvement of nature, as they supposed; and were accounted the wise men of their age; for to such wise men the preaching of the crosse was foolishness. And who seeth not, that even within the Church, such remaine most disobedient to the call of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and unperswadable by all its Reasons, Motives and Allurements, who suppose themselves to have attained to some more then ordinary Improvement of the Light of nature, or correspondence, in their walk, with a Natural Conscience, and Principles of morality; especially if this be seconded, or attended with an outward compliance with the outward ordinances of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they profess; for these, seeking to establish their owne righteousness (which is a piece of the heirshipe of corrupt nature, which all have from <hi>Adam</hi>) cannot, and will not submit themselves unto the righteousness of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 10:4. Wherefore, Perseverance in such a state, can be no advantage, but a manifest fixedness, in the way of death: and nothing can annul a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in this state, and cause a falling therefrom, but the strong hand of the grace of God. And that state of stability, of which he talketh, and from which there is no falling away, can be nothing but the Lords holy and judicial giving up to blindness and unbeleefe, and closeing their eyes, that they should not see, and stoping their eares, that they should not heare, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their hearts, that they should not beleeve, conforme to <hi>Esai</hi> 6:9. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12 <hi>vers.</hi> 40. <hi>Math.</hi> 13: <hi>vers.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8: <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 28: <hi>vers.</hi> 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>Mark.</hi> 4: <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>

What we hold concerning the Church, is distinctly set down in our <hi>Confess. Chap.</hi> 25: Where more of the clear truth may be in a few words seen, than readily will be found in several Treatises, written against <hi>Papists</hi> upon that head: there it is said; <hi>The Catholick or Universal Church, which is Invisible, consists of the whole number of the Elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one under Christ, the head thereof; and is the Spouse, the Body, the fulness of him, that filleth all in all (Ephes.</hi> 1:10, 22, 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5:23, 27, 32. <hi>Col.</hi> 1:18.) <hi>The visible Church, which is also Catholick or Universal, under the Gospel (not confined to one Nation, as before under the Law) consists of all these, throughout the world, that profess the true Religion</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12:12, 13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2:8. <hi>Revel.</hi> 7:9, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15:9, 10, 11, 12.) <hi>together with their children</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7:14. <hi>Act.</hi> 2:39. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16:20, 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11:16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3:15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17:7.) <hi>and is the Kingdom of the Lord Iesus Christ (Mat.</hi> 13:47. <hi>Esai.</hi> 9:7.) <hi>the house and family of God (Ephes</hi> 2:19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.15.) <hi>out of which there is no ordinary possibility of Salvation (Act.</hi> 2:47.) <hi>Unto this

Against which I have nothing to say: only, for clearing the matter, I would adde; That there is a company called out of the world by the grace of God, &amp; power of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to worshipe him in Spirit and in Truth; and this is that company, which is called the <hi>Church invisible,</hi> because their union with their Head, and with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, is by a bond of true and saving Faith, and sincere Love, which are not obvious to the eyes of men. As also there is a greater company of persons, called out of the world, to profess the Name of Jesus, &amp; to worshipe Him outwardly, according to his word, and to owne him for their King, by submitting to his Lawes, Ordinances, &amp; Officers, by an outward profession. And this is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which is called the <hi>visible Church,</hi> because both their exercise, &amp; their bond of union with this King, &amp; with one another, is outward, &amp; obvious to the eye; to wit, an open Profession of the true Religion, &amp; outward submission to &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the ordinances &amp; institutions of Christ: But as to this visible Church, in his following words, he seemeth to take no notice thereof; for he describeth to us the Church Invisible; and then tels us, <hi>that without this Church there is no salvation.</hi> But this is impertinently spoken; for that Church is made up only of the elect; And if we should speak of the Invisible Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:66147:191"/>
that will take in Heathens, Pagans, Turks and Tartars, that never heard, nor never shall hear a word of Jesus Christ; which Church, as he would delineate it to us, hath not the least relation to Christ, as Head and King; nor any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of, or interest in the Institutions of Jesus Christ. And what a Church this shall be let any sober Christian judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But let us heare himself speak: He calleth the <hi>Church a company of such, as God hath called out of this world, that they may walk in his</hi> light <hi>and</hi> Life. One might readily suppose, that this were good: but hear more. <hi>Vnder this notion,</hi> saith he, <hi>of the Church, all these are comprehended, of what Nation, Kinde, Tongue or Family they be, (though far removed from, and strangers to these who profess Christ, and Christianity in words, and enjoy the Scriptures) who obey the divine light and testimony of God within them, so as by it they become sanctified and washen. Ans.</hi> That is, in short, All Heathens and Pagans, who have never heard of Christ or of Christianity, belong to this Church of persons, called out of the world, to walk in God's Light and Life; if they have obeyed the Light of Nature and of a Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, teaching to abstean from grosse sinnes. This is the <hi>Quakers</hi> Church, and the Church of persons effectually called out of the world, which they mean: which is nothing else, but a Church of moralized Pagans, A pagan-Church, without the Knowledge of Christ, Profession of Christ, Faith in Christ, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe of Christ, Acknowledgment of Christ, Union with Christ, without the Gospel of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ.

This is further confirmed by what he addeth. <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>they may be members of this Catholick Church, who are Pagans, Turks and Iewes, and of every seck among Christians, if they be good single hearted men, though they be ignorant and superstitious.</hi> Thus we see the <hi>Quakers</hi> Church is erected according to the Covenant of works, and that now broken, founded upon the Law of Nature, directed by the Light of Nature: and to it belong all civil outwardly moral persons, whatever Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they have, and how superstitious soever they be: Yea though they worshipe stocks and stones, and the Devil; for there is no exception here. <hi>Reader,</hi> what thinkest thou now of this Church, of this Profession, and of this Religion? It is Catholick, I confess, alas too Catholick! Hence we see, how false it is that he saith afterward <hi>Pag.</hi> 174. that <hi>this Church hath sometimes been Invisible,</hi> though he, after the <hi>Quakers</hi> manner, misapply that <hi>Ier.</hi> 3:14. &amp; 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19:18.

                  <hi>Gathered together</hi> (saith he) <hi>by the Spirit of God, and the testimony of some of his Ministers</hi> That is (say I) by the Light and Law of nature, and the testimony of <hi>Quakers,</hi> or such Ministers, as preach nothing of the Gospel,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:66147:192"/>
nothing of Christ, revealed in the Gospel, nothing of the mystery of God &amp; of Christ, therein revealed. What more? <hi>And brought unto,</hi> (saith he) <hi>the faith of true principles, and the doctrine of the Christian faith.</hi> That is, such prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and doctrine of Christian faith, as may be among them, that never heard of Christ, or of Christian Faith; that worshipe the work of mens hands, and possibly the Devil. <hi>Whose hearts</hi> (saith he further) <hi>united by the same love, and their understanding illuminated with the same truth, meet together, to attend upon God, adore him, and unanimously give testimony against errour, though they suffer therefore.</hi> But (1.) Do not their bodies meet together too? (2.) Can that love be true Christian love, which may be among Pagans? (3.) What illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of truth can they have, who never had another teacher, than a Natural Conscience within, or the Law written upon the works of creation and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? (4.) What attendance upon God, or adoration of him, without Christ, known and beleeved in? (5.) What testimony against errour can they give, who never heard of the Gospel, or of Christ? (6.) I know that here he is giving us a description of <hi>Quakers</hi> Conventicles, which really are Synagogues of Satan. He tels us further, <hi>that all the members of those meetings teach and instruct one another.</hi> And so they are all officers, all eyes, &amp;c. and so monsters: No organical Church. Then he closeth with an untruth, saying, that <hi>such were all the primitive Churches, gathered by the Apostles.</hi> While as the Apostolick Churches consisted of persons, who called upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:2. They were Churches in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1:1. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1:1. that is, such as acknowledged and worshiped the true God, and that in Jesus Christ: which neither Pagans, nor Jewes as such did.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Having thus spoken of a catholick &amp; of a particular church, he cometh §. 4; to speak something of the qualifications of the members of both, which I judge superfluous, seing that was sufficiently done already. Yet because his words here are of a finer-like dress, let us heare him. <hi>That one</hi> (sayes he) <hi>may be a member of the catholick church, it is necessary, that there be an inward call of God by his light in the heart, and that the heart be fermented by his nature and Spirit, so as he leave off unrighteousness, and turne to righteousness; and that, as to the inward part of his soul, he be cut off the wild olive of nature and planted in Christ, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his word &amp; inward Spirit. And all this may be in them, that are ignorant of the history of Christ, as was proved in the</hi> 5. <hi>and</hi> 6. <hi>Thesis. Ans.</hi> These are fine words, to deceive the simple; had he not sufficiently explained himself above, in the place by himself cited, and just now also given us a clear view of his Catholick Church, and of its members, we might readily have been deceived: But, according to his owne interpretation of himself, and a narrow inspection of his words here, We finde (1.) That one can be a qualified member of the Church Catholick, who hath never heard of Christ, or of the Covenant of grace in Christ, nor learned any more of Christianity or of the Gospel, then what nature could teach: and how dissonant this is from the whole Gospel; let any, that ever read it, speak. (2.) All this inward call of God is by the light, that is in the heart of every man by nature: is this any thing else, but natures dim light? (3.) All this fermentation (to speak in the <hi>Quakers</hi> dialect) is effectuate by the power
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:66147:192"/>
of this light, and this is it he meaneth by the Spirit, as he hinteth here, and leargly told us before. (4.) All the effect of this work is but an outward turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from unrighteousness, which a natural wretch may do, upon the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a natural conscience: This is nothing of true Sanctification. (5.) It is impossible that all the operation of nature can bring a man off nature, and plant him in Christ. (6.) The Spirit of God worketh in and with the word, and this word is the preaching of the Gospel; and where the Gospel is, there is the history of Christ. So that where there is nothing of the history of Christ, there is not the word of the Kingdom, there is not the special working of the Spirit of Christ, This word therefore, and inward Spirit, whereof he speaketh, is but he word &amp; Spirit of Nature, that is, nature under new names; the Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish-word and Spirit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But what is requisite to a member of a particular christian church? He answereth <hi>Pag.</hi> 175. Beside this inward work <hi>it is necessary</hi> (sayes he) <hi>there be an external profession, and faith in Iesus Christ, and these sacred truthes delivered in the Scriptures, when the inward light, and testimony of the Spirit, shall naturally incline &amp; compel such, as are subject and obedient to it, to give assent and credite to the truthes delivered in the Scripture Ans.</hi> We heard before of a Catholick Church, whereof all the members must needs be saved, and of a Particular Church, much of the same complexion with the Catholick; but now we hear of a new Church, called <hi>a Particular Christian church</hi>; the complexion of which seemeth to differ from the former: But the matter is this; Christianity, with him, is not necessary to sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re may be particular Churches, were there is nothing of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion: Pagans, that are somewhat Moral &amp; Civil, belong to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, &amp; shall be saved; as well as Christians: But because, where the word of the Gospel is come, there must be some respect had to it, &amp; to the word of God; therefore a little more is necessary in this case, though not in it self, to be found in such as live in such places, where the word of God is; for it were a shame to say, that no more were required of a man, borne and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his dayes, where the word of God and the Gospel is, than of a pagan, that never heard of Christ. But now what is required? <hi>An External profession &amp;c.</hi> This is good, &amp; enough to declare, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Churches, are not Christian for they beleeve not the holy truthes set downe in the Scriptures, because they oppose and contradict them; Nor do they beleeve in or make profession of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, revealed in the N. Testament, because they oppose him, and all his Institutions. But how is this faith wrought? is it by the Spirit of God? No: the inward light alone doth it: that is, it is a faith of Christ &amp; of the truth of the Scriptures, that nature can sweetly &amp; naturally incline, yea compel unto. But this can reach no further, than the truths, that corrupt nature can teach; and what affinity these have with the Gospel of the grace of God, let Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans judge: And thus we have run round, and are againe, where we begane.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He inferreth, from what he hath said, That <hi>the inward work of holiness and laying aside of iniquity, is every way necessary, to constitute a member of the Church of Christ.</hi> Yet it is but such a work of holiness, that nature can produce &amp; effectuat.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:66147:193"/>
We acknowledge, true holiness, wrought by the Spirit of God subdueing &amp; overcoming nature, to be necessary in all that are members of the Invisible Church; but not necessary to constitute one a member of the visible Church, general or particular. What more? <hi>That outward profession is necessary, to make one a member of a particular congregated church, though not of the catholick church.</hi> Then the particular Church is not an homogeneal part of the Catholick; but of a different complexion. Then members of the Catholick church, cannot be members of a particular Church, without some more be added. It seemeth then, these particular Churches are Visible Churches, but the Catholick is invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Yet</hi> (saith he) <hi>this external profession is every way necessary, where God giveth opportunity to know it, and the outward testimony is to be beleeved, when and where it is revealed.</hi> Then it is no way necessary otherwise: and so, without any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Revelation, or Acknowledgement or Profession of the Gospel, one may be a member of the Catholick saved Church: are these things consonant to Scripture?</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Next</hi> §. 5. He tels us, that <hi>the devil, working in the mystery of iniquity, taught his followers to say, That none, how holy so ever, was a member of the church of Christ, without an outward profession, and unless he were initiated with some ceremonies.

Himself said, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession was necessary to particular Christian Churches: And are not these, Churches of Christ? (3.) for the external ceremonies, used in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we owne them not; but such as Christ hath instituted in his word, if the Spirit within him, be not contrary to the Spirit speaking in the Scriptures, he also should owne. <hi>And againe</hi> (saith he) <hi>That if one have an outward profession, though inwardly ungodly and irregenerate, he may be a member of the true Church of Christ Ans.</hi> That such an one may be a member of the Church Visible, we owne it, as the truth of God; and, when he shall be pleased to forme a disput upon this head, shall make it good: And, at best, he is but mistaken, when he addeth, <hi>that this is to put light for darkness; as if God did more regard words, than works</hi>; For the Lord calleth for both <hi>Rom</hi> 10:9, 10. He is also mistaken, when he sayes, <hi>that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist did build his structure upon this foundation</hi>; For he applieth all the privileges of the Invisible Church, unto his visible Synagogue of Satan; &amp; distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not betwixt the Visible &amp; the Invisible Church; as neither doth this <hi>Quaker</hi>; &amp; non-churcheth all, who are not of his combination; and how neare this <hi>Quaker</hi> approacheth to him, in this, he can judge, if he will.</p>

What he saith of the reformed churches: though there be too much truth in it, yet it ill becometh him &amp; his party, to upbraid them; seing all their designe, as hath been often observed, is to make them, &amp; us all, mere pagan churches.

               <p n="1">1. OUr <hi>Quaker,</hi> having thus dispatched what he had to say, of the <hi>Church,</hi> cometh to speak to what he had mentioned in his <hi>Thesis,</hi> concerning the <hi>Ministery,</hi> where we finde several things spoken unto, which we shall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine severally. In the beginning of his 10. <hi>Thesis,</hi> he tels us, <hi>That as by this gift, grace and light, all the true knowledge of God, in spiritual things, is received and revealed; so by the same, as it is manifested, and received in the heart, by its power and efficacy, every true Minister of the Gospel is constituted, prepared, and furnished for the work of the ministry: And by this moving, leading and drawing, must he be led &amp; commanded, in his misterial work, as to places where, the persons to which, and times when he is to be imployed.</hi> That which here we are to take notice of, is that which constituteth a Minister; and with this <hi>Quaker,</hi> the only thing that maketh one a Minister, is <hi>Inward Light</hi> (which he calleth also <hi>grace</hi> and a <hi>gift,</hi>) as it is, <hi>received, in its power, in the heart.</hi> This is all his call unto the weighty work of the Ministrie: What this Light, Gift and Grace is, we discovered above sufficiently; and after examination of all that he said of it, found it to be nothing else, but the dim Light and Law of Nature, or the Relicques of that, which once was glorious and illustrious, while <hi>Adam</hi> stood; because nothing else can be supposed now common to all <hi>Adam's</hi> sones, or all that are Rational Creatures, whether borne without, or within the Church, whether Pagans, Barbarians, Cannibals, Shythians, or what you will. And this he makes both the Preacher, or Revealer of Spiritual things, and the Meane by which this Revelation is received; for by it all the true knowledge of God, in Spiritual things, is (saith he) both revealed and received: so that it is Preacher, Bible, and all: and when this Light and its Teachings are received in the soul, then the man is Called Minister; but for what I know not, unless for to teach natural, dead-morality and civility, amongst Pagans, that they might be more civilized; for, sure I am, all this light can never qualifie him to be a Minister of the Gospel, to declare the Mysteries of the Kingdome of God, to Minister the Gospel of God, to be a Minister of Christ, and a Steward of the Mysteries of God, to Prea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

liberty, and be quiet; for when the ground is found nought, the superstructure falleth of its owne accord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Notwithstanding hereof, we shall take notice of what he buildeth upon this sandy foundation; that the opinions of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> concerning the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, may be in some measure detected, and confuted. In his <hi>Apol. P.</hi> 177. § 6. He tels, us that <hi>the errors, which Protestants retaine, concerning Ministers and Pastors, are a chiefe cause of Lamentation.</hi> I shall not deny, but errours, in this matter, are of dangerous consequence, being as sensible, as he is, that a false and corrupt ministry will quickly cause or occasione the corruption of all. He saith, that <hi>all things, concerning this matter, are at present in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: The Ground, the Call, the Qualifications, the Maintainance, and the whole Discipline is,</hi> saith he, <hi>diverse from, and wholly opposite unto the ministrie of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, and do necessarily tend to exclude a Spiritual Ministery, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce and establish a carnal ministrie. Answ.</hi> This is a hard charge, and had need to be well founded; yet it is no new charge: He hath but barrowed this from the <hi>Familists</hi>; from whom he hath many other things. But the calumnies and bitter speaches of <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the like, are not much to be valued, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when, they are directed not against one particular place, where, it may be, much corruption hath creept-in, or is introduced; but against the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie every where, excepting, I suppose, what is among themselvs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselvs only. He mentioneth five heads of corruption here, but in his following disput, we finde but three of the five spoken to: for as to the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>last</hi>; the <hi>Ground</hi> and the <hi>whole Discipline,</hi> he passeth them by, upon what account, I know not; possibly because, he thought the speaking to the rest, was sufficient.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the first place <hi>Pag.</hi> 178. §. 7. He cometh to speak of the <hi>Call of Pastors or Doctors, in the Church of Christ</hi>; and to show, what it is. But before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what he saith, I must take notice of this. That while he speaketh of a Call, &amp; taketh upon him to acquant us with the nature of a true Call to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery; he cannot but in reason suppose these Ten things following: <hi>first,</hi> That there is, and must be a visible Church continued, and keeped up in the world: for the Ministery, of the call whereunto he speaketh, hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted relation unto the Visible Church; it is in the Visible Church that this ministrie is set and placed by God 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:28. It is over it that overseers are set by the Holy Ghost <hi>Act.</hi> 20:28. It is such a Church, that they must feed, by dispensing the Ordinances of God: It is to such a company, that they must act the part of Watchers, Messengers, Ambassadours, Dispensators or Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Co-workers with God, Fathers, Rulers, Overseers, Nurses, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Stars, Angels, Paranymphs or friends of the Bridegroom, Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Pastors, Builders and the like: all their administrations are for such a company; and their work being to Convert Strangers, to Confirme and build up Beleevers, to Instruct the Ignorant, to Strengthen the Weak, to Bring home Wanderers out of the way, &amp;c. As also to Keep up and go before others, in the publick worshipe of God, it is manifest, there cannot be a Called Ministry without a visible Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is and must be a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:66147:194"/>
Ministrie, in the Visible Church: For where there is a Call, and the manner of a Call to the Ministrie spoken of, there a Ministrie is presupposed: a Call to an Office, supposeth the Office, otherwayes the call should be to <hi>a non ens</hi>: And it were ridiculous to debate about a call to an Office, if the Office it self be called in question, or not presupposed by both sides: Take away the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and all debate about the call to that office ceaseth, of will. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this standing Ministry, or Office in the house of God, is necessary, and must not be laid aside, or annulled: for when he maketh so much debate about the Call to this Office, and layeth so much stress upon the right manner of this Call, he cannot but presuppose, that the right call, or right manner of a call here, is of very great advantage; and if this be so, certainely the Office it self cannot but be necessary. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That this standing and continueing Ministry, in the Church, is an Ordinance and Institution of Jesus Christ, and must be owned as such, preserved and keeped pure, as such: For if it were a meer appointment of Man, What necessity were there, that we should make any debate about the manner of a call thereunto? If it were not of Christ, it were no great matter, though it were quite laid aside; and all debate about a call unto it, were utterly needless. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> That None ought to take upon him this Office of being a Pastor or minister in the house of God, without a Lawful Call: For seing it is necessary to know, what is the right manner of a Call to this Office, it is manifest, that there must be a Call unto this Office: and if there must be a Call unto this Office, none can cloath himself with that Office who is not called thereunto; if every one, who pleased, might take on him this office, what necessity were there of a call to it? A call saith that some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar persons, and that in an orderly way, must alone be impowered here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and that every one, who will, may not, at his owne hand, assume this Office. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> That as none way take this Office upon themselves, without a lawful Call thereunto; so none may take upon them the Work, proper to such an Office, but such as are called to the Office: For the call to the Office is only appointed, for this end, to lay a bar in the way of others, from doing; or taking upon them to do, the work belonging to that Office: if any, who pleased, might do the work, to what end should there be a special Office for that work, and a special Lawful call to the Office? <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That neither the Office, nor the Work proper to the Office, is common to all the members of the Church; for if the Work be common to all, of what use can a special Office be for this work? And what necessity were there for a call, authorizing some to the doing of the work of that Office? <hi>Eightly,</hi> That Officers and Church members, as such, are different and to be distinguished; so that all Church members are not Church Officers. This is clear from the preceeding. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> That a Call differeth from Gifts and Qualifications: for a call to an office, if it be right, &amp; such as God will approve, who send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not a message by the hand of a fool, doth presuppose, that the person call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is fitted &amp; qualified; and that this qualification was not a sufficient ground, for him to take upon him the office, or to performe the proper work of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; for if his qualification had sufficiently warranted him for the office, &amp; for
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:66147:195"/>
the work, the call had been useless wholly superfluous; when then our <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> speaketh of a Call, he must mean a proper, real and formal call, not a false, imaginary &amp; supposed one; nay nor yet what may be said to be a virtual call. <hi>Tenthly,</hi> When he speaks thus of a Call to the Office of a Pastor, or Doctor, he must needs suppose, that there are real and sure Rules, Grounds and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of a lawful call, laid down in the word. Whereby a true call may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from a false &amp; supposititious call: &amp; that the solution of this question, what is a right, and what is a wrong call; doth not depend upon our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and phancies, but must be had in the word: And therefore if he would describe or lay forth unto us, what is a right call unto the office of a Pastor, in the Church, he must not think it enough to tell us his dreames, and suppositions, but he must give us grounds from the word, whereupon we must rest. That by the question, which he here moveth, he must presuppose all these Ten parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as unquestionable truths, is from what is said, I judge, most clear: and if so, how he shall, in several of these, agree with other <hi>Quakers,</hi> I leave it with himself to judge: and how, as to some of them at least, he shall agree with himself, in what followeth, we may have occasion to remarke, as we go on.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When he speaketh of a Call to a Ministerial Office, we may observe, that he is very indistinct, &amp; confused, holding himself in the general, that he may the more easily inveigle his Reader, and leave the matter still in the dark. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know, that our Divines make mention of several sorts of calling to the Ministrie, not to mention that, which commonly in our language, goeth for a call, and is performed by the people inviteing, makeing choise of, and submitting to the Ministerie of such or such a person, which is more prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rly called <hi>Election;</hi> and is contradistinct from that, which is called <hi>Ordination</hi>; but to speak to that, which is otherwise called <hi>mission,</hi> or <hi>missio potestativa</hi>; that is, that, which formally impowereth the person called, to performe the Work belonging to that Office, and legally authorizeth him thereunto: for <hi>Paul. Gal.</hi> 1:1. saying of himself, that he <hi>was an Apostle, not of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, nor by man, but by Iesus Christ, &amp; God the Father,</hi> giveth ground to distinguish of calls, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that which is imported by the first expression, <hi>of men,</hi> which is commonly taken for an unlawful call, that is meerly of man, of themselves, or others; such as the false Prophets had of old, and the false Apostles, in the primitive times: to wit. That there is one call <hi>Immediat</hi> by God, and Christ, without the interveening of Man: There is another <hi>Mediat,</hi> which though also of God, yet it is by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of some deed of man &amp; so is said to be <hi>by man.</hi> The first is attributed unto the Apostles and some others; whom Christ immediatly sent forth; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning that call of <hi>Matthias, Act.</hi> 1. which, as to the person, on whom the lot fell, was immediatly from God. The other unto other Church officers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to their office by them, &amp; so forth in succeding generations, according to the way &amp; method set down in the word. The Mediat call is that, which we are now to enquire after, &amp; to look for; seing the Immediat call is ceased with these extraordinary persons, who were called by it, &amp; were with alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with extraordinary gifts; as we see <hi>Mat.</hi> 10:1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:12. or had some
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:66147:195"/>
other extraordinary thing in their mission, which did abundantly evince it to be immediatly divine. We may note further, That there is a Mediat call, which may be called <hi>Singular</hi> &amp; <hi>Rare,</hi> or not very ordinary; as when a Church is in erecting, &amp; not yet constituted, &amp; all things are out of order; so that, through necessity, many, or several things requisite in an orderly call, must be passed by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; dispensed with: And there is a Mediat call, which is <hi>Ordinary,</hi> &amp; is usually to be followed, according to the rules set downe in the word. Againe, it may be noted, that there is an <hi>Outward</hi> call, &amp; an <hi>Inward</hi> call. The <hi>Outward call</hi> or <hi>mission,</hi> is that which is done by men, according to the appointment of Christ after examination &amp; tryal of the person, separating him &amp; setting him apart with solemne prayer &amp; imposition of hands, for the ministrie; &amp; that is a committing of the work unto faithful men; &amp; an appointing of them to the work of the ministrie. The <hi>Inward call</hi> is the Lords signification of his minde &amp; will inwardly to the mans self, of his calling &amp; appointing him to the Ministrie, not only endueing him with gifts &amp; qualifications requisite, but also powerfully &amp; sweetly inclineing his minde, &amp; determining his will, to a willing suscep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Imployment, for holy &amp; pure ends; &amp; by other passages of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, manifestly signifying that to be his minde, that the man shall serve him in the work of the Ministrie. These considerations are considerable in this case, &amp; others might be mentioned; but our <hi>Quaker</hi> loving confusion, walketh in the dark, and tels us not what call he meaneth; Nor whether he meaneth all sorts of calling, or only one kind; and if one, he tels us not, what that one is.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us see, if his answere will help us to understand the question. His answere is this. <hi>He ought to be instructed by the inward power and vertue of the Spirit of God, in his heart.</hi> A suteable answere for such a question; that is, a confused answere to an indistinct question. He should have told us, what is the nature of a Pastors Call; &amp; his answere is concerning a qualification: Afterward he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of qualifications; &amp; how, I pray, shall he difference this from what he handleth there? <hi>Next,</hi> I would enquire concerning the meaning of this answere; whether he thinketh, that all, who are instructed thus, are called to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors; or only, that this is a qualification requisite in Pastors? if the <hi>first</hi> be his meaning, he destroyeth the distinction betwixt Officers and Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; for then all Church-members, must be Officers, seing with him all Church members must be thus qualified. If the <hi>last</hi> be his meaning. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinks he this qualification essential, or not? that is, so necessary, that one that wanteth it, cannot be accounted a Pastor, neither before God, nor before men; neither <hi>in foro poli,</hi> nor <hi>in foro soli</hi>? Againe I would enquire, what he meaneth by this qualification? if we interprete it by his former doctrine, (&amp; why we may not, Yea must not do so, I know not) this will be a good qualification for a Pagan-preacher, but no qualification for a Gospel-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; for it is nothing else, than the power &amp; efficacy of Natures Light &amp; of a Natural Conscience, informing &amp; enlightning concerning duties required by the Law of nature: it hath no affinity with the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the New covenant, bestowed upon the elect and chosen vessels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:66147:196"/>
and principling the beleever to new obedience. Howbeit this might suffice for an answere: Yet I shall say more to clear the matter unto the Reader. I confess holiness is required of Gospel ministers; The Apostle tels us <hi>Tit.</hi> 1:8. that he must be a <hi>lover of good men,</hi> (or of good things, as it is in the margine) <hi>sober, just, holy, temperate</hi>: And he must <hi>be blameless Tit.</hi> 1:7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:2. <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, sober, and of good behaviour ibid</hi>: And therefore all, who are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the examination &amp; tryal of ministers, should be careful in the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after this, as well, as in the tryal of their gifts and other qualifications: and when clear and manifest evidences appear of their hatred of good things, and of the godly, of their insobriety, injustice, unholiness, intemperance, want of vigilancy, and of their evil behaviour, they ought to be laid aside from that holy function, as well as when their want of gifts &amp; of other requisite qualifications clearly appeareth. Yea, if there be not some positive probable evidences of this love, and of seriousness in the maters of God, giving faire &amp; probable ground of concluding them to be faithful men, they ought not to commit the word unto them. See all this fully cleared and confirmed by worthy and learned <hi>Mr Durham,</hi> in his exposition of the <hi>Revelation</hi> Pag. 198. &amp;c. Yet, because grace, &amp; the saving workings of the Spirit, are latent, &amp; hid in the heart, &amp; there is no outward signe &amp; evidence thereof, whereby others can certainly or infallibly discerne and judge of the same, in all; &amp; so hid, that the man, in whom it is, &amp; is more privie to his owne spirit &amp; heart, than others can be, will not alwayes be in case to discerne the same; I dar not say, that the reall being of grace is such a qualification, as that the want thereof shall render the man no minister, and all his performances null, before God, or man; though the person, being a real stranger to grace, can expect no acceptance of God through Jesus Christ, for what he doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ's imploying of <hi>Iudas</hi> in the ministry, will sufficiently verify this, and I need say no more. See <hi>Mr Durham,</hi> in the place cited.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What addeth he? <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>seing true knowledge, in things spiritual, is received by this gift and grace, he that is purified and sanctified by the same, is at length also called by it, and moved to ministrate to others, and is made capable of showing to others, what by real experience he hath himself found,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5:11. <hi>And his words and ministry, proceeding from inward power and vertue, penetrat into the hearts of the hearers, and obtaine their approbation and subjection. Ans.</hi> (1.) This gift and grace, being but natural and Pelagian, as was shown above, can never give true knowledge, in things spiritual, saving and evangelick. (2.) Nor can it ever purifie and sanctifie a man according to the Gospel, whatever it may do, as to outward civility and morality. (3.) Qualifications are no call. (4.) Then, it seemes, there is no Outward call requisite; and so this man joyneth with <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> laying aside all outward call by men, as not necessary, in the Church of God; and saying, that all, who understand the truth of the Gospel, and are able to Instruct others, may and have a right to teach. See <hi>Smalcius Pag.</hi> 379. though <hi>Pag.</hi> 377. he confesseth, that this outward call, is decent and comely in a constitute Church, which this man doth no where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. See also <hi>Apol. Remonstr. Cap.</hi> 21. and <hi>Episcop. disput.</hi> 26. <hi>privat.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:66147:196"/>
Thes.</hi> 4. &amp; 5. (5.) Every motion to tell others what we know in the things of God, is not a call to the Work and Office of the Ministry. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 66:16. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat persons, in their private capacities, may and ought to seek to promove the edification of others, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4:10, 11. (6.) Is this telling of what they have found in their owne experience, the whole work of the Ministrie? Or is this the preaching of the Gospel? The divideing of the word of truth? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2:15. Is this speaking, exhorting and rebuking with all authority, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2:15? Is this be seaching as Ambassadours, in the name of God, and in Christ's stead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5:19, 20? Is this that, which <hi>Paul</hi> layeth upon <hi>Timothie,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4:1, 2. <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead, at his appearing and his Kingdom. Preach the word, be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine</hi>? Or that which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inde 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4:13, 14, 15, 16.—<hi>Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, Neglect not the gift, that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Meditate upon these things, give thy self wholly to them—take heed unto thy self, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: For in doing this, thou shalt both save thy self, and them that hear thee.</hi> But I should have remembered, that these men are against Preaching. (7.) Some may think, that by this <hi>gift and grace,</hi> which he mentioneth, he can mean, at most, nothing, but what the <hi>Papists</hi> call <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> and which is different from <hi>gratia gratum faciens</hi>; but I see no ground, to judge him so orthodox.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He goeth about to prove, that this qualification is absolutely necessary: and his <hi>first</hi> argument is thus. <hi>That which is necessary to make a man Christian, is much more necessary to make one a Minister of Christianity. But this inward call, power &amp; vertue of the Spirit, is necessary to make a man a Christian. Therefore, &amp;c. Ans.</hi> This argument is easily answered by a distinction, thus. That which is necessary to make a man a Real, Upright and Sincere Christian, or true member of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Church, is also necessary to make a man, a sincere and upright Minister before God, and approven of him, in what he doth; but is not simply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary, to make one a Minister, before men, who cannot certainly know this, nor walk by an infallible rule, in judging of this. That which is necessary to make a man a member of the Visible Church, a professing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, that I grant is also necessary to make one a Minister, both before God, and men; for men can judge hereof, and have a certain and fixed rule whereby to judge of this profession, whether it be true or not, though not to judge, whether it be sincere, or not. (2.) That the inward work of the Spirit of grace is necessary to make one a true and gracious Christian, or member of the Invisible Church, is true; but this is not requisite to make one a member of the visible Church: And he would know, that Ministers are set in the visible Church, and are to covert such, as are not yet members of the Invisible Church; and this sheweth the inconsequence of his argument. (3.) The Inward Power and Vertue of the Spirit, which he must meane, can make a no man a Professour, let be a Christian, in truth and reality; for it may be, where there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, or hearing of Christ, of the Gospel, of the Covenant of grace, or of any such thing, even in an Heathen and Pagan, who is yet without, as such are
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:66147:197"/>
called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5:12, 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:7. and is without Christ, being an alien from the Commonwealth of Israel, and a stranger from the Covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2:12.</p>
               <p n="8">8. His <hi>next</hi> argument is this: <hi>All the Ministers of the N. Test. are Ministers of the Spirit, and not of the letter,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:6. <hi>And therefore such must be called by the Spirit, and must know, that he is led and moved by the Spirit, and be sensible of the work of the Spirit, and of his inward vocation. Ans.</hi> (1.) It is most true, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the N. T. are Ministers of the Spirit, opposed to such as cryed up the Law, and preached it as separated from Christ; as the Jewes commonly did, &amp; as our <hi>Quakers,</hi> Pagan-preachers, do, &amp; must do, according to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; for they know no Gospel, but are sworne enemies to it, and plaine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of it, and all the Ordinances thereof; and are worse then the allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal teachers, of whom <hi>Beza</hi> maketh mention, on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:6. (2.) They may be said to be called by the Spirit, who are gifted with the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, fitting for preaching of the Gospel; such as the word of Wisdom, and the word of Knowledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 7, 8, 11. Whereby they are apt to teach, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:2. and fit to take care of the Church, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. And those gifts, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves considered, are different from true and saving grace, and yet come from the Spirit, and are given to profite withall; and so must be laid out to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the way prescribed in the Gospel. (3.) What meaneth he by this, <hi>must be called by the Spirit</hi>? Is this an inward Inspiration, or Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasme, saying to the man, he must goe preach? We reject all such phancies, which he and other phanatick persons dream of, and lean unto; and account them plaine delusions of Satan, which the very doctrine they deliver putteth beyond all question, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24:24. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2:9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13:1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1:8, 9. Let him shew, if he can, any true ground, warranting us to look for such imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat calls? Is there a promise for this? Or a command to expect it? (4.) His last words null his former argument and position; for there he required only that they have the inward working of the Spirit; but here he requireth more; to wit, that they <hi>know that they have it, and are led and moved by the Spirit, and are sensible of his work in them</hi>: Or he must say, that none can have grace, but he must also know and feel that he hath it; And consequently that such as feel not this, to their owne satisfaction, must peremptorily conclude, that they have it not: a dangerous position, and untrue.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A <hi>third</hi> argum. followeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 179. If (saith he) <hi>the testimony of the Spirit be not essential and necessary to a Minister; the Gospel Ministrie should be postponed to the legal; for there the people knew, who were officers; and beside these ordinary, there were extraordinary ones, called by the immediat testimony of the Spirit. But now we are vncertain, and must have Pastors, without all certain assent of Gods will. Ans.</hi> (1.) Then the thing he meaneth by a Call, is a testimony of the Spirit, such as the Prophets of old had; or at least such as may be plaine and notoure, not only to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who have it, but to all; so as they need no more doubt of it, than the Jewes needed to doubt of the Priests and of the Levites, or at least of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Prophets, that God sent among them: And thinks he, that this is had of his Quaker-Teachers, and Pagan-Preachers? No sure, their speach and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:66147:197"/>
their erroneous doctrine publickly declareth, that the testimony, which they have, is the testimony of a lying Spirit, and of a Spirit of delusion, that can easily deceive the possessors. (2.) Thinks he that there is no way now, to know who are the lawfully called Servants of God? He was pleased, while speaking of the Scriptures, to affirme some such thing, that he might thereby implead their Perfection; but we manifested his folly in that attempt, there. See <hi>Chap.</hi> IV, §. 31. (3,) Will he tell us, what that certaine assent of Gods will, or this Testimony of the Spirit is, whereby every one may know, who is truely called of God, who not? Doth the Spirit, when he calleth one to this work, speak to the senses of all beholders; and witness also to them, that such an one is indeed called of the Spirit?

They that enter by the way, which Christ hath appointed, come in by the door, which he hath set open for them, to enter by; and have his warrand and approbation, though they want this, which he pretendeth to.</p>
               <p n="11">11. He tels his Reader §. 8. That against his doctrine we Object the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Church, as sufficient: And upon this his mistake, he runneth out in many words, to no purpose. That Christ sent his Apostles immediatly, is certain and undeniable. That these Apostles ordained other ordinary ministers is unquestionable <hi>Act.</hi> 14:23. That they laid injunctions on these whom they had ordained, to commit the same to faithful men, is clear 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2:2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1:5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:1—15. <hi>and</hi> 5:21, 22.. And the practice of the Church thereafter evinceth, that this course was constantly followed: and though, through corruption, base and unworthy men entered sometimes into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie, yea and though afterward the Ordinance was corrupted through Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, by his manifold additions, and other corrupt appendices; yet the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Christ is not to be rejected, but rather to be purged from these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, annexed without Scripture warrand, that the ordinance may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and preserved in its primitive Integrity. And though, by reason of such corruptions, there was an interruption of the conveyance of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial power, in the order and manner appointed by Christ; yet the Ordinance might be taken up againe, and some usual circumstances, dispensed with, in such a case of necessity, without the least impeachment of the Ordinance it self. We need not then trouble ourselves to enquire after such an uninterrupted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Persons so ordained, one after another; if we finde ministers now setled, according to the Ordinance of Christ, we are to be satisfied. But the thing that troubles him is, that we say, such as are ordained by Pastors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of the word, are Pastors, and to be owned as such: Nor will it satisfie him, that we say, that beside this, such as are called must have an inward call also of God, inclineing them to that work, as we formerly hinted;
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:66147:198"/>
because, as he thinks, there is no enquiry made after this; and yet, if he would look our <hi>directory for</hi> ordination, he might finde as much, as might satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a reasonable man concerning this, which is not obvious to mens tryal and examination, but is hid in the heart. As to what he saith §. 9. and 10. because it concerneth them, who plead for the necessity of an uninterrupted Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which I see no necessity for, I need not trouble my self to Answere; though I see nothing said by him, which is of any force; and elsewhere I have said something to it. See my book against <hi>Velthusius Assert.</hi> 9. towards the end, and I shall recommend to this Man the serious perusal of <hi>Voetii Desperata Causa Papatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. He cometh §. 11. <hi>Pag.</hi> 187. to speak to Others, who lay not so much weight upon this Succession, as conveyed through Papacy; but assert, that in extraordinary cases of necessity, somethings may be done, which ought not to be done, in other ordinary cases, when the Church is setled and rightly constituted, or purged from destroying corruptions. And what sayes he here? Forsooth, to vindicate himself and his fraternity, for taking upon them the Ministrie, at their owne hand, he hath the face to say, that he can accuse us of many errours. And what will his bold saying so do, when we have evinced that <hi>Quakerisme</hi> is but a <hi>Cento,</hi> an Hotch potch of errours; so that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the very Kennel, in which all the filth of other errours and heresies run; &amp; are become one standing puddle of abomination? And as to their being Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, what, I pray, have they to show, but what the false Prophets, and Apostles did pretend unto? He talketh of an Immediat Revelation; but who seeth that, but themselves, who have the false light of an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them? Shall we think, that the Immediat Revelation of the Spirit of God would act men, as they are acted, and prompt them to at rampling, upon all the holy Ordinances of Jesus Christ? The Comforter, whom Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to send, will <hi>guide into all truth Ioh.</hi> 16:13. and not, sure, into all errour, <hi>and will glorify Christ vers.</hi> 14. while as the evil Spirit, in these <hi>Quakers,</hi> cannot do more than he doth, to vilify Christ, and render him most contemptible, in his Person, Offices, Work &amp; Ordinances. He tels us, <hi>that this immediate revelation of the Spirit is as necessary in a Church constituted, as in a Church to be constitute.</hi> But what meaneth he by this Immediat Revelation? Meaneth he nothing else, than what is necessary to all true Christians, and is acknowledged by us, that is, the inward working of the Spirit, sanctifying the soul? No sure, it is plaine Enthusiasme, of which we spoke enough above <hi>Chap.</hi> III. And who saith, or how will he evince it, that our first reformers were called to the work of the ministrie by such an Euthusiastick Call, as were the Prophets of old; or such an immediat outward call, with an audible voice, from Christ, as the Apostles had? I deny, that any such thing is necessary, or to be expected, even in extraordinary cases; seing the Lord can, in a more plaine and obvious manner, give intimations of his will, then by Enthusiasmes or audible voices, such as <hi>Paul</hi> had; which he would not have us now look for, having the Canon of the Scriptures now compleat before us, to regulate us, in all cases Ordinary and Extraordinary, and having the constant significations of God's will in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:66147:198"/>
to help us to understand his minde in particulars, conforme to the general rules, in his word: And by these we may learne, what is to be done, or not done, in this or that case, without Dreames, or Vive Voices from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or Enthusiasmes; which whosoever would expect might fear, that God, because of their tempting of him, might give the great Tempter leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; as experience hath proven.</p>
               <p n="13">13. As to that which some say, That such, as boast of an Immediat Call, should confirme the same by Miracles. He answereth <hi>Pag.</hi> 181. <hi>That as this was Objected by the Papists, unto our first reformers, so their answere may suffice: to wit, That was not necessary for them, seing they preached nothing but the doctrine, that was already confirmed by miracles: And beside, Iohn the Baptist, and some true Prophets did no miracles. Answere,</hi> Though I do not owne the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as it is here simply set downe: Yet take it thus, and it will prove too hote for his fingers. They who have had immediate cals from God, were able to give evidence of the same by miracles, or some other evident testimony of the Spirit, that it was so, which to contradict, or not to receive and beleeve, had been iniquity, and utterly unreasonable. Now what can these <hi>Quakers</hi> shew, to justifie their Immediat Call, to be of God; They alleidge an Immediate Call; but who can see any grounds to beleeve it. Their saying so, is not enough; for false Prophets said it. Their doctrine can not evince it; for if their call be to be judged by their doctrine, I know no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, that ever breathed, that had not better ground, upon this account, to pretend to an Immediat Call; for I defye any man to name me any Seck of hereticks, or erroneous persons, since Christianity was heard of, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained such a bundle of Errours, and Heresies, as these <hi>Quakers</hi> do: to speak nothing of their blasphemous expressions and practices; let any but read the examinations of <hi>Iames Nayler,</hi> and his carriage about <hi>Bristol,</hi> and their dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in their books, and judge. But to wave these, let us consider but this mans doctrine, who seemeth to be one of the most sober, among them all; have we found any thing hithertil, but <hi>Pelagianisme, Secinianisme, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, Enthusiasme, Antiscripturisme</hi>; Yea and <hi>Paganisme,</hi> &amp;c? have we seen any thing, that doth not directly enough tend to overthrow the whole Gospel? And what further we are to hear, a little patience will help us to see. He talks, that <hi>they teach no new doctrine.</hi> But doctrine more diametrically opposite, yea contradictory to the whole Gospel of the grace of God, a man shall finde no where else, in such an heape: So that, albeit they should pretend to Miracles, as they do to Immediat Revelations of the Spirit of God, &amp; should do somethings more then ordinary, like wonders, I should account them but lying wonders; &amp; their coming to be after the working of Satan, according to 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2:3. Yea, though an angel from heaven should come to head them, and preach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which they preach, I should remember that word of <hi>Paul's, Gal.</hi> 1: <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9. And therefore must account these <hi>Quakers</hi> no more Christians; but an Antichristian, &amp; Antievangelick brood of men, acted and led by an evil Spirit, designing the destruction of the Gospel, and the setting up of Paganisme.

Only I would enquire, If, as he saith, no man can know by the Scriptures, that he, in particular, is called to be a Minister, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must recurre to an Inward and Immediat Testimony of the Spirit, he must also say, that no man can know that another is a Minister, but by the Inward and Immediat Testimony of the Spirit; and therefore he cannot be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at us, that we do not beleeve, that he and the rest of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> are sent of God, because we have no Inward and Immediat Testimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, concerning this; and we are confident never shall have from the Spirit of God. And though the Scriptures do not particularly and expresly tell us, that <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> is a false Teacher, and ought to be shuned, as a false Teacher, it saith that, which is enough to us, concerning him, and his complices, when it saith that all that bring another Gospel, are to be accounted accursed; and the whole Scripture, that pointeth forth and declareth the Truth, and condemneth their Errours, as we have seen and shall see, is as good to us, as an Immediat Testimony, saying, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and particularly <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> are deceivers; yea &amp; better, &amp; more sure; for some men can take the dreams of their owne head, &amp; the impressions of Satan upon their phantasie, for immediat testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Spirit of God: but enough of this above <hi>Chap.</hi> III.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But he hath something <hi>Pag.</hi> 190. §. 14. that would seem to answere that question, we just now proposed; for after hee hath againe nakedly told us, that this extraordinary call (for he nameth it so here) is as well necessary, when the Church is setled, as when it is under a general Apostacy; he saith, <hi>that such as are thus called, are made manifest in the mindes of their brethren, and their call is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in them, who by the sensation of that life and virtue, that floweth out by them, are d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as yet there is no Inward Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the Spirit directly saying, that such men are truely called; and without this, in his judgment, they cannot be said to be taught and led of the Spirit, nor can they beleeve without this. (2.) Is this manifestation alwayes at every discourse, or sometimes only? Is it upon all their hearts, or upon some only? It may be, there lyeth an answere, in these words <hi>their brethren</hi>: But the signes of the Apostleshipe of <hi>Paul</hi> were among strangers, whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and brought in to the faith: And if this manifestation be alwayes and upon all present, he layeth down a ground to question Christs Apostleshipe and Call; for his preaching had not alwayes this effect, as is notoure. Nor <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> theirs, among the Jewes, as the book of the <hi>Acts</hi> sheweth, and 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. Nay, let that word be considered 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2:15, 16. <hi>for we are unto God a sweet savour in Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish; to the one the savour of death unto death, and to the other the savour of life unto life</hi>: And that <hi>Esai.</hi> 49:4. <hi>Then said I, I have laboured in vaine, I have spent my strength for nought and in vaine; surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God</hi>: and that <hi>Esai</hi> 53: <hi>Who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed</hi>; &amp; if he think it enough, that this manifestation be made sometimes, upon the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:66147:199"/>
the mindes of some. Alas! Poor man, thinks he that there are none of all the servants of Christ, who dar not be so bold, as he is, to pretend a Divine Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat Call, through an Extraordinary and Immediat Revelation, that can say the same, and that upon a more just account? As for his brethren, they are under the same delusion with their Teachers; and the sensation they have of life and vertue, is but the sensation of the workings of delusion; and no edification, or building up in the holy faith, but in opposition to that faith, which was once delivered to the saints; as is manifest to all that heare them, and read their books; and as this book, which is now under examination, hath made more manifest to me, than all that ever I heard, or read of them before.</p>
               <p n="15">15. He addeth. <hi>This is that, which giveth the true and substantial call and title unto the Minister, whereby he is a real successour of the vertue and power, that was in the Apostles. Ans.</hi> (1.) Then the extraordinary call was no true and substantial call or title. Then <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> who was sent to a rebellious house, that would not heare, had no true and substantial call; nor <hi>Moses,</hi> when he was sent unto <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> (2.) They, who are a savour of death unto death to some, may yet for all that, be successours to the Apostles. (3.) But I see, what this man would be at: The <hi>Quaker-Preachers</hi> (though as we have manifested above, nothing in truth but Pagan preachers) must be the only successours of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and Possessours of the power and vertue, that was in them. What more? <hi>Such Ministers stand not in need of the ceremony of Ordination and Imposition of hands. Ans.</hi> Why then were hands laid upon <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas, Act.</hi> 13:3. And why had <hi>Timothy</hi> the <hi>laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4:14. If such made use of this ceremony, shall any Minister now a dayes think it below him, to do the like? But sayes he, <hi>Our adversaries, who use it, confess that the power of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the holy Ghost is ceased among them: And is it not ridiculous to imitate the shadow, when the substance is away? Ans</hi> We say not, that the holy Ghost was alwayes given by imposition of hands: let him look (not to mention instances in the Old Testament, where it had no such use) <hi>Mark.</hi> 10: <hi>v.</hi> 16. &amp; 16: <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13:13. And even where it was used toward Church-officers, it did not alwayes carry alongs with it, the giving of the holy Ghost; as we see, <hi>Act.</hi> 13:3. it was used towards <hi>Paul,</hi> who before that had been filled with the holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 9:17. The same also we read of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> before this time <hi>Act.</hi> 11:24. So then though this power be not, and this use of imposition of hands be ceased, yet its use in Ordination, and Ordination it self, must not be cast away, by such, as would be followers of Christ, and of his Apostles, seing its principal use in Ordination remaineth, not only to declare, who the person is, who is to be set apart, for the Ministrie; but to declare the solemne Dedication and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, or setting apart of the person, for the work, and the conveyance of the Ministerial Power and Office, with a charge to go about the work with all care and diligence, But it is little wonder, that our <hi>Quakers</hi> trample this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance under foot, when there is not one ordinance of Jesus Christ, that they value, or will regard. And what Christians these are, let every one judge: And whether or not, I had not ground to say, and againe to repeat it, that they
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:66147:200"/>
are a company of the most desperate Antichristian opposers of Christ, and all his Appointments, that ever the sun shined on.</p>
               <p n="16">16. It is observable, that in his whole discourse, he speaketh nothing of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> which other <hi>Quakers</hi> require, in Ministers of the Spirit.

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. Of Ministerial Qualifications.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE proceed now, to examine what he saith, about the Qualifications of Ministers <hi>Pag.</hi> 190. &amp;c. §. 15. Though what he began to say of the Ministerial Call, was rather concerning the Qualifications, as we observed; yet now seing here he beginneth to speak directly, and <hi>ex professo,</hi> of these Qualifications, we shall follow him. And <hi>first</hi> he tels us. That <hi>as he placed the true call, in the motion of the holy Spirit, so also</hi> (he sayes) <hi>the power, vertue and life of the Spirit, and of grace, proceeding from him, is the principal and most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary qualification, without which he can neither discharge his duty, acceptably unto God, nor profitably unto men. Ans.</hi> Wherein he placed the call, we have heard, and have heard it several wayes expressed; And here we have it in a new distinct manner expressed; for here nothing is mentioned, but a simple <hi>motion of the Spirit</hi>; and every motion of the Spirit is not extraordinary. But (2.) What he sayes here of a necessary qualification, seemeth only to relate to the better and more profitable discharge of the duty, as to men; and so to respect the <hi>bene esse</hi> of the Office, &amp; not the simple <hi>esse</hi> of it. As for what he sayes of God, that it cannot be performed acceptably unto him, is nothing; for an unsanctified Magistrate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not performe his office acceptably every way unto God, unless we meane only, that the substance of the work, when done according to justice and equity, is approven of God, though the person be not accepted in it, (3.) We have here good words, <hi>Power, Vertue and Life of the Spirit, and of grace</hi>: But these must not deceive us; for by all these good words, according to his principles, formerly considered <hi>Chap.</hi> X. he cannot understand what is imported thereby in the Scriptures; but only what an Heathen or Pagan, that never heard of Christ, nor never shall hear of him, is capable of: And whether this be fitter to be a necessary qualification of a Pagan-preacher, than of a Gospel-Minister, let any judge who will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He saith next, <hi>That we affirme three things concurre to the constituting of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, to wit, Natural parts, that is, that he be not an idiot; acquired parts, that he be learned in the tongues, in Philosophie, and scholastick theology; and finally the grace of God: The first two belong to the essence of a Minister, the last to his bene esse. Ans.</hi> Who stateth the question thus, I know not; for my part I cannot well
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:66147:200"/>
approve it. Of the grace of God, I spoke my minde, in the beginning of the preceeding Chapter: As to the knowledge of the languages, wherein the Bible was originally written, I think that very convenient, in some measure at least, and he hath let us see here and there, in this his Book, what use he could make of it: but as to the knowledge of the original languages, &amp; use of commentaries, I think it no wonder, he should think it utterly useless, seing the knowledge of the Scriptures themselves, is of so little an account, with him. That skill in Philosophy is useful, in some measure, I shall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; but for the knowledge of Scholastick Theology, I account it not so necessary; And I suppose the knowledge of other Theologie much more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; though all these be very requisite, in a Professour. On the contrary, as not having said enough before, he saith, <hi>That without grace, no man can be a true or lawful Minister.</hi> And I suppose he meaneth, neither before God, nor Man, This I judge too far said. His <hi>first</hi> Argument for this is the same with the first he brought above, for his call, and was there answered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His 2. <hi>Arg.</hi> is much like the former, being this; <hi>No man can be a minister of the Church of Christ, which is his body, but he that is a member thereof. But he who wanteth the grace of God, cannot be a member of that body. Therefore &amp;c. Answ.</hi> Had he understood the difference betwixt the Church Visible, and Invisible; and had he known, that Officers are set in the Church Visible, and not in the Church Invisible, which is made up of homogeneal parts, he had seen the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this argument: Christ is an head to both, &amp; communicateth by his Spirit suteable nourishment, whether of gifts, or of grace, to the members of both, according as he thinketh fit <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4:7.11, 16. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. throughout: and while he applieth these things wholly and solely unto the Church Invisible, he bewryeth his ignorance. His 3. <hi>Arg.</hi> is from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4:10, 11. and he translateth the words thus, <hi>as every man hath receiveth grace,</hi> so &amp;c. but the word in the original is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we finde alwayes rendered <hi>gift,</hi> or <hi>free gift:</hi> but it is like, that <hi>gift</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> are one thing with him, with whom the highest grace is a most common gift, whereof even a Pagan, as such, can be capable. It is true, the Apostle addeth, <hi>as Stewards of the manifold grace of God:</hi> But that by <hi>grace</hi> is meaned a <hi>gift</hi> is notoure from the whole context, and scope of the place; for it is that only, which can be ministred, and communicated by speaking; let him consider, what this word importeth <hi>Rom</hi> 1:5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12:3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2:9. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3:8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4:7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1:7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5:12. But sayes he, <hi>this cannot be understood of any mere natural vertue, for by these God should not be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Answ.</hi> Let him therefore see to this, who giveth us no other grace, but what riseth out of the puddle of Nature: But we acknowledge spiritual gifts, which yet are distinct from grace, that is saving, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:1, 4, 9, 28, 30, 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14:1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6:4. <hi>Act.</hi> 8:20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11:17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13:2. His <hi>last Arg.</hi> is from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1:8. Which shew indeed, what is very requisite, and what should mainly be looked after; so as such, who give cleare evidences or pregnant presumptions of the contrary, should not be admitted unto the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie; but because real grace is hid in the heart, and can not be infallibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated unto others, so as they can judicially passe sentence thereupon; we
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:66147:201"/>
cannot say, that the want of true grace doth really null all their Ministerial acts, both before God and Man. What he citeth from a nameless Author, as also from one <hi>Franciscus Lambertus,</hi> saith nothing against what I say; nor proveth his point.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He <hi>Pag.</hi> 194. §. 17. Answereth contrary Objections, the <hi>first</hi> whereof is. That then all ministers should be saved. And instead of answering, and saying (which he might have done, with some shew of reason, according to his grounds) That none others, but such as should certainly be saved, were true a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d lawful Ministers; finding this, it seemeth, too hask, he chooseth rather to say, That there may be a total falling away from grace; the contrare whereof we have showne above <hi>Chap.</hi> XV. and so he yeeldeth the Argument. Another objection taken from their Principles, he proposeth thus.

He showeth, that he doth not exclude all true learning, from the qualification of Ministers, But what sort of learning owneth he? He owneth that, <hi>which cometh from the inward instructions and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, whereby the soul learneth the secret wayes of the Lord, and knoweth the inward labours and exercises of the minde &amp;c. and such,</hi> sayes he, <hi>as are thus taught, can teach, and opportunely admonish, and by certain experience witness for God, as did of old the Prophets, and the Apostles of late</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1:1. <hi>Ans.</hi> By this it seemes, that all ministers learning, of what soever kinde, that is useful, must be immediatly taught them; &amp; they must have all by inward Instructions of the Spirit; And it will not be enough to him, that the Spirit teach us by ordinary meanes, as he did <hi>Daniel Chap.</hi> 1:17. comp. with <hi>vers.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it must be by Immediat Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; Revelations: &amp; I would faine know, if he learned his Latine, Greek &amp; Hebrew so?

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Then §. 19. &amp; forward, he comes to speak in particular, to three parts of literature: as if there were no moe; nor none more excellent &amp; useful: &amp; the <hi>first</hi> is the <hi>Knowledge of tongues, Latine, Greek &amp; Hebrew;</hi> And he sayes we judge the knowledge of these necessary, that <hi>we may read the Scriptures, in the original languages,</hi> which Scriptures, he sayes, <hi>we take to be our only rule.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declareing, that he owneth then not as such: and sure, seing we owne the Scriptures for our only Rule, it is but rational, that we study these lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, in which they were first written, that we may thereby come the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to understand their meaning; seing no translation can so fully &amp; emphatically express the original, in all points, as were to be wished: But why mentioneth he the <hi>Latine</hi> for this end? Thinks he, that any part of our Rule was originally written in Latine? Belike he would foist-in some apocryphal books into our Canon, or give us the Popish vulgar version, for the only authenticque? And if so, we should not stand in great need of the Knowledge of Hebrew &amp; Greek. He sayes, <hi>this study was commendable in the primitive Reformers, because darkness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had overwhelmed the whole Christian world. Answ.</hi> (1.) Then it seemeth there was then a Christian world, contrary to what he said above (2.) If it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to dispel darkness, it cannot be unnecessary to keep out darkness. (3.) But why might not the Spirit, without their study, have taught these things? And why did they not waite till the Spirit taught them immediatly? (4.) How came it, that the Spirit gave a blessing to their endeavours? Will God bless sinful meanes? But he addeth. <hi>That true reformation was not placed in that knowledge; for though Papists, out of emulation, set up that study, yet we see that they are as much obdured in their errours, as ever Ans.</hi> who saith, that true reformation was placed in this? It was a mean in it self to help towards the knowledge of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res; And if Jesuites, &amp; other Papists, do not improve the same to a right end, shall therefore the meane be condemned altogether? This man tels us, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites &amp; all men have a light within them, which, if well improven, would prove saving, and because they, &amp; many others, do not make a right use here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; will he think, that it should be laid aside altogether? I suppose not. <hi>Therefore,</hi> sayes he further, <hi>this will not prove the necessity of this science unto ministers.</hi> Whence doth he conclude this? It is a conclusion without premisses; for that which he said last, would rather inferre the contrary. <hi>Far lesse, will it evince</hi> (saith he) <hi>that it is a qualification more necessary, then is the grace and Spirit of God; seing this can supply the want of that, in rusticks, and in ignorant persons. Answ.</hi> I shall be far from saying, that it is more necessary; Let each have its owne place and I am

satisfied; things subordinat can well consists; but this man will have these two contradictory. What the Spirit may help illiterate persons to know, by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the things of salvation, is nothing to the purpose; for we are speaking of Ministers, who should be knowing persons, and able to teach others. And <hi>Peter</hi> tels us, what unlearned Persons are apt to do with the Scripture: But says he <hi>Pag.</hi> 198. <hi>all the knowledge, that is had by that learning, is without the Spirit, and so is fallible; when as a rustick, hearing the Scriptures read, can say, that it is true, by the same Spirit, &amp; also understand it, and if needful interpret it, by observing how his owne condition agreeth with the condition of the saints recorded in Scripture Ans.</hi> It is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirits ordinary assistance: and we look not for immediat infallible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Inspirations. (2.) Why may not the rustick, if acted by an infallible and immediatly inspireing Spirit, tell all this, without hearing the Scriptures read? And how should he even have heard them read, in his owne language. If they had not been translated? And how had they been translated, without this knowledge? (3.) May not the rustick mistake his owne condition? and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently misinterpret the Scripture? or may he not misapply that passage, &amp; wrest it, contrare to its native scope, and that through ignorance even of the letter of the Scriptures; and so suppose an harmony, or similitude, where there is no such thing? Such a thing, I suppose, is not impossible: And what doth his argueing then evince? But <hi>he hath a sufficient experience in some of his Quakers, particularly in a shoe maker, or cobler, correcting a Professour, in a citation of some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Scripture, affirming, that there was no such passage to be found Ans.</hi> This man hath his fables ready at hand, for we had such another before: but few of his Readers can know, whether he speaketh true or false: all that I shall say, is that this fable is impertinently here brought in, for the question is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Professour or Doctor, may not have a failing memory? Nor whether a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick cannot have a more happy one? &amp; what more is in this fable, I cannot see, unless he would hence inferre, that the Spirit teacheth them, without book, hearing or reading, the very letter of the Scripture, even the very translated words. And if this be true, it is little wonder, they are at no paines in reading the Scriptures, let be in studying of them. But till I know the truth of this mystery better, I crave his leave to suspend my beliefe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The next point of learning is <hi>Logick and Philosophy.</hi> But whether is it Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Artificial Philosophy, that he is against? Though I judge, that a man may be a minister, &amp; yet be no profound Philosopher, nor expert in that which goeth under that name; Yet I think some measure of knowledge thereof, can not well be wanted, especially in such as have to do with wrangling sophisters, like this <hi>Quaker,</hi> that would pervert souls, &amp; propagate errour; &amp; it hath its owne profitableness to other uses also. But what hath this man against it? <hi>It is</hi> (sayes he) <hi>the root and original of all contention.</hi> How doth he prove this? we know, the best things may be abused, but the abuse of a science, may bear its blame, &amp; the science it self be blameless. <hi>It draweth men away from that clear understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things, which reason it self might furnish.</hi> This, if so, is but its abuse. <hi>He that is not very wise can be a perfect logician.</hi> This may be doubted; And it may be, he will not deny, that one not very wise may be a good Christian: doth
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:66147:203"/>
it not helpe in defending of truth, &amp; refuting of hereticks? <hi>The truth, that is in men truely rational, needeth not this help, and it will not convince the obstinate; but teacheth them many artifices and distinctions, to oppugnate the truth,</hi> saith he, <hi>Ans.</hi> What meaneth he by that truth, with is in men truely rational? is it natural truth, or supernatural; common, or saving? Me thinks, he had need of some science, whereby to explaine himself; for his language is dark (2.) Though truth, in it self, should not need this help; Yet it may stand in need of some such help, to fix it in a subject, that is doubting, either because of the darkness of his owne understanding, or because of the contrary argueings of Adversaries. (3.) This science is only used, as an instrumental medium to convince, or if not to convince, yet to confute their errours, and to defend truth from their exceptions, and that in such a rational way, as may be convinceing to such, as will not be obstinate. (4.) If any use its distinctions to oppugne the truth, they must beare the blame for this abuse: the distinctions may however be good. <hi>Truth</hi> (saith he) <hi>comeing from an honest heart, and taught by the Spirit, will sooner penetrate, then thousands of demonstrations; as the Instance of the old man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceing the heathen Philosopher, whom all the Bishops of the Councel of</hi> Nice <hi>could not overcome, with their disputes. Ans.</hi> This is only when it pleaseth the Lord, to concurre with his blessing: And such rare examples are not ordinary; and are to teach us in all these wayes to depend upon the Lord for the blessing, and not to loose us from the use of the meanes. What saith he to natural logick <hi>He doth not deny the use of this, because every man in his wits hath it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; he hath also used it in this treatise. Ans.</hi> But if natural logick be so useful, why is artificial or acquired logick so noxious, seing it only serveth to accomplish and polish the other? Though every man in his wits hath this, yet I suppose some have more and some have less; and such as have less may be allowed to take some help to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it. If he hath only used that logick here, I could wish him, to take some more of artificial logick to helpe it; and yet, I think he hath not wholly renunced it in this Treatise, though by neither, nor by both, hath he been able to gaine his point, whether in confirming his errours, or in darkning of the truth. What sayes he to other parts of Philosophy? <hi>That part,</hi> sayes he, <hi>which is called the Ethicks, may be better learned out of the Scriptures.</hi> Which is very true, they being a full and perfect rule in all morals: But I think, that this study should not be unprofitable for him, who will not owne the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as a Rule; and acknowledgeth the light of Nature, for a guide, and only rule, which is in all heathens, and by which light alone they wrote their morals or Ethicks: so that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I think, if he would make use here of his natural logick, he might see, how consequentially he should speak to his owne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if he would recommend to all the study of <hi>Aristotiles</hi> Ethicks, or the morals of some other Hethenish Philosophers, instead of the Scriptures. For <hi>Physicks and Metaphysicks,</hi> saith he, <hi>they may be reduced to Medicine and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicques.</hi> But not to be too Philosophical, in disputing here with him, why may not the knowledge of them; Yea and of Mathematickes too, be of some use, to whatsoever art or science they may be reduced? I would faine heare, what reason his natural logick could give us, to convince us, that
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:66147:203"/>
they could not be useful, because of that? As for my dull natural logick, it can perceive no reason, nor shew of reason. <hi>In fine</hi> He citeth <hi>Col.</hi> 2:8. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6:20. which speak nothing against the innocent and profitable use of philosophy, which is all we defend: we speak not of that philosophy, which is vaine deceit, after the tradition of men; and which, as <hi>Beza</hi> on the place thinketh, is that Theology, which is the product of humane vanity, leaning only to Custome and Enthusiasmes: let him consider this, &amp; what <hi>Calvin</hi> on the place, thinketh this Philosophy to be, and it may be, he may see his owne Theology comprehended under it, if not mainely understood. What is this Philosophy then, in <hi>Calvines</hi> judgment? Even, <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as for 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6: <hi>vers.</hi> 20. The science falsly so called there spoken of, is not Philosophy, but a science of coineing and uttering new and vaine bombast words, giving a sound without substance, tending to corrupt and darken the simplicity of the Gospel: A science wherein I know none more expert and skilled, than are our <hi>Quakers.</hi> He may read <hi>Calvin</hi> on the place, if he will. And for a close to this, How great a prejudice so ever he hath against Philosophy; yet in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, Christians, who had been Philosophers, was not by their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy less fitted, but more, to defend the truth against heathen Philosophers; as <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> against <hi>Valentinus, Tertullian</hi> against <hi>Marcion; Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus; Chrysostome</hi> against <hi>Libanius; and Prudentius</hi> against <hi>Symmachus.</hi>

The last part of humane literature, which he inveigheth against, is that which is called <hi>Scholastical Theology,</hi> by which I suppose, he meaneth that only, which now commonly goeth under that name, as distinct from Polemick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, handling controversies, debated betwixt the orthodox, and heretical or erroneous persons, such as <hi>Pelagians, Socinians, Arminians, Anabaptists, Antinomians, Quakers,</hi> and the rest; And as to it, I shall say no more, than I have said <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. §. 12. and suffer him to go on in his ranting. Only I must take notice of some expressions, which he hath here and there, in this discourse. Though I cannot understand, how <hi>Origen</hi> should be among the first, who by this art gave himself to interpret Scriptures; nor how hereby <hi>Arius</hi> fell into his errour; seing this Theology is commonly commenced from <hi>Peter Lombard</hi>; yet I am glade to hear him <hi>Pag.</hi> 201. calling that heresie of <hi>Arius,</hi> (who denyed the Son to be equal with the Father in power and glory and of the same essence) <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride</hi>; for many of his Brethren the <hi>Quakers</hi> either doubt of, or directly deny the Trinity: Yea Mr <hi>Clapham,</hi> in his book against the <hi>Quakers Sect.</hi> 3. tels us, they call this doctrine a lie, and citeth for it <hi>Saul's errand to Damascus</hi> p. 12. <hi>and the sword of the Lord drawn</hi> p. 4. And in this, if he thinketh as he speaketh, I would know, how he will reconcile himself unto them: but it may be, he taketh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son and holy Ghost, for one Person, as well as for one essence; as some other <hi>Quakers</hi> do. He speaketh like a <hi>Quaker,</hi> that is, calumniously, when he
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:66147:204"/>
saith §. 22. <hi>that this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knowledge is accounted a necessary qualification for a Minister, when the pure teaching of the Spirit of truth is contemned.</hi> He may speak thus, if he thinketh good, against his old friends the <hi>Iesuites</hi>; for we are for the teaching of the Spirit, and preferre it to all other whatsomever: but we are for the teaching of the Spirit, in the way he hath appointed, that is, by waiting upon him, in his ordinances, meditating on his word, and useing all other lawful meanes to come to the right understanding of his meaning, in his word, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially prayer: But we dar not, with this deluded bold generation, tempt the Lord, by looking for immediat Revelations, and laying aside all Meanes and Ordinances, in coming to the saving knowledge of his Name, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Gospel of his Son, Jesus Christ. We account it also a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny for him to say, <hi>ibid.</hi> that <hi>he who is to be a Minister, must lairne the airt of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hookster in the word;</hi> because we say, he must attend unto reading of what is written, for the understanding of Scripture. And whereas he thinketh the Devil could make as good a sermon, as the most learned: I only demand; and may he not also make as good a discourse, without book, as they do?

But the Spirit, that leadeth them, is wholly set in them to dishonour and cry down Christ, and to reject all his Ordinances, not one excepted; as we have seen already, and shall see more. Nay, this evil Spirit, that acteth them, destroyeth and casteth away these very Orders and Ordinances, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tels us, the true Spirit of God hath appointed and established: and is such an enemy to all Gospel Order, that it cryeth up only Paganish and develish Confusion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What he saith of the Papal and Prelatical Hierarchy, I have nothing to do with: but what can he say against that Order, which Presbyterians maintaine to be Instituted by Christ, by Officers of divine appointment, and the Courts &amp; Judicatories, which they owne, Superior &amp; Inferior? Whatever conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be among these, concerning the Order to be observed in the house of God, there is no warrand for him &amp; his party to cast away all Order, &amp; bring in the confusion of Babel, instead of that beautiful and edifying Order, which Christ, the Supream Head and King of the Church, hath wisely, for his owne glory, &amp; for promoving the good &amp; edification of his Subjects, Appointed, &amp; signally Blessed.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:66147:205"/>3. But sayes he <hi>Pag.</hi> 204. speaking of his party, <hi>We say the substance is to be enquired after, and the Vertue, Life and Spirit, who is one, in all these different names and offices, mentioned in the Scriptures</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:4 <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. <hi>Answ.</hi> We say also, the Substance is to be enquired after, and the Spirit's Blessing, Power, Efficacy, and Presence to be sought; but so, as the Ordinances and holy Appointments of the Spirit be religiously Observed; for the Spirit of God hath not taught us, to see any repugnancy here; whatever that evil Spirit, which acteth and leadeth them, doth. Sure, had there been any such Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy or Inconsistency, as these Fanaticks dream, the Spirit had never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed these Orders; nor instituted these Ordinances and Officers; nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Rules to Regulate these Officers, in the right and edifying manner of the discharge of their duty, and Administrating the appointed Ordinances. Himself cannot but confess, that the Spirit did appoint Officers, in the house of God; the Scriptures, by him cited, are so cleare and plaine, to which others might be added: And I would faine know of him, why this was done? was this to divert the primitive Church from enquireing after the Substance, and after the Vertue, Life and Spirit, of these ordinances? He dar not say this. The Spirit then, that acteth them, cannot be the same with that Spirit, that ordered matters in the Primitive Church; but an enemie thereunto; and consequently the Spirit of the Devil, directly Opposeing and Counter working the Spirit of God: let him think on this; for it will be found so.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He goeth on to tell us, <hi>That it was never the minde of Christ and his Apostles, that Christians should establish the shadow and forme of these Officers, without the power, efficacy and Spirit of Christ. Answ.</hi> The Power, Efficacy and Spirit of Christ, is not in Christians power to Establish: the Spirit bloweth where he listeth: I understand not that Spirit, which falleth under the establishment of men, and of these <hi>Quakers</hi>; It is not the Spirit of God, that is so under their power, and at their devotion, and can be established by them, as they please. (2.) We plead not for Shadowes and Formes; but yet we owne the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and desire religiously to observe such, as Christ hath appointed to remaine and continue, <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ Ephes.</hi> 4: <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12, 13. even to <hi>the end of the world. Mat.</hi> 28:20. especially seing we have no ground to think, that all these Offices and Officers were appointed only for that time and age, the work being of the same necessity now, as then; and no restriction or limitation to that instant being declared: It is true, there was a special piece of work called for then; to wit, the founding and setling of Gospel Churches, and of Gospel Order, Lawes and Ordinances, to which extraordinary Officers were called, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and impowered; which is not now necessary: the foundation being once laid, there is no more required, but a continual building upon that foundation, to which ordinary Officers, and a standing ordinary Ministrie is sufficient and necessary, that the Ordinances of perpetual use may be administred, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christs appointment, for the constant edification of the Church: And
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:66147:205"/>
against this, these <hi>Quakers</hi> set themselves with all their might; that when the Church is denuded of her Officers and Watchers, she may become a fitter prey for these grievous wolves, who now enter in, not spareing the flock, &amp; speak perverse things to draw away disciples after them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This is</hi> (saith he) <hi>the work of Antichrist. &amp; the mystery of iniquity, erected in the dark night of Apostasie. Answ.</hi> Then Christ and his Apostles wrou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Were there no distinct Officers, particular individual Persons, separated and set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for the work of the Ministrie, in the dayes of the Apostles? If there were, it is manifest, that their Order and Way is Diametrically opposite to the Order and Way, used in the Apostolick Church. If there were not: what were the Apostles?

But that the Lord hath restricted this work, in ordinary, unto the peculiar Officers, is not only manifest from their Institution, &amp; their call thereunto, already clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but also from expresse Prohibition of any such Encroachment <hi>Rom.</hi> 12:3, 6, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. throughout 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7:20. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4:11. &amp; from the Titles menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, which, not being common, shew that the work thereby imported is not to be made common; &amp; Qualifications not common shew that the work is special, &amp; not common; so also the Duties required of the rest, in reference to these Officers, aboundantly show, that all are not promiscuously called to the work, because it is upon the account of the work, that these duties are to be performed unto them.

Then Christ, when he instituted twelue Apostles, did institute twelue Operations: and <hi>Matthias Act.</hi> 1. who was numbered among the twelue, was nothing but an Operation, and <hi>Paul</hi> was another? And when Christ gave some Apostles, and some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp; some Evangelists, and some Pastours and Teachers <hi>Ehes.</hi> 4.11. he gave nothing but Operations, common to all the Church members, contrare to

(3.) The plaine and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious scope of the Apostle in both places, being to suppress that levelling humore; that was ariseing in these Churches, where proud persons were not satisfied with their owne station, but would encroach upon the function of others, is more than enough to confute and rebuke the levelling humore of this <hi>Quaker,</hi> who is sick of <hi>Corah's</hi> disease <hi>Numb.</hi> 16: <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2, 3. (4) We say not, that none of these Offices could coincide in the same persones; for we know the Superiour Officer could do, what the Inferiour did; though the Inferiour could not do what the Superior did The Apostles could have done the work of Pastours and Teachers, though these could not have done the work of the Apostles. (5.) There is a vaste difference betwixt these Official duties, incumbent to Officers: and presupposeing special Official gifts, and a peculiar call; and the common christian duties, mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9, 10. &amp;c.</p>

Ans.</hi> (1.) It is false, that all grant Pastours and Doctors to be the same, though one man may performe both these Offices, as one may performe both the office of an Elder and of a Deacon. (2.) The Prophets were extraordinary officers, having a special Function and Imployment in the Church, at that time; And though some now may have a gift of foreteling some future thing, that will not constitute them Church-officers, or Prophets. (3.) Though these Offices might coincede in some persons; Yet they remained distinct Offices: And though we should grant (which we cannot) that all the Offices were common to all the officers; Yet this would plead nothing for his Babel, who will have no distinct setled Officers, at all; but maketh all the Offices and Work, common, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to all the Members, man and woman, young and old, without any difference.</p>

But sayes he <hi>Pag.</hi> 206. <hi>Though to instruct, teach and exhort be proper to such, as are peculiarly called to the work of the ministey; Yet it is not so peculiar unto them, as that it may not also be common to such, as are moved by the Spirit, when the saints are gathered together. Ans.</hi> (1.) Then it seemeth, he will grant that there are some peculiarly called to the work of the Ministry; and that it is proper to them to Teach, Admonish, and Exhort: And if so, how can others take upon them to performe the work peculiar to such an Office, who are not impowered thereunto, by being called to the Office? We speak not here of Private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing and exhorting, but of that which is Ministerial; and is to be with Ministerial Authority, as by persons clothed with Official authority. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of hearing and seeing, which are proper to men, and yet common to other creatures, is of no use here, where we are speaking of work, peculiar to an Office, and ought to be performed by none, but such as are clothed with that office. (2.) God will move none, in ordinary cases, to violate the Order established in his owne house; and because of this Order, which Christ hath established, we judge, that all such persons, as suppose themselves moved by the Spirit, to teach publickly, in the Assemblies of the Saints, are moved by their own spirit, and not by the Spirit of God, who is a God of order, and not the Author of confusion; or rather by the Spirit of Satan, in contempt of Christs order.</p>

He should prove, if he could, that there was no such

Officer, and that it was a meer Operation, that goeth under that name; and such an Operation, as was common to all Church members. As for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, of whom he speaketh <hi>next,</hi> though the name, as to its etymology, may denote <hi>one sent</hi>; yet he knoweth, that it is in a special manner given unto those, whom Christ sent forth, who at first were twelve in number, and after Judas's death, were againe made twelve by the election of <hi>Matthias,</hi> to whom at length <hi>Paul</hi> was added, and some suppose <hi>Barnabas</hi> also; and though, he seeth, we make no strick limitation, as fixed unto the number, yet we hold, that they were distinct and superiour Officers, named with with a <hi>first</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:28. But he most boldly and impudently saith <hi>Pag.</hi> 207. <hi>That they were not distinct officers, but only names.</hi> What? did God set Names in the Church? did Christ, when he ascended, give only Names to the Church? What names were they? <hi>Such names, as the Scripture diversly useth to express the more eminent emanations and influences of divine grace,</hi> sayes he. But why doth he not give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this diverse use of the word? Why doth <hi>Paul</hi> so often stile himself, an Apostle? Why doth he so carefully vindicate his Apostolick office, chiefly in his Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>? What may not that man dar to do, who dar thus play with the Scriptures? <hi>It is</hi> (saith he further) <hi>as if some now should call him an Evangelist, who had converted some heathen Nation, as the Iesuites call their Emissaries to the Indians and to Iapon, Apostles; and as Iohn Knox was frequently called the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Scotland. Ans.</hi> This is so far from helping, that it quite overthroweth his designes; (not to mention, how absurd it is, to reason from mens abusive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and usage of words, to the affixing of such an Abusive sense, to the same words, used in Scripture, contrare to the whole intendment of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, in the places, where these words are used) for, (not once to take notice of the Jesuitical perversion) such expressions, being used by way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion, because of some resemblance, in some one point or other, which the work of these of late, had, or might have, with what the Apostles &amp; Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists did of old, do evidently say, that there were such Officers, in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, to whom these names did most properly appertaine; and that these names did point out, certain, knowne and distinct Officers; and not ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of divine grace; as this man saith, who speaketh he knoweth not what; but cannot speak ill enough, against Christ's Ordinances.</p>

               <p n="13">13. But §. 26. pag. 207. <hi>Though he plead for liberty of prophesying by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, unto all, when they are moved thereunto</hi>; yet he sayes, the <hi>Quakers believe and affirme, that there are some more especially called to the work of the Ministrie, whose work is constantly and particularly to instruct, exhort and watch, to whom such obedience and subjection is due, as is held forth Heb.</hi> 13: <hi>vers.</hi> 17. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5: <hi>vers.</hi> 12, 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 15: <hi>vers.</hi> 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5: <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) In this plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for liberty of prophesying, he joyneth with <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> his old friends, whom he hath no will to forsake, in such an advantagious point: but we have showne above, that this liberty destroyeth the Office; for if the work be common, there needeth no Office be appointed for that work; and if there be an Office for that work, no man must meddle with the work belonging to that Office, who is not clothed with the Office. What way are these men more peculiarly called, than others? Others, we heard, were placed in the ministrie and ordained of God, when moved to the work, and were to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and subjected unto, as such, according to these places of Scripture, now cited. Why doth he not show us, wherein this peculiarity consisteth? Whether is it in some thing inward, or in something outward? if inward; what can it be more, than Gods calling and ordaining? if outward; Is it imposition of hands of the Presbytery; or a potestative mission, by Church Officers? (3.) But he sayes, <hi>They are more fitted and fournished, than others.</hi> True, yet this is not before the call, but after it, and a consequence of the call; for he sayes, <hi>and therefore they are more fitted,</hi> to wit, because peculiarly called; and wherein this peculiar call consists, I would know. (4.) He tels us also, that <hi>their work is, more constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly to instruct &amp;c.</hi> But can they instruct at any time, without a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial motion of the Spirit? if they can, why doth he inveigh against our Officers for doing the same? If they cannot, how can this be said to be more their work, than it is the work of others, who do the same, upon the like motion? or doth their special Call consist in their receiving more frequent motion, than others? But this speaks only of more work, but nothing of a distinct Office. So that all this concession of his is just nothing (5.) I would know, if these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially called persons, be wholly separated for that work; and that statedly, and fixedly, so as they are in all time coming looked upon, regarded and submitted unto, as officers over others; and how this work of separating of them is done? Beside these he tels us also of <hi>Elders,</hi> who <hi>albeit they be not frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called to declare themselves in words</hi> (by this I suppose, he meaneth their way of preaching) <hi>yet having had experience of the work of truth on their hearts, they watch over and privatly instruct the younger. Ans.</hi> But yet if the Spirit move them, they may, they must, do this in Publick too. (2.) we heard before, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or something like, was all that he gave us, for a call to the highest imployment. (3.) whatever these Elders be, they are not the Scripture Elders; for these are apponted for Government or Ruleing the Church, hence called <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:29, and said to <hi>Rule</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4:17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12:8. (4.) He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:66147:209"/>
these Elders with deacons, telling us that <hi>they care for the poor, widowes, &amp; orphanes.</hi> Nay more, he sayes, <hi>they take care that peace, unity, concord, and love and health be preserved in the Church.</hi> But what way is this done? And how are they called hereunto? And whether doth all this declare them to be distinct Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, or not? and over the people, or not? And whether, is this their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar work, that others of the common people may not meddle with? Let him answere these, and reconcile himself with himself, when he is at leasure.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But <hi>Pag.</hi> 208. he tels us, <hi>that they refuse that distinction of</hi> laicks <hi>and</hi> cleargy. And knoweth he not, that we disapprove these termes? But the thing that they refuse, is <hi>That none,</hi> (as he speaketh) <hi>should be admitted to the work of the Ministrie, but who are educated in schooles, and instructed in logick, &amp;c. and he who is thus educated must not learne another honest tread, for his leaving.</hi> But why doth it offend them, that men take paines to be instructed and qualified for the work; and that none be admitted, but such as are qualified? It seemeth that the work of the Ministrie is a light business with them; &amp; may be discharged by such, as have no learning or qualifications; but why then did the Lord qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie his Apostles, by teaching them several yeers, and by extraordinary infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of knowledge? It seemeth they would have all waiting for such miracles now: but we must first see a warrand; and seing experience tels us, that the Lord doth not take this way now, why are they offended, that we use ordinary meanes for attaining to knowledge? (2.) He may know, if he will, that we exclude none from the Ministrie, if they be qualified, though they have not learned their philosophy, &amp;c. at ordinary schooles. (3.) As for their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an honest trade, we finde none of the Apostles doing so, after they were called to that work; and we look upon the work of the Ministrie, as such as will take up the whole man, and his whole time, if he be faithful and diligent. And yet some men have learned physick, after they have been Ministers, that they might be helpful to the poor; and no man condemneth this, providing that thereby they take not occasion to neglect the Ministrie, which is of greater consequence.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But hereby, sayes he, it cometh to passe, <hi>that Parents, seeing what honour and gaine attendeth the Ministrie, assigne their children to that office from their Infancy, and educat them thereunto of purpose, &amp;c.</hi> That Parents dedicat their children to the service of God, cannot be condemned: if they do it, upon a corrupt designe, and as moved by the corrupt ends, that is but their owne fault. <hi>Those</hi> (sayes he) <hi>being educated in pleasure and idleness, think it below them afterward to work with their hands, satisfying themselves to bring out of books, what they may Preach. Ans.</hi> Who ever think serious study an easie work, is not acquanted with it. And if a Minister think he hath time enough to follow an ordinary calling, he knoweth neither the weight, nor the worth of the Ministrie. He that must bring all his preaching alwayes out of books, must either preach seldome, or he will finde little time to follow another trade. But all these things, and what he saith further of corruption, in admitting corrupt and carnal men into the Ministrie, is nothing to the purpose in hand; for no sober man will approve such corruptions; And yet we need not run away to the <hi>Quakers</hi> way of prizing
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:66147:209"/>
extemporary non sensical discourses, after self motions, and self impulses, as the whole work of the Ministrie. But sayes he next <hi>Pag.</hi> 209. <hi>when men are not admitted to the Ministrie, that are not so and so licentiat, according to their rules, the Spirit is exstinguished and prophecies are despised, contrare to</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5:19, 20. <hi>Ans.</hi> What <hi>Papists</hi> do, in this, I regard not: Protestants will I suppose, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to admit any man, to the Ministrie, that is found after tryal really quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, upon any such account; howbeit the places by him cited be ill applied: but we must not stand upon every punctilio, but shall go on.</p>

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:66147:210"/>
which he had given to regulate the abuses of that Church. <hi>What</hi>? saith he, <hi>came the word of God out from you? Or came it unto you only</hi>?

Let the <hi>Quakers</hi> look to this; who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to the particular we are now about, would make us beleeve, that the word of God came out from them, and that it came to them only, and not to any Church, Primitive, or Subsequent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beside themselves. Further <hi>vers.</hi> 37, he sayes, <hi>if any man think himself to be a Prophet or spiritual, let him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the things, that I write unto you, are the commandements of the Lord.</hi> Let our <hi>Quaker</hi> ruminate upon this; and let all of them take notice of it; for when they contradict this expresse injunction of the Apostle, they declare themselves, say what they will to the contrary, to be neither Prophets nor spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: and further we see, that what <hi>Paul</hi> spoke, concerning this silence of women in the Church, was the commandement of the Lord. And therefore is obligeing to all Churches, who will owne any relation to Christ, their Lord and Head: and consequently the <hi>Quakers,</hi> rejecting this commandement of the Lord, renunce, in so far, their Interest in, and Relation to the Lord, as their Head and Lawgiver. And the next words <hi>vers.</hi> 38. <hi>But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant,</hi> have their owne weight also; as if he had said, if any will not yet, for all this, acquiesce, let him take his pleasure; no more needs be said, for his conviction: he is wilfully ignorant; and he must remaine so: And so say we, in this particular: if the <hi>Quakers</hi> will remaine ignorant, we cannot helpe it; we must follow our rule, and declare them inconvinceable; and so leave them.</p>

This practice then of the <hi>Quakers</hi> must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and a plaine saying; that God created <hi>Eve</hi> first, and then <hi>Adam.</hi> And further the Apostle addeth, <hi>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, was in the transgression.</hi> That is, the woman, being immediatly &amp; first deceived by Satan, was the cause &amp; occasion of <hi>Adams</hi> transgressing; &amp; therefore was her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the man laid further upon her, as a more grievous weight and burthen, as a part of her punishment. The <hi>Quakers</hi> then, who would have women usurping Authority and Teaching, in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do seek to annul the sentence past upon Women by the just Lord, for <hi>Eve's</hi> being the cause of <hi>Adam's</hi> sinning: and do
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:66147:210"/>
in a manner declare, that that sentence was unjust; and that <hi>Eve</hi> was not the devils instrument, to cause <hi>Adam</hi> sinne. Let them see to it; for it draweth deeper, than they are aware.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us now see, what he sayes for this. <hi>Seing</hi> (saith he <hi>Pag.</hi> 210.) <hi>male and female are one in Christ: and seing he giveth his Spirit to one, as well as to another, when the Lord moveth in women by his Spirit, we think it no way unlawful for them to preach in the meetings of God's people. Answ.</hi> (1.) That there is neither male, nor female, as there is neither Jew, nor Greek but all are one in Christ, we grant, in reference to the privileges of the Covenant, now under the Gospel dispensation, in opposition to what was under the Law; for of this <hi>Paul</hi> speaks <hi>Gal.</hi> 3:28. But that therefore, women may as well Preach in the Assemblies of the Church, as men, is a <hi>Quakers</hi> consequence, having no connexion, nor appearance of reason. (2.) That God giveth his sanctifying Spirit to women, as well, as to men, is very true: but that he moveth in them for any such end, as he here mentioneth, is simply denied: And by this we may see, what sentence to passe, upon these irregular motions, which they talk so much of. If the Spirit of God move in women, it will be to prompt them to duty, that is, to keep silence in the Church, and not to Teach there, or to usurpe authority, but to learne in subjection, remembering what her sex is called to, by the law of God, and what that punishment is, that is put upon all women, for <hi>Eva</hi> her carriage.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He thinks the passages we have cited out of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles do not oppugne their doctrine. And yet a more plaine contradiction is not imaginable. But what is his reason? <hi>Women,</hi> sayes he, <hi>have Prophecied and preached in the Church. Ans.</hi> That the Lord hath made use of women to be Prophetisses of old, we grant; for he is free to make use of whom he will. His rare and extraordinary acts are no rule to us; but his Law is our Rule, and to the Law must we goe &amp; to the Testimony.

his mistake is manifest, for the Apostle is only shewing, what the carriage of both men and women should be, while they were present in the publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and at the time of publick worshipe, while the word was spoken and explained, and publick Prayers used, not by themselves, but by others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereunto.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Common places, that the <hi>Quakers,</hi> on all occasions, make use of, in crying down the Ministrie, as thinking they have some popular advantage in this, &amp; ground, to cry out against them, as hirelings, and what not? Wherein they joyn with <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Levellers</hi>; little knowing or considering, how much hereby they are playing the Devils game. <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, when he was seeking to extirpate the Christian Religion by wiles, thought this a very effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual meane to accomplish that desperat designe by <hi>viz.</hi> to reduce the Ministrie to Contempt and Poverty, by withdrawing their immunities and stipends, as we read <hi>Sozom. Hist, tripart. lib.</hi> 6. c. 4. And who seeth not the manifest tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of such a designe? The Aegyptian Priests were more carefully looked to <hi>Gen.</hi> 47:22. When the Levites, his ministers, were neglected, the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a robbing of himself <hi>Mal.</hi> 3:8, 9, 10. <hi>Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings, ye are cursed with a curse, this whole nation &amp;c.</hi> Ought not <hi>Quakers</hi> to feare this curse? But they fear nothing said in the Scriptures; If the light within be their friend all is well.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What would this man be at, in this matter? He tels us <hi>Pag.</hi> 210. §. 28. That <hi>they willingly confess, that they, to whom Ministers are sent, if need be, should supply their necessities.</hi> This is, me thinks, a poor allowance; to have only their necessities, which some may possibly contract to little bounds, supplied; and that not absolutely either, but if need be. The necessity then that must be supplied, must be very necessitous, and extreme; yea a double necessity, and very constringing; &amp; possibly he will allow no more, than will serve to put away the greatest extremity of hunger &amp; misery. This is given with a very niggardly hand. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he saith, <hi>that it is lawful for them, to take what is necessary.</hi> And who would call this in question, seing hunger, we say, will break thorow hard walls. <hi>Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfie his soul, when he is hungry Prov.</hi> 6:30. would not this <hi>Quaker</hi> pity a Minister, if he were driven to this straite, to take something, to satisfie his hunger, though it were not formally given him: and will he allow no more, then that he take what is given, for the supply of his necessities, which may be very pinching, before some ill-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, like our <hi>Quakers,</hi> will let them passe for necessities? He tels us therefore, that he <hi>will not oppugne a necessary aliment.</hi> Wherein he is wise; for it may be the <hi>Quakers</hi> themselves both get and take more. What will he then oppugne? <hi>an aliment that is limited and compelled</hi>; and then, <hi>what is superfluous and sumptuous.</hi> But what if that, which some shall account superfluous, and sumptuous, be, in it self, all things considered, nothing else then necessary? who shall be judge in this case? must the <hi>Quakers</hi> only sit on the bench, as judges, here? If
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:66147:212"/>
so, some might possibly suspect them of partiality, and accuse them of cruelty. If the Supreme Magistrates of the land be judges herein, (&amp; who can reasonably refuse their umpirage and determination?) Will it not satisfie him, if Ministers rest satisfied with their decision? No, it will not satisfie him, for against this he rageth, as thinking it superfluous and sumptuous: and I shall not deny, but as to so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e it may be so, and therefore shall plead rather for others, who have but whereupon to live honestly, as becometh Men of such a function; and it may be scarce that. But, be it what it will be, he will not have it <hi>limited</hi>; And yet some way or other it must be limited, that it may answere the case of necessity, by a geometrical proportion, for an arithmetical proportion will not so well answere the necessity, which cannot be supposed to be alike in all. Who then shall make this limitation? Shall the givers only do it? But what if their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be too scanty? must the honest minister perish for want? Shall the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates? He will not yeeld to this; for then that would bring in a <hi>compelled maintainance,</hi> which he will also oppugne. But if there be not some legal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, (I owne no illegal, unjust and iniquous compulsion) what shall some Ministers do, who have to do with such hard hearted persons, as would rather suffer the Minister and all his houshold perish with hunger, before they would give what is just, yea or what is necessary, if they were not compelled by law: How shall they get their necessities supplied? These things, we see, can not well hang together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He tels us, <hi>that only this</hi> (that is, a necessary aliment) <hi>and no more, is included in these passages of Scripture, Gal.</hi> 6:6:1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9:11, 12, 13, 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5:16. We must then alittle consider these passages, that we may come to some clearness herein. The first is <hi>Gal.</hi> 6:6. <hi>Let him, that is taught in the word, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto him that teacheth, in all good things.</hi> But let us read the following verses too, where this matter is pressed, <hi>Be not deceived, God is not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them, who are of the houshold of faith, Gal.</hi> 6:7, 8, 9, 10. It is like, there were some of our <hi>Quakers</hi> principles, even in these dayes, who dealt unworthily with the Ministers of the Gospel: And it hath been Satans way, in all ages, to have men superfluously large in their allowance to superstitious courses, and to Idolatry; but niggardly spareing in the maintainance of truth: But <hi>Paul</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, what an open door this was, to let-in ignorance, if the labourers in the word were thus dealt with, sets himself against this evil, and will have every one, whom the Minister catechizeth and instructeth, to communicate unto the Minister, in all good things; this is not to contribute with others, to a bare supply of his necessities; but it is questionless a larger allowance; and that not in this, or that particular good thing, but in all good things: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many might, and possibly did, pretend, that there was no great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, the Minister had enough, and more; and they had little enough for themselves, and their owne families (as worlds wretches, who love the mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:66147:212"/>
of this world, better than durable riches in heaven, can devise many such things;) therefore the Apostle addeth, <hi>Be not deceived, God will not be mocked.</hi> It was with Him, and not with man only, they had to do; and he knew the truth of all, as he knoweth what really prompteth the <hi>Quakers</hi> to this opposition, whatever plausible pretexts they may alledge. And further he saith, <hi>whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</hi> To tell us, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication should not be with a niggardly and spareing hand; as we say, men must not hunger t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cting an harvest upon their sowing; and not suppose, that all that is given away to Ministers, is cast in the winde, seing it will have an harvest following it. Moreover he tels us, that the communicating of their good things, after this manner, is <hi>a sowing to the Spirit,</hi> which shall be followed with a reaping of life everlasting; not that this did exhaust the whole import of the expression, which the Apostle doth here thus accommodate, nor as if all such, as are thus liberal unto Ministers, shall have ground to expect life; but that the honest and conscientious liberal deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such, as are thus beneficial upon a good account, for maintaining of truth, and of the preaching of the Gospel, the meanes of propagating the Kingdome of Christ, and of the great designe of the Spirit, is in it self a sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spirit; and if their hearts be upright in the maine, and if they thus sow to the Spirit, they shall certainly of the Spirit reap life everlasting. But, on the other hand, what is keeped-up to the defrauding of labourers, of what they should have, is in God's account, <hi>a sowing to the flesh</hi>; and the harvest thereof shall be corruption; and thus their very niggardliness, shall destroy their substance. And lest some might think, that too oft giving might tend to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He addeth <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>and let us not be weary in well doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not:</hi> To shew, that there should be no sitting up here; and that folks fainting and drawing back their hand prejudgeth themselves of the harvest, that would follow in due season<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon which consideration, he presseth a more universal beneficence, not only to dispensers of the word, but to all persons; especially to the houshold of faith; and that when ever oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is offered. What liberality can they show to any, or to any houshold of faith, who withhold from Ministers, what is requisite?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us consider next 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. from <hi>vers.</hi> 4. and forward, where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle professedly is proving the lawfulness of Ministers taking maintainance not only for themselves, but for their families also, saying <hi>vers.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>have we not power to lead about a sister a wife, as well as other Apostles</hi>? And the proof hereof he prosecuteth at large, in the following verses. <hi>Who goeth</hi> (saith he <hi>vers.</hi> 7.) <hi>a warfare, any time, at his owne charges? Who planteth a vineyaird, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock</hi>? Souldiers have their pay and stipend; and the Roman Laws included herein, not only what was necessary for their maintainance, as provision for back and belly; but even the kindly gifts and gratuities, which were given, as further encouragements. And he who is at paines to plante a vineyaird, may in reason expect to eate of the fruite hereof; so he also that keepeth and feedeth a flock, should share of the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:66147:213"/>
milk. Natural equity pleadeth for these things; why are <hi>Quakers</hi> thus unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral? But they would not have stipends and salaries fixed and limited: and yet the salary of souldiers useth to be fixed; and if not, I suppose few would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their lives in the warre, unless they were in expectation of some greater benefite, than a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ministers are labourers in the vineyard, and are labouring husband men 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2:6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10:2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:9. And therefore they should have their hire, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5:18. They should have some fruite for their paines. So are they Shepherds, feeding the flock of God, and therefore should live of the milk. But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle goeth on to prove this, from other grounds, than the common Law of nations and equity, even from the Law of God <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>Say I those things as a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, I have the Law of God pleading for me also: <hi>For it is written, in the Law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corne: Doth God take care for oxen? Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes no doubt this is written, that he that ploweth, should plow in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd that he that thresheth in hope, should be partaker of his hope</hi>: Where he adduceth a testimony out of the Law, the moral equity whereof bindeth us, under the Gospel; and thence reasoneth from the less to the more; if oxen trading out the corne should not be muzzled, but have liberty to eat of the corne, about which they are labouring, much more must Ministers be maintained in their laboures: And this he further amplifieth from the similitude of labouring men, who plow and thresh, that they may share of their hopes. But lest some should think, that these arguments were not apposite to the Gospel, or to Ministers, who ministered spiritual things, and therefore should only share of that, as labouring men do of the fruit of their labours; and not of carnal things; the Apostle therefore, both to obviate this, and to presse the point further, sayes, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. <hi>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing, if we shall reap your carnal things</hi>? Arguing from the more to the less. As if he had said, Common equity and commutative justice would require some more, by way of compensation, than what we require; we sow unto you spiritual things, and we reap but your carnal things: and do you grudge us that? Our <hi>Quakers</hi> then are very cruel and unjust, that would have the mouth of the ox, that treadeth out the corne, muzzled; and would not suffer such, as sow spiritual things, so much as reap carnal things. Neither yet hath he Apostle said all, for he adduceth another Argument (beside that, that was more <hi>ad hominem,</hi> as we say, <hi>vers.</hi> 12.) <hi>vers.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Do yee not know, that they which Minister about holy things, live of the things of the Temple; &amp; they which waite at the altar, are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that they which preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel.</hi> Where he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth from a parity. As the Ministers of God under the Law were maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed honourably in their service, so should the Ministers of the Gospel be: and further addeth, that the Lord hath ordained it. How the Priests and Levites were maintained under the Law, is abundantly set downe there. See <hi>Exod,</hi> 29:

               <p n="5">5. Come we in the next place to take a view of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5: <hi>vers.</hi> 17, 18 <hi>Let the Elders, that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine: for the Scripture saith, thou shalt not muzzle the ox that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the corne; and the labourer is worthy of his reward.</hi> Whether by this <hi>double honour,</hi> we understand, with some, Reverence and Maintainance, or a double Portion of that honour, or Maintainance, that he allowed to widowes, spoken of in the former part of the Chapter; or with others, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective duty and encouragment: still <hi>Maintainance</hi> is included, as a special part; and this is held forth as due to all Rulers of the Church, even to such, as laboure not in word and doctrine, (which the <hi>Quakers</hi> did not see practised, amongst us) and chiefly to such, as Preach the Gospel: And against this they rage, though the Apostle confirmeth it, as formerly 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. from the Law; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> againe further from that received sentence, <hi>The labourer is worthy of his reward.</hi> But they grant, what is requisite for necessity: And yet the Apostle mentioneth a <hi>double honour,</hi> signifying, that he would have it a honorary indeed, and a double honorary; that is large, as the word <hi>double</hi> importeth in Scripture: see 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2 9. <hi>Esai.</hi> 40:2. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. <hi>Mat</hi> 23:15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18:6. So then there is more here imported, then what is for mere necessity: for what is for meer necessity is but an almes, no honorary; an honorary must respect the Place, Dignity; Office and Work of the person; and must have a correspondence therewith: And it can never be called an honorary, which is purely for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. They will not have this honorary fixed and limited, nor the persons constrained to give it. Why then doth the Apostle adde, <hi>the labourer is worthy of his reward</hi>? Is the labourers reward left to the discretion of the giver? Why then saith <hi>Iames Chap.</hi> 5:4 <hi>behold the hire of the labourers, which have reaped downe your fields, which is of you keept back by fraud, cryeth; and the cryes of them, which have reaped, are entered into the eares of the Lord of Sabaoth.</hi> It is an hire, we see, that cannot be keeped back, but by fraud; and when it is keeped back, it cryeth. Is the labourers reward unfixed? Or may not Law and Justice compel an unrighteous man to give the labourer his hire?</p>

These things he would not have them provide for themselves, because they should be provided of them, by those among whom they laboured. And in <hi>Luk.</hi> it is called <hi>an hire.</hi> And that it might appear, that he would not have them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained as almouners, he addeth, <hi>go not from house to house.</hi> If then Christ's allowance was such to them, who were but employed in that particular mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, to goe before Christ, towards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as his fore-runners; what shall we say of <hi>Quakers,</hi> that will allow so little encouragement to such, who must be employed in this work all their dayes, and give themselves wholly unto it, and must not entangle themselves, with the things of this life, but must minde this work alone, and be instant in season and out of season. They will allow them an almes, and hardly that, unless great necessity require it: but where is the hire, the wages, that justice calleth for? They have no heart to this.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Adde to these (1:) That Christ himself not only made use of the service of women, that ministered unto him of their substance <hi>Luk.</hi> 8:3. and so had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of that kinde, wherever he came; but we read, that He and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had a bag, which <hi>Iudas</hi> carryed <hi>Ioan.</hi> 12:6. out of which they provided themselves, as they thought fit <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4:8. &amp; 13:29. and gave also to the poor <hi>ibid.</hi> and if they had to give to the poor, they had more, then their own urgent necessity called for. But our <hi>Quakers</hi> would have ministers to excercise no charity to the poor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (2.) It is required of Ministers, that they be given to hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3: <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1:8. But if they have no more, than what their owne necessity requireth, their hospitality must needs be slender. (3.) Had Ministers only what <hi>Quakers</hi> do allow, it were to be feared, that many, to procure the favour and good will of their hearers, and so obtaine a larger allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance of their benevolence, would flatter too much, reprove faithfully too little, use too little ministerial boldness; many would be put to wrestle with no small difficulties, and strong temptations, perturbations of minde, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety &amp;c. that would very much unfit them for their work. (4.) This were an high way to render the Ministers, and consequently, the Ministrie contemptible. (5.) Few would be encouraged to enter upon that painful work, and have all outward discouragements to expect too. (6.) Nature taught heathens a far other thing. (7.) Shall Superstitious Idolaters be so extravagant: and shall Christians be so spareing? (8.) It may be, <hi>Quakers</hi> themselves take more, than for mere necessity. And whence soever it cometh, some faithful Servants of Christ, are not so well provided for, as all of them are.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Let us now proceed and heare what this <hi>Quaker</hi> saith. He saith <hi>we are forced to run to the example of the Law, which we use, as a refuge in defending many of our errours and superstitions, which are contrary to the nature and purity of the Gospel. Ans.</hi> We look upon this, but as a calumnious untruth, uttered by a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> who speaketh without ground, and thinks hereby to make himself and his party to he looked upon, as the only pure Gospellers: When yet wise and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding persons will see them to be the most desperat Enemies to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that ever appeared. (2.) We see the Apostle made use of the Law; and we may do the like. But what inferre we from the law? <hi>That the tithes belong to
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:66147:214"/>
Ministers under the Gospel.</hi> And what saith he to this? <hi>Nothing can be hence col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but that as the priests under the Law had their assigned aliment, so ministers now should have. The comparison should not be so far extended, as to say, that Ministers should only have the same,</hi> that is, nothing but the tithes. As for <hi>Ans.</hi> I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly grant, that if there be any who thus argue their ground is not good; and who they are, that plead for the tithes, as the only way of maintaining the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie, I would faine know of him. He knoweth, sure, that this is not the only way in <hi>Scotland.</hi> If the Ministers have <hi>a quota</hi> allowed, proportionable to what the Priests and Levites had; I suppose, many will be satisfied; and I am sure, this will be a far greater allowance, then he will willingly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend unto. The Ministers of old had more than the tithes; they had many gifts, much of the sacrifices, many whole Cities, fourtie eight in number, with their suburbs. But to make short with him, I shall not plead for the tithes, as the only necessary way; Let there be a competent honorary granted, whether in lieu of the tithes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or otherwise, I am satisfied; yet where tithes are setled by Law, as the way, I see not, what he or any can say against it, His following reasons conclude not this to be simply unlawful, and therefore I let them passe; for I do not plead for it, as only necessary.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But even, as to the aliment, he sayes <hi>Pag.</hi> 211. that <hi>if the people will not willingly give, Ministers must not receive it, nor compel the people to give it. Ans.</hi> I confess, if the people will not give it, it can hardly be received? but if people may not be compelled to give it; how shall Ministers live? How shall their necessities be supplied? How is it the Labourers hire and wages? But he proveth it from <hi>Mat.</hi> 10:8.—<hi>freely you have received, freely give</hi>: and addeth <hi>yet it was free for them, to take meat and drink from such, as willingly gave it. Answ.</hi> But how could they take so much, as that, if that sentence be applied to the necessary aliment? It is not said, freely give to all, that will give you nothing; but not to all, who will give; you must not give them freely, but take from them. So that this reason destroyeth it self But the true meaning of the words is, you have received freely the extraordinary gifts of healing the sick, of cleansing the lepers, of raising the dead, and of casting out of devils; freely use these gifts: and who would have ministers selling to the greatest offerers their paines, in ordinary ministerial imployments, which yet hath coste them paines and study? No, that were the hight of baseness; they should freely serve their Master in the Gospel, with a free and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous minde; yet this taketh not away their aliment or honorary, which Christ ensured to these 70. Disciples, for that short work. They should live of the Gospel, as we have seen; and if people be that unjust and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, as not to give, when able, what the Lawes of the land allow and have setled, as an honorary; justice should compel them; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r the labourer should have his wages: and this comporteth well with a free giving in the Minister, otherwise Christ had not joyned them together, in the same discourse. If this <hi>Quaker</hi> cannot see a consistency betwixt these two? he must either profess his owne ignorance, or blame Christ. He addeth. <hi>Hence it is clear, that Ministers may seek nothing. Ans.</hi> Might not the disciples have sought a cup of cold water?
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:66147:215"/>
Sure; Christ did as much, as all that himself <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.7: But sayes he, <hi>They may seek nothing by violence or compulsion. Ans.</hi> Faire Law and justice is neither violence, nor compulsion. <hi>They may not covenant before hand, how much they must have by year. Ans.</hi> True; and he may know, that our Church lawes account such deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Simony. As for <hi>Arnoldus's</hi> answere, which our <hi>Quaker</hi> confirmeth with an oath, saying <hi>ex animo,</hi> or speaketh bad latine, I leave it to <hi>Arnoldus</hi> to vindicat. His saying <hi>Pag.</hi> 212. §. 29. <hi>that the passages of Scripture here adduced, are of the same nature with such, as presse bounty to the poor</hi>: Is convicted of falshood, by what was said upon these places. But he addeth, <hi>Albeit Christians be bound to give out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things to Ministers, yet there can no determination be made of the quantity, without the consent of the giver. Ans.</hi> This maketh against him; for when the owners of the land did willingly allote the tithes to Ministers, as their honorary, the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the quantity, was made with their consent; &amp; what is thus determined should stand; and cannot be diminished, but by fraud and iniquity: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, that the present possessours of the Land have power to make a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; for, beside that that were sacrilege, in devouring sacred things, once devouted to pious uses; it were the hight of injustice: for when they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased that Land, they payed nothing for the tithes, but made their purchase <hi>cum hoc onere</hi> as is done in all purchases of Land, burdened with any publick thing. He is mistaken, when he saith, that <hi>there can no more any limitation be made here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then in acts of bounty and hospitality</hi>; for the Scripture told us, that this is the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hire; and reward, and no gratuity. His following objection is none of mine; and therefore I may let the answere passe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He tels us that <hi>Paul did prohibite this unto the Elders of Ephesus Act.</hi> 20: <hi>v.</hi> 33, 35. <hi>Answ.</hi> No such matter appeareth there. He saith ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e allow his Brethren, to take so much as a bit of bread from any? Why did Christ allow his 70. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to take bread and drink both? Did <hi>Paul</hi> thus every where? He took more then bread from the Church of <hi>Philippi Phil.</hi> 4:10, 15, 16. Nay he tels the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: <hi>v.</hi> 8. That <hi>he robbed other Churches, taking wages of them.</hi> Had he done so every where, and to every Church, he had hardly freed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the imputation of avarice. He saith next <hi>vers.</hi> 35. <hi>I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring, ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Iesus, how he said, it is more blessed to give, then to receive</hi> Hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is clear, that the Apostle willed these Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to follow his example, in supporting the weak, and in giving no offence unto them; for the word properly signifieth, an holding up with the hand such as otherwise would fall through weakness; and so, if the case fell so out with them, as it did with himself, in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9:15. 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 11:10. that before they stumble the weak, and hinder the course of the Gospel, they should rather work

with their owne hands, than be burdensome to any: And I shall willingly say the same of every Minister of the Gospel, that is placed in the like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: But this will say nothing against the Equity and Justice of an honorary, as we have seen <hi>Paul</hi> proving at large; nor against a Minister seeking his due by Law, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> what is established upon him by Law, when thereby he shall give no just ground of offence, or stumbling. And it is observable that these who lay at a catch to have some thing to say against <hi>Paul,</hi> for taking maintainance, were very like our <hi>Quakers,</hi> pretending to be Apostles, and yet were but transformed after the manner of Satan their Master, and were deceitful workers, whose end should be according to their works, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15. And as for these words of Christ, <hi>it is more blessed to give, than to receive,</hi> they held true of the Ministers under the Law, yet they had their set salary, and might seek it. It holdeth true also in all Christians; and yet notwithstanding thereof, the workman hath right to his wages, and may seek it; and a person may justly crave his debt. But this is indeed a noble argument to disswade from avarice, and to presse to bountifulness.</p>
               <p n="11">11. He sayes <hi>Pag.</hi> 213. §. 30. <hi>That a limited and forced maintenance maketh the Ministers of Christ like these mercenaries, that the Prophets so often reproved. Answ.</hi> I should rather think the contrary; But let us hear his reason. <hi>If one</hi> (saith he) <hi>be hired to preach to such or such a people, for so much yeerly, so that he would not preach without it, it is clear that he should then preach for a reward, &amp;c.</hi> This may be all granted, for it toucheth not the question: Our Ministers are not hired for so much yeerly: they must preach, whether they get their aliment, or not: If any be so mercenary, that he will not preach, without so much as he can bargan for, either for longer or shorter time, I will not defend the practice; but a setled maintenance by Law preventeth all this. And we have seen, how many of the Lord's worthies preach, and have preached withall readiness of minde, though they have had nothing of that setled maintainance, now for several yeers.</p>
               <p n="12">12. He cometh afterward to speak of <hi>Superfluous maintainance</hi>; And I shall not much speak for it: Only I think his description of it is too faulty, when he calleth that Superfluous, <hi>which is more then is necessary</hi>: that is, is more then food and raiment; for he citeth 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6:7, 8, 9, 10. as the only confirmation of this: And yet this place is impertinent; for it is not meaned of Ministers only, but is applicable to all. And I suppose <hi>Quakers</hi> have something more them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, than food and rayment: Report wrongeth them, if the most part of them be not richer then ordinary: However I do not envy their riches, but wish it be all lawfully gained: And I finde not the Apostle in that place simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning riches, but <hi>a will be rich,</hi> and <hi>a love of money,</hi> and <hi>a coveting of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. What he saith §. 31. of the excessive rents and revenues of Bishops, both Popish and Protestant, I meddle not with. I plead only for a competent hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, as due to all, that labour in the Lords vineyard. As for the objection; which thereafter he starteth, I desiderate ingenuity in it. He should not have said <hi>Christians,</hi> in general, or indefinitely (for these times have given proof of the liberality of many, in supplying richly the wants of Christs necessitous servants &amp;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:66147:216"/>
Sufferers, which is on record in heaven.) But at most, Some members of the visible Church are <hi>so hard, that if Ministers had not a certain and fixed maintainance, they should die for hunger</hi>: That is, if the Lord did not otherwayes provide for them; What answereth he to this? <hi>This saith something for the carnal Ministrie, consisting of natural men, who have no life, nor power; and so must have such a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance: but it saith nothing for them, who are called of God and sent; he sendeth none upon their owne charges, and who goe forth for him, in his power and authority, to turne people from darkness to light, such can confide in God, he will provide for them. Answ.</hi> This is one of the popular insinuations of our <hi>Quakers;</hi> but hath little in it either of Sense, or Reason: For (1.) <hi>Paul</hi> did not plead for a carnal Ministrie, when he reasoned for their maintainance; but for such, as were sent in the name of the Lord, and were to serve him in the Gospel of his Son, in turning people unto God. (2.) The Priests and Levites were called of God, to their work; and yet for all that, they had their fixed and setled maintainance. (3.) When Christ sent his 70. Disciples, he said, the labourer was worthy of his hire: And though Christ did provide for them; Yet that was by meanes of people: And he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed there would be some, who would not make them very welcome, for a testimony against whom, they were to shake the dust off their feet. (4.) Baals Priests, in the dayes of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> were very richly provided for, when the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful servants of God were put to great straites: shall we therefore say, that these Priests of Baal were the only called of God, sent forth in his Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and that the Servants of the Lord were but a carnal Ministrie? This were to argue carnally with belly arguments, as our <hi>Quakers</hi> do. (5.) Knoweth he not, that Idolatrous and Superstitious Priests are better cared for, after this manner, ordinarily, then the true and faithful servants of God? must they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be the only spiritual men? A noble argument for Heathens and Papists and the Turkish Muftees. What followeth is but a rabble of <hi>Quakerish</hi> and confused discourse, having neither head, nor taile; And his conclusion, for taking away all setled maintainance, because of the abuses, which he saith, (not telling when, nor where, nor by whom) some have committed in that mater, is like himself: and is as if one should have reasoned against all the setled maintainance of Ministers under the Law, because the Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> where chargeable with abuses therein: And this could have been said with more colour of reason, after our <hi>Quakers</hi> logick; for these abuses were certain and notoure; but our <hi>Quakers</hi> allaigances may be false; and though true, as to some circumstances; Yet, as to other circumstances, utterly impertinent. As for the summe of his discourse, upon this <hi>Thesis</hi> of the Ministry, which he layeth downe <hi>Pag.</hi> 218. &amp;c. §. 23. I need take no notice of it, the Falshood, Groundlesness, and Impertinency of these particulars, being already discovered, and his vanity made notoure un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XXII. Of the <hi>Quakers</hi> silent worshipe.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe summe of his <hi>Eleventh Thesis,</hi> which is concerning <hi>Worshipe,</hi> is <hi>That all acts of worshipe, must be performed, as to manner, duration, times and places, by inward Inspirations, and immediat Enthusiasmes, which are the only rule and principle thereof: And that all worshipe, that is otherwayes performed, is but will worshipe and abominable idolatry; which now, in the day of Christs Spiritual Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is to be rejected and separated from, howbeit, it hath pleased the Lord (who wincked at the times of ignorance, having respect to the simplicity and integrity of some, because of his owne innocent seed, buried in mens hearts, under the masse of superstition) to breath upon these, raise up an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> heare some groanes, for a little, untill the day should clear up</hi>] Whereby he would give us to understand, that Christs spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection was never till now; and that God never was worshiped aright, till the generation of <hi>Quakers</hi> arose; but hithertil Superstition and Idolatry hath raged, in all the Churches, no times, no places excepted, though God was pleased to breath upon some, here and there, raise up some groans in them, and hear them, (possibly he meaneth the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> or some such like <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> that History giveth us some account of) and to winck at the rest until now, because of his seed, that is in the heart of all Pagans, as well as Christians, and lay burried under the rubbish of Superstition and Idolatry. The maine thing, which according to what is held forth in the <hi>Thesis,</hi> we might expect to finde cleared, and confirmed in his <hi>Apology,</hi> is, the being acted and moved to, and in all acts of worship, by Immediat Inspirations and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastical motions of the Spirit; and the unlawfulness of entering upon Worshipe, at what time, in what place, and upon what occasion so ever, or continueing in it, without these Previous Physical, and Immediat Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Impulses, and Enthusiastical Motions: but we shall see some other things spoken to, and more insisted upon by him; and but little spoken to this, which mainly called for proof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. However, we must see what he says; &amp; leaving his preamble, wherein, according to his usual manner, he layeth an imputation on the Reformed Churches, as keeping still the root of false worshipe, when they cut off the branches of Romish worshipe: We shall consider what he sayes, for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Quakers</hi> way: <hi>first</hi> he tels us <hi>Pag.</hi> 222. §. 2. <hi>That he speaketh here of worship now under the Gospel, &amp; not as requisite, under the Law.</hi> Yet I suppose he is speaking of worshipe, as a moral duty, or in reference to what is moral or natural, which hath place in all ages of the Church; and of what is essentially and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily requisite to all moral worship: for he saith here expresly, that the ceremonies under the Law were not essential to true worshipe, nor necessary of themselves. I suppose also, he should speak of Institute Worshipe under the Gospel; but all that is by the <hi>Quakers</hi> rejected and denied; as we shall hear.
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:66147:217"/>
He tels us <hi>next</hi> §. 3. <hi>That they do not condemne all prescribed times and places for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe; for they have such.</hi> But may I not ask, whether they assemble, at these times, and in these places, by the Immediat Acting, Motion and Impulse of the Spirit, or not? It seemeth not; but when they are assembled, they must waite for these motions: But is not that a limiteing of the Spirit, as if he could not Act &amp; Move to publick worshipe, at other times, &amp; in other places? And is not the time of their abode together, at these several occasiones, limited also?</p>
               <p n="3">3. What do they then condemne? <hi>They condemne our having a Preacher to preach, excludeing others</hi>: But the lawfulness of this we evinced above. Next they are not satisfied, that <hi>these ministers come not to meet with the Lord.</hi> Neither am I. <hi>and attend not unto his inward motions and operations.</hi> Nor am I satisfied with this. <hi>Nor pray not, preach not, as the Spirit moveth and breatheth in them, and giveth ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance.</hi> What if I say, that I am not satisfied with this either, more then they? But the mystery of the business is; They acknowledge no Motion or inward Breathing of the Spirit, but what is Extraordinary and meerly Enthusiastick, without all previous study or preparation, and abstract from all meanes; as if the Lord could not move and operate, in and by the meanes, and could not help a minister, who had studied his sermon, by his breathing and inward assistance, to preach the Gospel, and give utterance and helpe to the carrying on of the work to edification. This is to oppose the Spirit of God and his motions, to all meanes of his owne appointment; condemneth all study and meditation on the Scriptures; taketh away all paines and laboure for abilities; and putteth men upon a sure way of tempting of God, and of inviteing the devil to deceive and delude, as was shown above.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That nothing may be wanting to compleat their Systeme of errour, they proclame all dayes alike, and so reject the Lords day, our Christian Sabbath; concerning which, if this man have any minde to dispute on that head, I will wait his Answer, to what I have said on it elsewhere. What he saith <hi>Pag.</hi> 225. §. 5. of their charitie towards many living in Popery, is no very great business, seing he will grant as much to Pagans, notwithstanding of their palpable and manifest Idolatry and Heathenisme: But why will he not give us charity too?</p>
               <p n="5">5. He cometh more home to the business <hi>Pag.</hi> 226. §. 6. and tels us, that <hi>when they assemble, every ones work is, to attend on God, to goe out of their own thoughts, and imaginations, or rather to thrust these away, to feel Gods presence, and in his name to acknowledge that assembly, where He is in the midst, according to his promise: And where every one is thus assembled in Spirit, as well, as in body, the secret power and vertue of life is known to refresh the soul, and they feel pure motions and breathings of the Spirit of God flowing, from which issue words of declaration, prayer and praise, and thus acceptable worshipe is performed, by which the Church is edified, and God is pleased,—yea though not one word be spoken or heard outwardly, yet true spiritual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Answ.</hi> This is a short account of their manner of worship, which, in his following discourse, he largely laboureth to explicat and vindicate. I shall only propose these few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions against it. (1.) Spiritual worshipe, which only is acceptable with God, who is a Spirit, and will be worshiped in spirit and truth, being a
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:66147:217"/>
matter of no small difficulty, for sinners to get performed aright, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire some preparation before hand, that the heart might be put in some frame for such an high and noble work, being made sensible of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from, and unsuteableness for approching unto such an holy and spiritual God, and of the necessity of some impression of that divine Majesty with whom they have to do, and of divine help for the right discharge of that duty: now I finde no mention made by them of any such thing, or of the necessity of wrestling with God in private for a right frame of Spirit, in going about that work, and for the assistence of his grace and Spirit, in the discharge of it, and for his blessing upon it. It seemeth their heart is alway in a like good frame, and they are alwayes in case for this solemne addresse unto God; or they come together, to get preparation and all, from the inward motions, without which nothing must de done. (2.) When the members of the Church are assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and publick worshipe to beginne, Nature it self would teach, that there should be a solemne address made unto God by Prayer, acknowledging their unworthiness of such an honour and favour; their unfitness for such a solemne work; their necessity of his divine help and assistance therein, and his blessing thereupon, that He may be glorified, and they edified: but here no such thing appeareth; no invocating of the great God, no supplication made to him, no prostrating of themselves in prayer before him, at the entry of their work: can this then be accounted an assembling for the solemne Adoration, Worshiping and Invocation of God? (3.) No word is there here, in all their Assemblies, of the Scriptures, as the Law of God, which should be read, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, and applyed for the Instruction, Reproof, Consolation and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the people: No, as the Scriptures are no rule to them, in their walk, so nor are they any rule to them in their worship: as their worship is not grounded upon the Scriptures, So nor have the Scriptures any place, in their worshipe, contrare to the practice of Christ and his Apostles <hi>Luk</hi> 4: <hi>vers.</hi> 16.—21. <hi>Act.</hi> 17:2, 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8: <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 25, 35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9: <hi>vers.</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10:43. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13:5, 15, 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18:28. (4.) Though there be no approaching now for sinners unto God, but in and through a Mediator, and all our service, and worshipe must be performed in him, &amp; through him <hi>Col.</hi> 3:17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2:18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14:6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2:5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14:13, 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2:5. Yet I hear nothing of Jesus Christ, in all their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe: It can therefore be no Gospel Worshipe, which they goe about; for as all that, must be in the name of Jesus, the Mediator, as having his warrand, so it must be offered to the Lord through him. Hence (5:) all their Solemne Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe is nothing else, then may be gone about by Pagans and Heathens, that never heard of Christ: for there is no Gospel Worshipe, no Gospel Duty, no Gospel Ordinance to be found in all their most solemne service, neither Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor Prayer, nor Praise, nor Administration of sacraments, nor any Duty instituted in the Gospel. (6.) Nay, in this they seem to come short of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly devotion, that is exercised by some Heathens, who have their Priests &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Officers, to carry on their worshipe with a piece of order and solemnity; But they know no such thing, their worshipe, we see, is carryed on without the orderly leading and foregoing of any Person, peculiarly designed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:66147:218"/>
unto. (7.) They speak of going out from their owne thoughts, or of expelling them; and it is convenient and ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>essary, I confess, that all carnal and worldly thoughts be laid aside, when we are to approach unto the great and living God; for our minds ought then wholly to be abstracted from all Impediments, and taken up alone with God: But how comprehensive their own thoughts may be, I know not, and whether he may not meane a laying aside of all use of Reason and Humanity, that so they may be fitter receptacles of the In workings of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and of the Impressions of his delusions: we may possibly heare something hereafter, which may give ground for this supposal. (8.) He tels us, that when t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ey are thus conveened, they meet with a secret vertue and power of life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing their souls &amp;c. But is this common and ordinary to them all? and is it so at all times? Then they are all, and that alwayes, while about the worshipe of God, in a good frame; and the Spirit, who bloweth where and when he listeth, never withdraweth from them; but is alwayes present, in Love and in Power; But what is this Life that hath such Power and Vertue? If we call to minde the principles of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> formerly considered and examined, we will finde, that it is not the true and real Grace of God, bestowed upon them, through Jesus Christ; and wrought in them by his Spirit; but the mere Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Product of nature: and therefore all the refreshing of soul, that they feel thereby, must be but Natural and Carnal, how sensible so ever it may be. (9.) He talks of Motions &amp; Respirations of the Spirit of God, which flow forth: but whence flow they? From their owne Spirits; or from that refreshing of soul, or from the power and vertue of that life, he spoke of? But the chiefe thing I would have noticed here, is, How shall we know, or how do they know, that these Motions and Breathings, are the motions and breathings of the Spirit of God? The reason of the enquiry is, because they have laid aside the Scripture, the only sure teste for tryal of Spirits, and of the motions of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and not only so, but they are now gone out of themselves, and are no more Men, having laid aside Humanity &amp; all the Cogitations &amp; Imaginations of Men: How shall they, how can they, or any other, know whether these motions be motions of the Spirit of God, or of the Spirit of darkness? Cannot Satan play his game in persons thus prepared for, and laid open unto his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and insinuations? Hath he not thus wrought in many, who thus gave up themselves unto his Power and Delusions? (10.) when these, who are thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and moved, by a Spirit (blake or white) utter words of declaration, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or praise; how shall it be known, that these words are words of truth and righteousness? It seemeth all is good coine that cometh that way, and no doubt is to be made thereof; no examination or tryal is to be made, all is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by an implicite faith: and sure, if these Declarations, Prayer &amp; Praises be suteable to, and corresponding with their Doctrine and Principles, we have ground to think, that they are such: as no Christian can with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science receive, or joyn with: and though he think, that what is so spoken, is delivered in the evidence and demonstration of the Spirit and of power; yet if we judge by the Scriptures of truth, we must say, that it is rather in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; demonstration of the Devil. (11.) When one is so moved and speaketh,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:66147:218"/>
what do the rest? Must they attend thereunto, and joyn there with? But what if they be, at that very instant, prompted by what is within them, to utter words of declaration, prayer or praise? (and this is not impossible) must they all speak together? where is then order and edification? or must they be silent, and listen to what the other speaketh, till he have done? How will he salve this from a limiting of the Spirit? But next can the rest hearken and joyne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an inward motion thereunto? If so, then that part of worshipe is performed by them, without the previous inward motion of the Spirit. Or must the rest waite for their proper and particular motions? then there is no publick worshipe performed by the Assembly. (12.) But, as to that mumry and dumb service, when nothing is uttered, how can that be call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d a Publick Worshipe of God? what publick worshipe is there and then performed by the Assembly? and where doth he read of any such Publick Worshipe performed unto God, in all the Old, or New Testam? How differeth this from the dumb service of some Heathens, performed to their Idols? And what mutual edification is there had hereby? He tels us, it is true, that even then, <hi>their souls are exceedingly satiated.</hi> But where with, or whereby? Not by any publick exhortation, prayer or praises; for there are none; &amp; that which is not cannot edifie. He tels us also, that <hi>their hearts are wonderfully replenished with the secret sense of the divine power and Spirit.</hi> But how is this brought about? <hi>This power</hi> (sayes he) <hi>is transmitted without words from vessel to vessel.</hi> Sure this is no usual way of the Lord's working: and why should he imagine, in this case, a transmission from vessel to vessel? Can not the Lord work immediatly upon every vessel? But thus, it seemeth, it must be, that it may be called at least, a joynt worshipe; for other wayes the Lord might worke immedatly upon them all, when asunder in their own particular houses.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But it were good, we heard more of this, that we may come to know it better: And he promiseth to speak to us of it from his own certain experience. Let us therefore listen. <hi>None can,</hi> sayes he, <hi>thus waite upon God, till he lay aside his owne will and wisdome, and be content wholly to be subjected unto God.</hi> This I should well approve of, were I sure, that it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re a real waiting upon God; &amp; not rather, a laying themselves open unto the Enthusiasmes of Satan. <hi>None at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to this,</hi> (sayes he,) <hi>or performeth it, but he that knoweth, that no outward thing, no ceremonies, no words, not the best words, nay nor the words of Scripture, can satisfie their weary and languishing souls; for, though these be all present, the power life and vertue, that maketh them effectual, can be away. Answ</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is like he hath learned this out of the popish books, stiled <hi>Theologia Germanica</hi> and the <hi>Bright Star,</hi> commended to us by <hi>Randal,</hi> a <hi>Familist.</hi> But though those outward things cannot do it alone; Yet he is not waiting upon God aright, who layeth these outward things, appointed of God for this end, aside; as they do: As God will be worshiped, so will he be waited upon, in the way he hath prescribed, and no other. <hi>They must be,</hi> sayes he, <hi>abstracted from all external things; and be silent before God, and turne within unto the inward principle within them, as unto the most excellent doctor. Answ.</hi> This is plaine: And so I see, that all their wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God, is to renunce all his Appointments, and betake themselves wholly unto the blinde guide of Natural Light, which is within every man; and this is
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:66147:219"/>
their God, and most excellent Doctor; And that the Devil may have a fairer opportunity to work upon their phancies, and plye the darkened Light within, they must become no Christians, renuncing all the outward meanes; and no Men, renuncing the use of Reason and Humanity. What will this excellent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of theirs teach? He <hi>will teach them,</hi> saith he, <hi>to attend upon God, in the measure of life and grace received, and so to cease from their owne words and acts, in their natural will and comprehension, and to feel this inward seed of life, that thereby they might be moved, or acted whether to pray, preach, or sing. Ans.</hi> That is, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the most excellent Teacher, seconded with Satans Operations, teacheth them to attend upon, in the strength of Nature, and according to the measure of that Light (rather Darkness,) and to feel what this Natural thing, or worse, working on the fancie, will prompt them to do: So that this can be nothing else but Heathenish, or Pagan-worshipe, taught and regulated by silly Nature, made alittle active by a strong Phancy, together with the concurrence of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of delusion, blinding the very eyes of Nature, and stirring up to utter this, or that, false or true, as the rarified braine, and tickled phancy is first inclined unto: And till this be, they sit mute as so many stones: and this is the ground of their silent sitting so long, as he saith himself: What judgment to passe upon this Worshipe, so Founded, so Regulated, so Principled, so Carryed-on, &amp; Issued, the Christian Reader needeth not long deliberate.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When one is thus moved to speak, what cometh of the rest, who are yet busie entering within themselves and consulting their Demon, their Teacher and Bible? <hi>The life,</hi> sayes he, <hi>the riseing whereof some do thus perceive and possesse, as it prevaileth in every one, so as afloud of refreshment, it runneth over the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation—for Gods name is one in all, and his glory breaketh out and floweth forth, and covereth all, and such a reverence and veneration possesseth all, that if the natural part should arise in any, or mans wisdom, or any thing, that is not one with this life,</hi> it <hi>would presently be depressed and condemned.</hi> This is indeed wonderful and strange, that the various degrees of Natural Power and Light should be screwed up to such an exact harmony, that in all the Congregation there should not be one jarring sound: but who would not suspect the hand of some cunning artist, tuneing all these strings, to his owne advantage? We cannot suppose this to be the work of the Spirit of God, thus constantly making life break-in &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the whole Congregation, upon the riseings thereof in some one particular person, or other; for there is no promise of any such thing; and we have no example or instance of any such dispensation: And beside it is manifest enough, that the Natural part predomineth here, and that which hath no affinity with, but is opposite unto, the kindly workings of the Spirit of life: Their doctrine, and af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8. But you may say, This cannot be, for he addeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 228. <hi>The forme of this Worshipe is so naked and devoide of all external and worldly glory, that it cutteth of all occasion, whereby mans wisdome should be excercised: and superstition and Idolatry have no place. Answ.</hi> Its being naked, as to all external and worldly glory, is not my quarrel against it, but that it shutteth out all the Ordinances and Institut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of Christ. And though all external pompe be away; yet Carnal Wisdome
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:66147:219"/>
hath a faire occasion to worke, when the prime and only rise of all this devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Nature; and all the conduct thereof is by Nature; save where it is spirited and principled by a superiour malignant ghost. We know, there is Inward Superstition and Idolatry, as well as Outward: and here I can see nothing but the Superstitious and Idolatrous excercise of the carnal heart, doteing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon, adoreing and worshiping a natural created thing within, which, at best, is not God, but the Light and Power of a Natural Conscience, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Spirit of errour and delusion, the Spirit that worketh in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of disobedience. What else can this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is not this, at best, to make that light, or whatever name he will give it, our Idol or Image, in the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God? He tels us next, that <hi>they get hereby such washing and nourishment, that they have no use for baptisme, or the Lords supper.</hi> Which is a plaine and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonstration, that their way of worshipe hath no correspondence with that, which was in use, in the primitive times, and hath been in use in the Church, ever since, and was instituted by Christ; but is meerly Paganish.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Yet to perswade us, that this is all the work of divine power: he tels us, <hi>That if it happen at any time, that one enter among them, who is not vigilant, nor entered within himself, with the rest, he is no sooner entered, then that power, if it be a little raised in the meeting, layeth hold upon him, and begetteth in him the sense of this vertue, to the softning and warming of his heart; just as fire will warme a man, and burne combustible mater, that is neare. Answ.</hi> Here is a further confirmation of the power of that deluding Spirit, that acteth in their meetings: But how is it known, that that person was not entred within himself? Doth this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversion cause such an alteration on the body, that all on lookers may see it? Why might not this Power, if it were indeed a divine power, work this effect, howbeit it were not as yet alittle raised in the meeting? What are the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this softning and warming of heart? Are they only a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in their errours and delusions? We see no ground then to think, that all this is of the Spirit of God. And it is known, how easy it is for the Devil to play the Ape, and transforme himself, as to the manner of his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, into an Angel of Light, that he may deceive poor souls, that foolishly give up themselves to be led and acted by him. All which is sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by what he addeth; <hi>yea,</hi> sayes he, <hi>if it happen, that many of these that are assembled wander in their mindes, and be turned out from the measure of grace, and wander in their imaginations, one, in whom the life is raised. shall feel labour for the rest, by co-suffering with the seed, that is oppressed in them; and if he abide attending upon the Light, and persisting in the divine work, the Lord oft times heareth that secret labour, and the secret breathings of his owne seed by such an one, so that the rest may finde themselve secretly pricked, albeit there be no words spoken; and hereby that one is as a midwife unto the rest, to produce life in them, by the secret labour of his owne soul,</hi> Who seeth not hereby the strength and power of Satan, working in the souls and imaginations of Men, given up to strong delusion? Who ever heard of such Operations among men, not under the power of the Devil? The midwife here must have
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:66147:220"/>
the child-birth paines. Nay more he telleth us, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t if all the meeting be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the life</hi> (pardon these termes, for they are his owne, as near as I can translate them; an uncouth Religion must be set forth to us in uncouth and unintelligible termes, which the Spirit of God never taught us) <hi>and the life be a little raised, though not one word be spoken, but all be silent, yet a stranger, come to gaze, it may be, or to mock, is so terrified, that he cannot resist, but the power of darkness is depressed by this power and vertue; which, if his day of visitation be not gone, will penetrate into the measure of grace within him, and raise it up to the redeeming of his soul.</hi> That is, maketh him convert after their manner, <hi>viz.</hi> without the Spirit of God infuseing the seed and habite of grace, and turning him from darkness to light by a new creation. But whence can this wonderful change come? It is when, and not before, the whole meeting is introverted, and all of them are now formally under the terrible Power and Movings of the Devil, which causeth such a change on their countenances, and such shakeings in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as we shall heare, that on-lookers cannot but be affrighted: and the Lord may, in his righteous judgment, for a further judicial upgiving of them unto a reprobate minde; and for a punishment of such, as out of a sinful cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity, and without a call, did cast themselves within the reach of a rageing Devil, suffer some such curious spectators to be carried away with the same Spirit of delusion; whereof this man is a manifest instance, as himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth in the following words. But withal it is remarkable by what he saith, that if a person be not thus changed, at the first sight of them, in this condition, his day is gone, and it is impossible he can be saved, should he be present an hundered times thereafter.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If we enquire at him, whence their quakeing and shakeing of body cometh, which is the ground of their being called <hi>Quakers.</hi> He tels us P. 230. §. S. <hi>That when the minde is introverted, and looking for the apparition of the Life</hi> (this is no other, then their waiting for the operation of the devil) <hi>and the power of darkness is resisting in the soul</hi> (whereby you may judge of their perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) <hi>then the good seed</hi> (this is either blake nature, or worse) <hi>riseth up, and is felt working like medicine; and by these contrary workings, there is a strugling felt in the soul, as really in the mysterie, as Rebecca found the striveing of the twines in her womb; and such a travail and labour in the soul that the outward man is affected, and the body wonderfully agitated, many sighs and groanes sent forth, yea the very paines of a woman in travail is felt: And this cometh not only upon one, but sometimes upon many, yea upon all,</hi> Which may further confirme any sober Christian, that there is at least much of the work of the Devil here, these being the very passions of the old <hi>Phythonicks</hi>; and the Devil dealing with them, much after the same manner, as he dealth with the Old Pagan Prophets and Priests. Where read we of the Lords exerciseing thus his people, in all the New Testament, who were meeting about his solemne worshipe. All this strugling can be nothing, but the strugling of contrare humores in the body, if it be not more immediatly, by Satan, who useth to be a merciless Master even to such, as formally serve him; such a hater is he of mankinde, and such delight taketh he to afflict and torment even those, who pay him all homage and devotion, as hath been demonstrated,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:66147:220"/>
by many instances, in <hi>America,</hi> and other parts of the world: And this cannot but be looked upon, as a righteous judgment in God, giving them so up unto this cruel handling, who, wearying of the easy yoke of his Ordinances, and Institutions, shake all off at once, and so declare themselves to be no more Christians. We need not forget the Story of <hi>Gilpin,</hi> in the Town of <hi>Kendal,</hi> attested by the Magistrats thereof. Where read we, that the true Prophets of old, even in their Trances and Ecstasies, wherein their outward senses were bound, had such wild, anticque and unnatural motions of body, as these <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> sometimes have, who will foame, swell and froath at the mouth, like persons in an Epilepsie? Where read we of any such bodily shakeings, quakeings, tremblings, and that from any such cause, as is here given, in all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches, or in any orthodox Church since, meeting for the solemne worshipe of God? I do not say, that the deep exercises of the minde will have no influence on the body; but such have no resemblance or affinity with the <hi>Quakers</hi> unnatural and anticque motions, at their set times and solemnities, which are here spoken of. But I wonder whence this power of darkness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto them, to cause this inward battel, and occasion this quaking? we heard before that he said, they were freed from the body of death, and it was taken away, so that they were made free from the Suggestions and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan, and from actual sinning. See his <hi>Eight Thesis,</hi> and our <hi>Chap.</hi> XIV. of <hi>Perfection:</hi> or he must say, that the immaculate birth, he spoke of, is not yet produced in them; and consequently, that they are not yet Justified, nor Sanctified; and so not yet Church-members, according to his former doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: But seing he will not acknowledge this; But rather that they are the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and only Church of Christ, and are Justified and Sanctified, yea and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, whence, I say, can this power of darkness come, to oppose the workings of life, and that when they are most devote, turning-in unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to waite upon God, and upon the light; and never but then, when they are about this their solemne worshipe? (for we hear not much of their quakings, at other times:) or is there alwayes a battel, but they feel it not, till they be about this <hi>Introversion</hi>? And cometh this trembling alwayes, upon their retireing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? or if not, whence is it, that it cometh more at one time, that another? Is it from the greatness of the opposition made by the power of darkness, or from the greater sense thereof? or both? And whence doth the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come, more at one time, than at another? These things I would have cleared, if he thought fit. Againe, is there no striveing betwixt light and darkness, grace and corruption, flesh and the Spirit in any, beside them? <hi>If not</hi>; then all others must eitheir be all flesh, or all Spirit; and if this last, these must be more perfect, then they are: <hi>If yea,</hi> how cometh it, that that combate in others causeth not such trembling and quaking, as in them? Is it because corruption in them is more violent, then in others? then their perfection is less; Or is it because they are more sensible, and their life is more quick, &amp; their mindes more agitated, and their spirits more stirred? Yet I am sure there might be trembling and quaking of limbes and joynts, more or less, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to the opposition, or to the sense of it, in others: But the truth is,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:66147:221"/>
whatever he feigne, this trembling and quaking hath another cause, and may confirme all rational men, that their way is more of the Devil, than of God, let themselves think what they please.</p>
               <p n="11">11. We have now heard of all the parts of their solemne Worshipe. (1.)<hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> which is alwayes necessary, and beginneth the action. (2.)<hi>speaking, praying or singing,</hi> as is immediatly suggested: but this is not necessary: for it may be wanting, &amp; yet the whole solemne Worshipe be performed to edification; neither is their speaking, praying or singing such as is used in the Churches, as we will hear afterward. (3.) Their <hi>Trembling</hi> &amp; <hi>Quaking</hi>: &amp; though this, it may be, is not alwayes necessary, yet it is peculiar unto them. Let us hear how he explaineth, or confirmeth these: for, it may be, no other confutation will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. He saith §. 9. p. 23. That <hi>their worshipe doth not consist, in silence, as silence.</hi> Wherein then? <hi>but in an holy and humble dependance of soul on God; from which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily floweth silence, in the first place. Ans.</hi> Dependance on God is good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and is a part of inward worshipe; but we are here speaking of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and solemne worshipe; and this silence must make a necessary part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for he sayes afterward, <hi>we judge in the first place, that there is a necessity of si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, for some time, both for speaker and hearer</hi>: And he told us before, that this silence may be continued all the time, and not one word spoken, and yet the worshipe be solemne and edifying; and he saith the same immediatly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Must not this be a fruitless and unedifying silence to others, at least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent? But when he calleth it thus necessary, there must be some thing more in it, then we can at the first see or he, will think fit to acquant us with, as yet. What more? <hi>life</hi> (saith he <hi>Pag.</hi> 232.) <hi>might flow in every one, and be increased, so as words may also well be spoken, by the influence of life; and yet because it was imposed upon none necessarily, they might all for the time, rather choose to possesse God in quietness, Ans.</hi> What this life is, and what the flowings and increasings of it are, we have seen: But as to this Silence, we say, how cometh it, that such, in whom this life floweth, do not speak? Is not this a call sufficient? how then dar they sit and disobey this call? how dar they follow their owne choise? Or is it no call, &amp; that because a necessity was not imposed? why then saith he, that words might well be spoken by the influence of life? Might words be spoken without an inward impulse and call? no certainly, according to his principles. Where are we then?</p>
               <p n="12">12. He goeth about to prove this their silence §. 10. And for this end, he tels us, <hi>that to attend and waite upon God is a duty incumbent upon all, and is a part of Worshipe.</hi> And who denieth it? Yet he citeth a number of Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of none speak of such a waiting, as he hath before pointed forth unto us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with silence, in the publick Worshipe of God: for <hi>Ps.</hi> 27:14. speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of a waiting opposite to fainting, through unbeleef, or doubting to see the goodness and deliverance of God in the land of the living: <hi>Psal.</hi> 37:7, 34. speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of a waiting opposite to freting because of the prosperity of the wicked, and a freting to do evil; and so is a waiting for Gods pleading the oppressed mans cause; &amp; is accompanied with a keeping of Gods way <hi>v.</hi> 34. not his waiting, that layeth aside Gods way and Ordinances. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20:22. speaketh of a waiting opposite to recompensing of evil. <hi>Esai.</hi> 30:18. is meant of a waiting for God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He imagineth <hi>Pag.</hi> 235. that <hi>God is speaking in every man, as one man is quietly talking in the eare of another, or as a Master teaching his schooler, or a Prince is speaking to a person; and that therefore the natural man should not be so rude, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docile, as not to be silent and hearken, and retire from all the operations of his soul, that he may heare, and the good seed may rise in him.</hi> Ans. That is, the natural man, that he may hear and learne of God, must lay aside all his senses, inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, all his operations as a man, good and evil; and so fall into something like or rather deeper then a trance and ecstasie, that he may receive the visions of God; And till this be done, he can goe about no act of commanded Worshipe. Is not this a noble phancie? We are waiting for the proof of this: and how long shall we waite till we see it? Is this the meaning of all these passages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that spoke of <hi>waiting</hi> and <hi>watching</hi>: Is not this like <hi>Socrates</hi> his Demon, that attended him, and to which he must Introvert to hearken? What shall the renewed man do? Is not God as well talking thus in and to him? and must he not also retire from his Humane or Christian acts, and lay all aside, that he may hearken? Sure, it is not seemly even for a courtier, to be talking to his Prince, while his Prince is speaking to him: he should waite till his Prince had done. And so, because we may suppose that the Lord is alway speaking, the whole Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe shall be this silent hearkening, And indeed <hi>Pag.</hi> 236. he taketh-in with the rest of the actions, that must be laid by, <hi>Sense and Fear of sin; Thoughts of Death, Hell and Iudgment, thoughts of Glory, Prayers, and other Religious Exercises.</hi> Have we not then a clear delineation of this <hi>Quakeristick ecstasie;</hi> and of this silent Worshipe of theirs?

The man then must become no man, nay not an <hi>animal</hi>; he must not be a living wight, such an ecstasie must he give himself up unto. But I am yet to learne, if this be in mans owne power; or if the Prophets of old were so far master of themselves, as to fall into a trance or ecstasie, (to speak nothing of such an ecstasie as this is, which taketh away all the use of the intellect, and inward motions of soul,) when they pleased; And yet more, if this was called for at their hands alwayes, when they went to Worshipe God; or if this was their solemne worshipe, or a chiefe part thereof.

And that divine aireis it with which mans Spirit is fermented, and in which waiting he is accepted in the presence of God, and is fitted</hi> (this word I must supply, or his words have no sense) <hi>to stand in his presence, to hear his voice, and to observe the motions of his holy Spirit. Answ.</hi> But (1.) We have evinced above, that there is no seed plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God in all men, or purchased by Christ, that is a measure of saving grace and life. Nature, and its light and power, we grant to be in all; but this will never become a new birth. (2.) Then this work being the same with Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Sanctification, as we saw above, every man must fall into an ecsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and become no man, as to any operation, before he be converted. (3.) Then (and this is the maine thing here considerable:) Every <hi>Quaker,</hi> at every time he cometh to worshipe God solemnely, (it is of this he knoweth, that we are now speaking) must have this change wrought in him; for it is to this end, that he must retire within him self, and be abstracted from all his Operations, that he may be in case to worshipe: But then observe what will follow; <hi>Quakers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to worshipe, are unregenerated, without the holy birth; and as oft as they come to worshipe, they must be regenerated, and get this divine aire to ferment their spirits: But how agreeth this with the state of Perfection, he talked of, one degree whereof was; they were able not to sin; and the other, wherein they could not sin? I suppose man, even a <hi>Quaker,</hi> is in case to sin, &amp; cannot but sin, till he be regenerated. Where is this man now? I see, though persons dreaming see not the inconsistency and repugnancy of their dreames, persons awake will see, and smile at fancies, hanging together like ropes of sand.</p>

That we can waite upon God, in prayer &amp; preaching; <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>waiting rather denoteth a passive dependance, than any action. Answ.</hi> I confess his waiting is a very passive thing, and inconsistent with any action of Soul or Body; but we are waiting for proof of such a waiting, as he talks of. We know, Prayer and Preaching is one thing, and waiting on God by Faith, Patience and Hope, in these duties, is another thing; And if he think these inconsistent, he knoweth neither Religion, nor Scripture. <hi>To pray and preach</hi> (saith he) <hi>by the Spirit, presupposeth this silent waiting, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, leading unto these, might be felt. Answ.</hi> This is the thing, that is under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: How can the godly pray for the motions &amp; leadings of the Spirit, if they must first feel them and have them, before they pray for them? Or must they not pray that prayer at all? But the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ions of the Spirit they pray for, are not these they have, but others, fitting them for other duties, he will say. I <hi>answ.</hi> The saints even pray for the Spirit to teach them to pray. But he will say; They must have the motion of the Spirit for the first prayer, or it will not be accepted. <hi>Answ.</hi> They may have it, and yet not feel it; and so these motions are not their Rule, The Law of God is the Rule, and what is, not done in obedience to a
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:66147:223"/>
Command, is no Obedience; for obedience respecteth a command; And thus the <hi>Quakers</hi> destroy all Obedience. If they cannot Pray, nor Preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a previous impulse of the Spirit; how can they waite without such a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motion? Waiting, sure, is a commanded duty, as well as Prayer, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be performed without the Spirit, aright and acceptably, more then Prayer. And if they cannot waite without the previous motion of the Spirit, how shall they waite for that previous motion to wait? I see not how this man can loose this knot.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But he proveth, that <hi>this silence is a special and principal part of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe, and that necessarly</hi> (though he told us before <hi>Pag.</hi> 23<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Answ.</hi> But how proveth he, that that Watching is the silence and waiting, he speaketh of? That Watching is not a turning inward but a looking outward also, and a looking to all hands, from whence tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can come: It is a Watching joyned with Prayer, and a Christian Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy and Circumspection, taking in the lively exercise of all graces, and is accompanied with all Christian duties, as was cleared above, so far is it from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any affinity with his mute Mumry.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The more to enforce this Silence, he tels us <hi>Pag.</hi> 238 §. 12. <hi>that it hath this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, that nothing else hath,</hi> to wit, <hi>It is impossible for the devil to simulate it; and therefore no soul in this exercise can be deceived by him.</hi> This is wonderful if true: but how proveth he it; I would be afrayed, that when a Man hath laid aside not only his Senses outward and inward, but his very Rational Judgment, Intellect &amp; all that he hath as a man, or as a Christian, the Devil should then most play master; and I am not sure, but it is so with them. Let us therefore heare his reason. <hi>The devil can only work in and by a natural man.</hi> I had thought that he could also work in a Spiritual man, as in <hi>Peter,</hi> when the Lord said to him, <hi>get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde me Satan</hi>; or else he must say, that <hi>Peter</hi> was then but a carnal man: And what was the messenger of Satan, that buffeted <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. what more? <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore,</hi> saith he, <hi>where the natural man is silent, he</hi> (that is the Devil) <hi>must stand.</hi> But why must he stand off, when the natural man is silent? and how proveth he, that there is nothing of a natural man acting in this silence? <hi>When the soul</hi> (saith he) <hi>is come to this silence, and, as to its owne operations, brought, as it were, to noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then the devil is excluded.</hi> How is this confirmed? <hi>for he cannot endure the pure presence of God then ariseing and the clearness of his light,</hi> saith he. But we doubt; if the pure presence of God then arise, or such a light, as shall quite banish the Devil away. This is the maine thing to be confirmed; nay the sequel prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to us, that all this presence and light is but of the Devils owne making: &amp; how that shall banish him away, I know not? But moreover, though it were granted, that this were the pure presence of God, and a light, that the Devil could not stand before, but behoved to flee from seven wayes; yet he might stay until that light appeared; and according to this mans owne doctrine, this cannot be; until the seed get room to arise, and become an holy birth, and this is not alwayes at the beginning of this silence: but this silence may continue
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:66147:223"/>
a while, before this birth be, and so though the new bith will affright the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil away; yet he may stay while it is out a forming, and so may worke his work, and play his game, in the time of that silence. Himself granteth <hi>Pag.</hi> 232 that <hi>this may be, while there is but a silence as to words; but when they once introverte, &amp; receed from all things, then they are in a castle, and feel themselves to be without his reach.</hi> But this is the maine thing to be proved: and I am ready to think, that then they are most in his power; for when the strong man keepeth the house, all is in peace. Let them see to it then, that this their greatest security, be not their greatest bondage.</p>
               <p n="18">18 The next excellency of this silence, is, That it cannot be hindered, nor interrupted by the Devils malice, which he laboureth to clear §. 13. p, 239. <hi>for</hi> saith he, <hi>when we are scattered and separated, one from another, every one, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverteth to the measure of life within himself, keepeth a secret union and communion with the rest; which neither the devil nor any of his instruments can hinder. Ans.</hi> So can all true Christians have union with one another, in the Spirit, without this wilde introversion; and so this is no peculiar excellency of theirs: But yet sure, their publick worshipe is in so fair impeded and hindered, Againe he saith, <hi>Their worshipe cannot be interrupted, when assembled, even by outward molestations, which interrupt another worshipe.</hi> And what wonder, seing it is no worshipe, but a silente mutenesse; and a man may be mute in the midst of the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. But all the publick worshipe, that we read of in the N. T. was such, as could have been interrupted by wicked men. Such as are possessed with a dumb and deafe Devil, can hardly be made to speak, or be interrupted in their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: is this therefore the excellency of their Condition? He addeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 242. That <hi>as Christs kingdome is not of this world, neither is his worshipe; and so it needeth not the wisdom, glory, riches and splendor of this world.</hi> This is true; yet his solemne worshipe cannot be performed without visible and audible actions, which can also be impeded and interrupted by Satans and mens malice. <hi>It needeth not a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal arme to defend, protect and establish it:</hi> Yet the Lord hath promised that Kings should be the Churches nursing Fathers, and Queens her nursing mothers: And when <hi>Saul's</hi> persecution was at an end, it is said <hi>Act.</hi> 9:21. <hi>Then had the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches rest-and were edified, and were multiplied.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth, <hi>that suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, prayers and intercessions be made for kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peacable life, in all godliness and honesty</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2:1, 2. <hi>Quakers,</hi> need not do this, for they can enjoy all their publick worshipe, who will, who will not; for no man can hinder their silence: &amp; yet he compleaneth elsewhere of wrong done them, by such hinderances. <hi>The worshipe of Christ's followers,</hi> saith he, <hi>is Spiritual, defended by the Spirit; but carnal worshipe hath need of a carnal arme to defend it.</hi> Spritual worshipe doth not stand in need of a carnal arme to promove it, but only to hold off injuries of wicked men, interruptin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beside, that this argueing supposeth, that God gote no spiritual service under the Law, which is manifestly false; we desire him to prove, that spiritual worshipe is inconsistent with any outward action; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth only in silence; and that Christ meaneth no other <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. for all this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and this he undertook to prove: but instead thereof he confuteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; For he tels us, in the end of <hi>Pag.</hi> 343. <hi>that God now taketh the heart of every Christian to be his temple, and there instructeth, how he will be worshiped in some</hi> (N.

               <p n="20">20. He tels us <hi>Pag.</hi> 244. § 16. That this way of worshipe of theirs was of old practised by some, who therefore were called <hi>Mysticks</hi>; and he citeth some say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of papists: And though I finde nothing in the words by him cited, giving countenance to his opinion; yet I am apt to think, that his way oweth its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal more to the <hi>Monkes</hi> Cels, than to the Apostles and primitive Churches; and am ready to fear, that as it came from thence, so it may lead back thither againe. And though these mystick Monkes &amp; Friars had some ground to speak against the necessity of the Popish Observances, which were but inventions of Men; I can see no ground, why he and his fraternity should enveigh so much against the appointed Ordinances of Christ: And though they call themselves Witnesses for the Truth, and for God; yet it is manifest, that they are real witnesses for Errour and for Satan.</p>
               <p n="21">21. In the last place §. 17. <hi>Pag.</hi> 246. &amp;c. he cometh to answere some Objections The <hi>first</hi> is, That its a very unprofitable thing to do nothing, and that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be occupied in meditation &amp; good exercises. And this is very true. What answereth he? <hi>That is not unprofitable, which is absolutely necessary, before any duty be done acceptably.</hi> This is very true too; but he hath not yet proved his Silence to be such a necessary Antecedent. <hi>They must</hi> (saith he) <hi>have but carnal apprehensions of God, who think, men can please him by their proper operations; when we have showne, that the first progress unto pleasing of God consisteth, in ceasing from our owne imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:66147:224"/>
that we may suffer God's Spirit to work in us. Ans.</hi> we have seen all that he hath showne; and have seen for all that, no proof or demonstration of what he undertook to prove: That Introversion is an Action, Operation or Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man, though it be attended with a Real or Imaginary, Humane or Satanical Abstraction from all Operation or Imagination. The man, who thus introverts, is not passive, but active; else he should not be said, to introvert, but to be introverted: so that I wonder that this man did not so worde his noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they might not destroy themselves. <hi>We must first cease to do evil,</hi> saith he, <hi>before we do good:</hi> Yet ceasing to do evil is not without all action of the minde and will, otherwise one might be said to cease from evil, in order to a doing of good, when he sleepeth, or when he is bound hand and foot, and his mouth stopped, though the Devil be rageing in his Soul, Intellect Will, &amp; Affections.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The 2 <hi>Objection</hi> is. If this be all their worshipe, why have they set times and places of meeting; seing they might do all that at home, in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral houses? He answereth. <hi>It pleaseth the Lord, to make use of the outward senses of his people, while here, in communicating of spiritual life; and suteable means, as speaking, praying and praising.</hi> But all this is inconsistent with pure silence, which is often all their worshipe: and with them, Speaking, Praying and Praising a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e not so necessary. He addeth, <hi>God hath appointed Assemblies to preserve an outward visible testimony for his name.</hi> But there is no visible testimony given to his name, when the duties, which he hath appointed for that end, are not performed, nor the Ordinances observed. <hi>He maketh his life</hi> (saith he) <hi>to abound more unto his owne, when they meet together to waite upon Him. Answ.</hi> Well; but that is not by their simple seeing one anothers faces, which may be in the market place, and on the streets; but by faithful and conscientious observation of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and not by mute mumrie. What he saith of Assemblies from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18:20. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10:24. is true; but maketh nothing for their mute service, of which all the doubt remaineth.</p>
               <p n="23">23. The <hi>last Objection</hi> is, That this mute way of worshiping is not found in the Scriptures. And sure, if it be not prescribed, it must be will worshipe. He answereth. <hi>That they make not silence the only substance of their worshipe.</hi> Yet he confessed, that sometimes it is the whole of their worshipe: And though it be not the only substance of their worshipe; Yet if it be a substantial part, it must be instituted, and warranted by a word of Institution, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Mak.</hi> 7:6. <hi>Esa.</hi> 29:13. <hi>In the primitive times,</hi> sayes he, <hi>they prayed and preached by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And if so, what absurdity is it, if we suppose, that the Spirit did not sometimes move them to these outward acts, and that then they were silent. Ans.</hi> I read of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping in the Spirit <hi>Phil.</hi> 3:3. but of their praying and preaching by the Spirit. I read not: and though I will not much quarrel about the phrase, yet I think Scripture phrases are best: and I shall adde, that neither name nor thing is found in the Scripture, in the <hi>Quakers</hi> sense. If they did all in worshipe, by such previous immediat Impulses, as he dreameth of (which I doubt if ever he shall prove) it must necessarily indeed follow, that they were silent, when they had not such motions; or went on without them: But in this case, their silence was but a pure non-action; it was not a positive part of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe;
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:66147:225"/>
nor such a positive active silence or Introversion, as he phancieth. That men must be silent, when they speak not, nor imagine not, is very probable; but that the Silence of the primitive Church, was such a Silence, that not only was without words, but also without thoughts and all imaginations, will be hardly proved by him; And when that is proved, which I look upon as very improbable, he hath not proved his Conclusion; till he withall prove, that this silence was gone about, as a principal part of worshipe. How long time will he take to prove this? How much less shall he ever prove, that the positive part of his silence, I meane the <hi>Introversion,</hi> was observed as a necessary part of worshipe? He addeth, <hi>Act.</hi> 2:1. <hi>It is said, they were all in one place, and then it is added, suddenly the Spirit came; but we read not, that any were speaking at that time: And what absurdity, if we say, they were silent? Ans.</hi> It is not said, <hi>suddenly the Spirit came, but suddenly there came a noise</hi>; it is true, the Spirit came, in his glorious Effects: Read we, that they were all silent? Read we that they were all Introverted? Where is then his Institution, or Example for his Introversion? Though they had been silent, that will not say, that they did Introvert; nor will it say, that their silence was a principal part of their worshipe. The man I see must bring forth such proofs, as he hath.</p>
               <p n="24">24. He starteth <hi>Pag.</hi> 248. that Objection, That there is no instance of such a silent assembly, in all the Scriptures. To which he Answereth. <hi>That though this be not written, yet such an assembly might be lawful.</hi> But we are seeking a word of Institution, or an approven Instance of their silent worshipe: And he can give neither. But he thinketh that a proof by consequence from other duties pressed in Scripture will suffice; And it is well, that he will admit of Consequences, in this case. What is this Consequential proof? <hi>The Scripture,</hi> saith he, <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to assemble together.</hi> This is granted. What then? <hi>And forbids us, while assembled, to pray or preach, but as the Spirit moveth.</hi> Where is this said? why doth he not shew this, that we may consider it? we must take it on a <hi>Quakers</hi> word. What is his Conclusion? <hi>If being assembled we are not moved by the Spirit, it necessarily followeth that we must be silent.</hi> Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly this is probable; but it is nothing to the point, seing every silence is not an <hi>Introversion</hi>: but where is the Conclusion, That this Introverting silence is a principal part of worshipe? He must leave this, until the next occasion. Yet I must take notice, that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially (if he reason by consequences, he must give us leave to do the same) he here destroyeth all that he said above, upon the head of <hi>the Scriptures</hi>; for there he denied, that they were our Rule; and yet here, he placeth them for the only Rule of worshipe, and would faine seek footing for his way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe in them, were it but by a Consequence; while as, according to his principles, formerly laid downe, he had no more to say, both to this and the former Objection, then that they were not bound to seek after either Precept or example of their worshipe, in the Scriptures; and this had been a short cut. But instead of this, he is runneth thorow the Scriptures to seek for an instance, and he pitcheth upon some in the <hi>Old Test.</hi> forgeting what he said in the beginning of this debate about worshipe; to wit, That he was only
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:66147:225"/>
speaking here of divine worshipe now under the Gospel: And he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Instances of worshipe under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> will not be pertinent to prove this, though he should produce multitudes. Could he get no one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in all the <hi>N. Test.</hi>? what if I helpe him to one? See <hi>Act.</hi> 21:40.—<hi>Paul stood on the staires, and beckened with the hand unto the people: And when there was made a great silence, he speak unto them.</hi> Here is a Silence, and a Great Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and a Great Silence in an Assembly: But I confess this Instance will not helpe him; for neither was it worshipe; nor was there an Introversion here, nor had it on their part, any good issue; as we see <hi>Chap.</hi> 22:22, 23. And yet I think their silence is hardly so justifiable, as this was.

                  </gap> were prompted to speak, they spoke no more consonantly to truth? It would seem, that all the light of God, that shined to them, while thus seven dayes long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, did not dispel all their darkness, nor banish the Devil away wholly. But the text it self giveth the reason of their silence, to wit, <hi>for they saw, that his griefe was very great.</hi> He citeth next <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9:4 But most impertinently, for this was a silence, not for worshipe, but arising from astonishment, griefe, sorrow and heaviness, caused by the sin of the people: Here was no Introver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to seek after the light within; nor Abstraction from all thoughts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, for his heart was filled with sorrow, and thoughts of the grievousness of the sin. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 14:1. speaketh nothing of silence, nor <hi>Chap.</hi> 20:1. But of the peoples coming and sitting before him: and if he say, that dureing this time, they were Introverted, he must say <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The effects of which supernatural species, in actions of God, are Rapts, or Extasies, internal visions &amp;c.</hi> Our <hi>Quaker</hi> might have given us some such thing as a more likely ground of their quaking and trembling.

Trithemius, Bellar. de Script. Eccl. &amp; Blosius,</hi> wherein I found, without any narrow search, several expressions, shewing whence our <hi>Quakers</hi> have their rare things, of which I shall adduce some instances; not to mention the manner of his conversion, set down in the relation of his life, how, while he was sick, sad &amp; dejected, a voice came &amp; said to him, <hi>Be at peace and relye upon God, &amp; know that when he was in the world in Mans Nature, he cured all their souls whose bodies he cured</hi> (which may be doubted as to the nine Lepers, who did not return to give glory to God <hi>Luk.</hi> 17:17, 18.) at which he was transported out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and had no use of his senses or of reason for a time: Whereupon his friend, an old man, told him, that now he had felt the grace of God in truth; and was taught by the holy Ghost, had the Scripture in him, and could now understand it all, and reconcile all seeming contradictory places; and that one of his Sermons should now do more good, than an hundered formerly.

The Inward man, or the Soul, which must be exercised with inward devotion, earnest desires &amp;c.

               <p n="1">1. After his discourse, concerning their manner of Worshipe, this <hi>Quaker</hi> cometh to speak more particularly of some parts of worshipe; such as <hi>Preaching Praying</hi> &amp; <hi>Singing,</hi> against all which he hath something to say <hi>Pag.</hi> 248. &amp;c. §. 18. And he beginneth with <hi>Preaching,</hi> telling us, that as Papists &amp; Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants use it, it is after this manner: <hi>One taketh a certain place or verse of Scripture, and speaketh upon it, for an houre or longer, these things, which he had before studied or premeditated, and had set together either out of his owne proper invention, or from the writings or observations of others, and committed them to this memory</hi>: in opposition to this, he tels us, what their way is: thus, <hi>When the Saints assemble, and every one introverts to the gift and grace of God, in himself, he, who ministereth, should speak acted by that grace in himself, what the Spirit giveth unto him, not affecting wisdom and eloquence of words, but the demonstration and power of the Spirit, and that either by interpreting some place of Scripture, if so be the Spirit lead him to it, or otherwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, reproving, instructing, or by speaking out the sense of some Spiritual experience; all which are to be consonant to the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>riptures, though perhaps not relative to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar chapter, verse, or text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Having thus laid down the two different wayes, in such a manner, as he thought most advantagious for himself, he saith, <hi>Let us now examine and consider, which of these are most consonant to the precepts and practice of Christ, his Apostles and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, as recorded in the Scripture.</hi> Before we come to this tryal, I must tell him, That I am glade to hear him insinuating so much, as that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are our Rule in worshipe, and that, that very mode of worshipe must be chosen as the best, which agreeth most with the primitive way, laid down in the <hi>New. Test.</hi> Only I would entreat him to reconcile this with what he said on the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> One thing more I must tell him: If he can prove the very first step of his way; that is, the <hi>Introversion</hi> of all the members of the Assembly, unto the gift or grace of God, in themselves, to be consonant to either Precept or Practice, recorded in the N. T. I shall give up the whole cause, in this mater. We heard how straitened he was to finde an instance of this, towards the end of the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> when he did run as far back as to <hi>Iob's</hi> dayes, to seek one: but, as to the primitive Church, we must have patience, till he think of one; and for precept, he could give none, that came within a look of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is necessare before we proceed, that we take a view of the proposal he hath made of our way, and compare it with his; that a just estimate may be made. And (1.) The speaking from a word of Scripture maketh not the difference; for they do that themselves sometimes; as he saith here, though he said it not before. Nor is it unlawful, else I cannot think that the Spirit would prompt them to it, if that Spirit be the Spirit of God: And I finde that Christ spoke from a text, and so did <hi>Peter Act.</hi> 2. from a passage of <hi>Ioel.</hi> And to say, as he doth to
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:66147:230"/>
this <hi>Pag.</hi> 249. that they did not this without an immediat motion of Spirit, is but a confirmation of what I am now saying <hi>viz.</hi> that it is lawful. So then as to this, there can be no debate, nor difference. (2.) That ministers read and study, and make some use of their reading, in their sermons, can give no just ground of offence; seing we finde the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his sermon to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing use of what he had read out of one of their poets <hi>Act.</hi> 17:28. And we finde him pressing <hi>Timothy</hi> to study, and meditation, and that in order to preaching to, and profiteing others. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4:15. <hi>Meditate upon these things, give thy self wholly to them</hi> (this sure importeth earnest and diligent study, when the Apostle saith, that he should be <hi>in these things,</hi> as it were wholly exercised therein, and taken up therewith) <hi>that thy profiteing may appear to all.</hi> And in that same <hi>Chapt. vers.</hi> 13. he sayes, till I come, give attendance <hi>to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</hi> So that this reading was not for his owne private satisfaction, but in order to a fitting him better unto exhortation and doctrine.

Moreover among the qualifications, which <hi>Paul</hi> requireth in ordinary teachers, this is one 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:2. <hi>that he be apt to teach,</hi> so also 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2:24. And this is such an Aptitude, as must be tryed and known before hand; as well as the other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, mentioned in both these places: And so it saith, that such ministers should have gifts and abilities, acquired by reading and other meanes, whereby they might be fitted for this work of the ministry. This is plaine and manifest; but nothing of this kinde is requisite in our <hi>Quakers</hi> speakers, in order to their speaking. Yet more, <hi>Paul</hi> tels <hi>Titus Cap.</hi> 1:9. that the preacher must be one, <hi>that holdeth fast the faithful word, as he hath been taught</hi> (or as in the margine, <hi>in teaching,</hi> or <hi>which maketh for doctrine,</hi> that is, sitteth and qualifieth him for tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and edifying.

ineffectual: who receive with thankfulness, what he offereth and suggesteth, in the time of their preaching; and with singleness declare it unto their hearers: who often times being called to speak, without fore-thoughts, go in the strength of the Lord, not seeking to commend themselves as able or learned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. Let us therefore a little examine his way. He <hi>first</hi> would have all Study, all Meditation, all Prayer and wrestling with God in prayer (for this with us is a maine part of study &amp; preparation) laid aside; &amp; Ministers going to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as naked and void of all knowledg of spiritual matters, as if they had never heard of any such thing. <hi>Then</hi> being <hi>Tabulae rasae,</hi> they must introvert unto that Grace or Gift, which is in them, &amp; there receive their Call, their Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, their Preparation both in matter &amp; words, whether with a text or place of Scripture, whereupon to ground their discourse, or to explaine and clear up, or without any such passage; as that inward teacher will. <hi>Lastly,</hi> when they are thus called, and fitted by this thing within, then they speak in the Spirit, &amp; are acted by the Spirit. But now to canvass this (not mentioning that which was spoken to before; <hi>to wit,</hi> that by their way, all are alike preachers, and none must speak, but such as are thus acted by the Spirit; and all thus called and prompted may and must:) I shall propose these things to the Readers considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. (1.) This Gift and Grace within, is, as we saw above, no singular thing; it is common to all men and women breathing, to Turks and Pagans, as well as to Christian Ministers: And therefore can have no affinity with the Spiritual gifts, which Christ giveth unto his Church, and endueth his messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with all, that they may be enabled for the work of the ministry, and for building up of his house; nor hath it any affinity with the special and saving grace of God, which Christ hath purchased for and bestoweth upon his redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es: For neither of these are common to all the children of men, as the whole Scripture declareth: far less can it have any affinity with the Spirit of God, which Liveth, Abideth, and Worketh in the Justified, Adopted, and Sanctified children of God. It can therefore be nothing else, than the relic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of nature, the natural light, and natural Conscience, which God hath left in every man. So that all the qualifications, which the <hi>Quaker</hi> Preachers have and seek for, are but what a Pagan may have, that hath a Natural Conscience, and the Light of Common notions, concerning a God-head, and equity and right among men: This dim &amp; darkened, and now malignant, light is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine and Storehouse of all their Enduements and Qualifications: this is the sole fountaine and spring of all their furniture; sufficient, I am sure, for none, but for Pagan-Preachers. (2.) Their Introverting unto this, to consult this
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:66147:232"/>
Goddess, as the Pagans did turne-in to the Cels of <hi>Apollos,</hi> to receive the Oracles, hath a more diabolick aspect; for, what can it be that they would thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, after they have unmanned themselves; or laid aside all motions of Soul and Minde, (which is not natural, nor practicable without diabolick as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, if it be, as he saith) but some Spirit? And what Spirit can we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be in Pagans, and every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> before grace come and make a change, but the <hi>God of this world</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:4. the <hi>Prince of the power of the aire, the Spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience Ephes.</hi> 2:3. and that strong man, that keepeth the house? Is it not then manifest, that this introverting must be a real consulting with, or giving themselves up unto the instructions and directions of this Prince of darkness? If he say, that they are Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and so under the power and direction of the Spirit of God, <hi>I Answere,</hi> I have seen and considered what he saith upon this, and have found, that it is nothing but the operation of pure Nature, wrought by the strength of corrupt and wicked Nature, that is an enemy to the Gospel, and to all the wayes of God; and if this hath not been sufficiently evidenced above, the Reader is free to judge: And if nature, and this Prince of darkness, who hath now a soveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity over all the unrenewed Sones of <hi>Adam,</hi> can or will destroy the works of Satan and of Nature, and embrace the Gospel, and the Spirit of Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Gospel, let all, who understand and believe the Gospel, judge, (3.) This Spirit then, which acteth and mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is plaine and manifest: let them see to it. And let the Reader now judge, what for Preachers these are: and whether their Talkers, or our Preachers, be most acted, and led by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Though what is said may be sufficient, to obviat all that he can say, eith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for himself, or against us; yet for further satisfaction, let us state the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion thus. Whether Ministers, in their preaching, should act as Christians, &amp; goe about the work with an holy and Christian dependance by faith, in the use
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:66147:232"/>
of lawful and approved meanes, upon the Spirit of God, for Furniture and Assistance: or should waite for and expect immediat Impulses, for all they say and do, and never goe about this work, in whole, or in part, but when, and as, they are thus immediatly Excited, Prompted, Acted, Moved &amp; Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed by the Spirit; and speak nothing but what is thus immediatly and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, put into their mouth by the Spirit of God; or rather is spoken by the Spirit, useing them as meer organs. If the question be thus stated; though I know, the <hi>Quakers</hi> will arrogat this last way unto themselves, and assert this to be the only way, now called for; yet how far they are from it, is manifest from what is said: But as to the matter, I assert the <hi>first,</hi> and deny this <hi>last</hi> to be the way, which Christ hath appointed. My reasons are these (1.) This would render all previous Paines, Labour, Study and Reading even of the Scriptures, useless, as to the work of preaching, contrare to what is already said. (2.) <hi>Paul</hi> could not then have said, as he doth 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2: <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>And the things, that thou hast heard of me, among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</hi> For to what purpose should there be such care had, that sound doctrine be transmitted from one to another, and the same committed to faithful and trusty persons, who will faithfully preach and deliver the same to people; if all must be done and carryed on by the immediat Inspirations and Motions of the Spirit? (3.) Nor was there any ground, why the Apostle should say 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1:3, 4. <hi>As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus—that thou mightest charge some, that they teach no other doctrine, neither give heed to fables</hi> &amp;c. Because such as must act by the immediat impulses of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit can receive no charge from man; nor regulate themselves in their teaching ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. (4.) Nor could <hi>Paul</hi> say to <hi>Timothy</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4:6 <hi>if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Iesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith, and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained</hi>: For <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> might have replied, I cannot be stinted unto these doctrines, which you desire me to put the brethren in remembrance of; for I must speak as the Spirit speaketh in me, and must receive all that I speak, immediatly from the Spirit. And he might have said also, I cannot put others in remembrance of any thing; for they must do, as the Spirit acteth them. (5.)

Nor can such preachers, as may and must do nothing but as the immediat Impulses of the Spirit acte them, be rightly said <hi>to laboure in word and doctrine,</hi> that is, (as the word importeth) to labour painfully, till they be wearied, with much tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail and toyl, with strength and earnestness, as Rowers with oars, See <hi>Leigh's

But he addeth, <hi>And the natural wisdom and learning of man is exalted.</hi> This is his mistake, which he could see, if the beam were out of his eye. All their learning and wisdome is the pure product of Nature, if not worse; as we have oftentimes manifested; for it cometh not from the Spirit of God, neither mediatly, nor immediatly; but riseth out of the dung hill of nature, and is extracted thence by the natural strength of man; and all its works and effects, are like the cause and original, except where the Devil getteth in his finger, in a more immediat way. <hi>This is,</hi> sayes he, <hi>the chiefe and great cause, why preachings are so unfruitful.</hi> Poor man, knoweth he no better? Did not Christ and his Apostles preach to many, that were not converted thereby? Thinks he that the only cause, why our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are so unfruitful, is because we preach not by Inspiration? And are their preachments so fruitful? It may be too fruitful, but that is no proof to me, that they preach by the true Revelations and Inspirations of God; for I read, that when the Lord sends strong delusions, men will beleeve a lie.

And moreover they assert that, as necessarily antecedaneous unto the performance of this duty, which tendeth to the laying of it wholly aside, to wit, a waiting for the Impulses of the Spirit: hence they inveigh against Prayer, whether in private or in families, morning and evening, or other fit and convenient seasons; and will not fixedly seek a blessing from God, at receiving of meate, nor give God solemne thanks therefore; yea and in their Publick Worshipe, this hath no fixed place, but may be and oft is, quite laid aside; and alwayes, unless the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit come, with his Inspirations and Impulses, calling and prompting them thereunto.</p>

Ans.</hi> we acknowledge, that true Religion is principally seated in the heart; but while we are speaking of solemne worshipe, the Religion of the heart ought to appear in solemne exercises, prescribed by God: we owne no actions of Religion, as acceptable to God, which are produced without grace in the heart, or by the meer strength of nature. Prayer

being a duty called for, at all occasions and seasons, and in all exigences, we ought alwayes to be in a frame fit for offering up this service unto God, in the name of Jesus, and by the helpe and assistance of his Spirit, and especially in our solemne worshiping of God: as for what he addeth of <hi>certain and prescribed prayers,</hi> or formes of prayer; he knoweth they are not owned nor approven by all. But he saith, <hi>that we all agree in this, that the motions and inspirations of the Spirit of God, are not necessarily previous thereunto.</hi> Wherein he is either ignorantly or maliciously mistaken; for he might see, in our <hi>larger Catechisme,</hi> the 182. Question. <hi>How doth the Spirit help us to pray</hi>? answered thus; <hi>We not knowing what to pray for, as we ought, the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, by enabling us to understand both for whom, and what, and how prayer, is to be made; and by working and quickening in our hearts (although not in all persons, nor at all times, in the same measure) those apprehensions, and affections, and graces, which are requisite, for the right performance of that duty. Rom.</hi> 8:26, 27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 10:17. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12:10. And therefore, in the very description of <hi>prayer Quest.</hi> 178. the help of the Spirit is taken in. We owne, as absolutely necessary unto the right performance of this duty, the Influences of the Spirit of God, putting the heart in a frame for the work, stirring up, blowing upon, and enlivening his graces in the soul, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting his assistance in the carrying on and performance of it: But the Motions and Inspirations, which he pleadeth for, as the only ground and call to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which we do not owne, nor expect, are the extraordinary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Impulses of the Spirit, carrying the soul forth unto the duty; such as the Prophets had, when inspired to write Scripture, and to declare the minde of the Lord, in several cases. And as to this, I see no ground to assert, that even the Apostles, who had an extraordinary measure of the Spirit of grace and of supplication, and of the ordinary Influences and Assistances of the holy Ghost, in this duty, were thus alwayes called and carryed forth unto this duty of prayer, I meane, by these extraordinary Impulses, and physical Motions of the Spirit, which they could not withstand, but yeeld unto; or by these immediat Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations calling them to the discharge of this duty <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi>: What might be, and possibly was, at some certain times and occasions, I determine not; but that which I affirme is, that I see no ground to assert, that to all their acts of Preaching and Prayer, they had an immediat and extraordinary Revelation, Inspiration, and Impulse calling them forth, and setting them on to the duty <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi>; so as they never acted therein, upon the ground of a moral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or were pressed thereto out of conscience to a command, or from the consideration of an ordinary call, whether because of the work they were about, or the circumstances of time, place, and accasion, inviteing thereunto, or the like.</p>

Yet he granteth, that <hi>prayer is Profitable and necessary, a duty commanded of God, frequently to be gone about by Christians.</hi> What would he then be at? <hi>But,</hi> sayes he, <hi>as without Christ, we can do nothing; so neither can we pray, without the help of the Spirit.</hi> And this is very true. But will this say any thing against what we hold? Or make any thing for his way? Knoweth he no difference betwixt the ordinary and usual Assistance of the Spirit, without which, we can do nothing aright; and that extraordinary Impulse of the Spirit, which he would be at, and supposeth to be the only lawful call unto this duty; and really taketh away all conscience of duty, or obligation to it? Nay, doth he think that that more ordinary assistance of the Spirit, Prepareing, Disposeing and Frameing the heart for the work, by blowing away the ashes from the coal of grace within, stirring up the graces of his Spirit, enlarging the heart, giving a deep sense of unworthiness and necessities, setting faith, love, zeal and fervency a work; and so putting the soul in case to sail faire before the winde; doth he think, I say, that this work of the Spirit is the only ground and call to the performance of this duty? and that till this be once, there is no warrand to set about it, or attempt it? When we heare his proofs for this, we shall consider them: At present, I shall only say; That as there is nothing in all the word, giving ground for this conjecture; so the frequently reiterated command of God (which himself acknowledgeth, and which we finde not qualified and restricted, as some commands are) laying on an obligation, taketh all coloure for such a pretence quite away: the word of command being our rule, the obligation to duty flowing therefrom is not enfringed by the Lords free not-blowings, or restrainings of the Influences of his Spirit, wherein he acteth according to the good pleasure of his will, sometimes out of meer sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity, because so it seemeth good in his eyes, sometimes in way of holy Justice, punishing for misimproving his former breathings, for not watching over the heart, nor guarding against such sinnes as grieve the Spirit. These motions of the Spirit are no rule to us, being the free and arbitrary actings of the Lord, who giveth an account of his matters to none. The Law is our fixed rule: and by this opinion, the Law and Command of God is made of none effect; for to all injunctions, this shifting returne might be given; Let the command be never
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:66147:237"/>
so peremptour, and pressing; Yet till the Spirit breath first, and act upon me, I can do nothing; and therefore am under no obligation; And thus all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of and mourning for sin, all godly sorrow for our indisposition for, &amp; neglect of the duty, and all serious and earnest prayer and wrestling with God for his breathing and gracious quickenings, are taken away; and a plaine path made for Neligence, Security, Indifferency, and Deadness. And if this hold as to prayer, it will hold also as to all other Christian duties; Yea and to all duties enjoyned by the law and light of nature; for neither can we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme these acceptably, and in a gracious manner, without the special Breathings and Communications of divine Influence and Assistance; and so, until such quickning &amp; upstirring breathings &amp; gales of the Spirit come, we are not to love God, nor our neighbour, to eate, drink and sleep; nor may the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man plow or sowe: nay, nor must we abstaine from murther, adultery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest, and other wickednesses, that the very light of a natural conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth: as if all those commands were not given to us as rational creatures, under subjection, or as Christians under the law and command of the Gospel; but only as creatures and Christians so and so spiritually qualified and disposed; and as if the Lord's gracious communications, which are acts of soveraigne grace, let out freely according to his owne will and pleasure, without the least of our deservings, were to restrick and limite the obligation of his lawes: and as if his free restrainings and withdrawings of these qualifying and disposeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, did put a check unto, and controle his Authority, as King &amp; Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Whatever this man may think of this, I can put no other construction u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it, than that it is a turning of the grace of God unto lasciviousness.

And there is a speaking to God with words, a glorifying of him with our glory and tongue <hi>Psal.</hi> 57:8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 108:1. which we are here mainly to consider, being speaking of solemne worshipe: but this, though outwardly, as to the expressions, differenced from the other; yet not rightly separated; for in all Prayer, the heart must speak to God, for Prayer is an offering up of our desires to God <hi>Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 62:8. and in publick and solemne Prayer, the heart must so speak, as the tongue must speak also, and the gift of Prayer be imployed, for the solemne and professed glorifying of God, and for the edifying of others, who must hear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14:14, 15, 16, 17. Let us hear, how he explaineth these, <hi>Inward Prayer,</hi> sayes he, <hi>is that secret introversion of soul, which being secretly done, and the Light of Christ being wakened in the conscience, and so being humbled in the sense of sin and unworthiness, breaths to God, and sendeth up constantly secret desires unto Him,</hi> and to this he applyeth <hi>Luk.</hi> 18: <hi>v.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5: <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6:18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21: <hi>v.</hi> 36. <hi>Answ.</hi> That there are secrete groanings and breathings unto God, I have showne: That to these, sense of sin and unworthiness, as also sense of want,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:66147:238"/>
and dependence on God is requisite, with Faith, Love, Zeal, Submission, and other graces, I teadily grant; and hence inferre, that if the places by him cited command this (as I think they do; and also a constant habitual frame, and disposition for Prayer, with a readiness to go about it on all occasions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, without disputing or delay, and that with constancy and perseverance) we cannot shift this inward Prayer, upon pretence of the want either of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious frame, through the breathing of the Spirit; or yet of a secret, strong and extraordinary impulse. But as to that introversion, (whether he make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Prayer, or only a preparation to it, his words give us no distinct account) remembering what was said of it above, we can neither look upon it as inward Prayer (except it be inward Prayer to corrupt nature, or to the Devil, and so, utterly abominable; seing all our prayer is to be unto God only, and to none else <hi>Mat.</hi> 4:10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10:14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6:13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10:20.) not as any fit preparation to prayer; for, as he did describe it to us before, it did unman and unchristian the man, taking away all Sense and Reason, all actions of Minde and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, yea and all sense of sin and wants. And further, this Light of Christ, is but the Light of Nature and of a natural Conscience, which is common to all Men, as such; and so not that Light of Christ, which is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by him, for all his owne, and is conveyed in and by the New Covenant of grace; the method wher of is, that a soul be first interessed in Christ by true faith, and united unto him, and then enjoy the benefites and blessings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.

And beside this simple Introversion, there must be a continueing in it, and how long I know not; He tels us himself, that sometimes, all the time of their publick worshipe is spent about this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversion,</hi> and it issueth in neither Prayer nor Preaching. (4) Beside this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversion, he sayes, there must be the Inspiration of the Spirit, and not only that, but a feeling of the same Inspiration: But what is this Inspiration? Is this a blowing of the Spirit upon his owne saving graces in the soul? No, that it cannot be; for this Inspiration may be, where ever this Introversion is, and this Introversion may be in those, who are yet without the Covenant with promises; so that it can be nothing, but some perception of the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and dictats of a natural Conscience; if it be not the breathings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of darkness working in the soul. (5.) Beside all this, there is a superadded motion and influence of the Spirit; but for what end, he tels us not; nor cleareth he to us, how it is distinguished from the Inspiration; unless by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration he meaneth the immediate Impulse, extraordinarily setting the soul to work; and by this Influence, a power or work of the Spirit, qualifying or fitting the soul for the duty. But then (6.) What can be the import of that <hi>powerfully inflowing efficacy and liberty, to speak in words,</hi> &amp;c? And how differeth
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:66147:239"/>
this from what was said before? But now, when we have heard this unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible description of outward prayer, we would desire one passage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or instance to clear and confirme the same to us: for the braine-sick non-sensical dictates of <hi>Quakers,</hi> are neither a Rule, nor Confirmation to us of any thing, in the matters of God.</p>

But that this is common to all, as well without, as within the Church; as well such as never heard of Christ, as those, who are truely unite unto him by faith; or to all, who can make this Introversion, is a quakeristick antiscriptural dream.

And then, seing he told us before, that they may be long Introverted, and yet the Spirit not suffer them to pray; the duty is not done, and they want not the preparation, and so are guiltles.

Therefore. Ans.</hi> What will this conclusion do for his purpose? It cometh not neare to what he should prove, by many stages.

That no man should put to his hand to build, and no man should set a watch upon the wales of a besieged city; and no man should laboure in his ordinary calling, till he finde the influenceing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and concurrence of the Spirit pouseing him forward, and driveing him to the work.

But sayes he further, <hi>As a natural Spirit is required to performe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acts; so the Spirit of God is requisite to the performance of Spiritual acts.</hi> All is granted: yet he knoweth, that to performe natural acts in a spiritual manner, the Spirit of God is requisite; and if natural acts be not performed in a spiritual manner, they are not accepted of God: and therefore according to his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we must not eat, drink, sleep, walk, work, plow &amp;c. till the Spirit stirre us up immediatly, and carry us to the duty; because without this previous moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, we will but commit abomination, in all these actions; as well as in worshiping without the Spirit. So that, if this man will speak consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, he must come to this at length; for he will never be able to loose the connexion.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Another Objection is. That thus a man may neglect prayer all his dayes, alleiging the Spirit hath not moved him to it: And indeed the <hi>Quakers</hi> doctrine hath a direct tendency, to the utter neglect, and laying aside of all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:66147:242"/>
of God, what answereth he? <hi>He should come to that place or state, where he may feel the Spirit leading him</hi>? That is, he should Introverte; but when he hath Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, he can pretend the Spirit doth not yet breath; as themselves do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. <hi>They sin,</hi> sayes he, <hi>in not praying, but the cause hereof is, they watch not.</hi> Nay, for themselves Watch and Introverte, and yet pray not. <hi>Our adversaries say,</hi> sayes he, <hi>that no unworthy person should come to the sacrament of the Supper, &amp; such as know themselves unprepared should absteane; and so, though it be a duty to come to this sacrament, yet it is necessary, that they first examine themselves. Ans.</hi> (1.) The use of this Sacrament is a part of instituted worshipe, and so may have its owne limitations, conditions &amp; restrictions according to the will of the Instituter; it is not so with prayer, which is a piece of moral natural worshipe; incumbent to all, by the very law of Nature. The Scripture saith indeed, <hi>let a man examine himself, and so let him eat</hi>; but the Scripture saith not, <hi>let a man Introverte, and so let him pray.</hi> Under the law, no stranger was to eate of the Paschal lamb, till he and his males were first circumcised; can he shew us any such condition put upon strangers, in reference to praying unto God? (2.) In the matter of the sacrament, there is a previous condition required of comers, and when that condition is performed, they must come, or else sinne: but the cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that his <hi>simile</hi> halteth miserably.</p>
               <p n="18">18. To the Objection, taken from <hi>Peters</hi> enjoyning prayer to <hi>Simon magus Act.</hi> 8:22. He saith. <hi>That Peter bids him first repent; and the least measure of this cannot be without some introversion. Ans. Peter</hi> bids him not repent in order to prayer; but repent and pray in order to pardon: and so though he was in the gall of bitterness, yet it was as well his duty to pray, as to repent: But, I see, with our <hi>Quaker,</hi> a graceless person can repent, but he cannot pray; nature can help him sufficiently to repent, but he must have some more before he be in case to pray, or under an obligation to pray, with him. (2.) Though the least measure of repentance could not be, without this Introversion; Yet what would that avail? <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> though he had Repented &amp; Introverted too, might not pray until the Spirit Inspired him, and Acted and Drew him; if our <hi>Quaker</hi> speak truth: And so <hi>Peter</hi> was mistaken, to enjoyne him to pray; and shoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="19">19. The last Objection is, Many prayers begun without the Spirit, become afterward affectual; yea the prayers of some wicked persons, as of <hi>Ahab,</hi> have been heard and accepted. <hi>Ans.</hi> Of <hi>Ahabs</hi> humbling himself and fasting, &amp;c. I read, but I hear not of his prayers: but as to the first part of the Objection, I think it strong and considerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For who of the saints have not found it true, that though they have gone about this duty, without these previous impulses, yet have gote a sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

pray acceptably, not remaining wholly impious, but thus entering into the beginnings of piety, from which afterward they fall away. Ans.</hi> (1.) Acts of divine indulgence, so frequently manifested, are stron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(2.) The motions and influences, that wicked persons living without the Church are sensible of, are nothing but the stirrings of a natural conscience: and such as some within the Church meet with, who remaine ungodly, are but common, and not special and saving. (3.) If they be such, as will warrant acceptable prayer, they must be indeed special and saving, strong and mighty Influences and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations, giving great power and liberty, and that after a serious Introversion; according to his doctrine. (4.) Now at length we see, that all the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of preparation for prayer, by Introversion, by the Inspirations, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses, Motions, Influences, and Drawings of the Spirit, is just nothing, but what a wicked wretch or a Pagan is capable of. (5.) As for his day of visitation, and falling away from grace, (which here he minceth, by calling it only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of piety) we have said enough above of both.</p>

But I dar not say, that no man must sing, but he who hath the sense of Gods love in the heart, seing I finde so many Psalmes sung, that were of a far other straine, as for example <hi>David's</hi> Penitential Psalmes, as they are called, such as <hi>Psal.</hi> 6. &amp; 32. &amp; 38. &amp; 51. &amp;c. as also that of <hi>Heman Psal.</hi> 88 and others. As for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Spirit, I acknowledge, that without that neither this, nor any other piece of worshipe can be rightly performed: but that neither this, nor any other part of religious worshipe should be gone about, till there come an Impulse of the Spirit; or till the soul finde it self in a fit frame, is that which I deny, for reasons given in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What are then his exceptions, against our singing of Psalmes? <hi>There is no footstep,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the Scriptures, of our formal and common way of singing. Answ.</hi>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:66147:243"/>
The Scripture mentioneth singing, and commandeth us to sing; but, it is true, prescribeth not this, or that particular mode of singing; but leaveth that to our liberty, that it may be done according to the general rules of the word, that is, that it be done with gravity, in a way suteable to the worshipe of God, without vanity, lightness and affectation; and such, I suppose, is our manner. Will he sing none, till he finde what mode of singing is particularly prescribed in the word? I fear he shall then lay it aside altogether: or will he waite till the Spirit inspire the notes and manner, as the matter? where is his warrand for this? is there a promise of such a communication?</p>

Could the Levites, and others that joyned, say all that of themselves, that <hi>David</hi> did say of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?

As the joyful, so the sad condition of others, being turned into a song, may be mater of a song to us, as we are members of the same body; the favours &amp; deliveries, bestowed upon others, should be looked upon by us, as favours conferred upon ourselves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What next? <hi>And sometimes, immediatly after singing, they will,</hi> sayes he, <hi>in their prayers confess themselves guilty of these vices, for redemption from which they had been praising God with David.</hi> The inconsistency here is in owne imagination, for he supposeth, that the case of others, which we sing, we sing it as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly our owne: But may we not blesse and extol that God in praises, who hath redeemed others from these sinnes, under which we yet groan? And may not the singing of this contribute to the strengthening of our faith and hope of the like redemption? And may not we, in the singing of such experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of others, be raised up to see what an high and rich favoure it is to be blessed with such a redemption?

It is that sure, that is common to all men, <hi>Turks &amp; Pagans, Scythians &amp; Barbarians</hi>: And we look not upon that, as grace, from whence spiritual songs can arise. I would enquire, if the Spirit ever moveth them in their Assemblies to sing, and what for Psalmes they sing? Are they immediatly Inspired by the Spirit, or not? If not, how can they, according to their owne principles, sing them? If they be immediatly Inspired; how can others concurre, who never heard of them before? What if they do not agree with the present condition of every member of the Assembly? And how can others sing with them, without the same previous motion of the Spirit? Or is it enough, if one sing alone? And if so, how can that be an act of publick worshipe performed by the whole Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? These things, if he be for singing at all, in the publick worshipe of God, he would do well to cleare to us: And withal tell us, if the Spirit inspireth also the meeter in the song, and the tone of the singing?</p>

What a paganish designe this is, to take away all outward and visible discriminating difference betwixt Christians and Turks or Pagans, every one may see; Thus would they bring-in Pagans, as equally sharers of all external privileges of the Church, with Christians; that so Christ might have no distinct house, or Kingdom. This was several times hinted to us before, but now the vaile is taken off their faces, and their designe is open and manifest.

Towards the end of his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, (which we have nothing to do with) with which he ushereth-in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon this subject, he tels us <hi>Pag.</hi> 165. <hi>That there have been moe contests and disputs about the Sacraments, than about any other Christian doctrine.</hi> And good man, so tender is he of the peace of Christianity, that to prevent any further disput, &amp; to end all these many controversies, he hath found out a medium; that is, to take them away altogether; as if a man would deny all Christianity, to the end, all controversies in Christianity might cease, and we might live all together in peace, and beleeve no more of Christianity, than Pagans; such a short cut hath this man found out, to bring us all to an agreement among ourselves, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming all Pagans: And yet this peacable man, is a wilde man for <hi>Ismael</hi>-like, his hand is against every man, and every mans hand is against him; for all those who upon each side, maintaine these controversies; do owne their being, &amp; would defend the same against him, &amp; many of their controversies thereabout speak out their care to maintaine this Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He taketh, in the first place, exceptions, at the name <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as not being a terme found in Scripture; So tender would he seem to be of all things: But I pray him tell me, where, in all the Scripture, readeth he of his <hi>Introversion</hi>; a very great matter with him? Where readeth he of <hi>fermentation,</hi> of the <hi>vehicle of God,</hi> and I know not how many moe? He is beholden to the <hi>Socinians</hi> for this exception: and they will tell him also, he must except against the <hi>Trinity,</hi> upon the same ground: It is a poor thing to move debates about a word, especially for him, who denieth the thing. Knoweth he not, what we mean by that word? Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he not, that we are not masters of words, but that use ruleth that? But sayes he, <hi>if this name be laid aside, the controversie about the number of Sacraments is at an end, for there will be no Scripture terme found, that will give occasion to that debate.</hi> No? He is mistaken: the same debate will remaine, if instead of <hi>Sacrament,</hi> we use <hi>signes and seals of the Covenant,</hi> and these are Scripture termes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17:7, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4:12. Knoweth he not, that in that debate, the question is not about the name, but about the thing imported by the name? This he is not sensible of; for sayes he, <hi>if we define a Sacrament, to be an outward signe, whereby an inward grace is either conferred, or only signified, that will agree to many other things.</hi> No sure, if we define a Sacrament to be an outward visible signe, whereby inward grace is not only signified, but really exhibited and conferred to the worthy partakers: far less, if we define a Sacrament thus. <hi>An holy signe and seal of the Covenant of grace, representing Christ and his benefites, and confirming to the right receivers, their interest in him.</hi> Can this definition, thinks he, agree to any other thing, to Prayer,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:66147:245"/>
Preaching, or any good work? But, sayes he, <hi>the Spirit only is called the earnest of our inheritance, Ephes.</hi> 1:14. &amp; 4:30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:22. <hi>And profane men may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Sacraments.

But our <hi>Quaker</hi> thinketh, that this will make two Baptismes, while as there is but one, as there is one faith, &amp;c. And here lyeth the whole ground of his mistake. And upon this same ground, he might say, there were two circumcisions under the Law, because sometimes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace, signified and represented by the outward act, and really bestowed upon beleevers, is called circumcision; as where mention is made of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the heart <hi>Deut.</hi> 30:6.

The Apostle saith here also, <hi>there is one faith.</hi> And upon the same ground, our <hi>Quaker</hi> might argue, that the doctrine of the Gospel, which is the object of faith, is not faith, though the same Apostle calleth it so, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1:23. and elsewhere; and that the outward Profession of the truth is not faith, though it be so called, <hi>Act,</hi> 8:13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1: <hi>ver.</hi> 19. &amp; 3:9. &amp; 4:1. hence the historical and temporary faith, and the <hi>faith of miracles,</hi> should be no faith; because not the faith here meaned. As also because the Apostle saith here, <hi>there is one body,</hi> he might thus reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Either the mystical body of beleevers is not the body; or the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal company of Professours is not the body, But as the <hi>body</hi> here compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth both, and the <hi>Faith</hi> taketh in both the outward profession, and the inward grace; so the <hi>Baptisme</hi> comprehendeth both that which is inward and outward, not the one with the exclusion of the other, as making up that one, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Baptisme, the consideration of which, is a strong motive to union among Church-members, made partakers thereof. But he thinks, that <hi>he is confirmed in his opinion,</hi> if we say, <hi>that the water is one part of Baptisme, as being the signe, and the Spirit is the other, as being the thing signified.</hi> But we take the thing signified to be Christ and his benefites; for it sealeth to the believer an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in him, and all the promises of the new Covenant, whereof the promise of the Spirit is a grand and comprehensive one. Let us hear his reason. <hi>For</hi> saith he, <hi>if water be the signe, it is not the mater of the one Baptisme; and the one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is to be taken for the mater, and not for the figure, type or signe. Answ.</hi> Whether he call it mater or signe (as a figure or type we owne it not) this is certain, that the outward element administred according to appointment, is the outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible part of that Baptisme, which comprehendeth both the outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part. But he supposeth, we say it is a part of the inward grace; which is his dream: and he speaketh of the inward grace, as separated, and considered wholly as distinct from the outward part; and will have it only called Christ's Baptisme: which may be true in some sense, because it is it which he doth and worketh by his Spirit: but it is not that baptisme, whereof the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. that, so abstractly and separatly considered, having no force of an argument or motive in it, to press Visible Professours to an endeavouring of unity; but as conjoined with this outward administration, wherein all were solemnely dedicate to God, and whereby they were solemnely admitted as members of one visible body, and visibly separated and differenced from all the rest of the world, and so, engadged to be wholly and only the Lords, and to lay out themselves for the good one of another, and to seek by all lawful meanes possible, the welfare and felicity of the whole body, and to demeane themselves as members one of another, for the glory of their one Head Christ. This is plaine and obvious to every one, that will but open his eyes. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:12, 13, 14, 25, 26, 27.</p>

But the first is true. Therefore &amp;c.

Ans.</hi> This man's trumph, though he stand upon the shoulders of his friend <hi>Socinus,</hi> who spoke thus before him, is a meer glorying in a thing of nought, and both his arguments may be blowne away with one distinction; thus, if those who were baptized with the baptisme of water, were not therefore baptized with that baptisme, which Christ himself by his Spirit, and not by the ministrie of men, was to administrate, than the baptisme of water is not this baptisme, which Christ was to performe by his Spirit, without the ministrie of men, true: then the baptisme of water is not the baptisme which Christ hath instituted, this is false. The Assumption is only true in the first sense, and not in the last. And so his Conclusion proveth nothing. The baptisme of water and this bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, of the Spirit are different, we confesse; and the baptisme by water is not the external part of this baptisme of the Holy Ghost, nor a signe, far lesse a type or figure: nor is this baptisme of the holy Ghost the baptisme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostle speaketh <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.

And who, I pray, shall be the administrators thereof? But, saith he, <hi>if there be now but one Baptisme, as is proved, this baptisme, must be the baptisme of the Spirit.</hi> But where readeth he of but one baptisme?

I observe moreover another piece of this mans ignorance or deceite, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he would found his discourse here: he imagineth, that these extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gifts of the holy Ghost, are the same with the Spiritual things signified, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and sealed in baptisme. And when the man doth shut his eyes, and then run on furiously in his blindness, what can we do, but stand by and be sorry at his folly and madness? Hence he will have none said to be baptized in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but such as are baptized and endued with these extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; and because we admit not now such a baptisme of the Spirit, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth, that we are only for the bare forme and shadow of baptisme, and he is for the substance. Who would not pity such a man, that taketh upon him to condemne, (as the <hi>Manichees</hi> did of old, and a Seck called the <hi>Whippers,</hi> that arose in the 13.

The fire in the Apostles could not be hid, they spoke with ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues; but our <hi>Quakers</hi> do no such thing (except by a new kinde of non-sense he would have us understand their speaking with tongues: And indeed they are all baptized with this baptisme) These were extraordinarily endued with learning and all abilities, to set forward the Kingdom of Christ: but our <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> are ignorant, and yet they imagine they are learned; and with what they have, they destroy, so far as they can, this kingdom; and therefore if they be extraordinarily baptized with a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>irit, it must be with a blake Spirit, Christ's enemy. And further, the baptisme of the holy Ghost, with which the Apostles were baptized, made them not enraged against the baptisme of water, but more careful to observe it, and administrate it, according to Christ's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that even to such, as had also received that extraordinary baptisme: As <hi>Act.</hi> 11. these same persons, on whom the holy Ghost fell, were baptized with water. But it is otherwise with our <hi>Quakers,</hi> the Ghost, which they suppose themselves baptized with, is a Ghost opposite to all Christ's Appointments.

give each its due place. What would our <hi>Quaker</hi> now say? He sideth with <hi>Schwenckfeldus,</hi> and <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> and would have the outward part wholly laid aside, and why? Because <hi>Peter</hi> sayes, <hi>Baptisme is not the putting away the filth of the Flesh. Ans. Peter</hi> sayes not, that there is no putting away of the filth of the Flesh, in Baptisme; but that the baptisme, which will save, must have some other thing, then outward washing; to wit, the answere of a good conscience toward God. Againe he joyneth with <hi>Papists,</hi> and will have baptisme to be that, which was really typified by the Ark, while as it is but a corresponding exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar, carrying some analogy or proportion therewith: let him Read <hi>Calvin</hi> &amp; <hi>Beza</hi> on the place. But saith he, <hi>As all in the Arkwere saved by water, so all should be saved by outward washing, if that were baptisme.

We do not say, that all who are only outwardly washen in baptisme, are therefore crucified with Christ, or have put him on; but that baptisme seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this to such as do really beleeve.

Christ in truth and reality; Yet they have put on Christ in profession, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have publickly declared their engadgment to the duties pressed: Conforme to what was said, I <hi>Answere</hi> to his first argument thus. If the baptisme of water, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted and separated from the answere of a good conscience, was the baptisme of Christ, then his <hi>Minor</hi> is true: But if baptisme of water, and the answere of a good conscience, therein required, be Christ's baptisme, then it is true, that as many as are thus baptized, have put on Christ; and so his <hi>Minor</hi> is false, and his <hi>Conclusion</hi> is vaine. So as to his second <hi>arg.</hi> I <hi>Answere</hi> thus, if so many, as are baptized into Christ, have put on Christ, then the baptisme of water without the answer of a good conscience, is not that one baptisme; true: then the baptisme of water including the answer of a good conscience is not that one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme; It is false. The <hi>Minor</hi> is true of this last, but not of the former; and so againe his <hi>conclusion</hi> is a <hi>non-sequitur.</hi> Thus he may see his folly, in disioyning and separating, what should be conjunctly considered. In all this, what hath he said, to Prove, that the baptisme, whereof the Apostle speaketh in the places cited, is nothing else, then the very baptisme of the holy Ghost and of fire, wherewith the Apostles were baptized in the day of Pentecost?

Preaching of the Gospel was principally committed, &amp; baptizing as an accessory?

               <p n="14">14. Unto that express command of Christ to his Apostles <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, He granteth all, supposing that it is not meaned of baptisme with water, as not being expresly so called in the text; and remitteth the proof to us. Wherein he is beholden unto the <hi>Socinians,</hi> never man having the forehead to call this into question before them: But these things make it evident (1.) This is but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment of a former commission, as to the Object, while as before they were limited to the house of Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now they are to go to all Nations; And before this we heard of their baptizeing with water, with Christs warrand &amp; authority, so as that it was accounted Christs deed <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4:1. &amp; 3:26.

(3.) Their constant after-practice declareth this to have been the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the command. (4.) This is the proper acceptation and import of the word, and himself saith, that <hi>the propriety of Scripture words must not be forsaken, nor must we run to a figurative sense, unless necessity urge</hi>: Now there is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity apparent enforceing a figurative sense here: And all greek lexicons can tell us, that <gap reason="foreign">

I think this must be it; for this was every way peculiar unto Christ, and to none else: and what will then become of all his former discourse? (2.) We have showne, that that one baptisme <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4:5. is only to be understood of the baptisme, we speak of; for no other was common to all professours, no other was a fit argument for unity and concord; and so no other could suite the Apostles scope there. (3.) All the three sorts of baptismes are Christs, in several senses: That baptisme of the cross, was his; because he alone, in a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Baptisme with water was his also, as being instituted by him.

He addeth, <hi>why should this fact of Peter more prove the permanency of baptisme, than his compelling (which yet is more than a command) the Gentiles to be circumcised: when he did this to Cornelius, the common opinion was, that the Gentiles should be circumcised.

                  </gap>not to put the burden of circumcision, &amp; other Jewish ceremonies, (beside the few excepted, for avoiding of Scandal) upon the neck of the Gentiles. And though this calumny of the <hi>Quakers</hi> had some ground, Yet the difference betwixt the one practice &amp; the other is great: Christ by his death did break down the middle wall of partition, &amp; so put an end to the Jewish ceremonies; but he did not so with his owne Gospel Institutions; but rather confirmed them. Where readeth he, that at that time, when <hi>Cornelius</hi> was baptized, it was the common opinion, that the Gentiles should be circumcised? And how came it, that <hi>Peter</hi> did not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise <hi>Cornelius,</hi> if that was the common opinion?

               <p n="1">1. WE have seen this Mans weak reasons, and strong rage, against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> And must have a little more patience, and hear the like against the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> Such is their malice against all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Jesus Christ, that nothing will satisfie them, but a total extirpation of them all, without exception of any; and such is their enmity against Christ, that they will have every memorial of him quite taken away, that there might nothing remaine, to discriminate us from Pagans; And indeed if their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples prevaile, all Christianity is overturned, and manifest Paganisme is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. Christ did institute a Supper to be religiously observed, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of himself; and these men will not be satisfied to take away <hi>Baptisme,</hi> the engadging and honourable badge of Christians; but they must have the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Supper of our Lord also quite Cashiered; that by time, when this lasting memorial is removed, people may be more easily enduced to renunce all Christianity, and perswaded to embrace Paganisme. And thus they have sucked-in the venome of some of old, who were against all Sacraments, such as the <hi>Ascothyptoe, Messalians, Acephali, Henry Nicolas,</hi> the Father of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of love, <hi>Swenckfeldus,</hi> and <hi>Almaricus,</hi> the first broacher of the <hi>Seculum Spiritus S.</hi> wherein there was to be no use of Sacraments. And they are, in this, worse then the Antichristian <hi>Socinians,</hi> who, though they destroy the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end of these Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> to be sealing and confirming ordinances,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:66147:252"/>
owneing them only for outward professions of faith and thanksgiving; yet keep up something of the practice: but these our <hi>Quakers</hi> would take away both name and thing; and the thing it self with all its uses and ends; that so nothing might stand in their way, while posting towards Paganisme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But whatever these <hi>Desperadoes</hi> say; we must hold for a sure truth. That our Lord Jesus, in the night wherein he was betrayed, instituted the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body and blood, called the Lords Supper, to be observed in his Church, unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance of the Sacrifice of himself, in his death; the sealing all benefites thereof unto true believers; their spiritual nourishment and grouth in him: their engadgment in and to all duties, which they owe unto him: and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other, as members of his mystical body 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11:23, to 26. and 10:16, 17, 21. and 12:13. For therein, by giving and receiving bread and wine, according to the appointment of Jesus Christ, his death is shewed forth, and they that worthily communicate, feed upon his body and blood, to their spiritual nourishment and grouth in grace <hi>Mat.</hi> 26:26, 27, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11:23, 24, 25, 26. have their Union and Communion with him Confirmed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10:15.

And though the body and blood of Christ be not Corporally or Carnally present in, with, or under the outward Elements of bread and wine <hi>Act.</hi> 3:21. yet they are spiritually present to the Faith of the Receiver, no less truely and really, then the elements themselves are to their outward senses <hi>Mat.</hi> 26:26, 28. And they that worthily Communicate in this Ordinance, do therein feed upon the body and blood of Christ, not after a Corporal and Carnal, but in a Spiritual manner, yet truely and really 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11:24,—29. while by faith they receive and apply unto themselves Christ crucified, and all the benefites of his death 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10:16, Therefore, as upon the one hand, we must reject all Corruptions of, &amp; corrupt opinions concerning this Ordinance; such as the Popish sacrifice of the Masse, a most abominable device, injurious to Christs one, only sacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the sinnes of the elect <hi>Heb.</hi> 7: <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10:11, 12, 14, 18. for in this Sacrament Christ is not offered up to his Father; nor any real sacrifice made at all, for the remission of the sinnes of quick or dead <hi>Heb.</hi> 9:22.25, 26, 28. but only a Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that one offering up of himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by himself, upon the crosse, once for all; and a Spiritual Oblation of all spiritual praise unto God for the same, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11:24, 25, 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26:26, 27.

by consecration of a Priest, or by any other way; as being repugnant not to Scripture alone, but even to Common sense and Reason, and overthrowing the Nature of the Sacrament, and hath been and is the cause of manifold Superstitions; yea, of gross Idolatries <hi>Act.</hi> 3:21, with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11:24.25, 26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24:6, 39. for though the outward Elements here duely set apart to the uses ordained by Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have such Relation to him crucified, as that truely, yet Sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the names of the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of Christ <hi>Mat.</hi> 26:26, 27, 28.

As, I say, we must reject these errours about this Ordinance, So upon the other hand, we must owne the right manner of its Administration, according to Christs appointment, which is, that his Ministers Declare his word of Institution to the people, Pray and Bless the element of bread and wine, &amp; thereby set them apart from a common to a holy Use; and Take and Break the bread; take the Cup, and (they communicating also themselves) give both to the communicants <hi>Mat.</hi> 26:26, 27, 28, <hi>Mark</hi> 14:22, 23, 24. <hi>Luk</hi>

none shall enjoy the sensation (let me use his words) of the presence of God, but such as meet together: And that other instance, which he adduceth, of God's giving according to his promise, to such as ask, confirmeth me in this; for God many times preventeth our seeking: other instances might be adduced, but these two, which himself hath adduced, are enough to clear the matter.</p>

It is not because God hath commanded us to be holy, that therefore, such as are holy shall see God's face; but because of a promise. What will he now do? his light hath confounded him, so as he knoweth not what he saith. But, howbeit a precept hath no interest here, while speaking of his Relation; Yet least he boast, as supposing, we could not maintaine, that there was a command for the use of this ordinance, we must see What he saith here. <hi>If there were any such precept,</hi> saith he, <hi>it should be found there, where the institution is.</hi> Which is very true, for the very Institution hath the force of a command, though there were no more. <hi>Matthew and Mark,</hi> saith he, <hi>mentione no command, and Luk only saith, this do in remembrance of me, Answ.</hi> Here is an express command mentioned by <hi>Luk,</hi> and what needeth more? The Institution, say I, hath the force of a command; and that the Apostles after practice declared; and the practice of the primitive Church: and beside all this, we have <hi>Paul's</hi> large commentary upon this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. &amp; 11. for if there had been no command for this, why was the Apostle at all that paines, to rectifie abuses among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> about this mater? why spoke he of a cup, which he blessed; and of bread, which he brake 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10:16: Why did he deliver this unto them, and tell them, that he had received it of the Lord 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11:23?

That declaration of Christ's death is a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive end; and includeth a Christian improvement, and application of Christ's death, to all the ends, for which he is held forth in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which appeareth by the whole context; for where this is not, there is an eating of the bread, and drinking of the cup unworthily, and an incurring the guilt of the body and blood of the Lord <hi>vers.</hi> 27. and to which is required self

examination, as a necessary preparation; and an eating of the bread and drinking of the cup so: And such as includeth a discerning of the Lord's body, the want of which maketh persons eat and drink judgment to themselves; and was the cause, why many were weak and sickly among them, and many were asleep <hi>vers.</hi> 29, 30. And such as requireth self judging, to this end, that we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent God's judging <hi>vers.</hi> 31. Thus we see, that such a Commemoration of the death of Christ, as is here understood, cannot be without this partaking. (2,) This same end includeth a command to use this Sacrament, until Christ's second coming. (3.) What thinks he of the ends mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10:16, 17? (4.) How such as partake of Christ's body and bloud, in his sense, cannot but declare his death, is a mystery to me: Let him clear to me, how a Pagan, that never heard of Christ, or of his death, can by introverting unto the light within him, declare Christ's death? (5.) Though Christ's death could be commemorated without partaking of his body and blood in this Ordinance; Yet it will not hence follow, that it must not be commemorated by this Ordinance: He might as well argue, that because Christ's death can be declared in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, therefore it must not be declared in the Word: but the truth is, this man would have all declaration of it laid aside, that it might be quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or no otherwise declared, than as may be by a Pagan, introverting to his Light.</p>
               <p n="12">12. What saith he to these words. <hi>This is my body, and this cup is the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my blood? As Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>used by the use of natural things, to lead the mind of his disciples up unto spiritual things; so here; Christ took occasion from the bread and the wine, which was before them, while supping, to tell them, that as bread and wine served to nourish their bodies, so his body and blood should be for their souls. Answ.</hi> Are not these excellent Commentators? Is it any wonder, that they will not take this word for their Rule? Who ever heard even mens words so abused and perverted? O the patience of God! Though I think the very reciting of his words, were enough to shame him (if he could be ashamed) and them both; yet let me soberly ask him a few things. (1.) Why doth he not give us a like instance? That which he mentioneth, of Christ's speaking to the woman of <hi>Samaria Ioh.</hi> 4. is nothing to the purpose; for Christ sayes not there, <hi>This well is my body,</hi> Or <hi>this well is the New Testament in my blood.</hi> (2.) What signified Christ's <hi>blessing of the bread,</hi> and blessing of the <hi>cup,</hi> if this was all? (3.) To what end did he <hi>break</hi> the bread, and <hi>give it</hi> to his disciples, and said, <hi>take eat,</hi> &amp;c. when they had been eating and drinking already? (4.) Why said he of the cup, <hi>drink ye all of it,</hi> if there was no more imported? (5.) Why said he, <hi>this do in remembrance of me</hi>? (6.) Was this all, that <hi>Paul</hi> delivered to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>? (7.) Was this all, that he received of the Lord? (8.) How cometh it, that the Spirit of the Lord in <hi>Paul</hi> giveth us not that commentary of the words? But enough of this piece of profane blasphemous boldness.</p>
               <p n="13">13 What sayes he to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10:16. <hi>The cup of blessing, which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread, which we break, is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Christ</hi>? He answereth. <hi>Pag.</hi> 298. <hi>That in all this Chapter, Paul is not speaking a word of this ceremonie,</hi> (he should say, Ordinance) <hi>Answ.</hi> For as
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:66147:257"/>
bold as he is, we will not beleeve him: Let us yet hear his reason. <hi>He saith vers.</hi> 21. <hi>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of Devils, &amp;c. but they could drink of the cup of Devils, and of the outward cup. Answ.</hi> Not morally and lawfully, because the Apostle here disswades them from having communion with idols, upon this very account; though they might physically: as <hi>Robert Parclay</hi> may steal and murther. But, sayes he, <hi>Paul speaks of one bread vers.</hi> 17. <hi>and this cannot be outward bread, otherwise the inward should be excluded. Answ.</hi> Both may consist; for by the inward they become all one body really and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; and by the outward, they became one body in profession, and open declaration: And what inconsistency is here? He next tels us, <hi>that he can see no ground or occasion in the Scripture, for this figment of Sacramental union.</hi> And what remedie, seing Institutions of Christ must be figments with him; it is no wonder he cannot see what others see; But some are so far master of their sight, that what they desire not to see, their eyes can not see: But, it may be, it is worse with him; He cannot but see, and yet the light within will not let him see. We have mentioned lately some passages to this purpose, both in the Old and New Testament; and that may satisfie such, as will see.</p>
               <p n="14">14. He findeth the Apostles discourse 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. A great mountaine in his way, therefore <hi>Pag.</hi> 299 he laboureth all he can to blow it away. He must grant, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were in use of celebrating this Sacrament, and that <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the abuses, that were committed, in their manner of going about it. Yet he saith, <hi>that the express and special use hereof, in the Apostles judgment, was to declare Christs death; but this is far different from partaking of Christ's flesh and blood. Ans.</hi> One use doth not destroy another; the Apostle had, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Chapter, mentioned the other use, and needed not here againe repeat it expresly: and we have showne already, that this was a comprehensive use, and could not but take in their eating of Christs body and drinking of his blood: and this is clear, in that the Apostle saith, that <hi>whosoever did eat and drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, were guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, and did not discerne the Lord's body.</hi> Nay himself granteth, in the following words, <hi>that to such, as use this, it hath an immediat relation to the outward body and death of Christ.</hi> And so there is a Sacramental union. But he addeth, <hi>It hath not a necessary relation to the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spiritual body and blood of Christ. Answ.</hi> We grant it, as to that which he taketh the spiritual body and blood of Christ to be: For there is no relation of the world there. But that true beleevers, partaking of these elements by faith, are really and spiritually made partakers also of Christ and his benefites, we assert; and he dar not disprove it. He addeth. That these words of <hi>Paul vers.</hi> 27. <hi>say only, That seing the Corinthians would needs performe this ceremony, as an act of religion, they should do it worthily, otherwise bring condemnation on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Answ.</hi> (1.) If the <hi>Corinthians</hi> performed this ceremony, as an act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without a divine warrant, they were guilty of will worshipe; And shall he make us beleeve that <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Spirit of the Lord rather in <hi>Paul,</hi> would not discharge this superstition? Nay, not only not so; but denunce such judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on them, for doing of it but amisse? (2.) Shall he make us beleeve, that <hi>Paul</hi> would have taught and delivered to them modes of will-worshipe, and

prescribed the exercise of Superstion? Yet <hi>Paul</hi> sayes <hi>vers.</hi> 23. that <hi>he delivered this unto them.</hi> (3.) Shall he make us believe, that the Lord would give <hi>Paul</hi> commission to establish among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> will worshipe and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition? Yet he sayes <hi>vers.</hi> 23. <hi>For I have received of the Lord, that which also</hi> I <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto you.</hi> (4.) What way can people go worthily about an act of will-worshipe? (5.) Would God have punished them with sickness, weakness and death, for an escape in the manner of will-worshipe, and not for the will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe it self? What wilde and bold conceits are these? He needeth not tell us, <hi>that from their practice, it will not follow, that this was a religious act incumbent to others also;</hi> for we lay not down their practice, as our ground; but what was their ground is ours, the Institution of Christ, which he delivered unto <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> received to deliver unto the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> And therefore it is not a thing indifferent, and so not to be compared with that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14:5. as he dreameth: and the practice of things indifferent, as such, is no act of Religion or of worshipe, such as this is: And therefore what he addeth <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Passing what is but a repetition, let us hear his arguments. <hi>Matthew and Mark,</hi> sayes he, <hi>expresseth this, as done while they were eating: And this was usual among the Iewes, as</hi> Paulus Riccius <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth, for at their eating of the passeover, the master of the family took bread, and brake it, and did distribute it, and so did he with wine: So Christ, who would fulfil all righteousness, and would observe the Iewish feasts, used this ceremony, for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples only, and took occasion thereby to raise up their mindes to higher things. Answ.</hi> (1.) To this last we have spoken before; and why did not Christ take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to give this Christian document before this time, while they were eating? (2.) It is true, Christ instituted this Supper before they rose from table, and what then? (3.) As for what is reported of the Jewish practice, not only by this <hi>Paulus Riccius,</hi> but by several others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doubt, if all that is said shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, that the Jewes had this custome before Christ's dayes; seing the eldest of the Jewish writters, out of whom they have it, wrote not till a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time after the Temple was brunt: And what credite is to be given to what they wrote, when their purpose and designe was to deface and annull Christianity, let sober men judge. (4.) Sure I am, there was no divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for this practice, at the eating of the Paschal Lamb; and how our <hi>Quaker</hi> can say, that Christ would do this, because he would fulfil all righteousness. I know not; seing righteousness stands in obeying the command of God. (5.) Though Christ did observe the feasts, prescribed to the Jewes by the Lord; Yet he would not observe their sinful additions and traditions: No; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned these <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. (6.) That which we are to look to, is Christ's practice,

and we are sure, that that should oblige us more, then the Jewish practice could oblige Christ. (7.) We not only have Christ's practice, but a command, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Luk, do this in remembrance of me.

And Christ, being Master and Lord, would condescend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the performing of this inferiour piece of service, usually practised by servants and the inferiour sort of persons, that he might both testifie his great love to his disciples, and also impress deeply on their soul, the moral duty of Humility, Condescension, Mutual service; and, by his own example, root out more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually that Pride, and Emulation, that was working in their hearts: and so this practice, in the very nature of the thing, did preach-out this moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But the mater of the Supper was a new Institution, having a mystical signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, depending meerly upon the Institution, and was chiefly to be a Signe and Seal of, and a Meane to exhibite to the followers of the Institution, and conscientious observers of Christ's Appointments, Spiritual benefites, even Christ, &amp; all his blessings.

And to say, that the breaking of bread. <hi>Act</hi> 2:42. is the same with the tables mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 6:2. is a meer groundless fancie; like many of the <hi>Quakers</hi> bold notions.</p>

Little considering the words, or the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the discourse. The first day of the week, our Christian sabbath, the disciples, in their whole number and company, came together to break bread, not to feast sure in a private house, (where conveniency for such a multitude, was not to be expected, and to which no small preparation and labour was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,) but to celebrate this Sacrament, which looked more like a work suteing the day, than such a private feast, as he imagineth: And it was such a feast, as required <hi>Paul's</hi> preaching: shall we think, that <hi>Paul</hi> did eat none at their private meales, all the seven dayes he was there? Yet we hear no word of his preaching at any other feast. And as for that <hi>vers.</hi> 11. it was not a supper; for it was long past supper time, it was after midnight, that he did eat then; but it was a little refreshment for himself, after his long preaching: And it is not, said <hi>vers.</hi> 11. that the disciples did all eat, as they came all together to break bread <hi>vers.</hi> 7. but only that <hi>Paul</hi> did it, <hi>when he therefore was come up againe and had
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:66147:260"/>
broken bread and eaten, and talked a long time, even till break of day &amp;c.</hi> So that this eating was for himself, both to refresh him after his long speaking, from the time that the disciples came together, untill midnight; and also to strengthen him for speaking till break of day, and for his journey then.</p>
               <p n="20">20. He cometh next to examine 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Pag.</hi> 308. And tels us <hi>that Paul vers.</hi> 20 <hi>sayes.</hi> When ye come together-this is not to eate the Lords supper, <hi>simply; and not,</hi> that was not to eate aright, and <hi>that because they were ready superstitiously to extend it beyond its true use. Ans.</hi> Of their superstition, we hear not; but rather of their defect in duties of Religion, as to this: And here the thing for which they are reprehended, is their coming in distinct separated troups, making schismes; &amp; this he sayes was not a coming together to celebrate this feast, as one body; And more particularly <hi>vers.</hi> 31. he reprehendeth their abuse, in eating thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, &amp; not waiting upon other, which in end he enjoyneth <hi>vers.</hi> 33. what maketh all this to prove this to have been a private repast only? was it ever the fashion of the Christians to hold their private feasts, and no feast else, in their publick Churches? We know these <hi>Corinthians</hi> had adjoyned to the solemne feast, their privat feasts, or love feasts, but the Apostle doth plainly discharge that practice, saying <hi>vers.</hi> 22. <hi>what, have ye not houses to eat and drink in? Or despise ye the Church of God, &amp;c.</hi> He would have no feast there held, but what belonged to the worshipe of God, and was a Gospel Institution; and therefore, in rectifying of all their abuses, he reduceth them to the first Institution, not barely narrating a mater of fact, as our <hi>Quaker</hi> fancieth; but relating an Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which he had delivered unto them, and had received of the Lord for that end. And if our <hi>Quaker</hi> were not willingly blinde, he might see a command here; and all the rest of the following verses confirming it: But Institutions are no commands with him; nor have divine commands any power over him; for he is not under God's Law, but under the light. Was <hi>Paul's</hi> delivering to them what he had received, nothing, but a simple narration of a mater of fact? What profane babling is this? <hi>But,</hi> sayes he, <hi>when he repeateth Christ's command, he wordeth it so, as that it is no command vers.</hi> 25, 26. <hi>but a conditional thing,</hi> as oft as ye drink it, &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> Then <hi>Paul</hi> relateth not faithfully, but maketh a false narration: But our <hi>Quakers</hi> scruple not at loading the Apostle with reproaches, yea &amp; the Spirit of God speaking in him! What force, I wonder, hath these words <hi>as ye eat and drink,</hi> to enfringe the command, and make the proposition only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional? by these words the Apostle lets us see, that Christ did not enjoyne, how oft this Supper should be gone about, but the command to do it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christ standeth, and is thrice repeated by <hi>Paul,</hi> for the <hi>vers.</hi> 22. may be read imperatively; where also we see, that there is a command of keeping up this ordinance, until Christs second coming. His talking, that <hi>this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of Christs inward spiritual coming,</hi> is but a quakeristick notion; as if any spiritual coming of Christ to his people here, would obliterat and delete the remembrance and commemoration of Christ's death; and beside, it would suppose, that there was not a good Christian in all this Church, nor one to whom Christ was come spiritually; or he must show us, where these are excepted here, and exempted from this command. But sayes he, <hi>they were weak, and Paul bore
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:66147:260"/>
with them. Ans.</hi> Yet being weak, they might be babes in Christ I <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:1. and so have Christ arisen in them: but if all were void of grace, how could <hi>Paul</hi> call them <hi>sanctified in Christ Iesus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:2. and <hi>thank God, for the grace of God, which was given them by Iesus Christ vers.</hi> 4. and say, that <hi>the testimony of Christ was confirmed in them vers.</hi> 6. why said he, that the <hi>Spirit of God dwelt in them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3:6. and that <hi>in Christ Iesus, he had begotten them through the Gospel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:15? These &amp; many such passages, which we finde in this Epistle, say that there were at least some, and not a few, reall beleevers among them, and so such to whom Christ was come inwardly and spiritually, who, for all this, were to waite for Christs second comeing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7, 8. and, in hopes of that, to use this Sacrament. Yet to confirme this, <hi>he</hi> sayes, <hi>that bread and wine, are among the things, that are on the earth, which such as are risen with Christ should not set their affections upon, Col.</hi> 3:1, 2. Which I do not wonder at; but think strange rather, that he did not reckon it among those members, which are upon the earth, and which we are to mortifie, <hi>Col.</hi> 3:5. to wit, <hi>fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, evil concupiscence and covetousness</hi>: Yet it may be, he will do so the next time. As for his Syriak version (which we regard not as authentick) if he will look upon it as authentick he may consider what it sayes, <hi>Act.</hi> 2:42. And, if he hath rightly translated the words here, on <hi>verse</hi> 17. thus, <hi>what I am about to command you, I say not as praising you, for ye are not advanced, but descended unto that, which is less.</hi> I see not what they can make for him; will this prove, that the Apostle saw a necessity to teach them, not external things and elements, but unnecessary and uncommanded things; as our <hi>Quaker</hi> must say? Nor is there the least shew of any countenance, from that version on <hi>vers.</hi> 20. given to this mans inference. <hi>When therefore you meet together</hi> (saith the version, as he translateth it) <hi>you do not, as is just, in the day of our Lord, eat and drink.</hi> And his inference is, <hi>that to meet for eating bread and drinking wine was not the work of that day of the Lord.</hi> While as the Version speaketh of their corrupt manner. But he would needs let us know, that he hath seen these Versions, with their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, in the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta</hi>; though he could make on other use of them, than to shew how dexterously he could pervert them, as well as the authentick Original.</p>
               <p n="21">21. When he can gaine nothing here, he must try another foord; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pag.</hi> 313. he tels us, that <hi>other precepts, far more positive, are laid aside:</hi> as that <hi>Act.</hi> 15:29. And knoweth he not, that that was a part of the ceremonial Law, the observation of which was thought necessary at that time, for avoiding the scandal of the Jewes: And the force of this canon was soon taken away by <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Colossians</hi>: was the Lord's Supper, a ceremonial command? Where read we of it, in all the Law of Moses? And was it ever a brogated by the Apostles, or Antiquated, either directly, or by consequence? When, I pray, or where? And then he citeth that <hi>Iames</hi> 5:14. <hi>of anoynting the sick with oyl.</hi> And when he replyeth to himself, that it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of the gift of miracles, which is now ceased, he sweetly acquiesceth: O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly he adviseth us <hi>to lay aside the ceremony of Imposition of hands, seing the giving of the holy Ghost is ceased;</hi> Not considering, that we use it not, as it was used for
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:66147:261"/>
the conveyance of the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghost; but as it was used for conveyance of the ministerial Power and Authority; and this use continueth, and so may the outward Ceremony of laying on of hands.</p>
               <p n="22">22. To make all sure, he will adduce some Scriptures, proving that such outward, and external rites, are no necessary parts of the new Covenant dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. And to this end citeth first <hi>Rom.</hi> 14:17. But the meat and drink, which the Apostle there speaketh of, is the same he was speaking of from the beginning of the Chapter, and that (as most suppose) was meates, which had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which some weak Christians thought yet to have been in force, as to these things; and therefore thought some meat was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane: see <hi>vers.</hi> 14. Will this make any thing against the observation of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ? Will he bring in Christ's Supper, as meat prohibited under the Law? Then he will make Christ a transgressour, He citeth next <hi>Col.</hi> 2:1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 20. Which is so plainely against him, that I think he hath done violence to the light within him, while he cited it; for he must bring Christ's Supper either under the traditions of men, or the rudiments of the world; for of these the Apostle speaketh, as we see <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 22. will he say, that the Lord's Supper cometh in among the shadowes of himself, as yet to come, while as he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come? But he addeth a reason, that must enforce all <hi>Pag.</hi> 311. to wit, <hi>that then the Gospel shall not be distinguished from the Law, nor preferred.</hi> Which is but a <hi>Socinian</hi> argument, formerly spoken to. There is no yoke, nor typical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor typical representation of things to come, under the Kingdome of the Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What followeth to §. 10. hath been spoke to, and obviated already: He is wearisome in his repetitions; and we must not weary the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with repetitions too.</p>

And, because he would end as he began, he must touch againe upon the various opinions about, and practices in this Sacrament, of old, and of late <hi>Pag.</hi> 313. which only argueth the restlesness of his malice against this Ordinance, &amp; how faine he would have it cashiered; but all in vaine, it will abide in force, and be preserved in use, till Christ come againe, nill he, will he, and all his party.</p>
               <p n="24">24. In end, after our <hi>Quaker</hi> hath fought untill he can stand no longer, and findeth himself weak, &amp; unable to fight any more, he cometh to something like a parlie, and would accord unto some accommodation; for he saith §. 11. <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if any today, out of true tenderness of conscience toward God, would performe these ceremonies, after that way and method, in which the primitive Christians did it, I would not doubt to affirme, that to such it might be indulged for a time</hi>: But, if what he saith be true, to wit, that there is no command for this Ordinance; that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

bold to say, that no man can, out of tenderness of conscience to God, after any method or manner, goe about it; and that no man should be more indulged therein, than in practiseing of circumcision.

(2.) Before, <hi>to wit Pag.</hi> 89. he told us, that some of the <hi>Quakers</hi> did fitly compare the <hi>Conscience</hi> unto a lanterne, and the light of Christ to a candle burning in it: And compareing this with what is here said; we may see, that in the <hi>Quakers</hi> judgment, the light of Christ, whereof they talk so much, is nothing but the light of the understanding, for it is this light of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that causeth the perswasion, which he calleth Conscience here; and it is that which shineth in the dark lanterne of conscience, as they speak there. But (3.) How can Conscience be compared to a lanterne, seing a lanterne is a dark thing, having no light in it self, only it hath an aptitude to transmit the light, that shineth in it; but Conscience is a lump of light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is either <hi>an act</hi> of the practical understanding, as some; or rather, as others, <hi>a power</hi> of the practical understanding, &amp; is not a distinct faculty from the understanding, but the very understanding judging of and giving sentence upon the mans State, Wayes and Actions?

Conscience then cannot properly be called a <hi>perswasion</hi>; for this resulteth from the clear apprehensions, dictats, witnessing and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Conscience; and so is but a consequent of Conscience acting, &amp; that not of every conscience either; as not of a <hi>doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And other things of that nature, that men can pretend conscience for; or not? If he hold the Negative here, as he must, if he speak to the point, we shall consider his arguments. (2.) Upon the other hand; Though the Magistrate cannot enforce a Religion upon men: Yet he may force them to the use of publick meanes, whereby they may be brought to the knowledge and conviction of the truth; As to hear sound Instruction, and Information, and to attend the meanes, whereby light is usually conveyed into the soul: and this is no force upon conscience, but a putting of people to duty. (3.) So then, the question is not, whether the sword be a meanes of conversion of men to the true faith? nor whether, heathens are to be compelled by the magistrates sword, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth?

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,</hi> (1.) Yet, I hope, he will grant, that this falling into errour must be something more, then an inward perswasion; even that, which can be witnessed, and whereof the person can be convicted, and for which he can be admonished. (2.) We say not, that Church-officers can punish by a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sword; and so we assent to that of <hi>Chrysost.</hi> which he citeth, <hi>dogmataimpia, quae ab haereticis profecta sunt, arguere &amp; anathematizare oportet, hominibus autem parcendum est, &amp; pro salute eorum orandum.</hi> Nor do we say, that every errour should be punished by cutting off with the temporal sword; nor that all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous persons should be forthwith spoiled of their civil privileges. There are degrees of Errours, and degrees of Punishments; so are there various kindes of erroneous persons; some Simple and deluded, through ignorance; others, Crafty and active in spreading their corrupt seed; Some may be easily, after Information, convinced of their mistake: Others are Pertinacious, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswadible. (3.) What meanes he by <hi>cutting off with the sword of the Spirit</hi>? Understandeth he Church excommunication? Or cutting off by an Inspiration, or by the light within? But he owneth no Church beside their owne; And in their owne, they have no set and fixed officers, by whom such a sentence should be given out. And I wonder, what that errour would be, for which they would draw forth this sword of the Spirit; it would be, I judge, pure orthodoxy. (4.) But I desire, in his next, that he would cleare to me, how this shall not be a forceing of conscience, in things immediatly betwixt God and man, and between men of the same perswasion?

               <p n="10">10. This being all, which he had to say, for clearing of the question, he cometh §. 2. to tell us, that he will prove, <hi>That man hath not authority over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, by vertue of any power or dominion, which he hath in the government of the world.</hi> And unless by Conscience here, he meane the outward and imperated acts, which are properly the actions of the man, that come in the open view of the world, he doth nothing but mocke his Reader, and publish his owne ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: And the same we say to his argument, which is this, <hi>That mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is the seat and throne of God.</hi> And moreover this Argument will plead as effectually for freedom from Church censures, as from Civil punishments; for the Church or his Light within, can no more invade Gods Throne and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, than the Magistrate. But his after-expressions intimate that his meaning is of outward actions; for he proceedeth very confusedly, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and saith <hi>that the magistrate is not capable to judge in these maters</hi>: Little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, that this will take away their power even in civil things; for, as to many such, they have not alwayes all the fitness requisite to judge, but must take help: And the same may be said of his Church; and how shall they then draw forth the Sword of the Spirit? But all this is nothing to our present question; for he will not yeeld this power even to such magistrates, as are
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:66147:265"/>
able to judge in these maters; or if he will, he must not plead for Liberty of Conscience.</p>
               <p n="11">11. His second argument is <hi>Pag.</hi> 317. <hi>This power is contrary to the nature of the Gospel.</hi> But why so? <hi>Because Christ said, his Kingdom was not of this world.

This consequence is water weak, for we are not pleading, as his following words suppose, for the Magistrates power, in propagating the Gospel by fire and sword; but for suppressing of what is destructive to the Kingdom of Christ, and is dishonourable to God: And knoweth he not, that in Christs Kingdome, Righteousness betwixt man and man, in things civil, is required? Knoweth he not, that the Gospel teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to live soberly and righteously, as well as holy <hi>Tit.</hi> 2:12. Will he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore say, that Magistrates have not power to punish Injustice and wicked Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness, or what is contrare to sobriety? No: for he hath granted this already: What can his argument then conclude? His saying, That <hi>when Christ sent forth his disciples, he said not to them goe kill, scourge, imprison &amp;c.</hi> Is but a demonstration of his ignorance of the question. Do we say, that M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He citeth <hi>Luk.</hi> 9:55. but most impertinently; for it toucheth not the question, as he himself hath stated it: that act of the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> was not a mater of conscience betwixt God &amp; man immediatly; but an act of incivility and inhumanity: He may better hence inferre, that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates may not punish uncivil, inhumane and indiscreet persons: The quarrel here was not false doctrine, nor perverting, of souls: Nor do we plead, that ministers should use fire and sword; Yea if this prove any thing, it will prove, that Ministers may not Anathematize (which yet himself granted out of <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> as we heard) false teachers; for that looks liker to a praying for fire, or some extraordinary plague out of heaven; than what we plead for. He runneth wilde, when he hence inferreth, that <hi>far less may men now raise fire upon the earth, to destroy them, who believe in Christ</hi>: for though this be true, it saith nothing for them, who are men of the same mettal with the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as to hatred of and enmity against <hi>Iesus of Nazareth</hi>: For in him they do not beleeve, but in a Christ within them. He is as wilde, when he addeth, <hi>That if it was not lawful for the Apostles, to compel others to be of their judgment, far lesse is it lawful for men, who confess themselves fallible to kill all, who will not be of their judgment in Religion, in all points</hi>: For difference of judgment, in the maters of Religion, was not the ground of the Apostles quarrel against <hi>Samaria</hi>: Nor do we speak of killing all, that are not of our judgment, in all points, in maters of Religion: this was the judgment and practice of their Forefathers, the <hi>Phanatick Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts</hi> of <hi>Munster</hi>; not ours; as his owne conscience, or light within him, if it be not blinde and dead both, may tell him. At the same rate of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, he goeth on, and <hi>sayes, Christ did not by outward force, compel others to believe in him</hi>: And citeth <hi>Zech.</hi> 4:6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10:4. <hi>&amp; Psal.</hi> 110 3. For we are not here speaking of the way of propagating the Gospel; but of defending the truth from violent and crafty foxes, who would spoile the vines, yea and

destroy the whole vineyaird. Though we cannot with cudgeling change a fox into a lamb; yet we may by force keep him from devouring the lambes: And the Church desireth to use no other weapons, than such as are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and appointed by Christ himself.

Little adverting how hereby he contradicteth himself; for he granted, that erroneous persons might be cast out by the Church, or he spoke Parables to us; and is not that contrary to this Parable, as he would now interpret it? He granted also, that Magistrates might punish Murderers, and the like: And are not they also children of the Devil, the seed of Satan, that offend, do iniquity, and shall be cast into the furnace of fire &amp;c? What will he now say? Must these all be let alone untill the day of judgment?

But the truth is, the parable is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such, who would think to have a Church here on earth so pure, that there should be no hypocrites in it, and are so severe in their rules and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that while they think to hold out and cast out all hypocrites, they hold out and cast out some of the good wheat; from whom all hypocrites can hardly be discerned; though this <hi>Quaker</hi> tell us, that he that hath a spiritual judgment can discerne hypocrites, as well as hereticks; wherein we will not believe his bare word, if he mean all hypocrites; I know, the servants here saw and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned some tares: but we finde not that they saw all; nor such as could not be plucked up without hazard to the good wheat; as there are some tares, that can hardly be discerned from the good wheat, as <hi>Scultetus</hi> showeth us, in his observations on the place. He is no less impertinent, when he addeth, <hi>that some Magistrates have condemned that for heresie, which was not</hi>: for it is as true, that false judgment hath been given in civil maters, and innocent men have been condemned: and yet he dar not say, that Magistrats may not meddle in these maters.</p>

(To which he should have added <hi>Deut</hi> 17:2.—7. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23:16, 23, &amp; 20:2, 3, 4, 27. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22: <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18: <hi>vers.</hi> 20, 22.) The moral equrty of which lawes binde us Christians, the ground being the same, the sin being an open denyal of the one God, contrare to the first command mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and a drawing of people away both from the fear &amp; from the love of God <hi>Deut.</hi> 13:2, 4. &amp; a seduceing of them to turne away from God; which is called an evil, that should be put away from the midst of them <hi>vers.</hi> 5. &amp; an evil that all should feare <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 13. lest the anger of the Lord were kindled against all, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. These, I say, being moral grounds, and the law founded thereon, we cannot think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the law is also obligeing. Now what sayes he to this?

<pb n="510" facs="tcp:66147:266"/>
to invade the land of their neighboures, and kill all.</hi> Ans. (1.) What will this say to instances, before the Jewish law was erected as <hi>Iob.</hi> 31:26, 27, 28. and of others that were not under that law, as <hi>Ezra.</hi> 7:36. (2.) By this one dash, he maketh the whole judicial law, as to its moral equity, quite useless; And so may hence cast all arguments, proving that Magistrates may punish whoredom, theft, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp;c. (3.) There is a difference betwixt a transient fact once commanded, and a standing law made to continue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the transient act had its peculiar reason, that perished with that occasion; but the law is founded upon, &amp; backed with moral &amp; lasting reasons. (4.) By this meanes the law made against such as gave their seed to Molech <hi>Levit.</hi> 20:2, 3, 4. should be null, as also the lawes against blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy <hi>Levit.</hi> 24:10.-14, 16. &amp; <hi>witches Exod.</hi> 22:18. <hi>Levit.</hi> 20:27. &amp; the like. (5.) Nay, upon this ground, he may reject all the law moral, which was given to the Jewes; for these moral commands were given to them, as well as the other: And if he make no difference, all must go together, &amp; so the whole <hi>Old.

I say not, that all these precepts oblige, unless they be rescinded under the Gospel; and so I need take no notice of his reply; I know, upon the ceasing of that polity, their whole judicial Law, in so far as concerned that Polity, ceased; but not what was founded upon moral equity, and was common to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Nor is that which he urgeth from <hi>vers.</hi> 9. of any weight; for the mater was to be brought before the judges; only the brother, the Father, or husband, as witnesses, in this horried crime, were, according to the usual manner, to lay their hands upon the guilty condemned persons, and to cast the first stone at them; not that they were to judge them, and execute them themselves, for <hi>vers.</hi> 8. thou <hi>shall not pit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

who cannot understand all the intrigus of every question and controversie? See <hi>Deut.</hi> 17:12.

(2.) Though <hi>Nero</hi> be here included; Yet he alone is not here understood; and so though he, being an heathen, was not qualified to judge hereticks in Christianity, Christian Magistrates being qualified may judge, and should judge such evil doers. Magistrates, as such, have power to judge evil doers, some Magistrates in particular cannot judge of some particular evil doers; Yet others, who can, may and ought: Fathers, as Fathers, are to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18:18, 19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12:26, 27. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6:4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:14, 15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4:3, 4, 5. Yet heathen Fathers cannot teach Gospel doctrine; shall therefore Christian Fathers be exeemed from this duty? It followeth not. (3.) Hence no ground to justifie <hi>Nero</hi> in persecuting the truth, no more then for an ignorant Magistrate to kill an innocent man, as guilty of murther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he so judged, through want of understanding.</p>

But it becometh us to adore, and not call God to our bar. The <hi>next</hi> absurdity, which he mentioneth, hath bin spoke to already; for our doctrine giveth no countenance to persecution for righteousness sake: and he might hence as well argue, that Magistrates might not punish murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, because hereby they teach Murtherers to pursue them, when they have power in their hand. Nor doth our doctrine give ground to say, that as heathens persecuted Christians with fire and Sword, Christians, when they have power should deal so with heathens: So that all that which he saith <hi>Pag.</hi> 323, &amp; 324. is to no purpose. Because men in power abuse their authority to suppress truth; it will never follow, that Magistrates should not use their power to suppress wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness and Errour, that eateth as doth a Canker.

Heathens and Pagans can endure as much for their Idolatry and Devil worshipe: Shall we hence inferre, that their way is the truth?

               <head>CHAP. XXIX. Of Warres.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE are now advanced unto his last <hi>Thesis,</hi> in vindication whereof, he handleth several distinct things, which we must speak to severally, and shall beginne with what he speaketh to, in the last place, because of its affinity with what was last spoke to, concerning the power of the Magistrate, He, as we heard, denied power to the Magistrate, to punish hereticks and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers; and though there he granted, that the Magistrate had power to judge in civil maters, and to punish such as wronged their Neighbours, in life or goods, or did any thing hurtful unto humane society; yet here he condemneth all warre joyning with <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> of late; and with the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Tertullianists</hi> of old. And thus, as their doctrine and principles tend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Christianity, as hath been abundantly showne; so in this, they would destroy all Commonwealths; and in a manner, destroy the very office and use of Magistracy: and whether their intent in this may be, to obtaine the fuller freedome and liberty to rage over all, according to their owne mind, I leave to themselvs to judge; this however is not oure, that though the <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> cryed out likewise against Magistrates, who are Christians, their useing the power of the sword, as incompatible with Christianity; yet no persons did more cruelly and barbarously use the power of the sword, then they, when they gote it once into their own hands. I do not finde this man, with <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> denying, that Christians may be Magistrates; but both with them and with <hi>Socinians,</hi> he would take from them the use of the sword, which they are to beare, and that not in vaine, but to execute wrath upon him, that doth evil <hi>Rom.</hi> 13:4. And though he speak particularly against Warre, yet when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no limitations or restrictions, but opposeth himself to all kinde of Warr, without any difference, he taketh away, in effect, the power of the sword, as his arguments will cleare; and when the sword is taken from the Magistrate, the Magistrate is made no Magistrate; and thus Magistracy is destroyed: But it may be he meaneth, with <hi>Socinians,</hi> that Magistrates may not shed bloud, how ever they may punish malefactors; See <hi>Socin. Epist.</hi> 6. <hi>ad Val. Smalcium,</hi> and this will be acceptable doctrine to Murtherers, Paricides Sodomites, &amp;c. but I would suppose, the Sword importeth bloud.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I shall willingly grant, that in nothing more, than in warre, is the fruits of mans rebellion against the Lord to be seen, men appearing against other, as so many ravenous Beasts, Wolves, Tygers and Lions, tearing, devouring and destroying one another, when they know little wherefore: I shall also grant, that it were a most desireable sight to see that Prophecie, <hi>Esai.</hi> 11:6, 7, 8, 9. fulfilled; and all the Professoures at least of the name of Christ, living together as brethren; But while maters thus stand, as they do this day, in the world, to deny the lawfulness of warre, even in self defence; so that a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailer may not defend himself from robbers, nor Merchants from Pyrates, nor
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:66147:268"/>
a Magistrate defend his land and subjects, from the invasion of Turks and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans; I think, is so far from being a medium to prevent the effusion of blood, and to procure peace and tranquillity; that, on the contrary, it should prove the strongest encouragment imaginable unto bloudy Enemies, to prosecute their bloudy designes, and shed the bloud of innocents, like water; for there is no such encouragement as this is, to know and be assured of no resistence, for such birds of prey, as delight in Rapine and Violence: Yet this bloody designe, (for I can call it no other thing, let men cover it over with what pretexts they will) seemeth to me suteable enough to the genius and doctrine of these <hi>Quakers</hi>; who, so far as I can discerne, drive at nothing else, then the reduceing of us to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme: And by this means of disarming all Christians, by perswading them, that it is not lawful to defend themselves by armes, against invadeing Pagans, give all Christendome up as a fit prey unto the lusts of Turcks or Pagans, who may come, when they please, to cut, at freedom, all their throates, that will not with them burne incense, and sacrifice their children to the Devil. The <hi>Quakers</hi> seem very milde and meek, and more ready to suffer, than to do wrongs; but let wise men judge, whither this their doctrine tendeth, and what enemies they make themselves hereby unto all Christian societies; They speak here only of Christians, as if Christians might not have the privilege of beasts, to defend themselves against unjust violence. But say they any thing of Pagans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> No: Pagans must weare the sword, &amp; may offend, if they please; but Christians may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves; for they themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es are neerer of kin to Pagans, than to Christians, as I have cleared all alongs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But let us see, what he alledgeth for this. He citeth <hi>Mat.</hi> 5:38. to the end; And with <hi>Socinians</hi> tels us, <hi>that Christ is here enjoyning a more perfect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way of manifesting love, patience and suffering, than was required of the Iewes by the Law of Moses.</hi> But this, his one and only ground, is abundantly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by our orthodox Divines, writing against the <hi>Socinians</hi>; and the text it self maketh it manifest, that Christ is here only vindicating the Law, from the corrupt glosses of the Pharisees, and Jewish doctors; and therefore, in the very beginning of his vindication, tels the Jewes, that they should not exspect that of him, which they had of their own doctors, <hi>viz.</hi> that he should also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Law: for he was not come for that end, but to fulfil the Law <hi>vers.</hi> 17. and to maintaine it by his doctrine; and therefore threatneth heavy judgments against such, as would teach men to break the Law <hi>vers.</hi> 19. And as to the part of Christ's discourse, which he here pitcheth upon; we need do no more, but shew, that there is no new precept here. It consisteth of two particulars, <hi>first</hi> concerning <hi>not retaliating,</hi> and the <hi>next</hi> about <hi>loving our enemies</hi>: As to the first, <hi>Socinus</hi> himself granteth, that Christ here looketh to the false interpretation of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> whereby some took the meaning of the Law to be, that private persons might, in their private revenge, retaliate, whereas <hi>Moses's</hi> Law was given to Magistrates, as is clear <hi>Exod.</hi> 21:22, 24, 25. <hi>Levit.</hi> 24:19, 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19:18, 19, 20. And against this private revenge, and retaliation, Christ speaketh: and also against this did the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> speak <hi>Deut.</hi> 32:35. comp. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 12:19. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19:18, 19. See also <hi>Gen.</hi> 49:5, 6, 7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20: <hi>ver.</hi> 22.

&amp; 24:29. <hi>Ier.</hi> 51:36. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 25:12. So that Christ's meaning is, that private persons should be ready rather to receive more wrongs, then to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for wrongs received: And <hi>Socinus</hi> himself assenteth to this: It is true <hi>Socinus</hi> thinketh, that Christ here doth prohibite Christians to seek a redress of their wrongs by the help of Magistrates: (which afterward he contradicteth) I know not if our <hi>Quaker</hi> will say so too, seing in the end of his foregoing <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> he would have the Law exerced, and right done to every one, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Persons, in the mater of injuries done to persons, in their goods and lives: And sure, the words of the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. are express enou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h for this. However we see, there is nothing here binding up the hands of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from necessary self defence by Armes &amp; Warres; for nothing is here required but what was required of old, notwithstanding whereof, warres were lawful, as cannot be denied. The same we say, as to the <hi>second</hi> particular; where <hi>Socinus</hi> also granteth, that Christ is not here directly correcting <hi>Moses's</hi> Law: Yet he saith, that <hi>Moses's</hi> Law by Neigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our understood only a Jew, and that <hi>hatred of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> that is, such as were strangers, did natively flow there from: In both which his ignorance of the Law and the Prophets appeareth: For there is nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, that can justly restrick the word <hi>neighbour,</hi> to the Jewes only; else it must be so also restricted in the very moral Law, in the decalogue, as <hi>Command</hi> 9. &amp; 10. which yet Paul extendeth to others <hi>Rom.</hi> 13:8, 9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5:12, 13. And that under the <hi>Old Testam.</hi> there was a Law for loving and doing good to enemies, is clear <hi>Exod.</hi> 23:4, 5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25:22. Thus it also appeareth, that this particular can make nothing against the lawfulness of Warres; seing Warres were lawful under the Law, when this same command of loving enemies had place: The inconsistency then, that this man conceiveth, betwixt these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of the Law, or renewed Lawes by Christ, and lawfulness of self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and warre for this end, is in his owne imagination: And for as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as he is hereof, <hi>Pag.</hi> 364. his ground faileth him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But he thinketh to prove this inconsistency. <hi>Pag.</hi> 364. &amp;c. §. 14. thus. 1. <hi>Christ commandeth us to love our enemies; and this is contrary to war. Ans.</hi> (1.) The Jewes were under a command to love their enemies, and yet they might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defend themselves by War. (2.) We are under a command to love our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Families and Relations, and therefore under a command to defend their and our owne lives from unjust violence; yea others also, that are not so related to us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24:11, 12. <hi>If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slaine: If thou sayest, behold we knew it not, doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? And he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? And shall not he render to every man according to his work</hi>? (3.) We are not to love our enemies more then our other neighbours; And the Law saith, that we should love our Neighbour, as ourselves; and therefore we are not to love our Neighbour more then ourselves: Nor with that degree of affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we are to love Ourselves: And therefore, we are bound to defend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the unjust violence of Enemies or Neighbours. (4.) Yea love can consist with repelling unjust violence with violence; for thereby our enemies are restrained from bringing the guilt of more innocent bloud upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:66147:269"/>
and from doing more mischiefe and wrong: Binding of an enraged mans hands from committing murther, is consistant with love; so is wageing warre against an invading bloudy tyrant, who can no otherwayes be restrained, or hindered. (5.) Love to enemies may appear, in seeking, by all meanes, faire and possible, to satisfie even their unjust desires, to provent a warre, and in a readiness to lay hold on all lawful and saife occasions of making peace. (6.) Love to enemies can consist with warre, when in wageing of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive warre, a private desire of revenge doth not principle, nor animate to the warre; but conscience to the command of God, enjoyning us, even by the Law of nature, to defend our Life, Relations, Neighbours and Countrey, from unjust and bloody invaders. (7.) The whole scope of the place is to presse his followers, to lay aside all private self revenge, and to be so far there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, as to follow with all toakens of love, kindness and respect, even such as were handling them as enemies, hating them, persecuting them, dispite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully useing them, by praying for them, blessing them, &amp;c. But there is no ground to suppose, that our Lords intent was to dissolve the Law of Nature, and to loose Magistrates, Parents, and all Persons, from its obligation; so as a man might not defend himself from an implacable blood-thirsty murtherer and robber; nor a Master of a family might not defend his Wife and Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his owne life, from the unjust invasion of night robbers and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers; nor a Magistrate might not defend his Subjects and Kingdom from bloody cut-throates; to which the Law of Nature, ingraven deeply in the heart of every rational man, doth perpetually oblige.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Next sayes he, <hi>The Apostle saith, that we wrestle not against flesh and blood; but in warres, we do so. Ans</hi> The Apostle sheweth indeed <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6: <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12. what necessity there is for us, to put on the whole armour of God, which is spiritual armour, seing it is not men only (though wicked men also,) but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, both within men, and without men, that we must fight against: Will he hence inferre, that we have no adversaries here in the world, or that we are not to defend ourselves against their unjust malice and cruelty? He may better inferre, that we have not an evil heart of unbeliefe to wrestle against: But how impertinent this reason is, children may see. 3. Sayes he. <hi>The Apostle saith</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10:4. <hi>that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal.

But when we have to do with cut-throats, comeing with guns, swords granads, stinck-pots, pickes, &amp;c. to kill and murther us, we must have, I suppose, suteable weapons 4. Sayes he, <hi>Iames sayes, that wars and fightings come from our lusts, that war in our members, Iam.</hi> 4:1. <hi>Answ.</hi> But <hi>Iames</hi> saith not, that necessary self-defence cometh from lusts.

Sayes he, <hi>The Prophet sayes Esai</hi> 65:25. <hi>they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountaine. Ans.</hi> Let us pray for the fulfilling of this also. 7. Sayes he, <hi>Christs Kingdom is not of this world, Ioh.</hi> 18:36. <hi>Answ.</hi> True, and therefore there needeth not be carnal weapons to carry on his spiritual interest: Yet while we are in the world, and surrounded with Wolves and Lions of this world, who would destroy us, and drive us out of the world, we may defend ourselves, according to that Law, which hath bin in force, since the foundation of the world. 8. Sayes he, <hi>Christ said to Peter, put up thy sword, &amp;c. Ans.</hi> Yet at another time, he said to all his discipses, <hi>sell your coat and buy a sword</hi>: But what sayes this against warres, manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Magistrates, in the defence of their Kingdomes, Subjects and Liberties? Would this <hi>Quaker</hi> have all the Subjects answering their King, when environed with enemies seeking to dethrone him, and crying for their help, with this, Christ would not have <hi>Peter</hi> draw a sword in his Masters defence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no more must we draw our swords in your and our own defence? These look not like loyal and faithful Subjects to their Superiours. 9. He citeth that <hi>Rom.</hi> 12:19. <hi>Answ.</hi> And the place answereth it self, speaking against private revenge, and a taking of God's prerogative from him, in avenging our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but it speaketh nothing against innocent, necessary self-defence. See <hi>vers.</hi> 18. <hi>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peacably with all men.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth not this, when it is impossible, and we have done as much as lieth in us, and all in vaine, The robber will cut our throat, if we resist not, purse, &amp; cloathes and all we have, will not satisfy him, must we hold up our throat when we can help ourselvs? The Apostle giveth no command for this. <hi>Lastly</hi> he sayes, <hi>Christ calleth his to bear their crosse, to patience, to simplicity. Answ.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. He cometh next <hi>Pag.</hi> 366. &amp;c. §, 15. to answere some of our Arguments, and <hi>first</hi> to that taken from the practice of <hi>Abraham</hi> before the Law, and of the people of Israel under the law, he saith foure things. 1. That <hi>they also circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, which is not now lawful. Answ.</hi> Circumcision was a Ceremonial Law, &amp; no precept of the Law of Nature; as necessary sinless self defence is; which was practised by all Nations; but the Lord did not prescribe any thing in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, which was the common practice of all nations; yea the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Lawes were to discriminate them from all nations. He saith 2. <hi>That the Israelites might not make warre neither offensive, nor defensive, of their own will, nor by their owne counsel or conduct, but were to consult the Oracle of God. Answ.</hi> (1.) I do not say, that warre should now be undertaken without consulting of God, and his Oracles; his word, I mean, and standing Law, whereby we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:66147:270"/>
his minde, as well, as if we had the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> to go to. (2.) I finde not that in all cases, the Israelites did consult the Oracle of God, in their undertaking a warre, but only in difficult cases: When they heard, that the two tribes and half had built an Altar by Jordan, the whole Congregation ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themselves together at <hi>Shiloh</hi> to go up to war against them; but of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting the Oracle of God, we read not <hi>Iosh.</hi> 22:12. So also in that war under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken against the tribe of <hi>Benjamin Iudg.</hi> 20. only they asked counsel, who should goe up first <hi>vers.</hi> 18. though after a defate they changed the question <hi>vers.</hi> 23, 26, &amp;c. He saith 3. <hi>Their warres against the nations were figures of the inward war of Christians, against the World, the Flesh, and the Devil. Answ.</hi> (1.) This is said, but not proved. (2.) What saith this to the warres among themselves; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel?</hi> This was said by <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> the <hi>Familist,</hi> before now. He saith 4. <hi>Something is prohibited by Christ Mat.</hi> 5:26. <hi>which was permitted to the Iewes, because of their rudeness. Answ.</hi> The contrary is manifest, as appeareth from what is said: It is but a groundless notion of <hi>Socinians,</hi> to say, that Christ there giveth any new precepts; while as he, who came not to dissolve or weaken the Law, in the least, did only vindicate the lasting moral Law from corrupt glosses, and interpretations; as is manifest.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To a <hi>second Argument, to wit,</hi> That defence is of the Law of nature, which Religion doth not destroy: he Answereth, <hi>Be it so; yet by obedience to commend ourselves to God, in faith and patience, is not to destroy nature, but to perfect it. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,</hi> But the argument is not taken from the corrupt nature of man, which grace changeth; but from the standing Law of Nature, which is Gods perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obligeing Law, and is not weakened, or altered by the Gospel, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever alteration grace maketh in us. To a 3 <hi>Argum.</hi> taken from <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> not disproving of warres, in the Souldiers, that came unto him, to ask him what they should do? <hi>Luk.</hi> 3:14. He answereth <hi>What then? The question is not of Iohns, but of Christs doctrine, Iohn was not that Prophet, yet Iohn did prohibite them, what is proper to Souldiers, to wit, violence and deceit, without which there is no warre.

Further, though he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to grant the office of Magistracy to be lawful; Yet his arguments will as well prove that unlawful, as the use of Armes: and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> will alleige, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy it self was a Jewish ceremony; and that with as great probability, as he can alleige warre to have been ceremonial: And as he granteth it lawful, for such as are not Christians to make warre; so will they grant it lawful for such to be Magistrates; but not for Christians. Yea <hi>Socinus</hi> himself, though he will not have it lawful for privat persons, to warre; Yet he granteth it lawful for Kings, Princes and Magistrats, without any impeachment of their Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and why it should be lawful to these, and not also to those, I see not: And it seemeth he would have the Magistrats warring without souldiers, which how they can well do, I know not.</p>

The Gospel destroyeth not what is just and right, it taketh not away Magistracy, nor that which is necessary to Magistracy, and without which Magistracy cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, nor Magistrates execute their office. Will any man say, that it is more just

and equitable, that Magistrates leave their Subjects as a prey to the lust of every oppressing, plundering, robbing and killing enemy, then with armes to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and resist these oppressing and murthering adversaries? And if not, were it not a great act of injustice to his own Subjects, thus to expose them to the cruel &amp; bloody sword of invaders?

But as to this question, let us view, what our <hi>Confess.</hi> saith <hi>Ch.</hi> 22: §. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>A lawful oath is a part of Religious worship (Deut.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.) <hi>wherein, upon just occasion, the person swearing solemnely calleth God to witness what he asserteth or promiseth; and to judge him according to the truth, or falshood of what he asserteth (Exod.</hi> 20:7. <hi>Levit</hi> 19:12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:23. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6:22, 23.) <hi>The name of God only, is that by which men ought to swear; and therein it is to be used, with all holy fear and reverence (Deut.</hi> 6:13.) <hi>Therefore to swear vainly, or rashly by that glorious and dreadful name; or to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred (Exod.</hi> 20:7. <hi>Ior.</hi> 5 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The only ground of his contrary opinion, is Christs words <hi>Mat.</hi> 5:34—37 and <hi>Iam.</hi> 5:12. which he so understandeth, as simply prohibiting all Oaths what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somever, wherein he is worse than the <hi>Socinians,</hi> for they say, that Christ added this unto the Law, that we should not sweare rashly and vainly; nor make promissory Oaths concerning things future.

ground; and supposeth, that Christ is here amending and correcting the Law, or adding to it; and so giving new Lawes: For if Christ only be interpreting the Law, (as we say) and it be certain, that the Oaths, we maintaine, were warrantably used under the Law; Christs Words must not be so largely taken, as he would. But a right consideration of Christs Words, together with his scope, will make all clear. Christ being here interpreting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> explaining and vindicating the Law, and so correcting and reprehending the false, laxe and erroneous glosses, which the Pharisees, and the jewish Doctors, had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Law withal; he cometh in these verses to vindicat the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which these loose Casuists (whom he meaneth, when he saith <hi>vers.</hi> 33. <hi>ye have heard, that it hath been said by them of old time</hi>) had so interpreted, as if nothing had been thereby prohibited, but only forswearing, that is, not to performe, what was vowed and sworne to be done, <hi>thou shalt not forswear thy self, but shalt performe unto the Lord, thine Oaths</hi>: And thence gave way to rash, idle, vaine, and inconsiderat Oaths, yea and to swearing by other things, than by the true and living God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To correct which corruption and abuse, Christ rightly interprets the Law, as prohibiteing all such swearing by any creature at all, saying <hi>vers.</hi> 34. <hi>But I say unto you, swear not at all.</hi> But how is this <hi>not at all</hi> to be taken? The following words clear, <hi>Neither by heaven—nor by the earth—neither by Ierusalem—neither by thine head.</hi> And then addeth, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their rash and profane Oaths in common discourse <hi>vers.</hi> 37. <hi>But let your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication be yea, yea; nay, nay.</hi> Whereby he sheweth, what should be our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary assertions, or negations, in our ordinary discourse; and what way we should take to guard against rash and unnecessary Oaths; <hi>to wit,</hi> that we should use uprightness and sincerity in our dealings, and speaches, that so no more may be required, then asserting or denying, or at most doubling of our assertions, or denials? And then addeth, <hi>for whatsoever is more then these, cometh of evil,</hi> that is, whatsoever is superfluous, or redundant and not necessary, (as all vaine, and needless Oaths, and asseverations are) is sinful, and of the Devil. So that there is nothing here, in the least, giving ground to reject all Oaths, as sinful; but only such, as are by Creatures, or are needless and superfluous, in our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary communication. And to this same purpose doth <hi>Iames</hi> speak <hi>Chap.</hi> 5:12. saying, <hi>But above all things, my brethren, swear not;</hi> how that is to be understood, he explaineth in the following words, <hi>Neither by the heaven, neither by the eart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(2.) That Christ correcteth or amendeth the Law, or dischargeth any thing, which was lawful by the moral Law of God; is but a <hi>Socinian</hi> dream, without any ground, or warrand, as is apparent, through that whole Sermon, and from the very first words of this part thereof <hi>vers.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>Think not, that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets: I am not come to destroy, but fulfil: for verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth passe, one jot, or one-title, shall in no wise passe from the Law, till all be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</hi> But sure, if Christ had added to the law, or taken away from it, he had in so far destroyed it, and made it an imperfect law, and had taken away from it many Jotes and Titles, contrary to his owne expresse profession and declaration. (3.) The place <hi>Mat.</hi> 23:16—23. doth clearly explaine this; for there, their unlawful wayes of swearing are reproved; and they discovered to be fools, in alleiging such grounds, as they did, for their profane licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious swearing, and satisfying themselves with such pretexts; but not one word declareing it unlawful in all cases, to sweare by the Name of God. (4.) These words <hi>by any other Oath,</hi> are to be explained by what went before; and so to be understood of any other such like Oath, as he had instanced in; otherwise Christs discourse shall be incoherent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To that, which is said, That swearing by the Name of God, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Father, and so cannot be now contradicted by the Son, who is one with the Father, he saith, <hi>That the father appointed many ceremonial Lawes
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:66147:274"/>
which were shadowes of good things to come, whereof Christ was the substance. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,</hi> This is very true; but nothing to the purpose; for he shall never prove that swearing by the Name of God was a ceremonial thing, being a part of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Worship, taught by the Law of Nature <hi>Gen.</hi> 21: <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 2: <hi>vers.</hi> 12. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36:21. and is several times put for the whole moral Worshipe <hi>Esai.</hi> 19: <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 45:23. <hi>Psal.</hi> 63:11. And where, I pray, and when, was this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial precept (if it be such) first given? But this one thing is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this dream (not to mentione, that we cannot understand, whereof it can be a shadow, or type: nor how then, as we shall hear, it was used, when types were abrogated) to wit, that Christ did not so early beginne to cry down and to annull the force and power of the ceremonial Law; but being made under the Law (ceremonial, as well as moral) was observant thereof in all points, to his dying day: for in the very night wherein he was betrayed, he observed the feast of the Passeover; and he came to ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il all righteousness: How shall we then imagine, that in his very first Sermon, he should abrogate the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, and that in moe points then one, if our <hi>Quaker</hi> be to be believed? For he will have the mater of Warres a ceremony too; and will affirme, that Christ abrogated that ceremony also, in the last words of this Chapter, as we heard?</p>
               <p n="6">6. He moveth this <hi>Argum.</hi> in the next place <hi>Pag.</hi> 355. That Oaths cannot be a part of the ceremonial Law, because they were in use before the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the law: An Argument, wherein I see little strength; yet I think it concerneth him to tell us, when this ceremonial law was first given, and to whom? What answereth he? <hi>It must be showne,</hi> saith he, <hi>that it is an eternal and immutable precept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Answ.</hi> And what needeth more for this, then to show, that it is a part of worshipe performed unto God, which the law of Nature hath taught all nations, and which hath no affinity with what is typical and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, having a manifestly moral import; for it is a solemne acknowledgment of Gods All-seeing eye, of his Truth and Veracity, of his Righteousness and Justice, and of his Power and Might: for therein he is called to witness a secret and hidden truth, and the swearer doth professe, that God is acquanted with the secrets of all things, and with the Intentions of the heart: Therein we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that God abhorreth lying and dissimulation, and will be a swift witness against false swearers; and in justice will be avenged of such, as mock him, in calling the God of truth to bear witness to an untruth, and shew his power in punishing and pursueing such: all which being ingraven on the heart of Man by nature, and being laid, as the ground of this practice among all Nations, and having nothing ceremonial in it, evince this duty to be moral, and the commands enjoyning it, perpetually obligeing. He tels us, <hi>that Abel and Cain did offer the tythes of their fruit, and the first fruites of their land.</hi> But I read not this in Scripture: I finde it said <hi>Gen.</hi> 4:3, 4. that <hi>Cain brought of the fruit of the ground, and Abel of the firsilings of his flock,</hi> but no more: no word of Tithes, nor of First fruites.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He moveth another Objection, after his owne minde; as if we said, that Swearing by the name of God is a moral duty, because it is mentioned with
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:66147:274"/>
God's essential and moral worshipe: But what he meaneth by <hi>essential worshipe,</hi> I know not; nor know I, who useth that terme. This argument I shall thus urge: If swearing by the name of God be not only urged, together with other acts of moral worship; but also as a comprehensive part of moral worshipe, and as further exegitical and explicative of other parts of moral worshipe mentioned; then it must be a part of morall worshipe: But the former is true. Therefore, &amp;c. The <hi>Major,</hi> I suppose, needeth no proofe. The <hi>Minor</hi> is clear <hi>Deut.</hi> 6: <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt sweare by his name:</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 10:20. <hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy good, him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and sweare by his name.</hi> In both which places, we see, it is not only attended before and after with precepts purely moral; nor only joyned in the same verse, with duties purely moral; but, as the other duties, mentioned in the same verse, are truely comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of that moral obedience that is due to God; so is this, and each one of these commands contribute to explicate the other; so that all are but various expressions of that one duty, of owneing the true God, for their only God, conforme to the first commandement. Adde to these passages <hi>Ier.</hi> 3:4. where it is pressed as a comprehensive duty of all moral obedience, as being the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest declaration of their true Repentance and Turning unto God, and of their putting away all abominations out of God's sight, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. <hi>If thou will return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return unto me; and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove: And thou shalt swear, the Lord liveth in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Ier.</hi> 12: <hi>vers.</hi> 14. to the end, where the Lord is offering salvation to the Nations about, upon condition, that they will performe this comprehensive duty, and <hi>shall learne to sweare by my name,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>the Lord liveth, as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then shall they be built in the midst of my people; but if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up, and destroy that nation.</hi> Adde <hi>Psal.</hi> 63:11. <hi>The King shall rejoyce in God, and every one that sweareth by him shall glory.</hi> Let the <hi>Quaker</hi> now see, if his answers will suite this argument, thus proposed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another of our Arguments he mentioneth, in the <hi>fift</hi> place, which is this, as I shall forme it: If that which Christ forbiddeth, be of the Devil, then he forbiddeth not the swearing by the name of God: But the former is true, from the words of the text, <hi>for whatsoever is more then these cometh of evil, vers.</hi> 37. or of that evil one <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> out of that evil one, who is exercised in all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. See <hi>Beza</hi> on the place. The <hi>Consequence</hi> of the <hi>Major</hi> is clear; for swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the name of God, was once commanded of God; but God never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that, which did flow from the Devil: Nor can it be said, with any face of reason, that any of the ceremonial Lawes, were of that evil one, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of evil. How then can this man say, that this which Christ saith, cometh of evil, was a ceremonial Law, enjoyned by God? What replyeth he? <hi>Some things,</hi> saith he, <hi>are good because commanded, and evil because forbidden, and some things are commanded because good, and forbidden because evil: Thus cerem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nials are good, as long as commanded, and evil when forbidden under the Gospel, Ans.</hi> (1.) But to me, there is nothing good morally, but what is commanded, and as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:66147:275"/>
and no duty of man can be said to be commanded because morally good, 'antecedent to the command of the great Law-giver, whose good will and pleasure is the ground of all morality among men. (2.) Though the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prohibited ceremonies, be evil under the Gospel; Yet we cannot say, that they are or ever were of that evil One, or come of evil. Here he tels us <hi>Pag.</hi> 356. <hi>That oathes did prefigure God's truth and fidelity. Ans.</hi> That which is prefigured, is something to come; then it seemeth God under the Law, was not true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for these attributes were but prefigured to exist in the dayes of the Gospel: Is not this Blasphemy? He would do well to retract this, otherwayes his errour is worse, then he is a war of. He giveth us another morality of oaths, <hi>viz. Testification of truth, which was before all oathes, and will abide, when all oathes are away. Answ.</hi> This is indeed the proper end and use of oathes, to testify to truth: But what he meaneth, when he saith, it is its morality, I must waite till he explaine himself. <hi>As long</hi> sayes he, <hi>as men abide true, there is no necessity of oaths</hi>: and for this he citeth some words of <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> and others. But what then? This would rather plead for the necessary continuance of oathes, because men are not true enough: And knoweth he not, that good civil Lawes may be occasioned by evil manners? Knoweth he not, that by reason of the fall, many things became moral natural, secundarily, that were not primarily natural? And why may not oathes come in among these? He giveth us an Argument, thus, <hi>That which was not from the beginning, nor had any use in the beginning, that had not its rise from the will of God, but from the work of the Devil, being caused of evil. viz. of infidelity, lies and deceit, and was chiefly invented by men, as a remedy of this evil, in which they did invocate the names of their idols, and which was granted to the Israelits as children, that they might abstaine from the heathens Oaths Ier.</hi> 12:16. <hi>is no moral and eternal command. But such a thing is an Oath. Answ.</hi> This is, I confess, a very ill favoured argument: For the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption is pregnant with blasphemy, and that upon his owne grounds; for he said before, that this swearing by the Name of God was a ceremonial command of God: Now is it not blasphemy to say, that any of the ceremonial Lawes of God had not their rise from the will of God; but from the work of the Devil? Is it truth to say, that any of Gods commands, especially such, as belong to the Gospel, as all ceremonies do, are chiefly invented by men? Faith in Jesus Christ was not from the beginning, nor was of any use in the beginning, and was occasioned only by the fall; is it true therefore, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> had not its rise from the will of God, but from the work of the Devil, and was chiefly invented by man? (2.) If swearing be such a thing, it must be intrinsecally evil: how cometh it then, that we hear sometimes of Gods swearing? What, would God do that, or any thing like that, which had its rise from the Devil? (3.) Many things became moral, yea natural, after the fall, which were not necessary from the beginning; these are called moral natural secundarily; and yet had their rise from the will of God; and not from the work of the Devil, as covering our nakedness, which this man will grant, unless he be an <hi>Adamit</hi> too. (4.) Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, lies and deceit, among men after the fall, might be an occasion of a law, and the law be good, necessary and immutable for all that, and be no

                  </gap>, that the Lord commanded the Israelites to swear by his name, because they were children, far lesse, to bring them off the useing of Heathens Oaths; the place <hi>Ier.</hi> 12:16. evinceth the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That God would have the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens learning to swear by the Name of the true God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A <hi>Sixt</hi> Argument of ours, he proposeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 357. thus, God hath sworne, therefore to swear is good: And indeed this doth manifestly evince, that to swear is not intrinsecally evil, nor floweth not from the work of the Devil; nor was principally invented by Man: and the Scripture bringeth God frequently in swearing <hi>Gen.</hi> 50:24. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13:5, 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33:1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.16, 23, 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 32:10, 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1:8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8:35. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 5:6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 95:11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 110:4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6:17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7:21, 22. For answere he tels us out of <hi>Athanasius, That God cannot swear properly, because he sweareth not by another, but by himself. Answ.</hi> And this is very true; But yet the Scripture saying that he sweareth, and expressing his Counsels and determinations, as confirmed by an Oath, to assure us of the Truth and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability thereof, confirmeth what we say, <hi>to wit,</hi> that it is not simply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and to be condemned. God cannot properly Repent, and yet he is said to Repent, and this hath a moral instruction to us. God hath not properly bowels of pity and commiseration, and yet what is spoken of the moving of his bowels, sheweth that our pity and commiseration is not simply sinful, but good and lawful in some cases. A <hi>Seventh</hi> Argum. is this, Christ did swear. Out of what Author, he hath this, I know not: of Christs swearing I read not; but of that earnest asseveration <hi>Verily Verily,</hi> I read often: And if our <hi>Quaker</hi> will so strickly interpret these words of Christ, <hi>whatsoever is more then these,</hi> to wit, then yea and nay, <hi>cometh of evil,</hi> as he doth; he must also condemne these asseverations; for they are more, then yea and no? And that same asseveration may be construed for an Oath, if we consider <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13, 14, But he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>That though Christ did swear, yet it will not follow. that we may; because he was under the Law, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ did abrogate that Ceremonial Law, as our <hi>Quaker</hi> thinketh, in that sermon of his upon the mount; and if it was then abrogate, it could not oblige him thereafer. (3.) This agreeth not with <hi>Hierom's</hi> answere, which he addeth, but rather contradicteth it; for <hi>Hierom</hi> draweth his answer from his being Lord, and under no Law.</p>
               <p n="10">10. An <hi>Eight</hi> Argument we use, which is better founded, and that is taken from the practice of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who several times, in weighty maters, and at necessary occasions, did use solemne Oaths and Attestations <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>God is my witness. &amp;</hi> 9:1. <hi>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me witness, in the holy Ghost.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:23. <hi>moreover I call God for a record on my soul. &amp;</hi> 11:10. <hi>as the truth of Christ is in me.

                  </gap> of God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to judge according to the truth or falshood of what is said. And whereas he saith, that they would not refuse this, but oft used such; but would not adde the outward ceremony required; he sheweth, how easily they can straine at a gnat, and swallow a camel, as the Scribes and Pharisees did <hi>Mat.</hi> 23: <hi>v.</hi> 24. As if <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant would have sworne willingly by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, but would have scrupled at the putting of his hand under <hi>Abrahams</hi> thigh <hi>Gen.</hi> 24:2, 3. who seeth not what a childish vanity this is? Yet I will not plead for any ceremony, that may justly give offence. But (2.) Must he not grant, that even this much is more then yea and nay, and consequently cometh of evil? Was this much from the beginning? Was it of any use, in the beginning? Was it not caused of the evil of infidelity &amp;c? And was it not therefore the work of the Devil? and was it not invented of men, for a cure of infidelity and deceite? How then can he defend it according to his own principles? It seemeth the <hi>Quakers</hi> may do, what we may not. He answereth 2. <hi>That this contradicteth our opinion; for Paul was not here swearing before a Magistrat. Answ.</hi> Nor do we adduce this instance to prove that; but only to prove, that all swearing under the <hi>New Testam.</hi> is not unlawful: will he say, that Christ <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. speaketh only of Oaths taken before Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates? Or that such only were a part of the Ceremonial Law? He must then restrick these words of <hi>Christ</hi> and of <hi>Iames, sweare not at all,</hi> to Oaths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by Magistrates, contrare to his own fore-mentioned glosses. What difference is there betwixt our solemne calling God to witness to a particular, of our own accord, when necessity and the urgency of the matter presseth to it, and doing this at the command or desire of the Magistrate, for ending of a controversie? I should think, that if I may do it, of my owne accord, I may much more do it, when called thereto by a Magistrate. But his 3. Answer will cut the knot, <hi>The question is not, what Paul or Peter did, but what their and our Lord taught,</hi> saith he. <hi>Answere,</hi> Then <hi>Paul</hi> must be a transgressour, and that oftener then once or twice: But I suppose, in writing of his Epistles, he was acted immediatly by the Spirit of God: and I shall not readily think, that the Spirit would have acted him so frequently to have transgressed Christs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press command, <hi>swear not at all,</hi> if our <hi>Quakers</hi> exposition be genuine. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Lib. de mendacio ad Consentium Chap.</hi> 15. learneth from this practice of <hi>Paul,</hi> how to interpret Christs Words, <hi>Iuravit. ipse Apostolus, in Epistolis suis, &amp; sic ostendit quomodo accipiendum esset, quod dictum est, dico vobis, non jurate om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino—sed quia praecepti violati reum Paulum, praesertim in Epistolis conscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, atque editis ad spiritualem vitam, salutemque populorum, nofas est dicere.

Were not the holy men of old called unto this essential verity? how came it then, that they did also sweare? Such as <hi>Abraham Gen.</hi> 21:24. <hi>Iacob. Gen</hi> 31:53. <hi>Ioseph. Gen:</hi> 47:35. <hi>Moses Iosh.</hi> 14:9. <hi>David</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20:3. &amp; 24:22 <hi>Ionathan</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20:16. <hi>Eliah.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17:1. <hi>Gedaliah.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25:24. <hi>Asa.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15:14. <hi>Obadiah.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18:10. &amp; <hi>Elisha.</hi> 2 <hi>King</hi> 2:6? Are not Angels called unto this essential verity? How came it then that they did swear <hi>Dan.</hi> 12:17. <hi>Revel.</hi> 10:5, 6? He citeth
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:66147:277"/>
some passages of some heathens <hi>Pag.</hi> 360. who would not swear: And what can this prove? And what will <hi>Pythagoras</hi> prohibition evince? Or <hi>Socrates</hi> his requireing that mens words should be firmer than oaths? Or <hi>Plato's</hi> appearing against it? These and the like may be good arguments for him, whose Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is but Paganish; but have no force with us? though I grant, these and the like may shame Christians, who regard even oathes so little. He hath <hi>Pag.</hi> 361. a number of bare citations of places of some Fathers and Others, without giving us their words; any, who hath these books, may peruse them, and see what they say: All that I shall say is this. Though it be true, that many of the Fathers, did in this assent to <hi>Pelagius</hi>; yet the more common opinion was, that Christians might in some cases lawfully sweare, which they ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the practice of <hi>Paul</hi>: See <hi>Vossius Hist. Pelag. lib.</hi> 5. par. 2. <hi>Antith.</hi> 1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 513. &amp;c. And let the Reader peruse the citations he hath there adduced, and he will see, that some of this <hi>Quakers</hi> citations, and Authors, are against himself; such, as <hi>Cyprian, Tertullian, Augustine, Polycarp,</hi> and others. The primitive Christians would not swear, it is true, neither by the <hi>Genius,</hi> nor by the <hi>fortune</hi> of the Emperious: See <hi>Tertul. Apol. Cap.</hi> 31. and from this some might gather, that they would not swear at all: which was certainly a mistake. And we read, that the Primitive Christians did sweare to be faithful to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as <hi>Vossius</hi> sheweth out of <hi>Vegetius lib</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. &amp; <hi>Arnobius lib.</hi> 4. see also <hi>Dio</hi> in <hi>M. Antonino; Tertul.</hi> de <hi>Cor. mil.</hi> c. 1. <hi>Eusebii histor. lib,</hi> 5. c. 5. He sheweth also how they used to sweare by the Eucharist, out of <hi>Eusebii Histor. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 35, The last argument, which he mentioneth, is not worth the naming, and so I leave it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For a Conclusion to this, let us take notice, that <hi>Augustine</hi> was only labouring to keep oft unnecessary oathes; and would have one and other shuning what they could the giving of oathes: But would not simply condemne the taking or giving of oathes, in weighty maters, even under the Gospel: And therefore speaking upon that sermon of Christ, on the mount; and having mentioned the expressions of <hi>Paul,</hi> formerly spoken of, he addeth. <hi>Ita intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligitur, praecepisse Deum, ne Iuretur; ne quisquam sicut bonum, appetat jusjuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, &amp; assiduitate jurandi, ad perjurium per consuetudinem delabatur.

                  </gap> for these as lawful, and as no way contrary to Christian Religion; as he saith <hi>Pag.</hi> 334. for howbeit we love not to place too much of Religion in the outward garb; nor think, that people should affect to be singular therein, and too pharisaically make a proclamation of their being such or such persons, as if the outward vestment could make the man a Christian of such or such a magnitude; nor like we such clothes of distinction, as the Popish Orders have, knowing how much Superstitious vanity moveth thereunto, and worketh under it: Yet we as much hate and abhore that prodigious abuse, that so much aboundeth this day, and provoketh the Lord to anger, as he can. We know Christianity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth all Gravity, Sobriety, Modesty and Moderation; and howbeit distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Qualities, Conditions, and Offices, will admit a distinction of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, both for mater and fashion; Yet in all there ought to be gravity and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty studied and followed: we remember, as well, as he, and presse the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of that word of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2:9, 10. <hi>In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety, not with broidered haire, or pearls or costly aray: but (which becometh women professing godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) with good works.</hi> And of that of <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3:3, 4. <hi>whose adorning let it not be that outward, of plaiting the haire, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; but the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</hi> Yet we dar not say, that it is sinful to wear any thing more, than what is simply necessary for covering of nakedness, and keeping from cold; knowing that there is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament allowed, that suiteth with Gravity, Shamefastness and Sobriety, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various conditions and qualities of Persons; though notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing we would have no offence given, in things indifferent; nor any just cause of stumbling, either to one or other; but do rather desire, that persons would keep within that measure, which their condition, and the custome of the place, would allow, than that their good should be evel spoken of, and Christianity fall under a reproach. And as to Ribbens, Laces, and the like, which, it seemeth, he inveigheth most against; though we could well desire, that they were utterly in disuse, where any ground of offence is given thereby; and willingly confess, that both as to these and several other things, there is too much Vanity, Lightness and Prodigality obvious and apparent; Yet we dar not simply condemne all the use of such things, as sinful, and repugnant to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity:
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:66147:278"/>
And we suppose, there may lurk as much real Pride, Vanity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, under a garb outwardly modest, and free of those toyes; as sometimes will do under a garb accompanied with them. As for this Comoedies, he may know, that some, who are no <hi>Quakers,</hi> have said as much and more against them, than he hath done, or can do: And yet we dar not simply condemne the use of all lawful and sinless Recreations, the use whereof with Christian mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and sobriety, may be useful, if not necessary, to some bodies, &amp; a mean to fit them for more noble service and work.</p>

Having thus dispatched these things, and having now considered all the parts and pieces of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Profession, held forth by this their Advocat and Patron, in the forgoing <hi>Theses</hi> and their Vindication; we come now, in the last place, to speak to that, which I look upon, as their proper and peculiar characteristick; as that which really differenceth them from all other hereticks, schismaticks, or erroneous persons, that have appeared to this day, in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world, so far as I can yet learne: Hither til I have met with nothing in all their Opinions, and Practices, which he is pleased here to lay before us, as owned by them, and defended by him (except their <hi>Quaking,</hi> which ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their denomination, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is remarkable, that the first and only person among Christians, that we can hear of using this mode, was the founder of the Jesuites, <hi>Loyala</hi>: but he did it but once, that we hear of, before a Governour, where he was chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged for a Spye, and yet it may be sufficient to make him also the Father, and founder of the new order of uncivil <hi>Quakers.</hi>

It may seem strange, that these Men, who owne no other Christ or Scripture, but the Light within, and take that for all, are thus against all good manners and civility, refuseing to salute persons, in the way; or to give the least civil signification of honour and respect to equals or superiours; when even among the wilde savage <hi>Indians,</hi> such moroseness and pedantick clownish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would be abhorred, being taught some other thing by the natural Light within them? However, as upon the one hand, we may observe, the enmity, that Satan hath at Mankinde, is such, as maketh him hate all things, that looketh like humanity, for their sakes; and therefore will have these his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded followers, weare no other character of cognizance, but such, as may make them openly appear as enemies to humanity and civility; so upon the other hand, we may observe the holy hand of a righteous God, in this, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up, to an unmanning of themselves, &amp; to a denying of that, which, in their outward carriage and gesture, might difference them, not only from

And though no titles were to be given to any, to testifie our respect to, and esteem for persons of eminency, whether as to Power and Authority, or as to gifts and partes; Yet this could make nothing for their blunt and rustick <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee.</hi> He addeth some Reasons, as. 1. <hi>These titles are no part of that obedience, which we owe to Magistrates; nor is any thing thereby added to that subjection, which consisteth in obedience to their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful commands. Answ.</hi> Though it be no part of obedience, to use titles; Yet it may be a part of that Honour and Respect, which is due unto them. And the fift command sayes, <hi>honour thy Father and thy Mother</hi>; and certainly it is no signe of honour to Magistrates and great Personages, to speak to them, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes then we would do to our footboyes, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do. 2. Sayes he, <hi>We finde not such titles in the Scripture, either under the Law, or under the Gospel; but when Princes, or Nobles, &amp; Kings were spoke to, this simple compellation was used</hi> O King; <hi>or with the addition of the name of the Person, as,</hi> King Agrippa. <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) We have seen other titles of honour and respect, above; as <hi>My Lord O King,</hi> and this our <hi>Quakers</hi> will not give to the highest; nor doth this man, in all his Epistle dedicatory to the King, prefixed to his <hi>Apology,</hi> say so much, as once, <hi>O King,</hi> or <hi>my Lord O King;</hi> only he giveth him <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou,</hi> as he would give his owne servant. (2.) These compellations, according to the then custome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were the highest, and only given to Kings; and inferiour Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons had their owne peculiar titles; and as no man did then scruple to give high persons, titles or stiles, due to their places, according to the received custome of the time and place; why should these scruple now; and not only refuse to give them such titles, as are now usual; but refuse to give them any at all; or to put any difference betwixt them, and the poorest beggar, that sitteth on the dung hill? This evinceth, that though they pretend want of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture warrant; Yet there is some other thing, which is the real cause.</p>
               <p n="7">7. His. 3. Reason is, <hi>This layeth a necessity on Christians to lie, in giving the titles of Grace, and Eminency, &amp;c. to such as have nothing worthy of these, or answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Answ.</hi> Under favour of his <hi>Thouship,</hi> he mistaketh the ground of these titles, supposing that they are given because of personal corresponding enduements; while as they are only given, because of that Place and Power, which they, in the providence of God, are in possession of: But neither can
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:66147:280"/>
this pretext be a real ground of their practice; for they will not give any titles to their own brethren the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in whom they dar not deny, but Christ is, and liveth; Yea and the whole Trinity; which, when I think upon, I wonder they do not fall down and worshipe one another, seing they acknowledge that Christ, and the Trinity, is in every <hi>Quaker;</hi> But I remember what was said to be done to <hi>I. Naylor</hi> at <hi>Bristoll</hi>; it may be, they shall do so to one another, ere long, and would have done so, ere now, if fear had not hindered it: And what meaneth their gazeing one upon another a considerable time, when they first meet? This would look like some sort of worshipe: If not, it is like the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, that (and thus can only their practice be reconciled with their principles) their God, and their Christ, and their Trinity, which they say is in every man, dormant; but living, (the light having gote room and enlargment) in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is not the true and living God, but a God of their owne making and imagination: and this I beleeve to be true. His 4. Reason toucheth the Pope and his clergy: And there we reject both place and title. His 5. Reason is against the Title of <hi>majesty</hi> given to Kings, which he saith is especially and peculiarly given to God, in the Scriptures, and not to men: But he is here also mistaken, for though it be spoken of God 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29:11. Yet <hi>vers.</hi> 25. (which his Concordance might have pointed him to) it is said, that <hi>the Lord magnified Solomon, exceedingly, in the fight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him royal majesty</hi>: And <hi>Psal.</hi> 21:5. (another of the places cited by him) it is not given to God, but by God to the King: And <hi>Psal.</hi> 29:4. (another of his citations) it is attributed to the thunder: What meaneth this man, thus to cite Scriptures at randome, without once considering what he is doing? He addeth, <hi>that Proud Nebuchadnezzar took this title to himself, Dan.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30. <hi>and was shortly therefore rebuked. Answ.</hi> Why did he not look also <hi>vers.</hi> 36. where <hi>excellent majesty</hi> was added unto him, after his restauration? And why did he not look to <hi>Dan.</hi> 5:18. where <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, that the <hi>most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar a Kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour</hi>? And againe <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp; for the majesty that he gave him,</hi> &amp;c? His Concordance could have helped him here, to have corrected his owne mistake; but his light was asleep.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He addeth a 5. Reason <hi>Pag.</hi> 339. <hi>all these titles are to be rejected, because we are to seek the honour, which is from God, and not that which is from below. Answ.</hi> We are not pleading for ambitious seeking of honour from men, more then the praise of God; and upon this account the rejecting of Christ and the profession of his name, for fear of missing thereby the honour, applause and esteem of men: This is not it, we plead for; and this is it, which Christ condemned <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5:44. &amp; 12:43. But we are pleading for giving honour to whom honour is due. What he speaketh of artes and wiles used to obtaine these honours, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing to the purpose; for this is not the ground of their practice; else they should give honour to some: For it is hard to say, that all use such indirect courses, as he seemeth to be acquanted with. What he saith of honouring the just and holy ones, is against himself; for they will not honour one another, at least not in a way, that we can understand: If they honour one another inwardly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out these outward significations; what know they but we do so to the poor,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:66147:280"/>
who are righteous and holy. If he think, that we should, according to our principles, give titles of honour to the poor, who are godly; He is mistaken; for our principles are not, that these outward titles are given to any, upon the account of their personal enduements; but because of their Station, Place and Authority: Yet we say, that honour is to be given to all, and due and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent significations of respect to the poorest, that fear God, upon the account of the grace of God shineing in them.</p>

Seeth he not now, what can hence be deduced against him? But what sayes he to <hi>Pauls</hi> practice? <hi>Festus,</hi> sayes he, <hi>was also truely noble, in that he would hear Paul in his owne cause, and gave not way to the Iew, fury against him. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,</hi> It was but a poor evidence of true nobility in him to hear <hi>Paul</hi> speak for himself, when the Lawes of the <hi>Romans</hi> bound him to it. And as to the Jewes fury, he gave as much way to it, as he might. Why did he else constraine <hi>Paul</hi> to appeal unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> which if he had not done, he might have bin a free man, in the judgment of King <hi>Agrippa Act.</hi> 26.32? what else importeth these words of <hi>Paul.

This I am sure was a very sory evidence of true nobility: and yet upon the very back of that, <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>I am not mad, most noble Festus.</hi> Sure then this title was not given him upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of true nobility, as this <hi>Quaker</hi> supposeth; but upon the account of his Place and Authority, it being the title, that was ordinarily given to <hi>Felix,</hi> his predecessour; though we read not, in express tearms, that <hi>Paul</hi> used i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At length §. 3. he cometh to speak in the defence of their <hi>Thees</hi> &amp; <hi>Thous</hi>; and very learnedly tels us, <hi>that we cannot use the plural number for the singular, in latine, every school boy knowing, that it is incongruous to say,</hi> vos Amas. <hi>Answ</hi> Yet every school boy knoweth, it is not incongruous to say, <hi>vos amatis</hi>: And why
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:66147:281"/>
may not the Verb be as well plural, as the Pronoun? If he say, that is not usual, when we are speaking of or to another single person: What will he say to this use, when we are speaking of ourselves? He hath not forgotten the old rule, <hi>At de me solo numerus dicetur uter vis.</hi> But be it so, that the latine will no way suffer this, other languages may; as for example, the <hi>Low dutch,</hi> where through the whole Bible, we shall not finde any other word, for <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou,</hi> then what signifieth properly <hi>yee</hi> and <hi>you.</hi> And what rule or ground, can he finde in latine, for their constant useing <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> and never <hi>yes,</hi> and <hi>no</hi>? But let it be supposed, that few languages will countenance such an abuse, as to say <hi>yee</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> to one single man: What will that helpe the mater? must all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages follow the same rules? knoweth he not, that use is the master of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage? and that in our language, <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou,</hi> is never used, when one equal is speaking to another (except where it is the expression of most intimate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe and affection, as betwixt man and wife) far less, when one is speaking to his Superiour? &amp; knoweth he not, that in our usual manner of speaking, if we should say <hi>thou</hi> &amp; <hi>thee</hi> to our equal, let be to our Superiour, it would either be construed to flow from the hieght of Pride and Contempt, or from Rage and Anger? And is it handsome for them to speak so disdainfully to all persons; and pretend conscience for it too? What a ridiculous whimsical folly is this? What he citeth out of <hi>Iames Howel,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Maresius,</hi> confuteth what he said just now; for they tell us, that even in latine, <hi>Vos, you,</hi> was used of one person; and though they say this change came through pride and flatery, it will say nothing, unless he can shew the like in our language; and though he should shew it, yet use being, as I said, master of words, his pedantick singularity will but savoure of Vanity and Pride: and for what he citeth out of Mr <hi>Godeau</hi> it is to no purpose, for he knowes, that whatever we do, while speaking to others, yet we use the singular number, while speaking to God, which may convince him, that language is not alwayes ruled by reason, but by use and custome. He tels us, <hi>They were necessitate to testifie against this, by speaking in the singular number to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular persons; because to speak otherwayes, came from pride; and so is joyned with a lie. Answ.</hi> How proveth he, that it came from pride, with us? Because it was so with the Latine? the consequence is not good (2.) Is every thing that cometh from pride joyned with a lie? (3.) Our <hi>Quakers</hi> will be both proud, and speak despicably of others, (as <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi> evinceth) that they may testify against pride: I appeal to any, that knoweth our language, whether it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth more of pride and worse, to use <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi> to our &amp; equals superiours, then to use <hi>you</hi> and <hi>yee.</hi> But I will not impute it to pride, in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that it cometh from a more stinking root, than either pride, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, though these may some time be admixed too; hence the Proverb, <hi>as proud as a Quaker.</hi>

And he saith, he cannot see what we can say in defence of our practice. But we have
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:66147:281"/>
shown above, what is our ground: and we have seen the same practised by other worthy persons, mentioned in Scripture. But to this he replieth, <hi>That these actions of the Patriarchs are no rule to us; nor is it sufficient, that these actions were not expresly reproved, for neither was Abraham reproved, for knowing Sarah's maide. Answ. Abrahams</hi> practice, in the mater of <hi>Hagar,</hi> was against a law; for the Lord created but one woman to <hi>Adam,</hi> though the residue of the Spirit was with him <hi>Mal.</hi> 2:14, 15. But <hi>Abrahams</hi> practice in civilly bowing unto the sons of <hi>Heth,</hi> was against no Law of the creation. (2.) When he and <hi>Lot</hi> both bowed unto the Angels, supposeing them to have been men, shall we think, that if that had been sinful, that the Angels would not have reproved them upon that account, as we finde the Angel did reprove <hi>Iohn,</hi> when he fell down and worshiped him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19:10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22:9? <hi>As concerning,</hi> saith he, <hi>the fashions and customes of the Nations, it is an evil argument for the practice of Christians, who should follow a better rule. Answ.</hi> And so we do follow a better rule; and yet we may follow the Law of nations, which is mostly gathered from the practice of nations, in things not contrary to the Law of God; for even the Law of nations, in such things, is a part of the Law of God, being but some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular applications, or explications of the Law of Nature: And though no particular gesture, as a signe of respect and reverence, due to our Equals or Superiours, be universally received by all Nations, yet the Law of Nations, and their practice, may teach us, that by some one outward gesture or other, we ought to witness our respect, &amp; declare that reverence, that we owe to others: Christianity is no enemy to humanity, and civility, whatever our morose and unmanerly <hi>Quakers</hi> dream.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But let us hear his arguments. 1. Sayes he, <hi>God alone is to be adored: But bowing of the body and knee and uncovering our head, are the only external signes of our adoration of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Answ.</hi> What a silly thing is this? He may as well inferre, that a man must never bow his body to tye his shoes, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his head to have his haire cut; Can he not distinguish betwixt a stated act of worshipe, and other actions civil and natural? It is true, in a stated act of worship, the uncovering the head, or bowing of the body, were it but to a stock or stone, or any dead creature, or any thing beside God, would be Idolatry; but to construe so of every bowing of the knee, or uncovering of the head, in every other action whatsoever, is ridiculous folly: And it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, these <hi>Quakers</hi> put no difference betwixt God and men; nor betwixt stated acts of worshipe, and other common actions. But he addeth, <hi>If we should apply ourselves to men, as to God, there should be no difference, in the outward signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but only in the Intention, whereby a door is opened unto the Papists worshiping of images. Answ.</hi> He seeth, we put the difference, in the nature and statedness of the action; and not in the bare intention; though that also be included in the nature of the action: And what door this openeth unto image-worshipe, he should have declared. He possibly thinketh, that it is our judgment, that if the worshiper do not intend to worshipe the image, it is no image-worshipe; This is his mistake: If the worshiper intend divine worshipe to God, in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before an idol, we account him guilty of image-worshipe; for his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:66147:282"/>
there declareth the action to be a stated act of worshipe; but we say not so of a craftsman bowing down to help or amend something in the image, for his intention showeth, that he is about no act of worshipe; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or doth the nature of that action require it: If he could evince, that while we bow our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or uncover our heads unto men, that we are intending thereby worshipe to God, his argument were good; but while there is no such intention, nor doth the action it self require it, being a stated civil action, and no more, his argument evinceth but his owne Folly and Ignorance.</p>
               <p n="13">13. His second argument is but the same; to wit, <hi>that men should not be adored</hi>: Which we willingly grant; for in adoration, there is a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We plead not for worshiping of men; for worshipe is due to God only, because of his Supereminent and Transcendent Excellency; and requireth inward Love Faith and Hope, in &amp; upon the object worshiped. He should prove, that these external significations of honour and respect, cannot be without, or do essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially include, worshipe performed towards the Object; but this is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for then if one bow his body to tye his shoes, or to lift up a pin, he shall be a worshiper of his shoes, and of a pin. He addeth, <hi>If it be said, that Iohn would adore the Angel with religious worshipe, it is not proved. Answ.</hi> Is it not proved, when the text sayeth, <hi>he fell down to worshipe</hi>? where finde we civil honour or respect called worshipe, in Scripture?

And suppose it had been but only civil honour; Yet <hi>Mordecai's</hi> case was singular, because he was a Jew, and the Jews were under a prohibition to do any homage unto these cursed <hi>Amalekites</hi>; and this, as it appeareth, was the ground of his refusal; for it is said <hi>Esth.</hi> 3:4.—<hi>for he had told them, that he was a Iew</hi>; thereby holding forth the ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his refusal to obey the Kings command.

Nay not only so, but we must be horride liars; and the searcher of hearts must be attested hereunto This is but an inconsiderable thing with them, who account all, that our Preachers say from the word of the Lord, nothing but lies, and satanical delusions, because it is not from the immediat teaching of the Spirit, and them but Professours of the Devil, upon this account: See <hi>Fox's Great Mystery</hi> P. 5. and 62.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet more, <hi>Hence is it</hi> (saith he,) <hi>that because we exhort people to returne and feel God within themselves, saying unto them, that if they feel not God neer them, the notions, which they have of God as he is in the heaven, above the cloudes, will not much profite them; they maliciously endeavour to inferre, that we say, that God doth not exist without us. Answ.</hi> Thinks he, that we have no other Notion of God, but as of one, that is up in the heavens above the cloudes? Supposeth he, that we deny him to be every where present? But if they beleeve, there is a God in deed and in truth, why talk they so much of <hi>a measure of God,</hi> in every man? Is the true God such a devisible thing? Why do they make the soul of man a part or particle of God? What meane they by the Vehicle of God? Do these and the like expressions smell of orthodoxy in this matter? The true God that is revealed to us, in the Scriptures, is a God, that is one in essence, and three distinct persons, the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost: do they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this? Furthermore if they beleeve really a God without them, why do they ascribe to something within them, that which is peculiar unto God? Doth not the <hi>morning Watch</hi> Pag. 5.6, 7. assert the light within every man, to be that word, which <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks of <hi>Iohn</hi> 1:1? See <hi>Fox</hi> the younger <hi>P.</hi> 50, 53, 54. Is that a savoury expression, which E.

And <hi>G. Fox</hi> saith, <hi>Is not the soul without beginning, come from God? It is not horride blasphemy to say, the soul is a part of God, for it came out of him, and that which came out of him is of him.

Mr <hi>Faldo</hi> in his book against the <hi>Quakers, part.</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 3-12. helpeth me to much more. Let us cull out of a great heap a few instances. (1.) Do not all the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny <hi>the Scriptures to be the word of God</hi>? Do they not <hi>say, that it is blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to say the letter is the word of God, and it is the Devil that contends for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the word of God?</hi> And what can more be spoken to the disparagment of the Scriptures, than to deny them to be his word or the signification of his minde, who spoke them; and did indite them by his Spirit, immediatly inspiring the Prophets and Apostles, and other holy men of God, in the writing of them? Is not this directly to devest them of all that Authority, which they have from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as his Law? Is not this to render them contemptible, when they are denied to be that, which only maketh them have weight with consciences? (2.) Do not the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny the Scriptures to be the rule of faith and manners; and the judge of Controversies, in the maters of Religion? We remember what himself aid above. Hear <hi>Parnel,</hi> in his <hi>shield of the truth</hi> p. 10. <hi>And he also that saith, the letter is the rule and guide of the people of God, is without, feeding upon the husk, and is ignorant of the true light, which was before the letter was.</hi> Hear <hi>Smith Prim.</hi> p. 10 <hi>And if thou lookest upon the Scripture to be for a rule and for trying, thou givest that unto them, which belongs unto Christ.</hi> And is not this enough to dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Scriptures, to deny that chiefe use and end of them, for which they were given?

But now it must satisfie us to know them to be men possessed of him. And so our next work is to think what is dutie as to these demoniacks; which needs no long demur; for sure the first hast, as to these poor possessed creatures, is to haste to carry them on our knees to Jesus Christ, even that Christ whom they b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh that he, who alone can say the word &amp; do the thing, would once say, <hi>hold thy peace and come out of them</hi>! It were no great matter, though they should be torne &amp; thrown in the midle, if he were driven out of them; for it is rare for Devils to get such a possession, but when he sees he can hold it no longer, he endeavours to breake down or burne the house, out of which he is driven. And though of all men in the world there is least hope of them (for their disease lyeth in blaspheming the very remedie of sin, and the alone releife of self destroyed sinners;) Yet because we know not, whether the righteous Lord, for holy ends and just causes, may not
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:66147:289"/>
suffer for a season some of the Elect, whom it is impossible finally to deceive, thus to be possessed; we would set about this work of prayer on their behalfe, yea earnest prayer, adding fasting thereto: for if ever there was a Devil, of whom it holds true, <hi>this sort goeth not out but by fasting and prayer,</hi> it holds true as to that Devil, that dw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lls in them, and speaks out of them. We would essay therefore to strain our own souls, in lifting up a prayer on their behalfe (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering to limite him) and seek so to save them if possible with fear, pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of the fire; for they are more them halfe in hell already, when they are become dens for such a Devil, as dwells in them, and drives them. If we hereby obtained no more, yet our love to our blasphemed Lord Jesus Christ, and to these perishing souls, who, through Satans malice and their own mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, are thus acted, would be manifested; and our prayer, if it did not prevaile as to them, would returne into our own bosome. And besides, this migh be the reward of serious wrestling with God on this behalfe, that that Devil, who drives them at this rate of opposition to his Christ, should be seen to be the Devil, and so the snare would be broken, and the elect preserved from falling in it, and the folly of these reprobats concerning the faith, these <hi>Ianneses</hi> and <hi>Iambreses,</hi> who resist the truth, and withstand a greater then <hi>Moses,</hi> might be made so manifest to all men, as they should proceed no further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I judge this monstruous appearance of men, so madded against Christ, and the alone way of salvation by him, cals aloud to all, upon whom the blessed name of Christ is called, to fall a weeping and pouring out their hearts before him, in the remembrance of the procuring cause, whereby the just and holy Lord hath been provoked to let loose such a Spirit, and leave so many souls to be seised upon by him, as we see (O sad sight!) are become a prey to him in this generation, and are taken (and held by the cords of their own consent) cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of him at his will. Alas! we may read, in this allaruming and wrath-speaking dispensation, the high and hot displeasure of God at our sin, in not prizeing this glorious Gospel of the Grace of God, wherein life and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is brought to light; mens not <hi>truthing it in love,</hi> or receiving the love of the truth; mens pleasing themselves with names, and pursuing of notions, while Christ was not received to dwell in the heart by faith; their not departing from iniquitie, on whom the name of Christ was called, and who seemed to call on his name, hath been the bitter root springing up in these spruts of hell, whereby the Church is this day troubled, &amp; so many are defiled with this leprosie and soul-destroying contagion. This, this is that root, which hath brought forth these cursed fruits; Because after all the pains he had been at, to reforme his Church, and setle pure ordinances amongst us; Yet our scum remained in us, and there were so few who made it their work, to walk worthie of the Lord to all pleasing, and to render unto him according to the benefite received; therefore he suffered <hi>Abaddon</hi> to plant that vine of Sodom, within the pale of his visible Church, and in that vineyard, on which he had taken so much pains; because it brought not forth fruit unto him, by whom it was dressed, and it hath been most fertil in bringing forth these grapes of gall and bitter clusters; and he hath conduced many trafficquers for him (which he could not have found
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:66147:289"/>
without the pale of the visible Church; nay which he could not have found in any Church, but in a Church, on which so much pains had been taken, and wherein ordinances had been setled in such puritie) to tread these grapes of gall, and vend this wine to poor souls, which is the poison of Dragons, and the cruel venome of Aspes; and they are hell-busie, for he must run whom such a Devil drives, though it be down a steep place, as is manifest in this <hi>Barclay,</hi> and his complices, who are long breathed in compassing sea and land, to proselyt poor souls, and poison them beyond the power of an Antidot; for then mercy it self is engaged to destroy them, by their trampleing under foot that blood of the Covenant, whereby the blessed surtie was sanctified, or whereby he sanctified, seperat, and set himself a part for their sakes, for whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a propitiation; I say, we are to remember the peccant and procureing cause of all this. Alas! how may many remember their laughing, at the first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this prodigie, and making light of the matter, with shame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of face? How may they, under the conviction of their guilt in this matter, go groaning to their graves? O will it not be an indelible marke of infamie, and an evidence that we knew not the signes of the times, and what they called us to do? Will it not be a reproach never to be rolled away from this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that one day, upon the Devils appearance in this shape, to destroy the all of Christianitie at once, was not set apart in all the Churches of <hi>Brittan</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to weep before the Lord; Yea day after day by common consent? Shall the posteritie heare that this was not done, and yet heare that we were alive when cursed <hi>Naylour,</hi> (whose name and notions will be for a curse to all that love the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for ever,) appeared upon the stage? Shall it be recorded how in his <hi>Bristol-road,</hi> and what followed upon it, he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did the very Devil; and also heare, that what was acted against Christ the Lord, did not put us all to cry upon our knees and weep day and night before him, (and here by the way give me leave to insert a Parenthesis, this unhappie Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>R. Barclay</hi> boasts in his <hi>Vniversal love,</hi> that they have not the name of any particular person called upon them, as other sects (so he calls them) have: I shall not here tell him what of untruth is in this vain boast, for whose name is called upon the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> &amp;c. nor shall I suggest the difficultie a person of as happie an ingine and invention, as he tells us he is, would have found, if he had set himself to essay the designeing of them by a particular name; seing they have monpolized, and soudred into one masse, all the most damnable heresies ever came out of hell; and so in their Camp are congregat and mustered against Christ all particular heresies, whereby under several Leaders the Saviour hath been opposed from the beginning. But this I'le say and confes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e unto him, there was a wrong done them, that they were not called <hi>Naylorists</hi>; i. e. the most perfect audacious opposers of Christ, that ever the Devil brought on the stage; and that their doctrine, instead of <hi>Quakerisme,</hi> was not called <hi>Naylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme,</hi> i. e. the purest blasphemie against Christ, that ever any of <hi>Abbadon's</hi> brood belched forth: And therefore hereafter I shall, since they are his very spawn, and as like him as if he had spitted them out of his mouth, doe them that piece of justice, as to designe them <hi>Naylorists,</hi> i. e. Blasphemers of Christ; for the

Devil should have his due) may not the very caul of our heart be rent in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion? Gracious <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> zeal (and I dar say upon a lesse clamant emergent, and a lesse crimson blasphemie) will rise up in judgement against the luke warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this generation: and our liveing in such a day, and not lamenting before the Lord, will witnesse that we had outlived our zeal, and be too plain a proof that our holy fire was gone out, since our heart did not boile over at our eye, on the seeing and hearing of such a thing. Oh if at last we would awake and weep, that we had been a sleep, while Satan was so busie in sowing these tares!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We would labour each of us to have our souls deeply impressed with the preciousnesse of Christ, and the absolut necessitie of making use of him for salvation; for the Devils great and manifest designe is by these his Trustees and Traffickers, to dispute men and debauch their spirits, into a contempt of the precious Saviour, and that great salvation, which is purchased by his death; and never since he began hath he made use of a mean, which hath so cleare and close a connexion with that end. Now Christ can be precious to none, he can be prized by none, who is not vile in his own eyes: he who lives not within sight of his own loathsome leprosie, and who is a stranger to the plague of his own heart, will reject the counsel of God against himself, and despise the great salvation. And it is cleare beyond debate, that the Devil, do his best, can never proselyt any man into this delusion and damnable haeresie of <hi>Naylorisme,</hi> (ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s <hi>Quakerisme)</hi> till, as the God of this world, he have first perfectly blinded their minds, that he may harden their hearts, into a final rejection of the true Christ, the Saviour, as the alone and onely way to be clothed with a suffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent righteousnesse, and cleansed from all that filthinesse of the flesh and Spirit, whereby they are defiled; and from which they can onely be cleansed by that blood, which these blasphemers tred under foot. Let every one therefore, who would keep himself in the love of God and of Christ, keep his finger upon his sore, that his eye may be keept <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>xed upon the remedie; for if the Devil get not his finger into a mans eye, and blind fold him as to the uptakings of his own miserie and the precious remedie, he will never turne him into a <hi>Naylorist,</hi> that he may turne and tumble him into hell with his own c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nsent. Study thy self, till what thou seest force thee to say, <hi>I am the cheife of all sinners</hi>; and then all that the Devil can say to the contrare, will never put thee from thinking it is a saying <hi>faithful, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ came in the world to save sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Growing in this grace of the right knowledge of a mans self, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, is the onely expedient to defeat the designe, he drives by these drivers, and to be preserved from being led away with the errour of these <hi>wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Study to know the great principles of the Oracles of God, and to have these impressed upon thy soul; that so, when assaulted by Satan, thou mayest hold fast that truth, which can onely make thee free: And let the fallings away of others make thee the more closely cleave to that blessed Guid, who leadeth in all truth. In a word. Let each one be busie in studying the word of God, and his own heart; and be much in holding up his heart to him, who
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:66147:290"/>
writs the Law in it, that so his heart may become the Epistle of Christ; and then he is guarded against taking on blasphemous and cursed <hi>Naylors</hi> blake marke. Let the sad sight of that swarme of Apostats put thee to studie to know the truth in its power and sweetnesse: And then, when by the fallings away of others, Christ is saying unto thee, <hi>wilt thou also leave me</hi>; thou will answer, with that man, <hi>whither shall</hi> I <hi>go from thee, for thou hast the words of eternal life</hi>? This will blessedly arrest the soul to an aboad with him, when others will be carried away, and never be seen any more to walk in Christs company.</p>
            <p>Now to make thee give thy self in some seriousnesse to studie the precious Truths of God, and to know him, whom to know is life eternal; thou mayest observe (and be provoked to that exercise by thy observation) what the Devil, who is still going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour, is a doing, and what he is thereby designing: When he had for a long time bawled and blasphemed in not our non-sense, lest his trade should decay, and the market of these traffickers for the souls of men (for the precious souls of men are the commoditie they deal in) should misse their marke, to the end that he may make merchandise still of such, with feigned and fair words, he prompts some to polish as well as they can with their parts and pen these blasphemies, and give them some colour; for which service, his Apostle, the Author of the <hi>Theses</hi> and <hi>Apologie,</hi> is shaped and set apart, as the sharpest and neatest pen.</p>
            <p>I shall not here, as I intended, digresse into observations upon the addresse of this book, wherein he Chartals all the learned men in the world; since it can escape no mans observation, who reads his book with judgement, and compares it with the addresse, that this novice, being lifted up with pride, is fallen into the condemnation of the Devil. Neither shall I take upon me to hint any thing, as to the bulk of the abominations, wrapt up in his voluminous fardell of blasphemie (that being so excellently handled by what thou hast read in this exquisitly cleare <hi>Examen</hi>:) Onely, as it seems, that as the Devil thought to serve himself by a <hi>Barclaij Argenis,</hi> the scope whereof was to teach how effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to destroy Protestant Religion, and swallow up the Truth in the See and sinck of <hi>Romes</hi> abominations; so we have a second <hi>Barclaij Argenis,</hi> the scope of which is, under sceptick and introverted notions, and new coined names, to destroy Christianity, and introduce pure Paganisme; and thus with a confidence peculiar to that partie, and like him who prompted him to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, he would <hi>rant</hi> and <hi>Romance</hi> us into heathenisme.</p>
            <p>But since he hath taken upon him to give us a Confession of a kinde of faith, (after he and his complices have made shipwracke of precious faith, and flout without fear at the faith of Gods elect) which is a systeme of Paganisme; And since he hath published to the world the <hi>Naylorists Alcoran,</hi> whereby he intends, as <hi>Mahomet's Mufti,</hi> to Mustelman the Christian world, and Mancipat us to the Turks gallies or worse: The Good Lord, to prevent the Devil and this despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rado's designe, hath found out and fitted for the undertaking amongst the men, whom of all others he most despiseth and abhorreth, the singularly <hi>acute,</hi> solidly <hi>learned</hi> and truely <hi>gracious</hi> Author, who hath in his Masters cause and strength undertaken the work, and taken this <hi>Turke</hi> to taske, and, in his convincingly
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:66147:291"/>
cleare <hi>examen,</hi> so discussed and dissected that carcase and carrion of all abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, as by the light of that Spirit of truth, which hath led him in the <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> he hath manifestly discovered <hi>Barclay's</hi> pretended Revelations to be the horrid illusions, and hellish suggestions of a Spirit of a blaker colour, then <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi> pigeon, and himself to be the Devil in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle, perswadeing us by the assistance of his <hi>Mephystophilus,</hi> instead of putting on the Lord Jesus Christ, that we may be found clothed upon with that rob of his righteousnesse, that so the shame of our nakednesse may not appeare, to put on I know not what, something common to us with heathens, who never heard of Christ, <hi>a Iapan</hi> gown; and place ourselves when we have done, in the expectation of the Turkes Paradise, or of none.</p>
            <p>When Satan, in pursueance of his project, having gotten possession of this poor <hi>vainling,</hi> and swelled him with the conceit of that felicitie of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof he boasts in his <hi>Vniversal love.</hi> (But more truely a plain discoverie of an <hi>Vniversal hatred</hi> to the Gospel of the Grace of God) he puts him on, having puffed him up, to publish to the world, what he had poisoned the poor creatures spirit with, thereby to leaven the spirits of men with this hell-hatched heresie. And now this parturient mountain, having with a great stridor and Nayloristick noise, to the end he may be heard in all <hi>Europe,</hi> peched out this Pagan mouse: Reader, there is no jest here. Alas! there is no matter of jest, when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is in so nettle earnest to destroy all, and makes use of this poor creature for that end; I onely make use of a known Proverb, commonly made use of, in the like case) he thinks by the felicitie of his ingine, he is able so to pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and paint this Pagan birth, as to make poor simple and shallow us, short of his searching and soaring wit, believe it is an Angel; and he endeavours to cloth this brat of his own deluded brain in such a buske, as will make every one, who sees its face, fond of it, and fall in love with its beautie. But he is mistaken; for so long as the light of this glorious Gospel doth shine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, every one that is led by that true light will perceive by the face, feature and foaming of this brate, he hath brought forth, that it is hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and that it is a <hi>Demon incubus,</hi> who hath begotten it, to which the Pagan Parent hath prostitute his darkened understanding. Nay I suppose, and not without ground, that if the Devil, who drave the Author on, and was at the dictating of these dreames, had his <hi>Doctors Dictats</hi> againe in his hand, he would bury or burne them, ere he subjected them to such an <hi>Examen,</hi> whereby the Authors <hi>Hell-Craft,</hi> or to please the <hi>Naylorist,</hi> in speaking in their own dialect, <hi>witchcraft,</hi> is so manifestly detected, as Satan, who set him on, missed his marke in driveing his deluded Trustee to belch forth what was so blake; as now, after the discoverie made by this <hi>Examen,</hi> it passeth the power of his blake art, to give it any colour, besids his own who is its true Father. Moreover, I doubt not to say, if the Author of these <hi>Theses</hi> and <hi>Apologie</hi> be not brought to see and acknowledge the blakenesse and abominablnesse of his Errors, by the shineing light and sharpenesse of this <hi>Examen,</hi> it is not because there is not a sufficiency of Scripture light, in what is by the judicious Author adduced; but because Satan hath engaged the Author of that <hi>Apologie</hi> in an opposition to the truth,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:66147:291" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beyond a retreat; and then what might otherwise prove a remedie, must fret the disease, and fire him into a heat of hellish indignation, to see his desperat designe so far defeat, as the light which he intended to darken and extinguish, shines more brightlie, after the smoake of the pit which came out of his mouth is blown away, and the truth in its radiant beautie and brightnesse is the more cleared up, that he essayed to overcloud it.</p>
            <p>But that I may not exceed the length and limits of a <hi>Postscript,</hi> let me desire these things of every Professor of the name of Christ shortly; <hi>First,</hi> seriously to peruse and ponder this <hi>Examen,</hi> for thy own establishment in the truth: But more particularly (since the arrogant, here answered, did addresse himself to Clergiemen as he calls them and students,) let me beseech and obtest both Ministers and Students of Divinitie to a serious perusal and pondering of this piece, not onely as the most full, cleare and satisfying confutation of the hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blake abominations of that prating and perverse gang of enemies to Christ, that hath, si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But also because the partie here dealt with having first swallowed down, and then vomit up what ever is mortal to the immortal soul amongst other Adversaries to Christ, beside these dottages peculiar to themselves, here thou hast a most learned and elaborat refutation of all these now grosse and grassant errors, whereby the souls of men are in hazard to be murthered, and the truth corrupted by these perverters of the Gospel of Christ; such as <hi>Arminianisme</hi> and <hi>Socinianisme,</hi> &amp;c. And I am sure, by the diligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal of what is here brought to thy hand, and the blessing of God upon thy pains, thou maiest not onely be singularly edified, established and built up in the most holy faith, but put in case to speake with all the enemies of the Grace of God in the gate; and if this may excite thee, I professe that by the reading hereof I have found my self confirmed in the truth, and much established in that doctrine, which is according to godlinesse. And forget not to blesse the Lord for his goodnesse to his Church, in preserving beyond expectation the Authors life, and for enabling him and holding his hand, as in all the several en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters he hath had, with the Adversaries to the truth, so in a remarkable manner and measure in this rancountre with the <hi>Naylorists</hi> Goliah, he hath been helped to dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>over these depths of Satan, which are in their doctrine; so that this <hi>Naylorist</hi> may well hereafter sprawl &amp; spurne, but a solid reply is beyond the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of his understanding. And every on will judge, he hath but little reason to boast of that felicitie, if he be so unhappily dull, as not to understand this. But if he intend a reply he had better cause some bold bawler undertake it, and instead of all other refutation, tell the learned and judicious Author, that he is in the <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and this will be the short cut: And if he will take my advice, he will finde it the saifest course: onely let him remember that
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:66147:292"/>
this course will be a confession <hi>in obliquo,</hi> that Goliah's head is cut off, and now the whole host of these uncircumcised <hi>Philistims</hi> must flee from the face and force of a little Presbyterian David.</p>
            <p>But to such as are not able to follow &amp; fathom the Authors reach, or have not so much time as thorowly to peruse this large examen (though I would have every one to have it by him, that he might, in their perversions of the Scripture, have recourse to it for a help to be cleared) I would besides other pieces parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly recommend a little piece lately published, called a <hi>short survey of Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme,</hi> wherein the Author hath solidly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d clearly said much in little, for guarding the people of the Lord against the contagion of these soul-murthering heresies. But above all (and with this I close all) that thou mayest be able to stand, when so many, once looked upon as persons of some understanding, have fallen, gird thy loins about with the truth of the Scriptures, O prize the word of God, that blessed word, which these men contradict and contemne, as if they would be avenged upon the Scriptures, <hi>First,</hi> for foretelling that such a race of Runagadoes from the truth would arise; whereby we are confirmed, that they are the word of the living God; <hi>Secondly</hi> because of their passing sentence upon them, when arisen, as seducers, and condemning their senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as the doctrines of Devils; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> because they most peremptorily inhibite us under the pain of his displeasure, who hath given us these Scriptures for our rule, to converse with such deceivers, or receive the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into our houses; and charge all, who would not fall into the same snare, and so bring sore and swift damnation on themselves, to stand aloof from the men of these abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and damnable heresies. And you are the rather to observe and do this, that you finde Satan rageth and goeth mad, if this be urged; and no wonder, since he knowes well what he hath gained by the contrarie practice, and is very sure that he, who breaks so cleare a command, hath wrested himself out of the hand of his guid; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so hath put himself out of case to pray or hope for leading, which Satan knowing and observing, way-layes him, when he hath him in his own Synagogue, or conversing unnecessarily with his domesticks, and thinks himself sure of him: And Alas! the successe often answers his expectation. And therefore he who put that deluded soul to draw up &amp; de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ile paper with this systeme, and compound of all abominations, doth prompt him in the next place to penne &amp; publish a piece, which he calls <hi>Vniversal love,</hi> just of a piece and complexion with cursed <hi>Naylor's love to the lost</hi> (for the men are of the same core and kidney, composed of hatred to the Gospel; so that if you receive their expressions of <hi>love to the lost,</hi> you are lost) however this is a prettie page and pimp to his Apologie, and weares its livery, and is calculat exactly for the designe of <hi>Apollyon.</hi> O so kinde as they will appeare! as kinde as the cruel spider to the flee, who, while it seems to embrace and kisse it, kills it with poison. Let them be but warmely welcomed, and have accesse to whisper you in the eare, and drop-in their poison at that passage, it will quickly reach your soul, and flee up into your head, and so distract you with themselves, into a pure and perfect hatred of the way of Salvation; but I must tell you, he, who would not have the Devil run away with him to hell, should not throw himself in
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:66147:292"/>
his embraces, or suffer that evil one, that liar and murtherer to come so neer him as to touch him.</p>
            <p>Much about the same time also (at least much about the same time both came to my hand) his brother in iniquitie <hi>George Keith,</hi> in answer (as he calls it) to a Postscript to Mr <hi>Rutherfoords</hi> letters, written on purpose to disswade all the Lovers of Jesus Christ to converse with these his stated enemies, flies furiously into the face of that Author; and in his furious transport foams out in that piece his own shame. Concerning which at present I have onely this to say to the <hi>Reader,</hi> that he may expect ere long to have <hi>G. Keiths</hi> notions examined by the same person, who hath answered his brothers <hi>Apologie</hi>: and for what relates more particularly to the Postscript it self, against which he rageth, he may expect to have it considered by the Author of the Postscript. But not to detain thee longer, consider <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
