            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He hearing me say so, began to embrace me a new, and offered me all the courtesie he colde for his sake, saying, although he knew him not, yet for the report he had hard of his pleasance, hee colde not but bee in loue with his perfections being absent. As we were thus discoursing, I hard such ringing of belles, such singing, such shouting, as though Rhodes had beene recouered, or the Turke quite driuen out of Christendome, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal I might behold an hundreth bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers together, tables spred in the open streetes, and banquets brought in of all handes.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Elcome Mayster <hi>Martin</hi> from the dead, and much good ioy may you haue of your stage-like resurrection. It was told me by the vndanted purseuants of your sonnes, and credibly beléeued in regard of your sinnes, that your grout-headed holinesse had turnd vppe your héeles like a tired iade in a medow, and snorted out your scornefull soule, like a mesled hogge on a mucke-hill, which had it not béene false as the deuill woulde haue it, that long tongd doctresse Dame <hi>Law.</hi> muste haue béene faint (in spite of insperation) to haue giuen ouer spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the congregation, and employ her Parrats tong in stead of a winde-clapper to scarre the crowes from thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion. But profound <hi>Cliffe</hi> the ecclesiasticall cobler, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from his morning exercise with this false alarum, broke vp his brotherly loue-méeting abruptly, when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite had but newly moued him, and betooke him to his soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary shoppe, abutting on the backe side of a bulke. Nor was his souterly sorrow so hippocritically ingratefull, but he determined in the aboundance of his teares, that made a ful tide in his blacking tubbe, to haue stitcht vp your traytour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe a tumbe of vntand leather, wherein <hi>tanquam culeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo insutus,</hi> hee mought haue sought his fortune in the seas. But I know not how this parracides exequies were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogd, in so much as a brother in Christ of his at Northham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton, fetcht a more thriftier president of funeralls piping hot from the primitiue church, which including but a few words and those passing well expounded, kept his wainscot from waste, and his linnen from wearing, sufficeth he tombled his wife naked into the earth at high noone, without sheete or

Deceiue not thy selfe thou man of security, for the enemy of <hi>Adam</hi> is no poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall <hi>Argus,</hi> that his eies should bee put out by thy argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I tell thée troth, he wil be-pistle thée so peuishly, with allegations of vnuenidall sinnes, as though hee were borne within two houses of Battle bridge. It is not thy despairing protestations, can make thy peace with God, whose church thou hast sought to deuide, as did <hi>Herods</hi> souldiers his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: wele geue thée leaue to tell vs a smooth tale of the intercepting of thy treasons, and curry fauour like a crafty foxe, with the ciuill magistrate in politique termes of feare and reuerence, but thy heart is no more disguised in this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall apparel, then a trenchour <hi>Aristippus</hi> in the coate of a Parasite. Why discourse I so soberly, with the mortall enemy of modesty, when as the filth of the stewes, distild in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ribauldry termes, cannot confectionate a more intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate stile then his Pamphlets. Thou calst our Bishops wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by comparison, whereas (wert thou strooken as thou protests with the vntoward euentes of thy villanies) thou shouldst find the defilings of the 7. deadly sins, to haue broght thée by a pleasant pollution, within the possitiue degrée of damnation. What talk I to him, of hel or damnation, whom <hi>Lucifer</hi> hath furnisht to infection, with the painted poison of snout-holy deuotion, and all the powers of darknesse, haue adorned as an intelligencer to their kingdome, of the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in our flourishing Church of England.

Yet by your leaue his other dayes daunger is not so fully disgested, that he shuld forget the sanctified martyrs his brethren, those runagate Printers, to whose reuenge he bequeatheth a large Pistle of rayling Epithites, and mistearmeth our Bishoppes authoritie, with a whole <hi>Textor</hi> of tyrannie. A few of whose milder tearms are of this making, wicked Priests, presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Priests, proude Prelates, arrogant Bishops, horselée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, butchers, persecutors of the truth, Lamhethical whelps Spanish Inquisitours. Thinke you this myrie mouthed mate, a partaker of heauenly inspiration, that thus aboundes in his vncharitable railings: yet are these nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of his auncient burlibond adiunctes, that so pester his former edition with their vnweldie phrase, as no true syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme can haue elbowe roome where they are. In which Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet these that followe may bee placed: bounsing Priests, terrible Priests, venerable Maisters, proud and pontificall Patripolitians. Gentle reader, I giue you but a tast of them by the waie, that you may knowe them the next time you méete them in your dish, and learne to discerne a poysonous scorpion from wholesome fish. <hi>Martin</hi> you must thinke, was moude, when his gun-pouder papers were fired aboute his cares, and the spendthriftes his Printers, haled to the prison their patrimonies. Wherefore I cannot blame him though he sends abroade his Letters of supplication, in behalfe of his seruants that did but his bidding. The Church, the Church is persecuted amongst you my maisters, and <hi>Martin</hi> gettes nere a superintendentship by the shift, but let not <hi>Meg Law.</hi> crie once more to the Churchwardens for her foode, least shée

Learne of her you London Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones, to make hodie-peeles of your husbandes, and leade them like good soules vp and downe the streetes by the hornes, let it be seene by your courages in scolding, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue soules, which a balde eloquent brother of yours, denide not long since in his Sermon at Lichfielde. I, I, my maisters, you may mocke, on as you sée cause, but I warrant you the good olde true-pennie <hi>Marprelate</hi> is not so merrie, hee sits ruminating vnder an oake, or in the bottome of a haystacke, whose bloud shall be first spilte in the reformation of the Church. And not without cause, for hée that hath so lately felte the paine of worming and launcing, cannot but stande in awe of <hi>Buls</hi> slicing tooles one two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after. O it is a hairebrande whooresonne, and well seene in Phlebotomie, if a but once take knife in hande, cha will as soone let out the seditious humours forth a Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes bodie, as the best he in England, that hath bin twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yéeres practioners in Surgerie.

How euer it happens, thou bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thy resolution in thy mouth at highe midnight, and hast Scripture enough to carrie thee to heauen, though thou wert hangde to morrowe. We feare not men that can kill the bodie, quoth <hi>Martin,</hi> because we feare God, who can cast both bodie and soule into vnquenchable fire.

Our Ecclesiasticall gouernment &amp; gouernours say they, are wicked and vnlawfull. Why? because Sir <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> nor Sir <hi>Paul</hi> were neuer Archbishoppes of Canterbury, London, or Yorke. They were Fisher-men, and were not able. When <hi>Caesars</hi> Officers demaunded their tribute to make fiue groates amongst them, then what reason is it our Bishoppes should inioy their fiue hundreds, nay, that which is more, their thousand and two thousands? They were none of these Cartercaps, Graduates nor Doctors, therfore why should we tie our Ministrie to the prophane studies of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersitie.

My selfe doe knowe a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Preacher in Ipswich, that beeing but a while a goe a stage player, will now take vpon him to brandish a Text a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst Bishoppes, as well as the best Martinist in all Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke. Why, I praie you goe no farther then Batter. haue wée not there a reuerent Pastour of <hi>Martines</hi> owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that vnderstands not a bit of Latine, nor neuer dyd so much as looke towards the Uniuersitie in his life, yet you sée for a néede he can helpe discipline out of the durt, and come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our Cleargie verie handsomely with an héere is to bée noted.

Well, to the purpose. You saie Bishoppes are no Magistrates, because they are no lawfull Magistrates. Is it euen so brother <hi>Timothie,</hi> will it neuer be better, must I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leade you vp and downe antiquitie by the nose lyke an Asse. May neither Scriptures nor Fathers goe for pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with you, but still you will bée reducing vs to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of the persecuted Church, and so confounde the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of warre and peace? If you will néedes make vs the apes of all their extremities, why doe not you vrge the vse of that communitie wherein <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfull. Perswade Noble men and Gentlemen to sell theyr landes, and laie the money at your féete, take awaie the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of mine and thine from amongst vs, and let the worlde knowe you héereafter by the name of Anabaptistes. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the authoritie of Bishoppes were as vnlawfull as you woulde make it, yet since it is imposed vnto them by the Princes owne mouth, and ratified by the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so many Kings and Emperours, as well in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Parliamentes as generall counsayles, you are bounde in conscience to reuerence it, and in all humilitie to regarde it, insomuch as Christ denide not tribute to <hi>Caesar</hi> an vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, nor appealde from <hi>Pilate</hi> a Pagan, who occupied that place by the intrusion of tyrannie.

are they not expreslie commaunded by the Lordes owne mouth, to honour him as their King: Howe can they then escape the dampnation of contempte, that béeing priuate subiectes to such a vertuous Soueraigne, as is zealous of Gods glorie will controll her, disposing of honours, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose vnto publique derision, those the especiall pillers and ornamentes of her state, whome shée hath graced from their infancie, with so many sundrie ascentes of dignities. But were this all, then shoulde not treason bée such a braunche of your religion as it is. Haue not you and your followers vndermined her Graces Throane, as much as traytours might: call to minde the badde practise of your brother the Booke-binder and his accomplishes at Burie, who béeing as hotte spirited as your worshippes, in the schismaticall subiect of reformation, and séeing it woulde not come of halfe kindlie to theyr contentment, made no more a doe, but added this newe Posie to her Maiesties armes. Those that bée neither hotte nor colde, Ile spue them out of my mouth, sayth the Lorde. Denie this, and Ile bring a whole Assizes, as <hi>Obsignatos testes</hi> of your trecherie. To come neerer to thée Brother <hi>Martin.</hi> Hast not thou in thy firste booke agaynst Doctour <hi>Bridges,</hi> as also in Hay anie worke for Cooper, excluded her Highnesse from all Ecclesiasticall gouernement, saying shée hath neyther skill nor commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as shée is a Magistrate, to substitute anie member or minister in the Church. And in an other place, that there is neither vse nor place in the Church for members, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or officers of the magistrates making. If this wyll not come in compasse of treason, then farewell the title of Supremacie, and welcome agayne vnto Poperie. By this time I thinke, good-man Puritan, that thou art perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that I knowe as well as thy owne conscience thée, namely <hi>Martin Makebate</hi> of Englande, to bée a moste scuruie and beggerlie benefactor to obedience, <hi>&amp; per con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequens,</hi> to feare neyther men, nor that God who can

Talke as long as you will of the ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or paines of hell, and turne from your selues the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of that iudgement howe you will, which shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue blushing iniquitie of the figge leaues of hypocrisie, yet will the eie of immortalitie discerne of your painted pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the euer-liuing foode of perdition. The humours of my eies are the habitations of fountaines, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of my heart the enclosure of fearefull contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when I thinke howe many soules at that moment, shall carrie the name of <hi>Martine</hi> on their foreheads to the vale of confusion, in whose innocent bloude thou swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to hell, shalt haue the tormentes of tenne thousande thousande sinners at once, inflicted vppon thée. There will enuie, mallice and dissimulation bée euer calling for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance agaynst thée, and incite whole legions of deuilles to thy deathlesse lamentation. Mercie will saie vnto thee, I knowe thée not, and Repentaunce, what haue I to doe with thée. All hopes shall shake the head at thée, and saie, there goes the poyson of puritie, the perfection of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the serpentine seducer of simplicitie. Zeale her selfe will crie out vppon thée, and curse the time that euer shée was maskte by thy mallice, who lyke a blinde leader of the blinde, sufferedst her to stumble at euerie steppe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and madest her séeke in the dimnesse of her sight, to murther her mother the Churche, from whose pappes thou lyke an enuious dogge but yesterdaie pluckest her. Howe euer proude scorner, thy whoorishe impudencie, may happen heereafter to insiste in the derision of these fearefull denuntiations, and sporte thy iesters penne at the speach of my soule, yet take héede least despayre bée predominant in the daie of thy death, and thou in steade of calling for mercie to thy Iesus, repeate more oftner to thy

            <p>Trust me therein thou hast spoke wiser then thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, for if a man should imagine of fruite by the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, of garmentes by the moath frets, of wine by the sowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I warrant him for euer being good costerd-monger, broker, or vintner whiles he liues. Therefore we must not measure of <hi>Martin</hi> as he is allied to <hi>Elderton,</hi> or tongd like <hi>Will Tong,</hi> as he was attired like an Ape on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stage, or sits writing of Pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phlets, in some spare out-house, but as is <hi>Mar-Prelat</hi> of England as he surpasseth King &amp; collier, in crying, So ho ho, brother <hi>Bridges.</hi> Wo ho ho, <hi>Iohn</hi> a London. Ha ha he, Doctor <hi>Copecotes.</hi> Doe this &amp; I warrant you, for sauoring of the fleshe, though you take the oportunity of the spirite, with euery sister in Christ. Beholde the state of the low Countryes, since your Plaintife Pistler, will needs make the comparison, suppose <hi>Martin</hi> to be the map of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia dilacerata,</hi> whose chiefe prouinces as they are wholye possessed with Spaniards, so thinke his hart and soule enha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited with spiet, they Romists in the matter of Religion, and he a Papist in supremacies contradiction, her inward partes possessed with Anabaptists, and Lutherans, and his more priuate opinions polluted with the dregs of them both, her farthest borders of Holland and Zeland, peopled God wot with a small number of vnperfite Protestants, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest and fewest of his thoughts, taken vppe with some odde true points of Religion. How now Father <hi>Martin,</hi> haue not I hit your meaning patte in this comparison. Say, wil you haue any more such interpretations, if you say <hi>Amen</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:4607:12"/>
it. Ile also reconcile your allegoricall induction of France, to the present constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your frowardnes: but that shal not néede, since the misery of the one is the mirrour of the other, and the Reader must suppose that <hi>Martin</hi> would neare haue compared himselfe to Flaunders nor France, but as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect by allusion the distraction of his factious faith. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you take him at the worst, yet is his welchnes perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Lord hath some speciell purpose, by preuentinge of his presse, to try who they be that are hipocrites, and what they be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are innocent: And not vnlike too, for hauing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the trafique of honestye, so long as thou hast with thy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfet knauery, tis more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hie time thy vnder-ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, were broght to the touchstone of authority. You think we know not how pretily your Printers were shrouded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of salt-petermen, so that who but <hi>Hodgkins, Tomlins</hi> and <hi>Sims,</hi> at the vndermining of a house, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of poore men, by diggyng vp their floars, and breaking down their wals. No, no, we neuer heard how orderly they pretended the printing of Accidences, when my L. of <hi>Darbies</hi> men came to sée what they were a doing, what though they damned themselues about the deniall of the déede, is periury such a matter amongst puritans. Tush they account it no sin as long as it is in the way of protestation, being in the mind of a good old fellow in Cambridge, who sitting in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> as Senior at the fellowes election, was reprehended by some of his betters, for that hee gaue his voice with a dunce like himself, contrary to oath, statute and conscience: why quoth hee, I neither respect oath, statute, nor conscience, but only the glory of God.

I must belabour you when all is done, for your backbiting &amp; slandering of your honest neighbours, and open inueighing against the established gouernment in your sermons.

Neither was this monster of Cracouia vnmarkt from his bastardisme to mischiefe: but as he was begotten in adultery and conceiued in the heate of lust, so was he brought into the world on a tempestuous daie, &amp; borne in that houre when all planets wer opposite. Predestination y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foresaw how crooked he should proue in his waies, enioyned incest to spawne him splay-footed.

Say what you will, he is a close lad, &amp; can carrie a ring in his mouth, though all the world sée it not: what though hee now dissemble with the time, &amp; disguise his Spanish heart in a Precisians habit. May not he hereafter proue a necessarie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies common wealth, &amp; aduantage the holy league as much in this meanes of sedition, as all <hi>Philips</hi> power by inuasion.

But had not the frantike practise of his youth throughly founded his confirmed age in this furie, I woulde haue imagined his vpstart spite, a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der aboue vsual spéech, whereas now the coniectures drawen from his cradles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mallice all maruels. For whiles hee was yet a fresh man in Peterhouse, and had scarce tasted, as we say, of <hi>Setons modalibus,</hi> he began to affect factions in art, &amp; shew himselfe openly a studious disgracer of antiquitie. Who then such an vnnatural enemie to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or such a new-fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled friend vnto <hi>Ramus.</hi> This one thing I am sure of, hee neuer went for other then an asse, amongst his companions and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualles, yet such a mutinous block-head was he alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, that through town and Colledge he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called the seditious dunce. For one while he wold be libelling

against <hi>Arist.</hi> and all his followers he knew, another while hee would all to be-rime Doctour <hi>Perne,</hi> for his new sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, &amp; make a by-word of his bald pate, yea had the Dean, President, or any other officer neuer so litle angerd him, they were sure ere the wéeke went about to haue hard of it, in some libell or other. This humor helde him at that time, when by conuersing with French men neare Christes Colledge of a Papist, hee became a Brownist, how after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from a Brownist hee fell to bee an Anabaptist, I referre it to those that knewe his after behauiour in Oxford.

But it is our English policy to aduantage our enemies by delaies, and resist a multitude with a fewe, which makes sediton séede before the haruesters of our souls suppose it in the blade: it is not the spirite of mildenesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> must moderat the hart of folly, dogs must be beaten with staues, &amp; stuborn slaues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trolled with stripes. Authority best knows how to diet these bedlamites, although <hi>Segnior Penry</hi> in his last waste paper hath subscribed our magistrats infants. Repent, repent thou runnagate lozill, and play not the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary any longer in corners, least thy chiefest benefactors forsake thée, and recouer the pouerty of their fines, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pursiuants to thy forme. I heare some vnderhande whisperers, and gréeneheaded nouices exclaime against our Bishops, for not granting thée disputation. Alas alas brother <hi>Martin</hi> it may not be: for thou art known to be such a stale hackster, with thy welch hooke, that no honest man wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base himselfe in buckling with such a braggar.

about the eares with <hi>ergo.</hi> Where should this <hi>sillogistica concertatio</hi> be solemnized: what in our Uniuersity schooles at Oxford, or in <hi>puluere Philosophico</hi> at Cambridge. No they were erected in time of Popery, and must be new built againe before they can giue any accesse to his arguments. Truly I am afraide y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this Generall counsaile, must be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at Geneua, when al is done, for I know no place in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land holy inough for their turne, except it be some barne or out-house about Bury, or some odde blind cottage in the hart of Warwicke shire, and thither peraduenture, these good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest opponents would repaire without grudging. Prouided alwaies that they haue ther horse-hire and other charges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them out of the poor mans box, or els it is no bargain. All this fadges wel yet, if we had once determined who shold be father of the act. Why what a question is that, when we haue so many persecuted elders abroad. The blinde, the halt, or the lame, or any serues the turn with them, so he hath not on a cloak with sleues, or a cap of the vniuersity cut. Imagin that place to be furnished, where shall we finde moderators, that may deale indifferently twixt both parts. <hi>Machiuell</hi> is dead many a yeare agoe, or els he had bene a fit man for this may-game, therefore whom shal we haue now, since it must be neither yours nor ours.

How thinke you my lay brethren? is not here a trim conuocation towards. But mark the end of it, and then you may haps sée odde buffeting with the buttond bookes, and battring down of bishopricks. <hi>Giles</hi> of Sidborough wil off with his gown at least, &amp; make demonstrations of Logique with his fists like <hi>Zeno,</hi> what though he be low and cannot reach so hie as an Archbishop, may not he sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d like a iackanapes on his wiues shoulders, &amp; scold for the best game with all that come.

sillogisme. Nay mark me well, &amp; take me at my words, he shal speake false Latine, forge a text, abuse a Bishop, or make a lie of reuelation for more then I speak off with any man in Enga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ld. Neither do I flatter him herin for he hears me not, if I did, it were no matter, considering that <hi>virtus laudata crescit,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From iest to ernest, I appeale to you Gentlemen, how ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous in pollicy this disputation would proue if it were granted. First for there Bibles, the touchstone of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies, they must bee of their Fauorites translation, or els they will deny there authority as friuolous. Admit they go to the originall (which but few of them vnderstand) they wil haue euery man his sundry interpretation. Let our deuines alledge any text, they will expound it as they list, say the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or other auncient writers what they will. For such is the growth of ther arrogancy, that they are not ashamed to compare themselus with <hi>Ierome</hi> or <hi>Austen,</hi> and in their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious sermons preach against them as prophane. If this the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bee any betraying of the wretchednesse of our cause (as they call it) not to dispute with them that deny all principles, not to contend with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wilbe tride by none but themselus, I refer it to all considerate iudgementes, that haue no more experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the actions of peace then a reasonable soule may afford. The more pacified sort of our Puritans, would néeds perswade the world, that it is nought but a learned ministry which their cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion <hi>Martin</hi> endeuors: were it no otherwise his pardon were easely sealed, but those that know the treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his books, can report of his mallice against Bishops. One thing I am perswaded, that he neither respects the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel, nor the prosperity of the Church, but only the benefite that may fall to him and his boulsterers, by the distribution of Bishoprickes. Beshrewe mee but those Church-liuings would come well to decayed courtiers. O howe méerilye the Dice woulde runne, if our lustye laddes might goe to hazard for halfe a dozen of these Dio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses. Not a page <unclear>but</unclear> woulde haue a flinge at some or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4607:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other impropriation or personage: and in conclusion, those liuings which now maintaine so many schollers and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, would in two or thrée yeares be all spent in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne amongst a <unclear>consort</unclear> of queanes and fidlers, that might carouse on their wine-bench to the confusion of religion. Well, to procéede in this text of reformation: is not this thy meaning <hi>Martin,</hi> that thou wouldest haue two and fiftie thousand Pastors, for two and fiftie thousand Parish churches in England and Wales. If thou saiest the word, we will haue a place in both Uniuersities, begin in Oxford first with the fresh-men, and so go vp to the heades of the Uniuersitie, and then count how many thou canst make. Our Beadles that know the number best, would néedes perswade vs, that of all sortes, there is not full thrée thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand: in Cambridge they say there is not so many by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, then call thy wits together, and imagin with thy selfe, out of these thrée thousand, and two thousand of all gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, how many good preachers may be mustered, some foure hundreth as I gesse, peraduenture thou maist rebate them to some fiftie or thréescore, because there is no more open-mouthes of thy profession in both Uniuersities: How farre this fiftie is from fiftie thousand, a farthing worth of Arithmetike will teach you: where wilt thou haue then a competent number to fill vp those defects of dum ministers: inspiration I perceiue must helpe to patch vp your knaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and then welfare the cobler of Norwitch, that being one morning somthing earelie at Saint Androwes, and the Preacher not come before the Psalme was ended, stept vp into the pulpet verie deuoutly, and made me a good thriftis exhortation in the praise of plaine dealing. If this bee not true, aske the Maior that committed him to prison for his labour. Such another Doctour would he proue, that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in election for a liuing that was then in her Maiesties bestowing, came to be examined by men of grauitie in the circumstance of his sufficiencie, who discending est soones

There be thrée Créedes, the Nycen Créede, Athanatius Créede, and the Apostles Créede, all which ought to be belieued vpon paine of damnation.

I kéepe a register of ten thousand such knacks. Why, there is not a Presician in England that hath abused arte, or mistoken a metaphor but I haue his name in blacke and white, what say you to that zealous shéepebyter of your owne edition in Cambridge, that saide the wicked had a scabbe, a braune, and a crust on their conscience, being so full of their wilie gilies, that we that are the true children of God can not tell how to concerne them: or was not hee a sound carde, that talking of the maiestie and authoritie of the scriptures, said they were the swéete meates of Saintes, the houshold stuffe of heauen, and the home spunne cloth of the Lords own loombes, being deliuered from the stonebow of his mouth, when he appeared in glory on mount Sinay: But this is nothing to the good sport of that is behinde. What, I must tell you of a fellow that trolles in his retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike like <hi>Martin</hi> in his riddles. This hors-holy father preaching on a time in Saint Maries at Oxford, came off with this mannerly comparison: There is an vglie and monstrous beast in our tongue-called a hogge, and this vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and monstrous beast in boistrous and tempesteous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lifts vp his suoute into the ayre, and cryes wrough, wrough: euen so (deare people) the children of God in the troublesome time of temptations, cry, Our helpe is

Such another woodcocke was he of Yarmouth, that said openly in the pulpet, whosoeuer weares a vayle, is an whore without exception, and on an other time, two women comming to be churched, whereof the one wore a vaile, the other went without. He began his thankesgiuing in this forme: Let vs giue God thankes for the safe deliuery of one of our sisters, for the other let vs not giue God thankes, for she is a straunger, and we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with her, I take her to be <hi>Dinah</hi> the harlot, that sat by the high way side, for she hath a vayle ouer her face, In the next place to him, shall he be put that raising on the Papists in his Sermon, alledged this argument to confute their religion, Nay (saith he) you may gather what a wicked and spotted religion this papistrie is, for Campi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himselfe that was accounted their chiefest piller, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to haue had the poxe. I haue another in my tables, that handling that place of <hi>Iosua</hi> where <hi>Rahab</hi> entertained his spies, would néedes conclude all Inkéepers to be harlots, because <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot was an Inkéeper.

A good old dunstable doctor here in London, should be the formost of them, that saide his wife was as good as our Ladie: and another time quarrelling with one of his neighbours that was a fadler, about setting vp of the Organs, in a good zeale he lift vp his fist, and stroke out two of his fore téeth, like a right man of peace: where haue you liued my brethren, that you haue not heard of that learned Presbiter, that talking how <hi>Adam</hi> fell by eating of the Apple, discourst thus: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> eate the Apple and gaue it to his wife, whereby is to

be noted that the man eate and the woman eate, the man eate, but how, a snap and away: the woman eat, but how, she laide her thumbe on the stalke, and her finger on the coare and bitte it ouerthwart, in which byting it ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, she broke all the commaundements, insomuch as vnder ten greene spots the ten commandements in euery Apple are comprised: and besides that corrupted her fiue senses. From whence wee may gather this obseruation, that a woman alwaies eates an Apple ouerthwart. Why, this is sound diuinitie, and apt for to edify, <hi>Sed abeundum est mihi,</hi> and from the Cleargie must I leape to the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Wherefore God euen good man <hi>Dauy</hi> of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and better lucke betide thée and thy limbes, then when thou dauncedst a whole sunday at a wedding, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes repenting thy selfe of thy prophane agilitie, thou entredst into a more serious meditation against what table thou hadst sinned, or what part was the principall in this antike iniquitie. The eyes they were the formost in this enditement, but the legs, (O those leude legs,) they brought him thither, they kept him there, they leapt, they daunced, and I leualted to the Uials of vanitie: wherefore, what didst thou but like a true christian chastised them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The scripture saith, if thine eye offend thee, plucke it out, <hi>Dauy</hi> saith, my hose and shoes haue offended mée, therefore will I plucke them off. This text thus applyed, off went the wollen stockings with a trice, and they with the good neates leather shoes were cast both into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a well. The sinners thus punished, and all parties pleased, home went the pilgrim <hi>Dauy</hi> barefoote and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legge. And now since wind and tide serues, now I care not if I cut ouer to Ipswitch: there is a Cowdresser there that I am sure will entertaine me if she be not dead, great <hi>Iane</hi> of Ipswitch they call her, one that hath béene a tender mother to many a Martinist in her time, and hath a very good insight in a canne of strong wine. A good vertuous

Matrone is she and a wise, hauing no fault but this, that she will be drinke once a day, and then she lyes her downe on her bedde, and cryes, O my God, my God, thou knowest I am drunke, and why I should offend thee my God by <unclear>spuing</unclear> thus, as I do. I haue not beene in Essex yet, but Ile set in my staffe there as I go home, for I haue a petition for my brother that made the Sermon of Repentance to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vp for me to the Councell: but it must not be such a one as he deliuered for him selfe to my Lord Treasurer, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with O sweet Margery, could thy eyes see so fare, thy hands féele so farre, or thy eares heare so farre &amp;c. for then euerie seruing man will mocke vs, but it must be of another tune, with most pitifully complaining, that a man can not call an Asse, asse, but he shall be had <hi>coram nobis,</hi> In this vaine enough, because actions of the case are chargeable, &amp; Guilde men vncharitable. If the dogge <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> barke againe, Ile hold him tugge for two or thrée cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and then beware my blacke booke you were best, for I haue not halfe emboweld my register. Amend, amend, and glorie no more in your hipocrisie, least your pride and vaine glory betray our prosperitie to our enimies, and procure the Lords vengeance to dwell in the gates of our citie. The simple are abused, the ignorant deluded, &amp; Gods truth most pitifully peruersed, and thou art that most wretched seducer, that vnder wolues raiment deuourest widowes houses. Ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are ceast, and all extraordinarie reuelation ended, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a good fellow in Cambridge, hearing all thinges might be obtained by prayer, prayed two dayes and two nightes for visions: wherefore broach no more heresies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of inspiration: if thou doest, thou art like to heare of me by the next Carrier. And so bon nute to your Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishippe.</p>
