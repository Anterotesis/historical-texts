            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This is a singular good way for teachers to conuert and confirme soules, by speaking vnto men of their owne sence, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their faith.

This is the best way to teach the ignorant, and to conuert sinners vnto God, by our owne faith, feeling, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and practise: of this we haue many sweet presidents in scripture.

                  <p>The metaphor of the Hen couering her young with her winges and feathers, is no lesse comfortable than familiar.

bodies from the strokes and darts of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: so the holy promise of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and deliuerance receiued by faith, strongly confirmeth our hearts to receiue any calamities or plague, and to rest confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, as out of all danger in Gods almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie shadow.

                  <p>Now to returne to our purpose, these three questions may here be considered.</p>

                  <p>To come then to the Booke of God: first let vs learne I say, wherefore the Lord
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17632:27"/>
hath sent in all ages this destroyer into the world. And next we will in like manner consider of the instruments and meanes whereby the Lorde poysoneth the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and so smiteth man with the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And lastly, to what ende hee thus proceeds in execution of his feareful iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>The causes which moue the Lorde to persecute the worlde vniuersally with the Pestilence, are the intollerable sinnes of men: and in the Church these speciall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties and wickednesses which followe, as motiues, and causes of this euill, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto our wise and godly considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>First I sinde, that ignorance, contempt, <note place="margin">The first cause of the pestilence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:17632:28"/>
A second cause is infidelitie and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the word, and the holy ministrie <note place="margin">

                  <p>Let the ninth cause bee the abuse of the holy Sacraments, as in generall of all disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so no doubt one especiall of the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

Cor. 11. 30. This also is a generall impietie, which hath ouer-spread Citie, Towne, and Countrey: for Saboths and Sacraments be exceedingly prophaned, by reason of the blinde ministrie of the land. Christ is not preached, his diuine mystries be not opened to the people. The precious and the vile are alike accepted to the Lordes Table.

                  <p>The tenth cause: the Lorde Iesus saith,

the Pestilence is one of the messengrs of his comming.

                  <p>In the fift verse, The Pestilence hath two fit names, 1. <hi>The terror of the the night,</hi> a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie of the effect for the cause, because this sicknesse breeds many terrors &amp; feares in the night.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the night is a sollitary time, and solitarinesse doth encrease feares.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When the Lord mindeth to amaze his enemies with any terrors, hee powreth his iudgements vpon them in the night season: <note place="margin">Note what sundrv ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects this feare wrought in Phatoh and all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</note> when hee would shake all <hi>Egypt,</hi> hee slew one, euen the first borne in euery house in <hi>Egypt,</hi> at mid-night; and it caused a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full crying and lamentation throughout the whole land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 29. 30. 33.

                  <p>First, the Pestilence is called, <hi>the arrow that flyeth by day.</hi> So <hi>Dauid</hi> called it, Psal. 38. For that it comes inuisibly, if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not wel sighted they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hardly discerne how it flies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that it comes swiftly, a man can hardly auoid it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because it strikes suddenly, as an arrow doth when men thinke least of it, sometimes in their mirth-making, feasting, gaming, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:17632:33"/>
Fourthly, an arrow if it come neere the heart, giues a deadly wound; so this euill if it come once neere the heart, the Phisitions confesse it incurable.</p>
                  <p>In the 6. verse. The 2. trophes set down verse. 5. are expressed verse 6. Hee deliuers his meaning in plaine tearmes, which hee had vttered before, verse 3. and 5. in meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors and in borrowed speeches: The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> hath in verse 5. <hi>The feare of the night, the arrow that flyeth, &amp;c.</hi> then the verse 6. <hi>The Pestilence,</hi> so that we may very fitly ad the word <hi>(I meane)</hi> or <hi>I vnderstand,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to expresse the Prophets minde. It is said againe, 1. that the Pestilence <hi>walketh in the darknes,</hi> 2. <hi>that it destroyeth at noone-day.</hi> The pestilence, as some of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t auouch, is more violent in the night then in the day, &amp; at mid-day, then in any other part of the day. First for the night, the ayre is made more grosse and thicke, with the coldnes of the night, and then the strong contagious poyson spread in the ayre, being driuen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither (as in the generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of meteors, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">No wisdom in time of Pestilence to walke in the aires of night.</note> and lightnings in the middle region of the aire) it is made more violent and deadly where it lighteth or smiteth any man.</p>

Secondly, where it is saide to <hi>destroy at noonday:</hi> the cause of this (they say) is for that in the day, the pores of our bodies are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and then when the Sun is in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pitch of the meridionall line, most open in all parts and arteries. This time therefore are we most apt to receiue any poyson, and this infectious vapour can soonest pierce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our secret parts.</p>
                  <p>And it is knowne by the experience of many yeares, that albeit the heate of the Sun cause not this pestiserous exhalation, yet it may cause it to be more violent, and that all windes that come from that part, breed pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction and rottennesse in all places.</p>
                  <p>This saith one Aphorisme of <hi>Hipocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>

But I iudge the simple meaning of the holy Ghost may be this: That the Pestilence spares not where God sends it, but smites downe at all times, as at midnight, so at mid-day all alike: in saire weather and in soule, in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and in the vallevs, in the best ayres and in the worst, &amp;c. And therefore when God shootes this arrow, men are

warned here to be in a readines at all times and in all places. Watch (saith our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ) for ye know not what houre the theefe commeth. Thus much briefly for the sense and meaning of these two verses.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs consider yet somewhat more carefully, seeing the Pestilence breeds so many feares and terrors night and day, and is so great an enemie and destroyer of man-kinde: what instrumentes and meanes the Lord vseth for the affliction of his people in the Pestilence.</p>

from the which windes doubtlesse it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that many infections of the ayre, and this infection chiefly doth arise.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17632:42"/>
and to cause the naturall faculties and parts of the body, eyther not to be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their duties, or to benumbe the body, or to do farre more, with greater strength and violence then nature alone can effect: such were those the scripture cals <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In which most grieuous affliction, Sathan doth most commonly bereaue the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the vse of common sense and reason, working in them beside their ordinarie course of nature straunge effects, euen such as the most iudicious both Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Diuines cannot ascribe to any other cause but to Sathans effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
                  <p>There is great wisedome and heede to bee taken in helping and healing such at this day; for it is not done by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration or diuination, as Popish Priestes professe and practise, but by entreating the Lord humbly in fasting and prayer. I see no warrant we haue to talke or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion with Sathan: for hee is the Lords executioner, hee hath sent him; what authoritie then haue wee to commaund
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17632:43"/>
him to depart, where God hath sent him. A Prince or Magistrate is offended with a subiect for some disloyaltie, an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer is sent to imprison him: shall hee or any other, charge the Officer in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces name to let him alone, and not to touch him? Is it not their way onely to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the Prince, and so the Magistrate will commaund the Officer to surcease? euen so where God sendeth Sathan his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner to arest any person in any forme or manner, in body or minde: the onely way no doubt, is to entreat the Lord to be pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to rebuke Sathan.</p>
                  <p>Againe, we reade often that Sathan tormented many in sundry most grieuous diseases, which I call the third and mixt kinde; for by secret poysons hee hath made them incurable to the best practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in Phisicke in all ages. The good woman mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 13. <hi>verse</hi> 16. shee is saide to bee bounde of Sathan 18. yeares, <hi>and to haue a spirit of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</hi>

                  <p>And such were many lunatikes, and may be to this day, they had a disease of causes partly knowne, partly vnknowne,

                  <p>The learned deriue the cause of this euill from the Moone as the name impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, because they haue obserued, that such as are borne in the change are thus pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but note what the Euangelist ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and wee shall see the secret cause of it, verse 18. <hi>Iesus rebuked the diuell, and hee went out of him, and the childe was healed in that houre.</hi>

                  <p>Of this third and last kinde I iudge to bee our common plague and pestilence at this day. My reasons are: First it is partly naturall; for if there were here no naturall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> cause, then those whom the plague hath infected, cannot doubtlesse so much as bee cased; much lesse healed by naturall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: but this second to bee very false, our common sence and experience dayly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs. Secondly, it must haue also some secret cause: for the learned, as I haue before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> noted, cannot finde it to arise of any elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall qualitie in nature. But my greatest and surest ground is this, the word of the Lorde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> speaketh it plainly, that the wicked spirits are his messengers, and his instruments for this purpose.</p>
                  <p>

If any doubt of this, let him looke into the iudgements which were inflicted vpon <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> by the ministerie of wicked spirites, for so the Psalmist speaketh, they vexed and tormented <hi>Egypt</hi> with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plagues.</p>

Now let vs not be brutishly secure and senslesse as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly be, but let vs make a holy vse, as of all the Lords chasticeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, so of the pestilence, comforting euery man himselfe by the word of the Lorde, on this manner as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>First, I consider the Pestilence and the like calamities on Gods people, to be Gods holy visitation, to call men to a serious and a publique humiliation before him, that their <hi>iniquitie may bee purged,</hi> and <hi>this is all</hi>

And this we shall sinde in due time true, if wee compare his lenitie with vs, and his fierce wrath vpon many citties in the Popes dominions. Conferre

                     <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. 15. and 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> verse 12. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I consider the Lords chastice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">How to comfort our selues and to make vse of afflictions.</note> as effects of the great and certaine decree of God vpon mee. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. what God hath decreed must come to passe: God hath deered to make the Saints through af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, that is, all maner of chasticements whatsoeuer, conformable to the image of his sonne Christ: The best beloued Sonne wanted not rods all the life hee liued vpon earth, and therefore I must not otherwhiles want them. I must beare many crosses on earth, before I shall be crowned with Christ in heauen.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I know Christ seeth dayly all my sores, all my griefs, all my paines, all my troubles, all my teares, they are as well knowne vnto him, as if they were distilled by drops into his bottle, and the number of them by iust account set downe in his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 8. <hi>Thou hast counted my wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, put my teares into thy bottle, are they not in thy Register?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I consider all these greeuances of this life as vndoubted seales of mine immortalitie: for the Lorde hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to bring mee to immortalitie, to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17632:47"/>
blisse voyd of all miserie, &amp;c. The effects of his decree I know, and see in my vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Iustification, and sanctification: but the life promised as yet I finde not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of my manifold afflictions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall vndoubtedly finde it when this life is ended.</p>
                  <p>Eiftly, I learne in Gods booke, that the diseases of the body, and all other afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this life, they are ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sent vpon Gods people and holy seruants, to worke in them a more serious humiliation for the sinnes of their youth, either because they were neuer throughly humbled for them, or least they fall dangerously into the same sinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 25. 6. <hi>Remember not the sinnes of my youth, nor my rebellions, but according to thy kindnesse remember thou me, euen for thy goodnesse sake O Lord.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, chap. 13. 26. <hi>Thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possesse the sinnes of my youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, I consider also that God would haue vs his children beaten <note n="*" place="margin">The godly are beaten for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their brethr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Sixtly, I see and know the corruptions of mine heart to be so many, and the dulnes and dimmesse of my minde to be such, that if I were not often by the crosse brought to hearken and to obey, I should neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand aright the Lords reueiled will, nor practise it with any sincerity in my life.

Lastly, after iust triall and examination had of our owne hearts, if we finde it in our selues, let vs labor with all our strength to cherish it &amp; preserue it; if we finde we haue it not, let vs neuer giue our selues any rest, but contend in all the meanes appointed, to come to Iesus Christ, that he may giue it vs, for he alone can giue it, and strength to keepe it.</p>
                  <p>Conscience is described of some, to be a liuing lawe in our hearts, which stirreth, awaketh, &amp; driueth vs vnto good things. I suppose wee may truly describe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science first generally, on this manner: <hi>Conscience is an inward remembrancer in our minds, and hearts, witnessing eyther with vs, or</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The cause wherefore the Lord hath put this remembrancer in man is this: a small light, and weake knowledge would soone lve hid, and be as buried in him, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the corruption of our hearts and affections: therefore the Lord hath left him this feeling, as a keeper and a watch to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake him, to marke and espie all his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and continually to present him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <p>The seate of this <note n="*" place="margin">Or the Lords hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing.</note> remembrancer is the vnderstanding, yet for that it is found sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly to smite the heart, therefore the holy Ghost euer seates him there: So <hi>Salomon</hi> noteth speaking to <hi>Shimei:</hi> Thou knowest all the wickednesse <hi>(wherevnto thine heart is priuie)</hi> that thou didst to <hi>Dauid</hi> my father.

                     <hi>I will be with him in troubles.</hi> This is the 2. promise.

for: by these Elders, the holy spirit vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth else-where the holy Ministers chiefly, and with them the godly brethren which were their helpers in their ministrie and spirituall seruice vnto God and his church, men of knowledge, wisedome, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and godlinesse without rebuke.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hee saith not one, but many Elders, not one Elder: for here in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall seruice, as in many other corporall actions, that is true which the Preacher saith, <hi>Two are better then one.</hi> Againe, the loue, iudgement, experience, faith, feeling, <note place="margin">

For the first sort, I commend vnto them these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rules following. 1. they must summon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vnto the iudgement seat of God, and looke on the plague as on the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Gods wrath, which cannot be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with change of places, but by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and amendment of life, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:17632:95"/>
And here when the Lord shall change the life of anie of thy good friends, be not cast downe, as they which are without hope: But remember <hi>Cyprians</hi> words: <hi>No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amittimus nostros, sed tantum premittimus: We haue not loct our good friends, but we haue onely sent them before vs.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5 Lastly, the Pastors and elders (as here <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh) may not depart, for how then shall the sicke be visited and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; which thing seemeth here to be commaunded &amp; commended by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Apostle vnto them.</p>
                  <p>The second sort make many obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which may be thus answered. First they say, Gods decree is vnchangeable: Frgo <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ob.</hi>
                     </note> it is in vain to depart or to goe anie thing aside, for no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can escape his decree, and so death when he sends it.</p>
                  <p>This argument is not good: for Gods decree doth not take away ordinarie and

B. If there come into the pestilence no naturall causes, then these whome the plague hath infected, cannot doubtlesse so much as be eased, much lesse be healed by naturall remedies. But this seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be very false, experience &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense do daily tell vs. Wherefore I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that naturall remedies must not be neglected.</p>
            <p>Againe, whereas others doe obiect, that phisicke heere often is seene to haue but small good successe: I answere, that we must not say of naturall preseruatiues, that because they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> not benefite one or two, or three: therefore they cannot helpe any at all. It is a badde conclusion: for consider that God doth gouerne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall causes and their effects as it pleaseth him, and blesseth them to whom hee will,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17632:98"/>
where and when he will.</p>
            <p>And hence it commeth, that the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion toucheth not euerie one that is in daunger of it, neither is it deadly to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one that is infected.</p>
            <p>Others yet more fondly dispute against naturall remedies in this sicknesse: and they saie that God hath here a more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prouidence, and he will smite whom he will to death, and therefore all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are to small purpose. These men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine want iudgement.</p>
            <p>I answere, that the Lord no doubt, when he sent a famine into Egypt, and the regions there-about, he determined who should die in that scarcitie: yet for all this, ceaseth not <hi>Ioseph</hi> with most wise counsell, to prouide for the Egyptians, and <hi>Iacob</hi> for his familie.
