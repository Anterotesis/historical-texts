                  <note>This work is in part supplementary to the English ed. of Exquemelin's Bucaniers of America, 1684, and in part a vindication of the English, especially Capt. Henry Morgan, from the aspersions of that writer. "The adventures of Capt. Barth. Sharp and others in the South Sea" (p. 1-114) differs from both Basil Ringrose's account, published in "Bucaniers of America, the second volume, containing the dangerous voyage ... of Captain Bartholomew Sharp," 1685, and Sharpe's own journal as printed in William Hack's Collection of original voyages, 1699.</note>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Reader may well
wonder at the disposing
thus, the several Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this small Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume:
I shall therefore for his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
give this following account.
That the Exploits of Captain <hi>Sharp,</hi>
and others in the South Sea, in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Emperour of <hi>Darien,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60800:3"/>
being the first that came to my Hands,
at the time the late History of Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canieres
was published; and I find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be a plain Journal, not
unpleasant, and much of the same
kind, writ by a Seaman, though not
learned and accurate in his stile; yet
one that certainly was very skilful and
industrious in the Art of Sailing, who
seems to have given a true and just
Relation of what befel them in that
Expedition: most of which I have
heard confirmed by others, who were
actually present in all those Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
For that reason I thought
it might not be unacceptable to the
world. To which I have only this to
add, That this Emperor of <hi>Darien</hi>
had been formerly surprized by the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by them carried to
<hi>Panama,</hi> where he learnt indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Language, and
was called by them <hi>Sennordon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60800:3"/>
But he, after his escape,
for their kind treatment of him, has
never ceased making War upon them,
always falling on whereever he sees
any good opportunity; and when like
to be overpowered, he retreats amongst
his Hills, Woods, and Rivers, with which
last his Countrey is very well stored, and
so baffles the industrious revenge of his
Enemies. The exact limits of that
which is properly called the Province
or District of <hi>Darien</hi> (which our
Author has omitted to give us) are
thus described.</p>
            <p>It is bounded on the South by the
Kingdom of <hi>New Granada;</hi> by the
Gulf of <hi>Uraba</hi> or <hi>Darien</hi> on the
East; by the South Sea on the West;
and on the North by the Province
of <hi>Panama;</hi> to which Government
this is now annexed, I mean, so
much as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have of it.
<pb facs="tcp:60800:4"/>
It took its name from the River so
called, running into the South Sea, and
has a small Town, though once a great
City, called <hi>Santa Maria del Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien,</hi>
but more commonly, <hi>Santa
Maria</hi> only, and sometimes <hi>la An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigua,</hi>
signifying the Ancient Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The next thing which is a short
Account of <hi>Van Horns</hi> taking <hi>la
Vera Cruz,</hi> being more Modern,
and of the same nature, I added; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the destroying the <hi>French</hi>
Pyrates by Captain <hi>Carlisle,</hi> that it
may be seen what care is taken to
suppress such as molest so considerable
a support of our Nation, as is our
Trade and Commerce with Foreign
Countries; of which that with <hi>Spain</hi>
is not the least: for by it more of
our Manufactures are taken off, than
by any other whatsoever. Besides
<pb facs="tcp:60800:4"/>
this of Captain <hi>Carlisle</hi>'s, if I had
the leasure, I could have given an
account of several others, both Men
of War, and Merchant-Ships, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and manned out as such, by the
Goverours of <hi>Jamaica, Barbados,</hi>
and the <hi>Leeward Islands,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
for scouring the Seas of the
Buccanieres or Pyrates, who being
a mixture of divers Nations, but
the greatest part of them <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Dutch,</hi> make Prize of all they
meet.</p>
            <p>The third Relation is of Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Morgan,</hi> which according to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
ought to have been placed first, but
I had no intentions of printing that,
till I had read over and considered
the said History of Buccanieres, and
then thought my self obliged no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to conceal such an Authentick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that Expedition: To which
<pb facs="tcp:60800:5"/>
I have adjoyned the President of
<hi>Panama</hi>'s Letter, which was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
going for <hi>Spain,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
(if need were) the Credit of
the precedent Relation.</p>
            <p>As to the last Paper, in which
is mentioned the settling the Peace
in those parts, with a Description
of the City of <hi>Carthagena;</hi> since
it related somewhat to the foregoing
Pieces, I thought it not improper,
with it to conclude these Miscella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
            <p>But I confess, I had yet another
design in printing that one Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> which
was, That I might in some measure
rescue the Honour of that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Souldier and Seaman, from
the Hands of such as would load him
with the blackest infamy. I could not
<pb facs="tcp:60800:5"/>
therefore forbear making some few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on the aforementioned Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of Buccanieres, but more
especially that part which concerns
Sir <hi>Henry Morgan</hi> and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
For it is against them, the
Authors Malice seems most to be aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
endeavouring on all occasions to
represent them the most Lewd, Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and Barbarous People in the
World.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Translator, who,
I confess, seems to have performed
his part well enough, in having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
does in his Encomiums of the
Author, comparing him to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Historian <hi>Comines,</hi> very
much extoll his Candour, and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
in recording the Actions and
Valour of the <hi>English;</hi> then at
large he commends his Stile and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod;
<pb facs="tcp:60800:6"/>
and highly applauds the
Truth and Sincerity of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>I will not trouble my self to shew
the inequality of the Parallel, with
the incomparable <hi>Comines:</hi> And
as for his faithful recording their
Actions, and Valour, I must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him to have writ some of their
heroick Exploits well enough, which
of themselves were so Eminent,
that had he gone about to have les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened,
it would have taken away
all credit from his History: But
he has most maliciously stigmatized
them all the while, as valiant
Thieves and Murderers. So that
there is no Man that reads them,
who does not conceive a horrour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the barbarous Actors of those
Cruelties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60800:6"/>
Neither will I find fault with the
Authors Stile, and Method; But it
is chiefly the boasted Truth and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of the History which I am most
concerned to expose, being therein
able to detect innumerable Falsities;
and for Vouchers of what I affirm,
can produce a whole Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
many of which Romances are
so palpable, that the Author could
not possibly write them by mistake,
but has inserted them on purpose,
certainly as embellishments to set off
his Story.</p>
            <p>To begin then with Sir <hi>Henry Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>'s
Parentage; He makes him
the Son of a Yeoman, and that be
sold himself for <hi>Barbados;</hi> when
it is sufficiently known he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
of an honourable Family in
<hi>Monmouthshire,</hi> and went at first
<pb facs="tcp:60800:7"/>
out of <hi>England,</hi> with the Army
commanded by General <hi>Venables</hi> for
<hi>Hispaniola</hi> and <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then his cruel usage of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
at <hi>Puerto Velo, Maracàibo,
Gibraltàr</hi> and <hi>Panamà,</hi> Murdering
many in cold blood; Racking and
torturing some to confess where their
Treasure lay, till they dyed; Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
others in Prison; Ravishing
Women, and the like barbarities;
which this <hi>Dutch Comines</hi> affirms
he saw him not only suffer his Men
daily to commit, but acted himself
as their example. All those Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties,
contrary to the nature and
temper of an <hi>Englishman,</hi> I have
heard absolutely contradicted by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of infallible credit; and any
may be convinced of the fouluess of
the Scandal thrown on this Excellent
Man, who are but acquainted with
<pb facs="tcp:60800:7"/>
such as then lived in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of whom are now living in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
Nay the <hi>English</hi> Merchants
of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> who resided ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at the
time these <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Panama</hi>
returned from the <hi>Indies,</hi> affirm, that
those very persons confessed, Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Morgan</hi> was so far from doing
any such base Actions, That they
highly applauded his Generosity, and
the Care he took, That none of those
severe things should be practised by
his Men, as are usual by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
when he has his Enemies at
his mercy, after an obstinate resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
This makes me think that
our <hi>Dutch</hi> Author, having the Idea
of the Business of <hi>Amboina</hi> in his
Head, has endeavoured to copy
out that, and lay it on the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
to render them as infamous to
Posterity, for these supposed villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> as some of his
<pb facs="tcp:60800:8"/>
Countreymen have by their real ones in
the <hi>East.</hi>

            <p>I am also assured by good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
That the Tale of Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Morgan</hi> his ill usage of the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Lady at <hi>Panama,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
a Romance; for so careful
was he, that as soon as he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Town, and quenched the fire,
he caused most of the Women of the
City to be brought to one place,
where he set a strict guard over them,
to prevent the Souldiers, or any others
abusing them, and gave out his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
prohibiting all men the offering
them the least violence or injury, on
pain of a severe punishment. And
under what loose government soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his men are represented to have
lived; I affirm, That few Generals
have kept their Armies with a more strict
Discipline, than he. Nor can I think
<pb facs="tcp:60800:8"/>
it possible for him to have done all
those great Actions with Men of so base
and dissolute tempers, as our <hi>Dutch</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
paints them to be: But, <hi>Pien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
el Ladron, quetodos son de su
Condicion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for confirmation of what I have
now asserted; At his return from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi>
when he brought the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to <hi>la Cruz,</hi> in his way to
<hi>Chagre</hi> Castle, to induce them to
pay their Ransomes; the Women, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such as seemed to be of any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and could ride, were set on Horses,
Mules, or Asses, and had Men appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to attend them with all respect. And
our <hi>Dutch Mandevil</hi> says that such
as were not able to redeem themselves,
were transported; which is of equal cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
with the rest of his villanous Tales.
For I am assured that no one person,
Man, Woman or Child (the Slaves
<pb facs="tcp:60800:9"/>
only excepted) were so much as ever
carried a shipboard, but were acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and set at liberty, when he embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
            <p>Moreover this Celebrated Buccanier
Historian, relating these Acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility
done in the <hi>Indies</hi> against the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> insinuates all along, That
these were all Robberies and savage
Butcheries, committed by Sir <hi>Henry
Morgan</hi> and the rest of his Crew,
who were a parcel of Thieves, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
and Pyrates; Men who did all
this for the sake of Plunder, Blood-shed,
and Rapine, without any other
colour or pretext whatsoever; filling
the World with horrour and amazement
at the reading his terrible Stories: So
that out of Malice, or at best, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
he omits to tell us, That though
we had not formally a War proclaimed
against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60800:9"/>
yet would not they listen to any
proposals of Peace with us, beyond the
Tropick, till about the year 1670.
that it had been concluded in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid
by Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> his
Majesties Ambassador there, and the
Articles sent over from hence by
Sir <hi>Thomas Linch</hi> to <hi>Jamaica;</hi>
before which time, there daily happened
great Acts of Hostility and Depredations
on either side, done as well by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
against us, as by the <hi>English</hi>
against them; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o doubt but Revenge
spurred on many that had been sufferers,
to the committing some severe things,
and to heightening the Rage on both sides.
For the <hi>Spaniards</hi> all this while were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot idle, they took our Merchants ships;
Plundred and spoiled our Plantations,
particularly at <hi>Jamaica;</hi> Used our
Men with all the severity and rigour,
that an enemy could do, throwing them
over board, exposing them in Boats,
<pb facs="tcp:60800:10"/>
and on Rafts, without Provision, to
the mercy of the Sea; Turning them on
uninhabited Islands; Leaving them on
Countreys to be destroyed by the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
keeping and starving them in
Dungeo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and making slaves of them.
All which severities might well incense
such as out-lived these miseries, if
they ever escaped, to put in practice all
manner of Revenge.</p>
            <p>Now if I have rightly stated this
point, then neither Sir <hi>Henry Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
nor any that fought under him, can
be said to be Pyrates or Buccanieres;
<hi>I</hi> mean, if he acted by Commission
from Sir <hi>Thomas Muddiford,</hi> or
any Governour of <hi>Jamaica</hi> before him;
as, if I mistake not, I have heard he
really did; which if true, though
done without the Kings allowance or
knowledge, I presume it justifies him,
though not the Governour; So that any
<pb facs="tcp:60800:10"/>
Fleet, might in time of War as well be
called Pyrates; and an Historian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the miseries attending a War
between two Princes, might term the
men slain in Battle, to be murdered;
and the Calamities befalling a Town
taken by storm, to be cruelties exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
by Thieves and Robbers, for
the sake of Plunder, and satiating their
thirst after Blood.</p>
            <p>I would not have any judge me so
vain, to think my self able to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
these men from every ill Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and imagine I could make them
pass for Saints: But I still affirm,
that those dismal Stories of Murdering
in cold Blood, Torturing, Ravishing,
Starving, and other such Barbarities,
are foisted in by the Author, to lard
his History with delightful variety,
and to fix an odium on the English
Nation in general, that they may be
<pb facs="tcp:60800:11"/>
hated by others. And I further say,
That perchance never Man behaved
himself with more true valour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of mind to accomplish what
he had undertaken, shewed more
prudent and soldierly Conduct, nor
took more care for preventing all ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities
amongst his Men, by his
own example, than the renowned
Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> who has been
thus scandalously affronted by these
Sourrilous Pens: For I cannot call
otherwise either the <hi>Dutch</hi> Author,
or <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
Since there is no doubt but that
if he had been the Pyrate, and ill
Man, he is by them painted out to
be; he would have been punished
as such a one, instead of being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with a Knighthood, as he
was at his coming home to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
and since that made Deputy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisle,</hi>

            <p>There is one absurd story more,
amongst many others, which I had
like to have passed over without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark;
that is, His firing the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

to it, as this <hi>French-Hollander</hi>
affirms; which if he did, it was
but ill Policy, to burn the Town he
came so far to plunder, 'ere he was
well got within it. But this is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the President, in his Letter,
to have been done by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
themselves, on purpose to disappoint
the <hi>English</hi> of their Booty. By this
ridiculous falsity, may the Credit of
the rest of that History be conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured.</p>
            <p>Many errours could I point out in
<pb facs="tcp:60800:12"/>
that which is his <hi>Natural History
of the</hi> Indies; as for instance, his
Story of seeing the Caymanes or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codrills
suffer their young ones to
play and run into their Bellies; for
which Fancy he must have been, I
suppose, obliged to <hi>Pliny</hi> or <hi>Aelian;</hi>
for I dare say, no Man that has
lived in the <hi>Indies</hi> will vouch for
him. But these being besides my
business, I pass by: and have only this
more to say, That I forbear to print
any more, at present, than that one
Expedition of Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi>
thinking that sufficient to convince
the Falsities of that scandalous History
of Buccanieres.</p>
            <p>What acts of Hostility have been
committed since the Peace made
in the year 1670. betwixt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
and the Privatiers of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Nations; have been many and
<pb facs="tcp:60800:12"/>
considerable, amongst which we have
had no small loss fallen on our Merchant
men, trading there in the <hi>West-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
causing a great obstruction to
our Trade. The number of our Ships
taken since then, as I am informed,
is no less than one Hundred and
Twenty, a List of at least one half
of which, I am able to have here
inserted; which thing I fear increases
the number of Privatiers, in those Seas.</p>

Enterprize; which was to go

of our own there, and there being no

could have intelligence of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and the satisfaction we had of
the promise of having along with us,
the Company of our Emperour, under

say were the allurements that induced us
to list our selves into this Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5. Mund.</hi> All things being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
on, upon Munday the fifth day
of <hi>April</hi> we landed about Seven a Clock
in the morning, and began our march
with our Emperour in the head of us till
two in the afternoon, and took up our
Quarters for that night in some Indian
Houses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6. Tuesd.</hi> At the first appearance of
day we began our march; our last
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60800:15"/>
nights Lodging, (Chambers and Silk
Beds being as much out of Fashion here,
as they were in <hi>Adam</hi>'s time) was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
better than the cold Earth cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Starry Canopy, which gave
us but small encouragement to stay long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and travelled up a steep Mountain
till about three, at which hour we came
to a fresh Spring of Water where we sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down
and rested our selves, then march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about six miles further we took up
our Lodgings by a River-side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7. Wedn.</hi> Early in the morning we
continued our march to King <hi>Goldencaps</hi>
Court; going till four we met two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
loaden with Fruit which the King
had sent us as a present, which we thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accepted, and marching an hour
longer we came to the King's Pallace,
where he with his Nobility and Men of
the best Quality gave us a kind Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Entertainment. These Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
are very handsome people though
Tawny, but clean limbed and well fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
and are very obliging and affable, as
those of our Men who afterwards marcht
back again, over Land, experienced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8. Thursd.</hi> This day finding such good
Entertainment we staid at the Court,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60800:16"/>
being Favourites not inconsiderable, and
so well Armed and Resolute, as our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>9. Frid.</hi> In the morning we took our
leave, and our path being bad, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to wade a River fifty or sixty times,
which almost foundered us, at last we
came to three large Indian Houses where
we had free quarter, and found all things
convenient for refreshment (by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
and Kings command) ready pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
as <hi>Plantins, Bonanoes</hi> and <hi>Moria
Flesh,</hi> but the same Lodging that Nature
affords Animals, less mischievous than our
selves, the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>10. Saturd.</hi> We continued our march,
and at night took our Lodging, (where
the Poets fancy so many delicacies and
advantages of sensual enjoyment, but
for my part I would not envy their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
had I had the Poets Bed in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
for the Green Bank of a River
on which we lay, whether perfumed
with Roses or Jessamines; our tired limbs
had not leisure to search, or our sences
any vacancy for meer weariness from
sleeping to perceive.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>11. Sund.</hi> Early in the morning, our
Indian consorts having a few small Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60800:16"/>
some of our Men embarked and
going down the River met with several
inconveniences, both Natural and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial:
As first great falls, and then the
Spaniards throwing great T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ees cross the
Rivers, by which we lost several of our
Canoes, the rest of our Men marching
by Land to the place where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
had ordered our Rendezvouz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>12. Mund.</hi> This day the remainder of
our Men embarked at a place where the
Emperour had provided more Canoes,
and had a pleasant Voyage. About four
in the afternoon we arrived at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
place, but not finding our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Souldiers there, who embarked the
day before us, as we expected, it crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in us a jealousie that the Indians had
thus divided us, the better to execute
some treachery, by the assistance of the
Spaniard, the Emperor perceiving by
our Caballing and Whispering among
our selves, that we had some cause of
dissatisfaction, Commanded a Canoe to
row up another arm of the River in
search of our Men, and meeting two
Canoes with some of them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with all expedition to us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
us of their safety, and that they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60800:17"/>
had been honourably treated by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
and would be with us the next
morning; so here we staid for them this
night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>13. Tuesd.</hi> This day all our party met,
which not a little confirmed us in the
good opinion we had of the Indians fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity;
we staid here all day to rest our
selves, and fit our Arms and Necessaries
for our next days proceedings, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
acquainting us we were near the
Town, which we were glad to hear; our
tedious march put us quite out of fancy
of walking to take the Air any more,
now we were fallen so low down the
River; the Emperour and the King
had provided Canoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> enough for
us all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>14. Wedn.</hi> We rose with the day,
and all embarked, also the Emperour and
King with us; the Emperour was Cloathed
with a loose Robe or Mantle of pure
Gold, which was extraordinary Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
and Rich. The King was in a White
Cotton Coat fringed round the bottom,
about his Neck a Belt of Tygers Teeth,
and a Hat of pure Gold, with a Ring
and a Plate like a Cockle Shell hanging
at it of Gold in his Nose, which is the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60800:17"/>
Fashion in this Country for the people
of Quality, and which for what I could
perceive was the only distinction. We
rested not this day or night, and at two
in the morning we landed within two
miles of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> and shrowded our
selves in the Woods till day light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>15. Thursd.</hi> About six this morning we
attacqued the place and carried it with
little difficulty, it being a Stockadoe
Fort, and a small Town o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Thatched
Houses. This Fort of <hi>Santa Maria</hi> was kept
by the Spaniards for the conveniency of
gathering Dust-Gold, which the River
affords plenty of, and the poor Natives
are the Drudges to gather it for them.
We designed to make no further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
being told there was a sufficient
quantity of Gold-dust at this place to
enrich us all, but the wary Spaniards had
carried it away two days before, as
thinking a conveyance of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
safer than ours, though not so
well guarded as it would have been
by us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>17. Saturd.</hi> Disappointment is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive
to Revenge, and good Resolution
the commander of Success; these being
now our cheifest directors, we fitted our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60800:18"/>
Canoes, and got what Provisions we
could, being loth to return empty han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and at the tide of Ebb designed to
fall down, to see what fate would afford
in the Southern Ocean. At this place
it flows near two fathom perpendicular.
The River is else very showly and full of
Banks, which are dry at low Water. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twelve in the night we came to a
Watering place, where we got drink, the
River being Salt, here we staid till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
filling Water, it being very dark,
and the mouth of the River wide, one
branch of it coming from the Golden
Mines; but having no Chymist to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the Ore, we thought it best to go
look for it where it was to be had with
the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Arms on it, for
we like other Children loved Pictures
strangely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>18. Sund.</hi> This morning we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on our intended Voyage, and about
eleven in the forenoon we saw the South
Sea; then coming to a small Isle near
the mouth of the River <hi>Darien</hi> we rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our selves; from this we went to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
about two Leagues distant, and
took our Lodging there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>19. Mund.</hi> At day light we put from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60800:18"/>
this Isle, and rowing not above half an
hour, the Wind blew very hard and
against the tide of Ebb, which made a
great Sea, and had like to have put a
period to all our atcheivements: One of
our Canoes being overset with seven
Men in her; but it pleased God, that
with extream danger even to those that
rescued them, they were all saved. It
being a certain truth that those who are
born to be hang'd shall never be drown'd,
it proving so with us, one of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being hang'd at <hi>Iamaica</hi> on <hi>Port
Royal;</hi> And we were very near it here
in <hi>London;</hi> After this having a violent
storm of rain we were forced on shoar
upon a long sandy bank, where we built
a House and were content to Lodg in it
this night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>20. Tuesd.</hi> This morning it being fair
weather again, we put to Sea with our
Fleet of Canoes. Towards noon it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to blow hard, yet nothing is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to a willing mind, so we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
About two in the after noon we put
ashoar at an Isle to look some Water to
drink, and finding some in the stinking
holes of the Rocks we drank it as hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as Canary. This Island is high, round,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60800:19"/>
and Rocky, and here is plenty of Sea-Fowl;
we staid not long here, but about
four of the Clock we came to <hi>Planting
Isle,</hi> where finding a Bark, and we stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in need of Shipping, put some of our
Men on board here; At this place we
took Quarters for this night; There was
on board the Bark 130. Men, so this
was now our Admiral, the rest being
Canoes that carried from six to fifteen
Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>21. Wedn.</hi> In the morning we depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from this Isle, with the Bark and
Canoes, being bound for the Island of
<hi>Chipila</hi> for Provisions, we in our way
met with one of the Spaniards Armadillo
Barks, or little Men of War, who fell
foul of us, Killing one Man and Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
five more, so left us. Having no
Provisions, and perceiving we should be
continually Skirmishing, we went on
shoar at this Island, and lay there that
night</p>
            <p>
               <hi>22. Thursd.</hi> Finding but small supply
for our wants on this Isle, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to seek further, so we stood to
the Westward, rowing along the shoar
all that day and the night following, in
hopes to reach another Island where we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60800:19"/>
were informed we might accommodate
our selves with neeessaries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>23. Frid.</hi> We parted with our Bark
and 130. Men in her, whom we had
sent to look some Water for us, where
they could find it, early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
And soon after we met with three
Armadillo Barks with 280 Men on board
them, which engaged our Fleet of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes,
having in all scarce above 200 found
Men in them. These three Barks were
fitted out of <hi>Panama,</hi> who by this had
notice from <hi>Santa Maria</hi> of our approach,
on purpose to cut us off, thus unprovided
of Shipping, or convenience of defence,
being in Canoes that carried some six,
some eight and ten, to fifteen Men, which
leaning on one side might overset the
biggest; however nothing daunted at
the disadvantage of Fight, we made a
resolution rather than drown in the Sea,
or beg Quarter of the Spaniard, whom
we used to Conquer, to run the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamest
hazard of Fire and Sword, and
after a sharp Contest, still birding with
our Fusees as many as durst peep over
Deck, we boarded one of them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
her; so with her we took the second;
and the third had certainly run the same
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60800:20"/>
fate, had not she scoured away in time,
(though to speak without diminution of
the Commanders courage) he staid as
long as he could, and we plyed him very
warmly, so that though we know not
certainly how many Men they lost on
board, yet are confident but few found
Men returned to their City.</p>
            <p>In this engagement we had eleven
Men Killed right out, and thirty four
more Wounded dangerously.</p>
            <p>These Vessels being purposely fitted
out for this design, afforded but small
conveniency for our Wounded Men; so
we went in chase of a larger Ship which
we soon after took, put our Wounded
Men on board her, and lay before the
City of <hi>Panama,</hi> as well to refresh our
tired Men, as to show them, they were
not like to be rid of us so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>25. Sund. Captain Iohn Coxon,</hi> with
fifty Men perswaded the Indians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
back, being a little in disgrace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
our Men, as something tainted
with cowardize in the late action, which
made him leave us, and take with him
his Chyrurgeon, and most of our best
Medicines, not having any consideration
or respect for our Wounded Men which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60800:20"/>
we had on board, being forty in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as a Man of moral honesty ought
to have had: Thus making our retreat
the more unsafe by taking away fifty
sound Men, and then leaving us desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of remedies for the recovery of our
Wounded and Sick; but this last thing
was unknown to the rest of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>26. Mund.</hi> Captain <hi>Coxon</hi> being gone,
Captain <hi>Sawkins</hi> and Captain <hi>Sharp</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
full Commission from our said Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Darien,</hi> agreed to stay in those
Seas till our Wounded Men were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
After this we had lay some time
before <hi>Panama,</hi> and took some of their
Ships, one of which slipt by us in the
night, but we followed her with an Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Bark into the Harbour; and so near
the shoar that we could hear the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
talk, and fetched her out again.
She came with money to pay off the
Souldiers, but we eased them of it; it
being 60000 pieces of <hi>Eight,</hi> which we
divided amongst us the next day, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to 247 pieces of <hi>Eight per</hi> Man;
Then we went to a small Island which
they call <hi>Taboga</hi> for Wood, Water, and
other Necessaries, and staid there till
<hi>May</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60800:21"/>
               <hi>May</hi> 13.<note place="margin">An. Dom 1680. May</note> After we had thus for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
days blocked up the Harbour of <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and having maturely debated the
Condition we were in, beginning to
want Provisions, we designed to take
some Town on the Main that might
supply our Necessities; so we weighed
and stood along shoar till the 23. of
<hi>May,</hi> at which time we arrived at the
Isles of <hi>Quiblo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. We landed some of our Men
here to look for Provisions, where Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Sawkins</hi> being too rash, and landing
before the rest of our Men, who were
in other Canoes with Captain <hi>Sharp,</hi>
and running up to the Town, which
having timely notice of our coming, had
made several Brest-works for our recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
entertained him very hotly, yet
he being a man that nothing upon Earth
could terrifie, ran eagerly up to the
end of their works, and though at that
time not one fourth part of our men
were landed, fell in amongst a thousand
of them, as they that retreated informed
us, and was there unfortunately killed
with two men more, and five wounded;
the remainder drew off, still skirmishing
till they came to their Boats, by which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60800:21"/>
time the rest of our Men were landed.</p>
            <p>Thus Rashness and Want of conduct
overthrew our design, yet we took a
Bark at the Rivers mouth loaden with
<hi>Montego</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Corn.</p>
            <p>As affairs were now with us, we
took this for good Provisions, and so
returned to our Ships; When we came
on board there hapned a great distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amongst our Men, which was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by the death of Captain <hi>Sawkins.</hi>
In this mutiny seventy five more of our
Men left us, and returned over Land
as they came, delivering up their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
to our Emperour. Captain <hi>Cooke</hi>
who was Commander of a Ship, not
finding things answering to his desire
and expectation, laid down his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and went on board Captain
<hi>Sharp</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this juncture, things lookt with a
very bad aspect: But Captain <hi>Sharp,</hi>
who was created by us Captain, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
General, made head against all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
and resolved to stay by our
Poor Wounded Men and make a further
discovery in those Seas. For perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of which he ordered Mr. <hi>Iohn Cox</hi>
to fit out the <hi>May-flower,</hi> and put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Front with a Volly of small Shot, which
put a stop to their carreer and courages,
and not finding it safe to come nearer,
fairly wheeled off to the left, and took
shelter amongst the Hills. This confirmed
us that we should get no other Beefs; so
having filled our Water, we that night
went on board, our Ships; leaving the

            <p>3. <hi>Frid.</hi> About two of the Clock in
the morning we Manned our Canoes
and Boat, with eighty five stout Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and away we went for the Town
of <hi>Coquimbo,</hi> resolving not to return
without plundering it in revenge of the
affront the <hi>Heloe</hi> Men put upon us. The
Canoes wherein were thirty five Men
out-rowed the Boat, and Landed before
day, and just upon day light they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the Patroule, which is kept on
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60800:33"/>
the Bay; and at this time did consist of
about 150 Horse, who deriving Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
from their advantage in numbers,
hemmed us in a ring, not doubting but
to have an easie conquest over so few
Men, and rid boldly up to us; our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
considering we were but thirty
five, ordered that but six Men should
Fire at once on the Enemy, to keep
the longer from a close Fight; being
provided of no other Arms then a Fuzee
and a Pistol, as also knowing our Party
would in a little time come up to our res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue,
but whether they did or no, this was
our resolution, to turn our backs on the
water-side and every Man maintain his
ground, or fall upon the spot he stood on.
By this time they were come pretty near,
and I believe scarce a shot flew in vain,
and so quick, having Cartridges alway
fitted for our small Arms, that scarce two
Vollies were fired before those that had
discharged were ready loaded for them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
that he was happiest amongst them
that got furthest behind; thus we bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
them severely, which they, after
they had made a stand to carry off their
dead, not liking, retreated in disorder, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other damage then the Wounding
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60800:33"/>
one Man. We followed the chase, though
but leisurely, that our Men who had
been set on shoar by the Boat, might
come up with us, which in a little time
they did, following us, by the track of our
Feet and tops of the Cartridges, coming
with full speed to our Assistance if there
had been occasion; Then we followed
the Enemy as close as we could, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they had retreated into the Town,
but they decoyed us (to give the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
time to secure their Valuable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities)
a contrary way, and led us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Ditches and watry Swamps;
yet at last we got to the Town, and
in a short time made our selves Masters
of it, with little or no loss on our side.
Here we staid four days to refresh our
selves, finding plenty of Hogs, Fowls,
Mutton, and Sallads, with very good
Wine, which is made here, also great
store of Wheat, Barly, and all <hi>European</hi>
Grain, and many large Orchards as they
have in <hi>Kent,</hi> of Apples, Pears, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewise delicate Gardens of
Apricocks, Peaches, Strawberries, Goose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries,
and other Fruit.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Coquimbo,</hi> Scituate upon
a Hill, is three quarters of a mile square,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60800:34"/>
and has nine good Churches in it;<note place="margin">An. Dom. 1680. Septem.</note> and
it is distant from the Road for Shipping
about Eight Miles. The chief Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture
of the place is Copper, which
they have in abundance.</p>
            <p>Here is also Gold-dust, which washes
out of a great River that runs into the
Sea, at the foot of the Hill whereon
the Town stands, the latitude of the
place is 29 deg. 50 min. South.</p>
            <p>The second day that we were in the
Town, there came six Gentlemen to us,
with a Flag of Truce, desiring that we
would send their Governour some Wine,
for he had none in the Fields where he
lay, which we did, together with some
Fowls. And this Compliment; That if
either Himself or his Lady wanted any
thing that they had left behind them,
Gold, Silver, and Jewels excepted, they
might with freedom command it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, finding we were such so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
Enemies, and so good Natured
Victors, he Invited our Captain to drink
a glass of Wine with him at the top of
a Hill just by the Town side, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
our Captain to come without Arms,
and but with one Man, and he would
do the same, which our Commander
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60800:34"/>
consented to, and met the Governour
with two Bottles of VVine,<note place="margin">An. Dom. 1680. Decem.</note> where they
drank and were merry together, and
where amongst other discourse our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
was not forgotten. Our Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
agreeing with the Governour, who
was unwilling the Town should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished,
to Ransom it for 95000 pieces
of <hi>Eight,</hi> which he promised to send us
the next day.</p>
            <p>So having drank their VVine, they
parted; we receiving the Captain into
the Town with a Volly of small Arms.</p>
            <p>The next day our fancies being filled
with the expectation of so much money,
we were at a pitch of mirth higher then
ordinary, when we received a Letter
from on board our Ship, intimating that
there was an Indian with a couple of Seal
Skins blown like Bladers, of which he
made a float, and in the dead of the
night came under the Stern of our Ship,
with a Ball of Pitch, Sulphur, Oakum,
and such combustible matter, and stuck
it between the Rudd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r and Stern-port,
and set it on fire with a Brimstone match,
after this he left his new Fashioned Boat
and swome on shoar. This fire made
such a stench that almost choaked the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60800:35"/>
Men in the Ship, who else, it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
had not awaked, for had they kept
a good look out, the Indian could not
have effected so great a part of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
some leaped into their Canoes and
others searched within board, and at
last found the fire before it had taken
hold of the Ship. This piece of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
made us despair of our money;
However it wrought this effect upon
us, that ever after, we kept so strict a
watch, that we had prevented any such
other mischiefs, had they attempted the
like against us. And truly as our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
were, it was a deliverance,
no Serious Man will be ever unmindful
to give God Thanks for. For at that
time, had our Ship been burnt, not one
man of us had escaped, the Spaniards being
not easily reconciled to us, for those ill
Offices we had done them since our
visits there on the South Sea Coasts,
and some of us also not unknown
to them in the North Seas; That they
would have hanged the rest if they had
been Saints.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards perceiving their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
had not operated to burn our
Ship, they Early in the morning tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60800:35"/>
all the water sluices into the Town,
which in an hours time, made the
streets almost Ankle deep in water,
which before was dry dust. This they
did, either to drive us out of the
Town, or to have water at hand to
quench it, in case we set it on fire,
which (resolving to keep our word
with the Enemy) we did, firing it in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Places at once, and Packing up
our Luggage, after we had staid till
the greatest part of it was in Flames,
we marched out of it down to the
water side; But the Governour had
drawn all his men from the tops of
the Hills, down into the Vally, by
the water side into the way that we
should pass; So we detached out a
small party for a forlorn, supposing
we must have fought our way through;
But as soon as we began to pink some
of their Jackets for them with our Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zees,
they got out of our reach, and
went to their ruin'd Town leaving us
to go peaceably on Board our Ship.
When we came on Board, we sent a
shoar a great number of our Prisoners,
and amongst the rest <hi>Don Thomas d'Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gondony,</hi>
Captain <hi>Peralta,</hi> Captain <hi>Don Iuan,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60800:36"/>
and many others, some of them
being Merchants, which we had taken
and kept on board, to learn them to
eat <hi>Montego</hi> and <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they no reason to complain of their
entertainment amongst us, they being
very civilly treated with the best our
Ship could afford, which if they do
not justly acknowledge, let them have
a care we call them not to an account for
their ingratitude, when they least think
of it.</p>

            <p>Here we lay and refresht our men,

so it had the same effect
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60800:37"/>
upon our men, for now they are for

            <p>A party of the disaffected to Captain

had none left; having lost it at

            <p>It pleased God as our Ship was newly
made clean and ready to Sail, there
came three Men of War to look for us;
Now we had at that time two Canoes
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60800:38"/>
at the windward side of the Isle,<note place="margin">An. Dom. 1680. Ianuar.</note> setching
Goats, who saw the three Men of
War, and gave us notice of them, so
that we had just time to get our Men
on Board, who were most of them at
that time on shoar, cutting wood and
washing their clothes. As soon as they
were got on Board, the Ships came in
sight, so we got up one Anchor, and
left the other behind us. We heysted
in our Canoes and Boat, and clapt close
by the wind, for at this time those
Ships were to Leeward of us about
two miles; their Admiral sailed well,
so that in chase of us, the other two
were two leagues distant from him;
now knowing we could deal well
enough with him, tho he had twelve
great Guns, and we not one, we
went about-Ship, resolving to Board
him before the other two could come
up with us, and then we should be
ready for them.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nto two Parties, of which 40
were designed for the Fort, and the rest
for the City.</p>
            <p>When we drew near the Town, we
saw a great number of Men drawn up
without their works, in a plain Sandy
Ground, who fired at our Party that
marched towards the Town, and our
Men returning their compliment kept
on their way; our other Party that
were for the Fort seeing us ingaged,
hasted down the Hill, with a Shour,
and cried, <hi>They run, they run,</hi> and then
firing on their Flank, made them run
in good Earnest, and with what haste
they could, get into their Breast-works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:60800:41"/>
When we were united into one body
the Enemy played their Cannon briskly
upon us; So we resolved to attaque
their Breast-works, which were out of
the Bearing of their Fort, but we had
a smart A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sault of it, for we being all
open to their, fire and naked Men, and
they secured in their works, they by this
advantage, killed us a great many Men.
At last some of ours got to the End of
their biggest Breastwork, which galled
us most and then we plyed them well
with small Shot, which was a Cartridge
fit for the Bores of our Fuzees with a full
Shot in it and 7 or 9 Swan Shot loose
upon that. This kept them in play till
our Men in the Front began to Storm
the wall; upon which they cryed for <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
which our unwary Commander
too readily granted, it afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ruin of our design.</p>
            <p>In this jun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ture we received many a
Volly from three other Breastworks,
that this great one lay within command
of; and we being for dispatch faced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with a party of ours, and took them
all by assault without giving any quarter
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60800:41"/>
to those that were in them, they being
<hi>Creolians,</hi> a people half Spaniards and
half Indians, of a Copper colour'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and Men that never give it
themselves.</p>
            <p>From hence we advanced to the Town
and took it, that now we had nothing
to do but to give a general assault to the
Fort, but Captain <hi>Watling</hi> delaying his
time, in the Breastwork where he staid
to give quarter; Those we drove out of
the Town got into the Fort; whom,
had it not been for the Guns to put into
our Ship, we would not have troubled
our selves with; for we knew that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once possession of the Town, there
was more Coined money then we could
tell how to bring away, in case we had
not been disturbed, which Plunder
would have made us what we could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
but we wanted their Cannon, to
secure it on board when we should get
it there. At length the Captain march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Town with his Prisoners
and called us all together, where being
come, we found we had more Prisoners
then Men of our own. So that after
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60800:42"/>
we had sent our Wounded Men to the
Hospital, got the Doctors to dress them,
and set a Guard upon our Prisoners and
Wounded, which took up above an
hours time, we marched to the Fort,
and then too plainly saw that had we not
been so hasty in giving quarter, but as
soon as we had taken the Town, rallied
again and made an attempt on the Fort,
no doubt but we had carried it in spight
of all Opposition.</p>
            <p>We then contrived to set some of the
Prisoners before us, to secure us the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in our approach to the walls of the
Fort, but they fired as well upon them,
as us, and on a sudden at a signal given,
they all run from us into a Sally Port,
Which was hastily shut with some of
them left out, whom we knocked on
the head. Yet we undauntedly got un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the walls, and began to throw over
our Hand-granadoes, which proved bad
and were altogether Unserviceable.
Now while we were under the wall,
and consulting how we should get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, though a Prisoner told us
there were three hundred Kings Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60800:42"/>
in the Garison. The Country
people came in so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ast upon us, that
we could do no good on the Fort, so
we retre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted towards the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>wn. In
which action Captain <hi>Watlin</hi> was Shot
into the Reins, and Killed; and to add to
our loss &amp; disappointment we found both
the Town, and Breast-works, new manned
by the Country people, which while
we were engaged with, they Sallyed out
of the Fort upon us, so that we were
forced to quit our attempt on the Town
and betake our selves to the plain Field,
leaving our Doctors, and some Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men in the Hospital behind us.
When we came into the Field, and saw
such a small remainder of our Men,
and our Enemies Horse quite round us,
we got our Wounded Men into the
middle, and casting our selves into a circle
or ring, Fought our way through. Not
one Man of us offering to run, and thus
marched down to our Boats, but with
heavy Hearts, to think we should leave
so much Plate behind us. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
we were so few, and this

having been ingaged from eight a

Clock in the morning till two in the

but of forty seven Fighting Men,
and they at least twelve hundred in the
Field, besides what were in their Fort,
Town, and Breast-works; and our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes
lay full three miles from the Town.
All which way we charged through
and through them, and lost not one
Man in the retreat, though some of us
were Wounded; what damage we did
them we never knew, but it could not
but be considerable. In this Fight we
had eight and twenty Men Killed, seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Wounded, and the Doctors taken
Prisoners, who had quarter given them
as we were afterwards told.</p>

for the sake of their skill; but that the
wounded were knockt on the Head;
and that one Negro, who had his Leg

it, and killed four or five of their Men,
before he was shot dead on the spot.

news to us; so we went up to
the Carpenters Yard, and friendly
desired the chief Builder, and seven of
his Workmen, to go on Board us, and
help us to cut down our Ship: He also
helped us to a Canoe load of Spikes,
and Iron Work, which our Ship want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to fit her with; but some of our Men
being drunk, they over-set her coming

lay our Ship in, out of the Tides way,
and this day unrigged her, got our

home; who returned us many thanks
for our generosity, and using them so
civilly; and with them, we turned
away some Prisoners which we had on

Negroes to do our drudgery.</p>
            <p>During our stay at <hi>Cheroe</hi> we did this

others wounded.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturd.</hi> we came to an Anchor

Wine, Brandy, Oyl, and Fruit, and
670. Piggs of Metal, which we (such
was our dulness) supposed to be Tin.
All the Arguments some of us could
use, would not perswade our Captain
and rest of our men to take them in;
only one was brought away to make
Bullets; part of which we gave to a

resusing to take in those Piggs, we
turned away to Sea our Prize, that
might have sufficiently enriched us all,
and having stored our selves with Wine

and two Top Sails, and stood in

sent our Canoes in before the Ship, and
found a very smooth place to anchor
in, but deep Water: so we came to an
Anchor in 45. Fathom Water. At
going in, one of our Men fell out of
the Sprit Sail-Top, and was drowned;
his name was <hi>Henry Shergall.</hi> In the
Night our Cable cut with the Rocks,
that we were forced to look for a better
Harbour, which finding, we got our
Ship in, and mored her to the Shoar
with Hassers, and laid two Anchors
out, which were all we had left.</p>

Stern grounded upon a Rock, which

one of them got away, another was

            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> our Canoe went to see it

            <p>These Vessels had between nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

On the 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

on the Coast of <hi>la Vera Cruz,</hi> and lay
by; there the men that were to land,
were put on Board <hi>Yanchy</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi>
and then stood off.</p>
            <p>On the 9. these two Ships stood in,
and in the Night the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the
Castle and on Shoar, made fires to
Pilot them in, supposing them to be two

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60800:71"/>
the Morning, about two Miles from

four Men.</p>

part of the Town, where they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Court of Guard, but found only
four Men: <hi>Laurence</hi> commanded the
Forlorn, and with it attempted the two
Forts, the one of twelve, the other
of eight Guns, both close Forts, but
they found them open, and the Centinel
asleep; so with the loss of one man kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and three by a
mistake of the <hi>French,</hi> by break of day
they had made themselves Masters of
the Forts and Town; and had they, as
<hi>Laurence</hi> advised, sent at the same time,
but two Canoes and fifty Men, they had
without doubt surprized the Castle,
which stands upon a Rock in the Sea,
three quarters of a Mile from the Town,
and has in it seventy Guns mounted.</p>
            <p>But the Pyrates thinking it more safe
and profitable to plunder the Town: set
Guards at the Streets ends, and sent
Parties to break open the Houses, where
they found every body as quiet, as in
their Graves, and for three days they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60800:72"/>
continued breaking of Houses, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
them, and dragging the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Inhabitants to the Cathedral, and
though at this time they got abundance
of Jewels, Plate, &amp;c. and about
three hundred and fifty Bags of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenelle,
each containing one hundred
and fifty or two hundred pound weight,
as they say; yet were they not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but put the considerable people to
ransome, and threatned to burn the
Cathedral and Prisoners in it, which
were five thousand and seven hundred,
if they did not immediately discover
all they had; so that the fourth day
they got more than the other three;
and had seventy thousand pieces of
Eight for the Governour <hi>Don Luis de
Cordoua</hi>'s Ransome, which <hi>Spurre</hi>
found hid amongst Grass in a Stable.</p>
            <p>The Buccaneers feared the <hi>Spanish</hi> Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
which had been two days in sight,
consisting of twelve great Ships,
and likewise apprehended succours
might come to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from <hi>los
Angelos,</hi> a City thirty Leagues from
<hi>la Vera Cruz,</hi> so they left the Town, and
carryed their Prisoners and Plunder to
a Cay, where the Ships rode, called
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60800:72"/>
               <hi>los Sacrificios,</hi> from a famous Indian
Temple that was there; and at their
passing by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, lying at the
mouth of the Harbour, which they
expected would have fought them;
the Buccaneers perceiving that they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them to go off with their Booty so
quietly, resolved to have a Bout with
them, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> preparing to
be gone away, it prevented their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
            <p>Here at <hi>los Sacrificios</hi> the Pyrates stay'd
eight dayes, to receive Ransomes, and
to divide what they had got, which is
generally said to be eight hundred
pieces of eight, a share in Plate and
Mony, and they made near twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
shares for Men and Ships; and
<hi>Van Horn</hi> had about fourscore shares
coming to him, for himself and his
two Ships.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Laurence</hi> and <hi>Van Horn</hi> quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about the dividend, sought, and
<hi>Van Horn</hi> being wounded in the
Wrist, no body thinking it to be but
a slight wound, they all embarked,
and <hi>Van Horn</hi> once more proposed to
attack the Flota, and engaged to board
the Admiral; but <hi>Laurence</hi> utterly refusing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60800:73"/>
it, away they went, carrying
also with them about a thousand Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes
and Mulatos.</p>
            <p>About fifteen days after, <hi>Van Horn</hi>
dyed of his Wound which had gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greened,
and was thrown into the Sea
off of Cape <hi>Iucatan,</hi> leaving his Son,
a Youth of about ten or twelve years
of Age, to the value (as they say) of
twenty thousand Pounds Sterling on
Board; and his Lieutenant <hi>Gramont,</hi>
took upon him the command of the
Ship, intending for <hi>Petit Guave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laurence</hi> and the rest of the Fleet were

the Shoar, to prevent any assistance

her, made their escape, except four

in, they prepared to go up the River,
where the Admiral understood our
Enemies had entrenched themselves,
and had six several Retreats, in Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Works;
whereupon he gave order,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60800:79"/>
That seven sail of the lesser Ships,
should be fitted to go up the River,
and fill'd them with Men, and great
Guns, leaving three hundred to guard
the Castle and the Ships, under the
command of Captain <hi>Richard Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Munday</hi> the ninth, Admiral <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
began to set forward with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred Men, in the said seven
Ships, and thirty six Boats.</p>
               <p>The twelfth day he got to the first
Intrenchment, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
had basely quitted, and set all on fire,
as they did all the rest without striking
a stroak for it.</p>
               <p>Here he was forced to leave the
Ships and Boats, (being unable to get
them conveniently up further) with
two hundred Men to guard them,
under the command of Captain <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Delander,</hi> and we betook our selves
to our march through the wild Woods,
where was no Road nor Path for
four and twenty Miles together, but
what our Pioneers cut and made for
us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:60800:80"/>
The fourteenth, our Admiral with
our Army, arrived within two Miles
of <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> the place where we
should have landed, if we had been
able to have got our Vessels up so high:
And here we came to a narrow and
dangerous Pass, which the Enemy
thought to have secured, and put a
stop to our further progress in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
but indeed they were presently
routed by our Forlorn, commanded
by Captain <hi>Thomas Rogers,</hi> the rest of
our Men never being put to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of firing one Shot, and without
sustaining any loss, saving three Men
slightly wounded, but the Enemies
loss we could never learn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ianuary</hi> the fifteenth, we arrived
at <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> upon the River of <hi>Chagre,</hi>
which is a very handsome Village,
and the place where they land and
embark all the Goods which come
and go to <hi>Panama:</hi> And where we
thought we might meet with some
Provisions, having marched three
days with but a very slender Dyet,
but found this (as the rest of the
places we had passed) all on fire, and
the Inhabitants and Souldiers all fled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:60800:80"/>
The sixteenth we marched on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the Enemy galling us from
their Ambuscades, and by small Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and we still beating them for
a League together; although they
had all the advantage of us that could
be, by reason of the Ways being so
narrow that we could seldom march
above four a Breast, and was for
the most part so deep and hollow, that
the Enemy could keep over our heads
to annoy us.</p>
               <p>About Noon we got safely to the
<hi>Savanas</hi> or open Fields, with the
loss but of three Men Killed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and six or seven wounded: and
of the Enemy, twenty killed, and
one Captain, besides many wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
About three Miles further, we
took up our Quarters, to refresh
our Men, and thank God for the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
service of that day.</p>
               <p>The seventeenth we continued our
march without any opposition, and
about nine a Clock in the Morning
saw that desired and long wished for
sight, the South Sea and not far
distant from us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> parcel of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60800:81"/>
Cattle and Horses feeding. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
our Admiral commanded a
general halt to be made; and gave
our Men leave to kill Horses and
Beeves enough to feast us all.</p>
               <p>At about four a Clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
our Men having refreshed
themselves very well, we marched
on again; and at five came within
sight of the Enemy, where he was
drawn up in Battalia, with two
thousand and one hundred Foot, and
six hundred Horse; but finding the
day far spent, the Admiral thought
it not fit to engage, but took up quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
within a mile of them, where
we lay very quiet; not being so much
as once allarmed.</p>
               <p>The next Morning being the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
our Admiral gave out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
early his Orders, To draw out
his Men in Battalia; which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
performed, and they were
drawn up in form of a Tertia. The
Vanguard, which was led by Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Colonel <hi>Prince,</hi> and Major
<hi>Iohn Morris,</hi> was in number three
hundred Men. The main Body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60800:81"/>
six hundred Men, the
right Wing thereof was led by the
Admiral, and the Left by Colonel
<hi>Edward Collyer.</hi> The Rere-Guard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of three hundred Men, was
commanded by Colonel <hi>Bledry Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Admiral, after having viewed
his Men, and encouraged them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Officers all to repair to
their respective charges. Mean while
the Enemy being drawn up in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
place, still kept their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor would at all move, though
often provoked by us, fearing to
lose the security of their Ground.
Which our Admiral perceiving, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
gave order, That our Officers
should wheel our Body to the left,
and endeavour to gain a Hill which
was hard by, and which if once gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we should then force the Enemy
to engage, to their great disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
because he could not be able
to bring out of his great Body, any
more Men to fight at a time, than
we should out of our small; and
that we should likewise have the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60800:82"/>
advantage, both of the Wind and
Sun.</p>
               <p>Our Officers streight put this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in execution, and in a small
time we gained the Hill, together
with a little dry Passage, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
for us. So the Enemy
was constrained to fight us upon
their hasty march, not having room
enough to wheel their whole Body,
by reason of a great Bogg, which was
just at their Rear, and before which
they had purposely drawn up, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
us: But we having thus Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
our Ground, that proved in the
upshot to be of prejudice to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>We being thus advanced, <hi>Don
Francisco de Haro,</hi> who commanded
their Cavalry, with his Horse gave the
first Charge to our Vanguard, which
he did very furiously, coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the full speed; and we having
no Pikes among us, our Admiral
gave order, That we should double our
Ranks to the Right, and close the
Files to the Right and Left inward, to
the close Order: But their fiery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60800:82"/>
could not stop his career till
he dropt, losing his life in the Front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Rank
of our Vanguard.</p>
               <p>Upon this their Horse wheeled off
to the Right, and their Foot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to try their Fortunes, but they
proved as unsuccessful as their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;
for we being ready, with our
main Body to receive them, with our
first Volley gave them such a
warm welcome, and pursued our
work in hand, with that vigour
and briskness, that our friends the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> thought it safest to retreat,
and by and by were so closely ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our Left Wing also, who at first
could not come to engage, (because
of their hindrance by the Hills)
which our Enemies not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
mended, though unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
their pace, and at last all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
betook themselves to plain run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>Just before which, they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
such a stratagem, as hath sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
been heard. For while the
Foot had engaged us in the Front
and the Flanks, they had contrived to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60800:83"/>
force in, two great Droves of Oxen,
of above a thousand in each, into
the Right and Left Angles of our
Rear, with intention to break and
disorder us: Which design might
probably have taken effect, had not
our prudent Admiral, with great
presence of mind, spoiled their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
giving order to a small Party
to fire at the Drivers, and not
at the Cattle, which put the
rest into so great a fear, that the
Oxen were soon forced back with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>afe. So that this stratagem being
thus defeated, they were in so great
consternation, that happy was he
that could get first into the City:
There they had two hundred fresh
men, and two Forts; in the one
were fix Brass Guns mounted, and in
the other eight. They had all their
Streets barricadoed, and in many of
them had also planted great Guns;
the number of which amounted in
all to thirty two Brass Guns: But
instead of fighting after all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
the President caused the
City to be fired, and his chiefest
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60800:83"/>
Fort to be blown up, which was
done with such hast, that he blew
up forty of his Souldiers in it. We
followed them into the Town, where
in the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> or chief Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
place, they made a short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
fring some of their great
Guns at us, with which they killed
us four Men, and wounded five.</p>
               <p>At three a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
we had quiet possession of
the City, although in Flames, with
no more loss on our side in this days
work, than five Men killed, and ten
wounded; but of the Enemy about
four hundred. And now were we
forced to put all Hands to work for
the quenching the Fire of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Houses, which they themselves
had kindled to disappoint us of the
Plunder; but all our labour was in
vain, for by twelve a clock at Night,
all the whole City was burnt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a part of the Suburbs, which
with our great industry, we made a
shift to save, being two Churches,
and about three hundred Houses.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:60800:84"/>
Thus was that ancient and famous
City of <hi>Panama</hi> consumed and laid in
Ashes; being the greatest Mart for
Silver and Gold in the whole World:
for it receives all the Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise
coming from <hi>Old Spain,</hi>
in the Kings great Fleet, which is
first landed at <hi>Puerto Belo</hi> and <hi>Venta
Cruz,</hi> and thence brought on Mules,
and by other land-Carriage, hither;
and likewise delivers to the Gallions
of the Flota or Plate Fleet, all the
Silver and Gold which comes from the
Mines of <hi>Potozi,</hi> and all <hi>Peru.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here at this City we stayed eight
and twenty days, making continual
incursions upon the Enemy by Land,
for twenty Leagues round about, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having so much as one Gun shot
at us in anger, although we took in
this time near three thousand Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of all sorts: And kept Barks like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
cruising in the South Sea, and
fetching off Prisoner from <hi>Toboga</hi> and
other Islands near that Coast, to
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had fled with their
Families.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:60800:84"/>
                  <hi>February</hi> the fourteenth,<note place="margin">1670. Febr.</note> we quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Panama,</hi> and began our march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Ship with all our Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and the next day came to <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
Cruz,</hi> at about two in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
which is about fifteen <hi>English</hi>
miles. Here we stayed refreshing our
selves till the four and twentieth, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> opportunity to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
their Prisoners. The twenty
sixth we got to <hi>Chagre;</hi> which we
found in good order since our leaving
it. And here we divided the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
amongst the Souldiers and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which amounted to about thirty
thousand Pound Sterling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> the sixth, we fired the Castle
of <hi>Chagre,</hi> having first spiked the
Guns; and then embarked for our
Voyage towards <hi>Iamaica;</hi> where in
a short time, we safely arrived.</p>
               <p>The reason why we got no more
wealth in that expedition, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had two Months notice of
us, before our coming, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
most of their Treasure away on
board their Ships, to be transported
to <hi>Lima</hi> in <hi>Peru;</hi> one of which Ships
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60800:85"/>
was laden with Gold, Silver, and
precious Stones; which Ship contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
seven hundred Tun: And there
was likewise another of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Tun, laden also with Riches,
both which made their escape from
us. This, together with their firing
the City of <hi>Panama,</hi> made us return so
empty home.</p>

of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> which he

to <hi>Chagre</hi> one hundred and fifty. And
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60800:86"/>
to the <hi>Castillan Don Francisco Saludo I</hi>
sent order that with five hundred Men
he should guard the passage of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and fortifie it.</p>
            <p>About five months before this I had
consulted <hi>Don Iuan de Aras, Capellan of</hi>
the <hi>Audiencia,</hi> and other Intelligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
And they perswaded me that the
forts on the River as well as the Castle,
were all impregnable; And in rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
Letters which I had from <hi>Don
Pedro de Lisardo,</hi> he assured me the same
of <hi>Chagre,</hi> and that I needed not to
take care for them, for that although
six thousand Men should come against
them, he should with the Fortifications,
and Men he had, be able to secure
himself and destroy them: The like
those who were at the passages of the
River confidently assured me.</p>
            <p>And now the Enemy being come
those of the Castle of <hi>Chagre</hi> fought
whole day, and defended themselves
with great Valour and Resolution, Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above two hundred Men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsing
above six Assaults, until the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
taking advantage of the night, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60800:86"/>
by the help of their Fire-balls set on
Fire the Fortifications, because the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
were of Wood. They likewise
burnt the <hi>Castellans</hi> or Governours
House, being thatched with Palm, and
consumed all the good Arms within.
There was Killed above half the People,
the Lieutenant also and the <hi>Castellan,</hi>
who all had behaved themselves with
great Valour, and had it not been for
the Fire, the Enemy had never gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</p>
            <p>At the unhappy News of the loss of
this considerable Castle, those on the
River were extreamly astonished, and
fearing the <hi>English</hi> would come up to
them with two thousand Men, <hi>Luis de
Castillo</hi> Captain of the <hi>Mulatto's,</hi> whom
the <hi>Castellan Saludo,</hi> had ordered to his
Post, a place called <hi>Barro Colorado,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
called a Council of War of those
Officers under his Command, without
having any Order of mine or power to
do it, retired to <hi>Barbacoa,</hi> forsaking his
Post, without fo much as ever seeing
the Face of the Enemy: The <hi>Castellan
Saludo</hi> did the same, quitting the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
of <hi>Barbacoa,</hi> and retired with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60800:87"/>
his Men to Cruzes. Before this, at the
first notice I had of the loss of the Castle
of <hi>chagre.</hi> Two mestises called the
Sollices and a Negro of <hi>Vregoa,</hi> offered
with a hundred Men to regain the Castle,
or so to disorder the Enemy in case
they should attempt to come up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as to hinder them: And for fear
they should gain the Castle of <hi>Santos,</hi>
I sent <hi>Gil de la Torre</hi> who had been
Lieutenant there, to Govern and Defend
it. But neither of these complied with
their undertaking; for having sent two
hundred and fifty chosen Men, instead
of the one hundred they had desired;
with the Sollices, who meeting the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
on the River, neither durst they
stay to fight him, as they might have
done, nor did they pass on to regain
the Castle of <hi>Chagre:</hi> But rather went
round by the Mountain, and came out
at <hi>Capira,</hi> after which they all dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without doing any good at all.</p>
            <p>In this conjuncture having had the
misfortune to have been lately Blooded
three times for an <hi>Erysipelas,</hi> I had in
my right Leg, I was forced to rise out
of my Bed, and march to <hi>Guiabal</hi> with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60800:87"/>
the rest of the People, which I had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in <hi>Panama;</hi> where I slaid until I
understood the exact course of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
march, because I would be sure
not to miss them, for they might have
gone by <hi>Barbacoa, port Gilloa</hi> and <hi>Puerto
de loes Naos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With me I took eight hundred Men,
and three hundred <hi>Negroes,</hi> that were
Vassalls, and Slaves of the <hi>Assentistaes.</hi>
And from the aforesaid place, I sent to
<hi>Cruzes</hi> three hundred Men, amongst
whom went one hundred <hi>Indians</hi> of
<hi>Darien,</hi> with their Commanders; Of
these I had greater Credit and Opinion
than of any others, yet had not these
the courage to perform any thing.</p>
            <p>Having been a day in <hi>Guiabal,</hi> and
my Men pretty well refreshed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Letter from a <hi>Negro</hi> Captain,
called <hi>Prado,</hi> in which he assured me
that the Enemy marched against us
two thousand strong; which News so
much discouraged my Men, that they
ceased not to importune and press me
to return to the Town, protesting they
would defend themselves in it to the last.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60800:88"/>
But it being impossible then to fortifie it,
it having many entrances, and the Houses
all built of Wood; so soon as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
should once make a breach, we
should quickly be exposed to their fury,
and forced miserably to shift for our
selves; for which reasons I consented
not to them. Next morning at break
of day, I found my self with not above
one third part of my Men, the rest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
deserted me. So that I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to return back to the City, to
perswade them to Fight there at <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
there being no other remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I arrived on</hi> Saturday <hi>night at</hi> Panama,
<hi>and</hi> Sunday <hi>morning went to the great
Church, where having received the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Communion before our Blessed Lady
of Immaculate Conception, with great
Devotion. I went to the principal guard,
and to all that were present, I expressed
my self to this effect.</hi> That all those,
who were True Catholicks, Defenders of
the Faith, and Devoto's of our Lady of
Pure and Immaculate Conception, should
follow my Person, being that same day at
four a Clock in the afternoon, resolved to
march out to seek the Enemy, and with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60800:88"/>
this caution, that he that should refuse to
do it, should be held for Infamous and a
Coward, besely slighting so precise an
obligation.</p>
            <p>All proffered me their assistance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
those that had slunk from me at
<hi>Guiabal;</hi> And when I had drawn them
up in order, I carried the chief of them
to the great Church, where in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of our Lady of Pure and Immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Conception, I made an Oath to die
in her Defence; And I gave her a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
Ring of the Value of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pieces of <hi>Eight,</hi> in token of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with my word, and heartily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
her aid. And all present made
the same Oath, with much fervour.</p>
            <p>The Images of the Pure and Immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Conception ever since the day of the
Fight at <hi>Chagre</hi> Castle, had been carried
out in general Procession, attended by
all the Religious, and Fraternity of the
Cathedral of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> that of the
Nuns of our Lady of the <hi>Rosario,</hi> those
of San <hi>Domingo,</hi> and those of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes,</hi>
together with all the Saints and
Patrons of the Religious. And always
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60800:89"/>
the most Holy Sacrament in all Churches
was uncovered and exposed to publick
view. Masses were continually said for
my happy success. I parted with all
my Jewels and Relicks collected in my
Pilgrimage, presenting them to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
images, Saints and Patrons.</p>
            <p>After this I marched with my Army
about a League from <hi>Panama</hi> having with
me three Field pieces covered with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and charged. And from that place
I ordered another Party with two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Guns, of the Men which came from
the River, being above three hundred,
to advance towards the Enemy, which
neither did any good.</p>
            <p>This Body of Men which I had thus
brought with me, was compounded of
two sorts, Valiant Military Men, and
faint hearted Cowards, many of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all their Estates, or pay due to them,
left in the Castle of <hi>Chagre,</hi> and <hi>Puerto
Velo,</hi> and a great part of my Men were
<hi>Negroes, Nulattos</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> to the
number of about twelve hundred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
two hundred <hi>Negroes</hi> more belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Astiento.</hi> Our Fire Arms were
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60800:89"/>
few and bad, in comparison of those the
Enemy brought: For ours were Carbins,
Harquebusles and Fowling pieces, but
few Muskets for they had likewise been
left in <hi>Puerto Velo</hi> and <hi>Chagre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having formed the Army, into
two double Squadrons, and the Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which were two hundred, mounted
on the same tired Horses which had
brought them thither, and with two
great Herds of Oxen and Bulls, drove
thither by fifty Cow-keepers on purpose
to disorder the Enemy. The Army all
appeared brisk and courageous, desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing more than to engage; nor
wanted there any thing of <hi>Regalo</hi> to
infuse Spirit into them. So that it
seemed to me, by what I saw, and what
they told me, that they would be able
to charge the Enemy like Lightning.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wednesday</hi> morning, the Enemy
appeared, seeming to direct their march
towards our Rear in three Squadrons,
wherein they had two thousand three
hundred Men, as I understood for certain
afterwards, but by and by they taking a
compass, advanced to the Front of our
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60800:90"/>
Army. I had put for Leader of our left
Wing <hi>Dom Alonso Alcaudete,</hi> and for Leader
of the right Wing the Governour of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragues,
Don Iuan Portando Bargueno,</hi> and in
the centre the Serjeant Major; To these I
gave strict Command that none should
move without my order, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within shot, the three first Ranks
should Fire on their Knees, and after
this charge, they should give place to
the Rear to come up and Fire, and that
although they should chance to see any
fall Dead, or Wounded, they should not
quit their stations, but to the last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
observe these their Orders.</p>
            <p>I was at this time in the right Wing
of the Vanguard, watching the Enemies
motion, which was hasty, by the Foot
of a Hill, in a narrow place, about three
Musket shot from the left Wing of our
Army. When on a sudden I heard a
loud clamour, crying out, <hi>Fall on, fall
on; For they Fly. At which Don Alonso
de Alcaudete,</hi> was not able to keep them
in their Ranks nor stop them from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away, though he cut them with his
Sword, but they all fell into disorder;
And I well knowing the Fatality of this
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60800:90"/>
gave command that they should drive
in the Herds of Cattle, and charge
with the Horse, So putting my self
in the Head of the Squadron of the
right Wing, saying, <hi>come along Boys, there
is no other remedy now, but to Conquer, or
Die;</hi> Follow me. I went directly to the
Enemy, and hardly did our Men se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
some fall Dead, and others Wounded,
but they turned their backs, and fled;
leaving me there with only one <hi>Negro,</hi>
and one Servant that followed me. Yet
I went forward to comply with my
word to the Virgin, which was to Die
in her Defence, receiving a shot in a
staff which I carried in my Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
close to my cheek. At which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
came up to me a Priest of the
great Church, called <hi>Iuan de Dios</hi> (who
was wont to say Mass in my House)
beseeching me to retire and save my
self whom I twice sharply reprehended.
But the third time, he persisting, telling
me that it was meer desperation to Die
on that manner, and not like a Christian.
With that I retired, it being a miracle
of the Virgin to bring me off safe from
amidst so many thousand Bullets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:60800:91"/>
After this I endeavoured with all my
industry to perswade the Souldiers to
turn and face our Enemies, but it was
impossible; so that nothing hindering
them, they entred the City, to which
the Slaves and Owners of the Houses
had put Fire, and being all of Boards
and Timber, 'twas most of it quickly
burnt, except the <hi>Audiencia,</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
House, the Convent of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes,
San Ioseph,</hi> the Suburbs of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lambo,</hi>
and <hi>Pierde Vidas,</hi> at which they
say, the Enemy fretted very much for
being disappointed of their Plunder.
And because they had brought with
them an <hi>English</hi> Man, whom they called
<hi>The Prince,</hi> with intent there to Crown
him <hi>King of the Terra Firma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> having thus got possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Relicks of our Town, found
a Bark in the <hi>Fasca,</hi> although I had
given order there should be none, yet
had they not complied with my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and when they would have set
it on Fire, the Enemy came fast and put
it out, and with it did us much damage,
for they took three more with it, and
made great havock of all they found in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60800:91"/>
the Islands of <hi>Tabaga, Otoque, and las
Islas del Rey,</hi> taking and bringing
from thence many Prisoners.</p>
            <p>After this misfortune, I gave order
to all the People I met, that they should
stay for me at Nata for there I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to form the Body of an Army, once
more to encounter the <hi>English.</hi> But
when I came to that City, I found not
one Soul therein, for all were fled to
the Mountains.</p>
            <p>The same happened to me at the
Town from whence I dispatched a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
to <hi>Peru,</hi> with the sad News of our
misfortune, as I had done by Land to
<hi>Guatimala, Mexico,</hi> and by <hi>Puerto Velo</hi>
to <hi>Sparue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although I afterwards attempted
several times to form an Army, yet I
could not do any good of it, because
no Man would be perswaded to follow
me. So that I remained utterly desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of any Guard, till such time as the
<hi>English</hi> marched back to the Castle of
<hi>Chagre</hi> to make his Voyage for <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60800:92"/>
There embarked themselves for Peru,
without seeing the face of an Enemy,
the <hi>Castellan Saludo,</hi> (whom I did not
believe to be such a one) <hi>Don Iuan de
Aras, Francisco Gonzales Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>asco</hi> being
a young lively Captain, and many O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>This Sir, has been a Chastisement
from Heaven, and the same might have
happened to that great Captain <hi>Gensalo
Fernando de Cordova,</hi> as did to me, if his
Men had deserted him, for one Man
alone can do little.</p>
            <p>In the middle of all this Torrent of
Affliction, it was no small good fortune,
to have the Fort of <hi>San Geromino</hi> in <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto
Velo</hi> finished; And to have the
Fortifications of those two Castles made
there anew. Because their first intent was
to have attaqued the said Castles, which
are, as report goes, well furnished with
Men and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>If all were lost, I hope God would
give me patience to suffer so great a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
But so it is, that all the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
together that this Kingdom has
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60800:92"/>
ever had; have not done the third part
of what I have done, in order to the
prevention of these mischiefs: But
I know my self so unfortunate as not
to have People sent me out of <hi>Spain</hi> that
are paid; And so long as that shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
not to be so in this Kingdom, and
that <hi>Chagre</hi> and <hi>Panama</hi> shall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
they will be in perpetual danger
of loseing the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is what has passed, omitting
infinite particulars, not to enlarge too
much, and which is all I have to say
to you, whose Life God preserve many

            <p>On <hi>Sunday, Iuly</hi> the sixteenth 1671.
We went aboard, and immediately put
to Sea; The Colonel having a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Train of Servants, and half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Gentlemen, who went out of respect
to wait on him, and a curiosity to see
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Country. We had also

And on the twentieth at ten in

            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the twenty third in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we fell in with the Land of <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena</hi>
and stood towards the City, which
we came in view of at one a Clock; And
being within about a league and a half of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60800:94"/>
it, the Colonel sent off the Pinnace,
with a White Flag, and in her Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Stone,</hi> and Mr. <hi>David Gomez,</hi> with
these Orders: That after due respects
paid to the Governour, they should tell
him that the Ships that appeared before
the City, were two of his Majesty of
Great <hi>Britains</hi> Frigats, which were sent
thither by the Honourable Sir <hi>Thomas
Linch</hi> his Majesties Lieutenant Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of <hi>Iamaica.</hi> And that they were
sent from a Gentleman on board to him,
to let him know who he was, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to acquaint him, that he came by
order of the said Governour to Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate,
and adjust with him, the Peace
made in <hi>Madrid</hi> for the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the said Gentleman desired to
know, whether they might have Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to come on shoar, and return on board
again with safety, as their business might
require: The which if he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
they would come ashoar, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
what they had in Commission to
him.</p>
            <p>The Colonel moreover ordered them
to acquaint the Governour, that it was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60800:94"/>
not the Custom of his Majesties Ships
of War, to salute any place where-ever
they should come with their Ordinance,
unless they were assured of a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
which if he would please to promise
by those Gentlemen at their coming
back on board; We would salute the
City.</p>
            <p>About five in the evening our Pinnace
came off with their White Flag surled,
and Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> at his coming aboard,
brought this account: That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
entreated him to tell the Colonel,
that he was very welcome; that he should
have all the Liberty he could desire,
both in coming ashoar and returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board;
that the City was ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us with all respect, and where we
should be with all manner of Freedom;
and that the Colonel might as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he should be treated, as a Person

And if we should think good to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>

with an equal number of Gvns. Which

               </gap>ired
from the <hi>Assistance</hi> twenty one and from

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60800:95"/>
answered from their Walls with forty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Munday</hi> the twenty fourth, we went
ashoar, with both the Ships Pinnaces
and for the more solemnity; had salutes
from both the Frigates at our putting
off.</p>
            <p>At our landing, which was at a small
distance from the Town-wall, we were
met by ten Coaches, a Company of
Foot, the Serjeant Major of the Town,
and the Captain <hi>Bocca Chica</hi> the <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
or Commander of the Castle,
with several other Gentlemen of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and saluted with those Ordinance,
which lay on that part of the Wall next
us, and thence conducted to the House
of the Governour <hi>Don Pedro de Riba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneira,</hi>
in our way to which, the streets
were extreamly thronged with People,
who wondred much at our Garb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
used to see none but those of their

            <p>When we came to the Governours,
who received us at the stair head, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tring
into a large Room, we found him
waited on by about fifty of the Best
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60800:95"/>
Gentlemen of the City, who as himself
was, were richly habited, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Gold and Jewels, and many of
them of the Orders of Saint <hi>Iago, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrava,</hi>
and <hi>Alcautara.</hi> After the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of our reception was over, all
then fate down; The Governour
with great compliment placing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,
and Captain <hi>Reide</hi> his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the two first Chairs on the right
hand, no Apologies on their parts
serving to excuse it.</p>
            <p>After this the Colonel delivered his
Letters and other Papers relating to the
Affair he came about, which were given
to the Secretary, to cause them to be
transalted, and then they passed the
time in publick Discourse, At noon
we were treated with an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Dinner, served all in Plate, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
with Musick, much Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
shown, and great expessions of
their Satisfaction, by Drinking his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Health, the Queens, his Royal
Highness the Duke of <hi>Torks</hi> and others.
Betwixt this, the Papers were translating;
we spent most of the time in treating
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60800:96"/>
such Gentlemen of Quality, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
permitted to come on board,
and see the Frigates; who gave him an
account of the Strength and Beauty of
them, with which, and their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they were infinitely pleased.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wednesday</hi> morning the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
called his Council together, and
having placed Colonel <hi>Beeston</hi> on his
right, Hand, and Captain <hi>Reide</hi> on his
left. The Papers were all read, and
the business of the Peace was Discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not without much resentment, for
the taking of <hi>Panama,</hi> which was with
great eagerness and dissatisfaction urged,
as done after certain notice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the Peace, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
was published in <hi>Carthagena</hi> the
second of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which the Colonel excused, as
much as he could, acquainting them
with our Ignorance of it in <hi>Iamaica,</hi> till
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Sir <hi>Thomas Linch</hi> our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Governour.</p>
            <p>Then the Colonel demanded of them,
our <hi>English</hi> Prisoners taken by them,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60800:96"/>
which were immediately delivered to
us, to the number of three and thirty;
And to pacifie in some measure their
complaints, it was at length concluded
on by us, That all <hi>Spanish Negroes,</hi> of
the Provinces of <hi>Carthagena</hi> and <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
which had been taken and could be
found in <hi>Iamaica,</hi> and that could prove
they were free in their own Country,
should be set at liberty: And that all
<hi>Negroes</hi> of the said Provinces, which
were Slaves should be redeemed by their
Masters, if they would come for them,
at eighteen or twenty pounds <hi>per</hi> head.</p>
            <p>After we had quite finished our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
The City invited us to Dinner,
where we were nobly treated, as well
with Feasting, as with their great Guns,
and all other expressions of their Joy
for the Peace. Though in the main,
they seemed suspicious, as doubting
whether or no we intended to keep it
strictly; And to strengthen it, soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Dinner, there came an Express to
the Governour, from the wind-ward,
giving him an account, that there were
two Privateers come to an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, near
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> de Canu,</hi> which is about five leagues
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60800:97"/>
from the City. At which they seemed
infinitely dissatisfied, and confidently
affirmed they must needs be <hi>English,</hi>
and told us with all that there was but
small likelihood the Peace should be long
continued, when our Privateers came
before the Town, whilst we were there
treating with them, and owning the
Peace. To appease which, the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
assured them, Sir <hi>Thoms Linch</hi> had
called in all the Commissions, and that he
was confident we had not on Privateer
abroad. So that if there were any such
Vessells out, they were <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuga;</hi>
But for their better satisfaction,
if the Governour desire it, he would
send one of the Frigats to see what they
were. Which offer he gladly accepted.
And that he might see we intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than the Preservation of the
Peace, the Colonel sent Captain <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse</hi>
to Sea, who returned again in
twenty four hours, having been beyond
the place, where they were reported to
have been, but saw none, at which they
were again satisfied.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the time we staid
here, which was whilst the Governours
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60800:97"/>
Papers were dispatching, we spent in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Town, and treating several Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of theirs a board, who were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to see the Frigats and their strength.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Carthagena</hi> lies on a Bay
by the Sea side, built on a Sand, but
to Landward it is very boggy. It is in
length about three quarters of a mile,
and not full half a mile in bredath. `Tis
walled all round with a thick stone wall
of about four and twenty foot high,
with Bastions built with Orillons, in
some parts, in others they are plain:
But has neither Graffs nor Ramparts.
The Guns which are in number one
hundred twenty six, are most Brass and
Copper, and lie upon the Parapets, and
looking over the tops of the walls, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either Battlements, or common Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
to blind them. In the wall are
three Gates; one to the South called
<hi>San Domingo;</hi> one to the North East,
called <hi>Santa Catalina,</hi> and one to the
East, which goes to the Harbour, and
into the Country. This City neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
is not strong, for there is neither
Castle, nor any considerable place of
strength in it; and moreover to the North
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60800:98"/>
North West, which is the Bay, those
winds have made in the wall three great
Breaches, which may be entred with ease.
The People likewise are not many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Church Men, and for the most
part are <hi>Creolians</hi> who are half <hi>Spaniard</hi>
and half <hi>Indian;</hi> There are also many
<hi>Molatto's</hi> and <hi>Negroes</hi> amongst them.
Their Souldiers are Armed (for Fire
Arms) only with match Locks, in the
use of which they are likewise very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expert.</p>
            <p>The City in general is well built with
Stone, and covered with Tile; the streets
are narrow, and the Houses for the most
part contiguous, and most of them four
or five stories high, with Balconies of
Wood and great Wooden Lattices as they
have in <hi>Spain.</hi> Here are many Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Churches, and other Publick Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
One of their greatest wants is
fresh water, having none but what falls
from the Clouds, for the reception
whereof, they have large Cisterns in
most Houses and likewise under the
Bastions in the walls, where they keep
and husband it till God send a fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
The Town appears very Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60800:98"/>
at a distance, for there are many Cocao
Nut Trees which resemble Palms, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
promiscuously in several parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and overtopping the Houses; which
is a delightful Ornament to it.</p>
            <p>On the East side of it, about a mile
distant, upon an Eminence stands a Castle
called <hi>Santa Madalena,</hi> provided with
many Guns of Brass, Copper and Iron,
which they look upon, as of great
strength, and able to do much in their
defence, and for preservation of their
City.</p>
            <p>Whilst we staid here some of our
Company were desirous to treat with
one <hi>Herman</hi> an Eminent Factor here for
the <hi>Grillo's Genoese</hi> Merchants in <hi>Spain,</hi>
in hopes to have sold him some <hi>Negroes</hi>
from <hi>Iamaca,</hi> but he was so ill beloved
by the People, and they were so suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of us, left we should sell the <hi>Negroes</hi>
which waited on us, that we could not
have any discourse with him.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the twenty eighth. We
received our Letters and Dispatches,
and in the afternoon took our leaves of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60800:99"/>
the Governour and City, and went on
board, staying all <hi>Saturday</hi> to fit our
Ships.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> morning we Sailed, saluting
the City at our going off; which they
with the same number of Guns answered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tuesday, August</hi> the first, we met with
the <hi>Santa Cruz.</hi> Captain <hi>Francisco Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribaldo</hi>
Commander, a Ship of thirty
two Guns. Sixteen Petreros, and a
hundred and six Men, she belonged to
the <hi>Grillo's</hi> and had on board a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty thousand pieces of <hi>Eight,</hi>
with which she was going from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena,</hi>
to <hi>Corizo,</hi> to buy <hi>Negroes.</hi> Out
of her we took Five Prisoners, which
made our number thirty eight. After
which we passed on; And without any
thing worthy of remark in our Voyage,
standing over for <hi>Iamaica;</hi> On <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
August</hi> the seventh in the morning,
we arrived, and came to an Anchor
in <hi>Port Royal</hi> Harbour.</p>
