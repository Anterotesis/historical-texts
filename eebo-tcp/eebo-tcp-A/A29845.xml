            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER In answer to a BOOK ENTITLED <hi>Christianity not Mysterious.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I sent to borrow of you the Book Entitled, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity not Mysterious,</hi> I little thought of drawing on my self any trouble beyond the bare reading of it; but since you have desir'd my thoughts of the matters contain'd in it, I was unwilling to resuse. Thô I must free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell you, what you seem to own in your Letter, that I think my self bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56374:3"/>
imploy'd. And your saying, that it is no neglect in a Shepherd to leave his feeding of the Lambs, and go aside for a while, to beat off any thing that comes to devour or infect them, wo'd not have prevail'd with me, if this had caus'd any intermission in that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which I hope will turn to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account when I come to receive my Wages. But having a little time to spare, I shall perform what you desire.</p>
            <p>And I have done this the rather, for that you tell me the Book hath made some noise; and that the Author is countenanc'd, and encourag'd by some Men of Sence. I don't much wonder at it; for every Man of Sence is not a Man of true Religion; besides it is not every Man of Reason and Integrity, hath leisure to consider it; and if they have, yet these sort of abstracted Discourses, are out of the road of Men of Business.</p>
            <p>What you observe is very true, that the generality of Men who write such Books as these, and talk of them most, are those of a mixt sort of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56374:3"/>
Persons of a miscelaneous educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who have some insight into most of the Sciences, but are throughly vers't in none. And the talking of Idea's, and running endless divisions upon them, is a cheap and easie way, some Men now adays have taken up, of appearing wise and learned to the world. Whereas the bottom of it all is no more than this, That Men of nice heads have agreed to speak of plain things in a peculiar dialect of their own; which if they were strip't of those terms of Art, and put into plain Language, have nothing in them more than what is obvious to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sence and reason of all Men. And the consequence of using them so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in matters of Religion is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, what is so visible in this Author, that they darken the Subject; so that the Question is lost in a multitude of Words, and then Men wander far in pursuit of Truth, when they left it behind them at their first setting out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56374:4"/>But before I come to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I can't but take notice of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness of People, who never think a Writer sufficiently confuted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we follow him in all his wandrings; whereas in a subject of this nature it is enough to shew where he left the Road, and that he is not yet return'd into it. If a Man were to demolish a Fabrick, there is no necessity of doing it stone by stone; it is abundantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if he undermine and destroy those Pillars which are the main sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of it; for then it falls to the ground, and is no other than a heap of Rubbish, thô many of the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als were very good in themselves.</p>
            <p>To any reasonable considering Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it were a sufficient Answer to this whole Book; to shew in short, how he mistakes the Question, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in it, all upon two false Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions: One in Logick, in the former part of his Book, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Evidence is the only ground of Perswasion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56374:4"/>The other in Divinity, in the latter part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That now under the Gospel the Vail is perfectly remov'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This wo'd satisfy them that he runs all the while upon a false scent; and they wo'd not take it ill, that we left him to wander by himself. But because these are but few, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of those who take things in the gross, and can't so well discern the connexion and dependance of one thing upon another: And indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Answers are design'd for such as are not able to see into the fallacies, and not for those who are; therefore I shall trace him step by step, and leave nothing in him unanswer'd, that hath any appearance of reasoning.</p>
            <p>I shall be so far from endeavouring to contradict him in every thing, that I shall grant him all that possibly I can. The worst of Hereticks speak many
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56374:5"/>
things that are true; and the more we can with justice allow them, the plainer we shall make their Errors appear; and the more difficult it will be for them to proceed, for this obligeth them either to speak to the pinch of the Question, or be silent.</p>
            <p>It can't be expected in the compass of a Letter, that I should enter into any nice disquisitions about the nature of Faith in general; or of the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gospel in particular; or of the use of Reason in Religion: For I am not now going to write a Book upon this subject; if I were it should not be in answer to him. I shall at present only shew the weakness and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olly of this Man's arguing; and lay open the Cheats and Fallacies, by which he is either deceiv'd himself, or wo'd impose upon others: That I may relieve the subject he treats of, from that darkness and obscurity in which he has involv'd it, either through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or design.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56374:5"/>And first, there is great deceit in the very Title of the Book; CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANITY NOT MYSTERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS. For by these two words, as it appears by what follows, he wo'd raise a Notion in the heads of People that Christianity, as it is now generally taught and receiv'd among us, is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion made up of dark aenigmatical Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, and absurd irrational and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible Notions; or else of the plainest things wrapt up in mysterious Rites and Ceremonies; and in short, that our most holy Faith, is no other than one great Riddle.</p>
            <p>Whereas Christianity is so far from being <hi>Mysterious,</hi> that it is the plainest Institution in the World. All the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Points of Faith and Practice are so clear and obvious to every capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that it is a Religion calculated for all sorts of People: And therefore it is said of the times of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That God wo'd put his Law into their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts, and they should all know him</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56374:6"/>
               <hi>even from the least of them to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</hi> That which this Sophister wo'd have infer'd from hence is, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing God should reveal in the times of the Gospel, Men should have as full and comprehensive a knowledge of, as they have of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in nature. But 'tis evident this expression was design'd to signify the plainess of the Gospel, as to all matters of obligation upon Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, in opposition to the obscurity of the Law; which was so perplex't with a multitude of Rites and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Duty, that it was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and tedious to learn and observe them all. And therefore it is said in the same Text, <hi>That they should not then teach every Man his Neighbour; saying, Know the Lord;</hi> because all the necessary knowledg of him and his Laws, was then to be rendred plain and easy. And accordingly this is now the glory of our Religion; and its plainess is one great argument of its Excellence and Divinity: not but that there are some things reveal'd in the Gospel, of which we are not now
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56374:6"/>
capable of any clear &amp; distinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. So that there is a great deal of difference between these two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, <hi>Christianity not Mysterious,</hi> and, <hi>There are no Mysteries in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The first is very true, and the last is absolutely false.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Or a Treatise shewing, that there is nothing in the Gospel contrary to Reason.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Who among us ever said there was? but if this had not been added, his Book wo'd have been the shorter by Fourteen Pages; and were it not for this, and many other things in it, as little to the purpose, it had been only a sticht Pamphlet, and cry'd about with Almanacks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor above reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This likewise is a dubious saying; for if it signifies that there are no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56374:7"/>
in the Gospel, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for us to know the meaning of, then it is very true: For thô some passages are difficult, yet every thing in the Gospel is intelligible; and were there any expression in it impossible to be understood, so much of it must have been writ to no purpose. But if by <hi>not being above reason,</hi> be meant that there is nothing spoke of in it, but what we have as compleat and perfect a knowledg of, as we have of any object of our Sences, it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely false; as I hope will sufficiently appear.</p>
            <p>And thus the whole Title Page is nothing else, but equivocation and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phism. However there is this to be said for it, that it suits the-Book very well; the main drift of which is, to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t up Natural Religion in opposition to all Revelation; and these same E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocations begun in the Title Page, run through every thing he says.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56374:7"/>His Introduction, wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to state the Question, requires no Answer; for we grant that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Mystery is to be taken from the Holy Scriptures, and not from the opinion of <hi>any private Doctor,</hi> or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> or <hi>any infallible Head,</hi> So there are Six Pages of Impertinence cut off already.</p>
            <p>I shall only take notice, how he sets out with a fling at the Divines, the Men he's all along so angry with, who gravely tell us</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we must adore what we can't comprehend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, they tell us we must adore God, and yet we cannot comprehend him. Let him prove we can if he's able, and without giving himself or us any farther trouble, we will put the whole Controversy to a short is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and let it lye upon this one point. And if he does not make out, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56374:8"/>
we have as full and comprehensive a knowledg of the Nature and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, as we have of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in <hi>Euclid,</hi> then what will this Man deserve for that arrogant expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Divine Being himself cannot</hi>

            <p>His business here was to have sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Question, and let us have known what was the true Notion of a Mystery in Scripture. But instead of this he goes a great way about to tell us, that the true notion of a Mystery is to be taken no where but from thenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which no one denies. And therefore since he hath not done it, I must: That both He and I may speak to the purpose, and neither of us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after trouble the World with imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56374:8"/>Now the clearest way I can think of, for doing of this, is to instance in some particular Mystery of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and in that one for all, to let us see what a Christian Mystery is in the sence of Scripture. I shall take the first I think of, that of the Resurrection of our Bodies.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of this says,<note place="margin">1 Cor: 15: 51, 52.</note> 
               <hi>Behold I shew you a Mystery, we shall all be chang'd in the twinkling of an eye.</hi> Again, St. <hi>John</hi> speaking of the same<note place="margin">1 Joh: 3: 2.</note> matter says, <hi>It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence we see a Christian Mystery is something which relates to another life, which it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for us to know, without Divine Revelation; and now that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd we know it but it in part, and cannot fully comprehend it. Or shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56374:9"/>It is a Divine Truth reveal'd to us in part.</p>
            <p>As particularly this of <hi>our being changed at the last day into the likeness of Christ.</hi> It is a truth relating to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother life, which could never have enter'd into our heads to think of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it had been reveal'd to us from Heaven; And now that it is reveal'd to us <hi>that we shall be like him,</hi> yet we know nothing of the manner of it wherein this likeness will consist.</p>
            <p>So that in a Christian Mystery, there is something we do understand, and something that we are wholly ignorant of; and it is call'd a Mystery in respect of both these.</p>
            <p>1. It is call'd a Mystery in respect of what we do know of it; because it was a thing so hidden from us, that it was impossible to discover it by those powers of knowledge which we are now endu'd with. As we could never have known from
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56374:9"/>
reason, that good Christians should be <hi>chang'd into the likeness of Christ.</hi> Now it is this part of the Mystery which makes it an Article of Faith, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligatory upon our Consciences to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. Because we understand well what it is for a Body to be rais'd, and alter'd for the better, and we know perfectly what it is for one thing to be chang'd into the likeness of another.</p>
            <p>2. It is call'd a Mystery in respect of that part of it which as yet we have no notion of; because 'tis utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for us in this life to attain to any knowledg of it by reason assisted with the greatest degree of revelation that is afforded us. And thus it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for us in this life to have any notion of the manner of that change<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the likeness of Christ, for 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly said, <hi>That it doth not yet appear what we shall be.</hi> From whence I shall infer only thus much at present, that what we do know, and what is yet conceal'd from us, are in gross call'd the same Mystery. And that as we are oblig'd to believe what is reveal'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56374:10"/>
of it, so likewise we are at the same time oblig'd from express words of Scripture to believe, that there is more in it than we are now able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. Nay that there is something in it which we have no notion <hi>or Idea</hi> at all of.</p>
            <p>This is the notion of a Mystery in the sence of Scripture; and therefore now we see the Question is not, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man can believe what he kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ws nothing of,</hi> which no man in his wits ever yet affirm'd; for there is a flat contradiction in the terms; and yet this is the main thing he labours to disprove, and by which he endeavours to confound his Readers. But the Question is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether there be not some things in the Gospel, concerning which we are bound to believe, that there is much more in them than we are now able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</hi> If there be such things, as it appears in this instance of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56374:10"/>
then there is something in the Gospel that may properly be call'd a Mystery; and in so strict a sence, that nothing else can be call'd a Mystery with so great propriety of Speech, as will appear more fully hereafter.</p>
            <p>The case would have been the same, had I taken any other Mystery for an instance, either the eternal Generation of the Son; or the Procession of the Holy Ghost; or the Union of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human Nature; or the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Holy Spirit in the act of Grace; or the Felicity and Joys of Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if it be requir'd I am ready to quit this, and take any other for an instance which he shall pitch upon.</p>
            <p>Now this is the thing that lay upon him to disprove; but he durst not go about proving or disproving any thing, till he has perplex't the matter in hand, and amus'd his Reader with fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal terms and distinctions. If he had mean't honestly, and thought himself able to go through with what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56374:11"/>
he would have spoke plain undisguis'd Reason and proceeded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the proof of the Question. But instead of this he finds it necessary to spend above one third of his Book, in loosing of it: wherefore I must take my leave of it for some time as he doth, to rescue the subject from obscurity, and force this Man to speak plainly and intelligibly.</p>
            <p>And first he tells us, <hi>That reason is</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 8, 9, 10</note> 
               <hi>not the man that hath it;</hi> nor <hi>the things to be reason'd about;</hi> nor <hi>is it our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and desires;</hi> nor <hi>is it authority.</hi> What trifling this is? he should have added, that it was not the Head that forms the Thoughts; nor the Fingers that write them; nor is it the Brain it self; No! nor is my Reason, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of another Man. Our Readers are like to be much the wiser for this.</p>
            <p>After this he proceedeth to shew<note place="margin">P. 11.</note> what it is, in his second Chapter; the whole substance of which in other words is only this; that it is not <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56374:11"/>
               <hi>Apprehensio,</hi> nor <hi>Judicium,</hi> but that it is <hi>Discursus</hi> that is properly call'd Reason. Which last he will not express by <hi>Syllogism,</hi> the word for it that is commonly receiv'd: but he must call it, <hi>The application of intermediate Idea's to other Idea's that are distant from one</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> 
               <hi>another, and ly too far asunder in the mind.</hi> And this he explains by <hi>the measuring of two Houses with a line;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you can't take one House in one hand, and the other in another, and so clap them together, to find out which is highest. What is this but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Syllogism, by applying the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Terminus</hi> to the parts of the Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? and to what purpose is all this, unless he thinks that his Readers have not learned Logick?</p>
            <p>Yes, he hath a drift in it, which is very observable in all our modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against reveal'd Religion; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he first lays down false rules of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, the consequences he wo'd make, will not appear to be true. Thô he's in the right of it thus far, and it is no more than what is in every common
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56374:12"/>
Logick; Yet what follows is his own, and is both trifling and false.</p>
            <p>For first, his four ways of coming to the knowledge of any thing, are very ill put together, and the distinction frivolous. <hi>The Experience of the Sences,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
               <hi>the Experience of the Mind</hi> (i. e.) in usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al speaking, Sence and Reason; <hi>Human and Divine Revelation.</hi> Now at first sight who does not see? that any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation by God or Man, must enter into the mind by one of these two ways, either by our Sences or our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; so that there are but these two ways still.</p>
            <p>And then as to his making <hi>Authority</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 16.</note> 
               <hi>a means only of Information, and</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">To make what is to be said upon this head more intelligible, the Reader may take notice that by Evidence he means nothing more than the knowledge of a thing in the Mind. So that these two Expressions are the same. <hi>Evidence is the only ground of Perswasion,</hi> and, <hi>You can give your assent to nothing but what you know.</hi> All the difference is, that one is plain, and the other affectedly obscure. But <hi>I</hi> must use his own Cant, otherwise thô I speak ever so much to the purpose, he will not think himself an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd.</note> 
               <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the only ground of Perswasion;</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56374:12"/>
which is the fundamental Error of his Book, and indeed of all these modern Writers who make such a stir about Reason and Evidence; we shall see the falsity of it if we consider <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in respect of the Person who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and of him who gives the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p>1. In respect of the Person who is inform'd, I grant it is a means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; for how comes any one to the knowledge of a thing he was wholly ignorant of before, and which he could not attain of himself? why? by an others revealing it to him.</p>
            <p>2. When considered in the Informer, it is a ground of Perswasion; for why do I give my assent to any Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on related to me from another? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the veracity and ability of the Person that makes the Information.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56374:13"/>But this cuning man will ask, how can that which is inseparable from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother be the ground of any assent in my mind? I Answer, It is the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is in me of his ability and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity is the cause of my assent. The ground of this opinion indeed is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: But then this Evidence is a ground of perswasion in respect of the worth of the Person only; and that Worth or Authority of his, is the only ground of perswasion in respect of the substance of what he relates to me. From whence it is plain, that though we grant that Evidence in the Mind is a ground of perswasion, yet it is not the only ground. And therefore to make this very clear and undeniable, let us take an instance of two Propositions, wherein these two grounds may be consider'd separately.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>The three angles of a Triangle are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to two right ones.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56374:13"/>In a Person who is able to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate this Proposition, the only ground of his perswasion or assent, is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it in the Mind: For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he gives his assent to it is; because he finds out the agreement of the extreams by intermediate Idea's, and thus as he speaks, the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at last becomes self evident.</p>
            <p>But as to the substance of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When Christ appears we shall be like him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The authority of the Person relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is the only ground of perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For as I should never have known this if it had not been reveal'd, and therefore in this respect Authority is a means of information; so I should never have believed it, if I had not known that this Revelation had come from God. And therefore <hi>Authority</hi> consider'd in the Revealer, is the only
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56374:14"/>
grounds of my assent to the substance of this Proposition.</p>
            <p>But to make this plainer, we must consider that all natural Truths which do not necessarily require Revelation, need no other ground of perswasion but <hi>Evidence;</hi> but those which do, have both these grounds of perswasion, <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we distinguish the three things in every relation.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The meaning of the words.</item>
               <item>2. The relation it self, or the very act of revelation.</item>
               <item>3. The <note n="*" place="bottom">To prevent all ambiguity, <hi>I</hi> do not take the word <hi>Substance</hi> here strictly, as it is oppos'd to the modes and accidents of the thing, but as it includes them.</note> substance of the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Revelation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>As to the meaning of the words, and truth of the revelation in any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, Evidence is the ground of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion: for why do I believe this Proposition? <hi>When Christ appears we</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56374:14"/>
               <hi>shall be like him.</hi> Because I know the meaning of the words; and because there is an evidence in my Mind of its coming from God, from those proofs to my Senses and Reason; which argue the Divine Mission of the Person who relates it; and consequently the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the relation it self. But as to the <hi>Substance</hi> of that Proposition, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> is the only ground of Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as indeed it is in all relations whatsoever.</p>
            <p>And therefore 'tis now plain how<note place="margin">P. 43. &amp; 128.</note> 
               <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Human Authority</hi> differ as well in degrees of <hi>Perspicuity</hi> as of <hi>Certitude.</hi> And why? because when a meer man relates any thing to me, thô I allow the veracity of the man, yet it is impossible for him to give such proof to my Sences and my Reason of the reality and substance of what he relates, as God can; And therefore can't raise so great a degree of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in my Mind. Though I suppose this mans relation to be true (so that this relation of his, and one of God's
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56374:15"/>
shall be upon equal Terms as to certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, being both alike true) yet this assent of mine to what the man relates, is more precarious and worse founded than my faith of any divine propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; because this is more clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, as having a degree of Evidence in the mind which the other wants. <note n="*" place="bottom">That which may make this Paragraph obscure, is the mistaking <hi>Evidence</hi> in the Mind, or <hi>Knowledge,</hi> for those proofs which are only the cause of it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I shall make this plain by an instance. A man tells me that <hi>Rome</hi> is swallow'd up by an Earthquake; I have such an opinion of the veracity of the Man, that I give my assent to it and believe it firmly.</p>
            <p>Let us suppose afterwards that God reveals this same to me. As yet there is the same degree of perspicuity allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ability and veracity of the man; for then both God and he tell truth in this. But if God confirm the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a Miracle, this shall raise an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56374:15"/>
or degree of knowledge in my Mind, beyond any thing the man is able to effect; and consequently the revelation of the same thing from God makes it clearer, and gives it a greater degree of perspicuity than it had before.</p>
            <p>But it will be yet more clear, That <hi>Authority</hi> is a ground of Perswasion, if we consider, that all Evidence in the Mind proceeds from Evidence in the Thing. Now all Truths in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are equally evident; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of us they are not so: for some we are capable of knowing distinctly, and some we are not, because they are not suited to our present ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities. In respect of those divine truths, or of that part of them which is suited to our present capacities, <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is the ground of perswasion; but in respect of that part of it, which is not suited to our Capacities, as we have seen, <hi>Authority</hi> is.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56374:16"/>
And thus we see, how we may give our assent, to many propositions, for the substance of which we have no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the mind. Why then says he a man shall believe what he doth not know, and that is giving his assent to nothing. But this is a quibble and to remove it effectually, let us take up the same propositions again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The three angles of a Triangle are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to two right ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis plain a man who knows what a Triangle is, and what it is for one Angle to be equal to another, may give his assent to this proposition; though perhaps it may be utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible ever to beat the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into his head. And though he doth not comprehend it, yet he can't be said to be ignorant of it. And the only ground of his assent is, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of some person who is able to demonstrate it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:56374:16"/>And thus it is with a divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. <hi>When Christ appears we shall be like him.</hi> Any one who knows what it is for a body to be rais'd, and for one thing to be like another, may give his assent to this proposition; though it be impossible for him to know wherein this likeness will consist, or to demonstrate that it will certainly be so. And therefore the Authority of God is the only grounds of perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in this proposition; and no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is necessary any farther than to understand the meaning of the words, and the truth of the revelation it self. So groundless is that main principle of his, that a man can give his assent to nothing but what he comprehends: whereas the contrary is as clear as the light, from what hath been said.</p>
            <p>But farther, from this supposition of his, that <hi>Authority is only a means of Information,</hi> and <hi>Evidence the only ground of Perswasion,</hi> these two absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities will directly follow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56374:17"/>1. That a man can never be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in any thing; for if <hi>Evidence</hi> in the Mind be the only ground of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wasion, a man can never give his assent but where there is this Evidence: for if there be but one only cause, the effect can never proceed but from that cause; and what is evident (i: e:) what is truly known, can never deceive.</p>
            <p>He hath no way of evading this, but by saying that the cause of error is the giving assent where there is none, or not sufficient Evidence in the Mind; which destroys every thing he says upon this head, for this supposes that there may be some other cause of assent besides Evidence. But if we suppose Evidence to be the only cause of assent, then it must vary in degrees together with it's cause; so that a clear Evidence shall have a firm assent, and the least degree of Evidence shall have but the least degree of assent; so that still a man can never be deceiv'd in any thing, or in any degree. And for him to say that we may think we have this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56374:17"/>
Evidence when we have it not, is still supposing that there is some other ground of assent. Nay worse, 'tis supposing that a thing may be Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to us, and not Evident at the same time.</p>
            <p>2. It will follow that no Person either God or Man, can be believ'd on their word. For what they relate is evident to the Mind, or it is not; If it be, then they give their assent to that <hi>Evidence,</hi> and not to the Person who relates it. If it be not evident (i: e:) according to him, if he doth not know it perfectly, he must utterly reject it. And thus in a few words he destroys all Faith, both Human and Divine. For thus he proceeds; a man can believe nothing but what he knows; and he knows nothing but what he comprehends; and then he is said to comprehend a thing when he hath a clear and distinct Idea of it, (i: e:) when it is as clear as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Demonstration; or as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as what he sees with his Eyes, for you know seeing's believing all the World over.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56374:18"/>Having thus made it plain that <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is not the only ground of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, I come now to consider his <hi>clear and distinct Idea's</hi> which he lays down as the ground of this Evidence. This opinion carries a face of fairness and probability, and insinuates it self by the common inclinations of men, who are naturally averse to all restraint in thinking as well as acting, and are as uneasy at any fetters upon their Mind as upon their Body. They wou'd not willingly be oblig'd to give their assent to any thing but what they have clear &amp; distinct Idea's of; and if it be not thus in the Christian Religion, even well meaning people are apt to wish it were so.</p>
            <p>Now because I design this Letter in answer not only to this Book, but to all the opposers of <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> upon the like principles of setting up for <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Evidence,</hi> and clear and distinct notions of every thing they give their assent to, I shall be very particular in the consideration of this point. And I hope to make out
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56374:18"/>
plainly to them, the deep deceit that lies at the bottom of all this; and to convince them that God, by requiring their assent to his Revelations, doth as little violence to their mind as to their body; and that he leaves their Reason as full a scope, and as great a liberty in matters of Religion as in any thing else. So that they will find us as great Sticklers for <hi>clear Idea's,</hi> strict <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> as they can be for their hearts.</p>
            <p>These men speak much truth, but make false inferences, never conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the difference between these two propositions, but confounding them in all their discourses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clear and distinct Idea's are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all our knowledge and assent,</hi> which consider'd in a right sence is undoubtedly true. But for that other which they make a consequence of it, it is absolutely false, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

from thence; that there is no necessity of having a clear and distinct Idea of what I give my assent to.

And therefore to cut of all Metaphysical nicities, and infist upon nothing but genuine Reason; by a clear and distinct Idea, as it relates to this controversy is signified, <hi>as clear and distinct a conception as we ordinarily have of the things of this World.</hi> For these are the two main things he contends for in his whole Book.</p>

               <item>1. That we are so far from having clear and distinct Idea's of those things of another World which are revealed to us, that we have no proper or immediate Idea at all of them. <hi>And</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That though we have no proper or immediate Idea of those things, yet we are bound to believe them; and that our assent to them, according to his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, is founded upon clear and distinct Idea's.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. As to the first by a <hi>proper and immediate Idea</hi> I mean, <hi>a conception or notion of the thing as it is in it self,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56374:21"/>
By <hi>a mediate or improper Idea</hi> I mean, <hi>a notion we form of any thing in our Minds by Analogy or</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Not that worldly Objects can have any real likeness or resemblance of the things reveal'd, but they are such as God hath made choice of for that purpose; and therefore we may make this inference from his Wisdom, that they bear the greatest analogy with them, of any things that fall within the compass of our knowledge now.</note> 
               <hi>Similitude.</hi> Whether this distinction hath been made use of or no I know not; but sure I am 'tis a very necessary one, and of excellent use to set the bounds and measures of our knowledge, and to lay open the true nature of our Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Faith: that we may clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend where <hi>Knowledge</hi> ends, and <hi>Faith</hi> proceeds alone. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded a due observation of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, wo'd effectually put an end to all this controversie about mysteries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56374:21"/>Now what I say is this, that we have no proper Idea's of the things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, but frame to our selves conceptions of them, from those things in this World whereof we have clear and distinct Idea's. And to make this appear, let us consider that there are but two ways of Gods revealing any thing to us; either by giving us new faculties, or by adapting his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations to those we have, which are our <hi>Sences</hi> and our <hi>Reason.</hi> He grants that it is not by giving us any new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; and therefore since this is done by adapting himself to those faculties we already have, then 'tis plain that he must make use of such words and notions as fall within their proper sphere.</p>
            <p>Now that we can have no proper or immediate Idea from Sence or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of the real nature of any thing relating to another life as it is in it self; or indeed any other notion of them than that of <hi>Being</hi> in general, will best appear by instancing in the particulars. I shall begin with God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56374:22"/>
himself and his Attributes, that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible Being which this bold man affirms, to have nothing more myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in it than a <hi>stock</hi> or a <hi>stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. And first our imagination can frame no likeness or resemblance of God, as it can do of material and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Objects; and therefore the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites were forbid to represent him by any figure or resemblance, because they saw no similitude. And to the same purpose are many expressions in the Scriptures as Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i. 40. 18. <hi>To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?</hi> So that I hope I have gain'd thus much, that God is more mysterious than a stock or a stone, because we can frame some imagination of these, but none at all of him.</p>
            <p>2. But 2dly, as we can form no si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude from the <hi>Sences,</hi> so neither hath the <hi>Reason</hi> any the least glimps of his real Nature as he is in himself, for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56374:22"/>
the only way we have of forming an Idea of him is either negatively, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving from him all the Imperfections of the Creatures, or by enlarging those excellencies we find in these, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting them to God. So that he is now incomprehensible to us, not only as we have no clear and distinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, but as we have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Idea at all of his real nature. And therefore when he made a particular Revelation of himself it was only by the name I AM, which denoted nothing more of him than barely his Existence; and plainly intimated that it was impossible for them to conceive any thing farther of him. For this reason 'tis said that hereafter <hi>we shall see him as he is,</hi> because we have no knowledg of him now, but by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of those Idea's we have of the things of this World. And to make this farther appear let us consider him in those Attributes of his, whereof we are thought to have the most clear and distinct Idea's. And</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56374:23"/>1. 'Tis reveal'd to us that <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> by which we really understand nothing more, than that he is a Being that is not matter; which is so far from a proper immediate Idea, that it is not a positive one; for all the notion we have of a Spirit is that it thinks, and that it moves. As to the first of these, the only reason why we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to a Spirit, is because we can demonstrate that meer matter cannot think; And therefore we conclude it must be something else that can, thô we have no notion at all of what it is. Besides we can't conceive what think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in a pure Spirit; we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the true manner of that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in them, which is answerable to knowledg in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We can conceive thinking now, only as it is perform'd by help of material Organs, and more immediately by the Fibres of the Brain. But when we set our selves to consider it abstractedly from these, we have no Idea at all of it. So that we now form as gross a notion of thinking in a pure Spirit, as we do of it's motion,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56374:23"/>
when we walk by dragging one Leg after another.</p>
            <p>And then as to it's motion, when we say a Spirit moves, we don't make this inference from any knowledge we have of the true nature of it, but because we can prove that matter can't move it self, and thus by denying it to matter, we really do nothing more than give it to something else; but what that something is we know not. For we know not how it moves, or how it communicates this motion to matter. Nor indeed can we distinguish Thought and Motion in a Spirit; and as far as we may make a conjecture of what we have no Idea of, in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they are the same. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can't but wonder that any one<note place="margin">Lock of H. U. B. 2. C. 23.</note> sho'd affirm, that we have as clear and distinct an Idea of Spirit as of Body. That we have as good proof for it's existence, as we have for that of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I grant; but to say our Idea's of their Modes and Properties are equally clear and distinct, appears to be a very groundless assertion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56374:24"/>2. As for <hi>Infinity</hi> another Attribute of God, the only way we are said to form a notion of this, is by continu'd accumulation, and then a confus'd Idea of what remains when we are weary of this. But 'tis plain there is not one addition we make but <hi>ipso fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> we destroy it's being; the very thought of addition, does of all things in the World carry the Mind farthest from the real nature of it. And how little this will help us to any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate positive Idea of it is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that when we have imagin'd all the Atoms that go to the composition of the Universe, told as many times over as we can heap up numbers for it, we are as far from any true Idea of Infinity, as when we began to reckon <hi>Two.</hi> Had I said <hi>One,</hi> we sho'd in all likelyhood have been nearer it; as an instant of time hath been found a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter representation of Eternity, than the successions of numberless. Ages. And therefore it were more conducive<note place="margin">Lock of H. U.</note> to true knowledge, to own our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and say it is a perfection which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56374:24"/>
we know nothing of, but we form a gross, a scanty notion of it by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual addition to the widest space, or greatest number, or longest duration we can think of.</p>
            <p>3. As to his <hi>Omnipresence</hi> we have no Idea at all of it, for it is utterly impossible for us to conceive, how the same thing sho'd be here, and there, and every where in the same instant: and therefore we frame to our selves a gross notion of it by that of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued extension; thô at the same time we are sure this must be utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the real Nature of God.</p>
            <p>4. And as for the <hi>Prescience</hi> of God, we are so far from having any notion of it, that it can't enter into our heads to think how God sho'd actually see a thing that hath no being: for God sees things to come, as we see what is now. So that we can no more conceive it, than we can conceive how a thing may
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56374:25"/>
be, and not be at the same time; and therefore we frame to our selves the best Idea we can of it (i. e.) from those previous Idea's of things in our Mind; which doth not at all represent this Attribute of Prescience as it is in God, who sees them actually and <hi>ex parte rei.</hi> Nor can we conceive how this Prescience of his is reconcileable with the contingency of things, thô we are sure it is so, from those Prophecies of very minute circumstances, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years before they came to pass.</p>
            <p>I might thus run through all the Attributes of God, and shew in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, how we make to our selves some representations of them, by compounding and enlarging those Idea's we have either of sensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or of the operations of our own Minds. And thus we represent the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Holyness,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. of God, from the scanty notions we have of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56374:25"/>
these things in our selves, thô they exhibit to us no more of the real nature of these things as they are in God, than continu'd extension doth of his Omnipresence; or a great number doth of his Infinity; or many ages of his Eternity. So that in all our thoughts of that divine Being we don't proceed thus. The nature of God is such, therefore these things follow. But these things are the greatest perfections we are able to conceive, and therefore by help of these we form the best and most honourable Idea of God, that is possible for us in this condition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity and blindness that we are now in. Not but that after we have fram'd the biggest Idea of God our Minds are capable of, by the greatest enlargement of these perfections, after all, 'tis as gross a representation of him as Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is of Light: and expresseth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the reall nature of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible Being to us, nor do they give us the least glimps of him as he is in himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:56374:26"/>2. But 2dly, As we can have no such proper and immediate Idea of God himself, so neither have we such Idea's of any thing relating to another World. And therefore it is that the Glory of Heaven, is reveal'd to us under the notion of Light; the greatness and splendour of that place, by that of a Kingdom; and the joys of Heaven by sensual pleasures, such as <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking;</hi> the operation of Grace, by the nourishment of our Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when God himself is spoke of, 'tis always by analogy with the Members of a Human Body, and the operations of our Minds. Thus he is mention'd as having Hands and Feet, as Seeing, and Hearing, and as being affected with all the passions of a Human Soul; because he hath no other way to speak of himself to us now, since we have neither Words nor Idea's, to think or speak of him after any other manner; or indeed of any other Objects of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:56374:26"/>And therefore it is that the Spirit of God in all his Revelations, hath made use, not only of the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Phrases</hi> commonly receiv'd and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; but likewise of those <hi>common notions</hi> in the minds of Men, of things in this World, to represent Truths, which are in respect of us now uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable; and for which there are as yet no capacities in our nature. So that in truth all the Idea's we at present have of the things of another World, are no other than a sort of <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of things, the real nature of which is totally obscur'd from us.</p>
            <p>And this is the literal meaning of<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 12.</note> those words of St. Paul, <hi>That now we see through a Glass darkly,</hi> (i. e.) by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy only with the things of this World. But <hi>then Face to Face</hi> (i. e.) we shall have as immediate a view of those heavenly Objects, as we have now of these things which only represent them to us. So that when we are said to have these divine Truths reveal'd to us in <hi>part,</hi> the meaning is not, that any real part of the thing as it is in it self
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56374:27"/>
is exhibited to our view, and the rest obscur'd; or that we have any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct view of the thing it self, as we see an Object at a great distance. But the meaning is, that the <hi>whole</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to us under the resemblance of some things in this World, whereof we have clear and distinct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Idea's.</p>
            <p>And thus it is plain that thô we may be said to have <hi>Idea's</hi> of God and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, yet they are not <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate or proper</hi> ones, but a sort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position we make up from our Idea's of Wordly Objects; which at the utmost amounts to no more than a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> by which something in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World is signified, of which we have no more notion than a Blind-man hath of <hi>Light.</hi> And now that I am fallen into this Metaphor, which seems well to explain the nature of the thing, let us pursue it a little; and suppose, that to a Man who had never seen or heard any thing of it, it were to be reveal'd that there was such a thing as <hi>Light.</hi> This man as yet hath neither a <hi>name</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:56374:27"/>
nor a <hi>notion</hi> for it, nor any capacity of conceiving what it is in it self. 'Tis plain therefore God wo'd not reveal this to him by the name of Light, a word wholly unknown to him; nor by stamping on his Mind any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Idea of the thing it self: for then it were utterly impossible for him to communicate this Revelation to others as blind as himself; for nothing but the same Almighty impression cou'd do that. So that this Revelation must be made by Words and Notions which are already in him. And accordingly when he is told, that it is a thing which can diffuse it self in an instant many thousands of miles round; and enable him to know in a moment what order all things lay at a great distance from him, and what proportion they bore one to another; nay that it cou'd make him know where the Heavens lay; and by the help of this he shou'd there discern at once, a vast and almost infinite number of very pleasant Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and in short that without the help of his <hi>Stick</hi> or his <hi>Hand</hi> he shou'd know every thing that lay before him.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56374:28"/>
After all, 'tis plain this Man wou'd form to himself an Idea of <hi>Light</hi> from his <hi>Touch,</hi> he wou'd think it very like <hi>feeling,</hi> and perhaps call it by that name; because this was the best way he had of distinguishing one thing from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therefore wou'd conclude that those <hi>Bodies</hi> he heard of, must needs be wondrous soft and smooth.</p>
            <p>Just thus do we conceive the things of another World, so that we may rack our invention, and turn and wind all those Idea's we have into ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand different shapes, and yet never make up any <hi>likeness</hi> or <hi>similitude,</hi> of the real Nature of those Objects of another World.</p>
            <p>And now I hope, he will grant it a thing possible for God to make such a Revelation as this to a Blind man. And yet by this concession he destroys his whole Book. For upon his Principles it were a thing utterly impossible for any man that was born Blind, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is such a thing as <hi>Light,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:56374:28"/>
upon the testimony either of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> for without the use of <hi>one</hi> of his <hi>Eyes</hi> at least, he's so far from having any clear and distinct Idea of it, that he cou'd have no Idea at all of it as it is in it self; and therefore must never believe that there is such a thing. Now it were a very pretty way of revealing the nature of <hi>Light</hi> to this Man, by opening of his Eyes. Then I must confess <hi>Light</hi> wou'd be no longer a Mystery to him. And when this Man makes us understand (as he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken) the nature of God, and the things of another World, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as that man doth the nature of <hi>Light</hi> when his Eyes are open'd, I will yield. But till then, I must freely own ours to be the case of that Blind man, in respect of all the Mysteries of our Religion: and before this <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi> Book of his comes out, I am very positive that nothing less than the Almighty Power of God is able to perform what he promises, since it requires the alteration of our whole Nature, and the enlargement of all our Faculties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:56374:29"/>But perhaps he will object here, If it be a thing thus impossible for us to have any proper Idea's of these things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, what necessity was there for any <hi>revelation</hi> at all of them? wou'd not the immediate Objects of Sense and Reason have done as well, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther reference to any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them? I answer, no. For the discovery of the things of another World even thus far, is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to make men good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Thô we had ever so great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the innate excellency of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> it self, yet this wou'd bind us but like a Spider's Webb. We might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have admir'd it for it's delicate and excellent contexture, but it wou'd have been of no strength, to restrain the unruly inclinations of our Nature. The excellencies of Vertue, without these Revelations, had been a sort of Bonds and Fetters which wou'd have sat as loose upon us as the Air; they wou'd have serv'd at best only to have rais'd our admiration, but never to have influenc'd our practice. And
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56374:29"/>
therefore since they were thus neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and that we are not capable of any knowledge of them by <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>immediate intuition,</hi> there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of revealing them to us, but by <hi>analogy</hi> with the things of this World. And this Imperfect way of Revelation is sufficient to answer all the ends of God, since it is abundantly enough to all the purposes of Vertue and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: as the motions of the heavenly Bodies represented in a <hi>Sphere,</hi> is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to answer all the ends of human life, thô the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> be all very different from it, and represents no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less to us, than the reality of the thing.</p>
            <p>It being, as I hope by this time very plain, that we have no such proper or immediate Idea's, either of God or the things of another World, as of the things in this; we may from hence see the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious trifling of those abstracted <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical</hi> Brains, who bend their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to bring down these hidden things to the level of our present ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56374:30"/>
of knowledge: whereas the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out a way of commerce with the Moon, or how to make a visit to the sixt Stars, is a grave and serious thought to it.</p>
            <p>The other Proposition I laid down in direct opposition to him was,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That thô we have no proper or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Ideas of these things, yet that we are bound to believe them.</hi> And, <hi>That our belief of them is founded upon clear and distinct Idea's.</hi> Not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but of those things by which they are represented to us, and because of those proofs we have from thence of their existence to our Senses and our Reason.</p>
            <p>And here we are to observe what I made out before, <hi>viz.</hi> That in every Mystery there are two things to be consider'd. 1. <hi>Something that we do comprehend fully,</hi> and 2dly <hi>Something</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:56374:30"/>
               <hi>that we have no notion at all of.</hi> As to this latter part of it, it is wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the disquisition of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Faith alone can reach it, for our Reason fails us where we have no Idea's. So that in respect of this part of the Mystery, these and such like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of his are very true, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the intermediate Idea can be no<note place="margin">P. 14.</note> proof, where the agreement with both Idea's of the question is not evident.</hi> And again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That when we have no Notions or Idea's of a thing we cannot Reason about it at all.</hi> For, as I have shewn, we have no proper immediate Idea's of the things revealed to us in the Gospel; and therefore we can't speak one word of sence about the real nature of them, as they are in themselves.</p>
            <p>All beyond this World, as yet, is but a <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>empty Void</hi> to us; and we may send out our Reason to range it backward and forward incestantly, till Soul and Body part, and never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scover
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56374:31"/>
the least glimps of light, into the true nature of any thing beyond this scanty <hi>Sphere</hi> of ours. We have no <hi>intermediate Ideas</hi> to make Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces concerning them, and if we had, there cou'd be no application of them to things whereof we have no notion. So that thus far every thing of another World is a mystery to us, and a <hi>new born Infant</hi> knows as much of them, bating their <hi>existence only,</hi> as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst man in the world.</p>
            <p>But as to that other part of them which is knowable by us (<hi>i. e.</hi>) as far as we are able to conceive these divine things, by <hi>analogy</hi> with the things of this World, either under the <hi>similitude of sensible Objects,</hi> or <hi>the Operations of our own Mind,</hi> they fall intirely under the consideration of our Reason. Thus far we have as clear and distinct Ideas of them, as we have of other ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worldly Objects. And in respect of this part of our <hi>Christian Mysteries,</hi> all these sayings of his are very true, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56374:31"/>
               <hi>That nothing reveal'd is more exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the disquisitions of Reason, than the ordinary Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>That nothing in the Gospel is contrary to Reason, or above it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all the Revelations of God are in a way suitable to those powers of knowledge we have, and he requires us to believe nothing, but what is just and reasonable. For as he says, <hi>To act tyrannically does only become the Devil.</hi> In respect of this part of the Mystery, all that he contends for holds true. We must have <hi>clear and distinct Idea's</hi> of the things; we must have <hi>interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Idea's to find out the agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Extremes.</hi> What need I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in any more particulars? I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him thus far, all the <hi>Clearness, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity, Evidence</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> any man can wish for. And all the request I would make to these Men of Reason is, That they wou'd cease to ask for a <hi>rational account,</hi> of what neither they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56374:32"/>
nor we can have any <hi>notion</hi> of; and that as to every thing else in Religion, they wo'd be as <hi>exact,</hi> and <hi>critical,</hi> and <hi>severe</hi> in their Reasonings as possible they can. And unless they find more reason to believe the truth of those things reveal'd in the Gospel, than it is possible for them to have for what any Man says, then I will allow them to be the only Men of <hi>Sence,</hi> and that we are only <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>credulous</hi> fools.</p>
            <p>'Tis every mans <hi>native Right</hi> and <hi>Priviledge</hi> to judg and examine every thing, before he gives his assent to it; and 'tis this alone which distinguisheth our <hi>Christian Faith</hi> from <hi>blind Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> because it admits of such enquiry. For thô we have no <hi>notion</hi> of the things themselves, yet we are sufficiently assur'd of the truth of them, from those things we fully understand: And the constant method of arguing in divine things is this; from the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct Idea's,</hi> we infer the existence of those things whereof we have <hi>no Idea</hi> at all. As for instance in this Proposition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:56374:32"/>
               <hi>This Corruptible shall put on Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have a clear and distinct Idea of what it is for a Body to <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>rot;</hi> and likewise I know what an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thletick habit of body is, and for a person to have a firm constitution, and to remain always in the utmost <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>vigour</hi> of a blooming Youth, which is the best Idea of Incorruption that I can frame to myself now. And the reason I give my assent to this Proposition, is not because I have any, the least notion of that <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table state of perfection</hi> which a Body shall be rais'd to, and which is here represented under the notion of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption.</hi> But because I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof for the truth of it, in this Type or Figure by which it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to me, that it is possible for me to have, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the concurring testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Prophecies, Miracles,</hi> and the <hi>Excellency of that Doctrine</hi> which they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56374:33"/>
preach't, who were made the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of revealing this to me.</p>
            <p>And thus likewise, thô we have no Idea of God as he is in himself, yet we infer his <hi>Existence</hi> from those clear and distinct Ideas we have of the things of Nature; which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meaning of the <hi>Apostle</hi> when he says, <hi>All that was to be known of God was manifested in them, for the invisible</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19.</note> 
               <hi>things of him from the creation of the World are cleerly seen, being understood by the things that are made.</hi> It was for want of some Idea of him as he is, that made the Heathen World run into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and represent him under the similitude of some of the <hi>meanest of his Creatures.</hi> And now by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what we come to know more of him is, that we can have no Idea at all of him as he is in himself: and as it follows it is this will one day render all <hi>Infidels without excuse,</hi> because thô they had no clear and distinct Ideas of the things of another World, yet God did not leave them without suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56374:33"/>
proof of their existence; nay greater than it was possible for them to have for any thing else.</p>
            <p>From whence we see, that there is an <hi>essential</hi> difference between <hi>Human</hi> and <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> because the proof on which one is grounded is <hi>fallible,</hi> and that of the other <hi>infallible;</hi> and consequently a greater degree of knowledg in the one than in the other. This is one reason of using these two words <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Knowledg</hi> so promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously in some places of the New Testament, because our belief of a meer man, is but a precarious assent, but the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> may be called <hi>Knowledg</hi> in a more peculiar sence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are obliged to believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what we have infallible prooffor. Which again shews the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of that saying of his, which he lays such a stress upon. That <hi>Divine and Human Revelations do not differ in degrees o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And now we see plainly the error of those men, who out of a <hi>mistaken zeal</hi> for the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Christianity, have set themselves to defend them, by bringing them down to the <hi>level</hi> of a man: and endeavour by <hi>thin spun notions,</hi> to solve the greatest difficulties in them upon the Principles of Reason. These are very rash and inconsiderate attempts; and when all is done, their failing in what they aim at, is the best defence of our Christian Mysteries. If we had not a <hi>determinate sence</hi> for the words wherein they are reveal'd, they could be no <hi>Articles</hi> of Faith, And if they cou'd be fully solv'd and explain'd, they wou'd cease to be <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</hi> This hath given the Enemies of our Religion a great advantage, for when they find they are not to be throughly accounted for (as indeed they are not) upon the strength of Reason, together with the assistance of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56374:34"/>
that degree of <hi>Revelation</hi> we now have, they utterly reject them, as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent</hi> with those powers of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which God hath given us.

            <p>It wou'd certainly be very pleasant, to hear two such <hi>quicksighted</hi> blind men as I spoke of, dispute warmly concerning the nature of <hi>Light,</hi> and how many <hi>seeming contradictions</hi> they wou'd start concerning it, as, <hi>How any thing cou'd be in every point of such a vast space in the same instant? How it was possible for them to touch so many millions of Objects at once?</hi> Since this was their chief way of distinguishing one thing from another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fall
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56374:35"/>
out about these <hi>imaginary difficulties</hi> irreconcilably. Whereas upon suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that it was reveal'd to them that there was <hi>such a thing;</hi> which shou'd make them very happy some time or other, when God shou'd open their eyes: Their business was not to consider, whether they were able clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and distinctly to <hi>comprehend</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this thing; but whether it were really <hi>reveal'd</hi> to them, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such things whereof they had clear and Distinct Idea's. If it were divinely reveal'd, and they had suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient testimonies for the reality and existence of it, then they wou'd have sufficient reason to believe it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any clear and distinct Idea of the thing it self.</p>
            <p>So that we take a wrong <hi>method,</hi> against all the <hi>Opposers</hi> of <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Mysteries,</hi> when we go about to explain to them what is really inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable by us now; many such <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi> and <hi>impious</hi> Books as these have been the consequence of it. We are
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56374:35"/>
neither able to apprehend any thing of these Mysteries, nor if we knew them, cou'd we explain them so as to make other people understand us. 'Tis the greatest <hi>Folly,</hi> because it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;</hi> and the greatest <hi>Boldness,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is searching into what is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from us; and all these <hi>elaborate Intricacies</hi> are but mischievous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> what they have <hi>no Idea</hi> of, it must always end in darkness and confusion. That part of a Christian Mystery which is <hi>intelligible</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> was ever so; and that part which is <hi>mysterious,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their vain endeavours, will ever be so till we co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> to another World.</p>
            <p>Therefore our way to deal with these men is, to fix the right <hi>sence</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of those Propositions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Mysteries of the Gospel are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to us; and then to insist upon the <hi>Proofs</hi> we have for the truth of the Revelation, and shew that they are
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56374:36"/>
such as ought to convince any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable unprejudic'd man; insomuch that if they do not give their assent to them, they shall be <hi>without excuse</hi> when they come to be try'd for their Infidelity. Thus we shou'd turn the <hi>course</hi> of our Thoughts into a right Chanel, and confound all these Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our excellent Religion. For by freely owning (as becomes us) that we have no notion at all of these mysterious things as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, we cut off a multitude of <hi>frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> and <hi>impertinent Objections.</hi> And shew these men, that our Christian Faith however is no <hi>lazy credulity,</hi> or <hi>blind implicite assent,</hi> since it is built upon a better foundation, than is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for any man to lay, without the concurrence of the <hi>Almighty Power</hi> of God: insomuch that we are ready to join issue with them, upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reason, in every point of our <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> as far as the things reveal'd fall within the compass of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:56374:36"/>And therefore were I to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of my belief of the TRINITY, laying aside all <hi>affectation of hard words,</hi> and <hi>abstruse Metaphysical Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> I wou'd do it thus.</p>
            <p>I am fully perswaded of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Revelation in general,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all the purposes of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> in this life; and I am convinc'd that those Revelations of the things of another World, which are made in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> have better proofs of their <hi>Divinity</hi> than any other whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. They have such <hi>testimonies</hi> of their coming from God, from Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Miracles, and the agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Doctrines therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, to our common Notions, that if I use my <hi>Reason</hi> with the same <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality</hi> in these that I do in other things, I must give my assent to them.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56374:37"/>From whence, and from many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther passages in the Scriptures, I find that there is a <hi>Distinction</hi> made in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> under these three names of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> hath exprest, altogether by the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> and singly by the word <hi>Person.</hi> And I think these terms proper enough, to express all that we know of this <hi>Mystery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I find no account of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of this <hi>Distinction</hi> in the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> any otherwise than that the Son was begotten, and that the Holy Ghost <hi>comes</hi> from the Father and the Son. I conclude there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a meer <hi>Nominal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,</hi> because we are said to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, in the name of the <hi>Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghost.</hi> Which must needs import something more than if that Commission had run thus. <hi>Go Baptize all Nations in the name of</hi> Jehovah, <hi>and of</hi> Elohim, <hi>and of</hi> Adonai. And if there were not something more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56374:38"/>
intended, than barely that they shou'd do it in the name of God, this were a needless tautology.</p>
            <p>Again, I conclude that they are not three <hi>distinct different Spirits,</hi> for then there must be <hi>three Gods,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Reason</hi> and Scripture. From all which I infer, there is in the Godhead something more than a <hi>meer nominal Distinction,</hi> and something less than that of three <hi>different Spirits.</hi> And because I find each Person <hi>seperatly</hi> as well as <hi>jointly</hi> mention'd as God, and Divine Worship allow'd and paid to them. Therefore as that excellent <hi>Creed</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it, <hi>I worship the Trinity in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Athe.</note> 
               <hi>and Unity in Trinity; neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now at the same time I make this <hi>profession</hi> of my <hi>Faith,</hi> I allow I have not the least knowledg how strict this <hi>Union</hi> is, nor how great the <hi>Distinction.</hi> It is as much beyond my <hi>Reason,</hi> as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56374:38"/>
the <hi>Glory</hi> of God is beyond my <hi>Sight;</hi> and any man who strives to conceive it himself, or takes pains to explain it to others, is guilty of such a folly, that I can't think of any action in nature <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant</hi> enough to match it. If we saw a Man stretching up his hand with a great deal of <hi>Vehemence</hi> to pull down a Star, we shou'd certainly conclude him distracted; because 'tis utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him to <hi>reach</hi> it, or <hi>grasp</hi> it if he cou'd. 'Tis the very case of those men, who go about to account for the manner of that <hi>Unity,</hi> and <hi>Distinction</hi> for which they have neither <hi>Words</hi> nor <hi>Idea's.</hi>

            <p>And therefore I say it again, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to this Insolent Man, that I thus <hi>adore what I cannot comprehend.</hi> This is one of those <hi>Mysteries</hi> reveal'd in the Gospel, and it is never the less a Mystery for any thing he hath yet said, or ever will say; for the Union is inexplicable, and will be so to the end of the World. However my assent to this is not <hi>precarious</hi> and <hi>implicite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56374:39"/>
or any <hi>easie blind Credulity;</hi> but is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounded upon <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct Idea's.</hi> For there are three things to be done by every reasonable thinking man, concerning any Proposition wherein a <hi>Mystery</hi> is reveal'd.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To be sure that he understand well the meaning of the Words.</item>
               <item>2. That he discern no Contradiction in them.</item>
               <item>3. That he hath sufficient evidence of the Revelations coming from God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. As to the first of these, in respect of the Mystery I am now upon, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand very well the <hi>meaning of the Words</hi> wherein it is reveal'd; and they themselves who oppose this Doctrine understand them as well as I; for if they did not know what was meant by the <hi>Words,</hi> they wou'd never set themselves to argue against it; for there is no other way of con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uting <hi>Nonsence,</hi> but saying it is such. So that thus far, if it prove to be true, these Propositions wherein the <hi>Trinity</hi> is reveal'd, will hold good against them
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56374:39"/>
at the day of Judgment, and render them without <hi>Excuse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As to the second thing, I see no <hi>Contradiction</hi> in it; and if there were, I would utterly reject it. For to say that <hi>Three</hi> are <hi>One,</hi> is so far from being a contradiction, that there is nothing more common in ordinary discourse, than for any one to say, that <hi>Three</hi> or any other greater number of things, are but one; and if every man who spoke such <hi>seeming</hi> contradictions, were <hi>catch't</hi> up immediately, and forc'd to explain himself upon all such occasions, it wou'd make <hi>conversation</hi> very troublesome. As if one shou'd say, that <hi>there are three distinct things in a Man,</hi> a <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> and an <hi>Immaterial Substance,</hi> and yet these <hi>three</hi> are but <hi>one;</hi> and he shou'd be forc'd to explain himself and say, that his <hi>meaning</hi> is not, that <hi>three</hi> men are <hi>one</hi> man, or that <hi>one</hi> man is <hi>three</hi> men. They who cry there is a <hi>Contradiction</hi> in this <hi>Mystery,</hi> seem to me neither to know what a Contradiction is, nor what is the Christian Faith concerning
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56374:40"/>
the Trinity. For we don't believe that the <hi>Divinity</hi> is <hi>One</hi> &amp; <hi>Three</hi> in the same sence; then indeed it wou'd be a contradiction. But we affirm the quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is <hi>One</hi> &amp; <hi>Three</hi> in <hi>different respects.</hi> So that all this noise of <hi>Contradiction</hi> vanishes, and the whole force of the Objection amounts to no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are not able to conceive, in what <hi>respect</hi> he is <hi>one,</hi> and in what respect he is <hi>three;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore because we have no clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Idea of this, we must utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it. I grant we are not able to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> for this, and it is this that makes it a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and if I cou'd clearly solve the manner of this <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> it wou'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to be such. Thus much of it is purely the <hi>Object</hi> of my <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> of God is the only ground of my assent to this part of it. But then</p>
            <p>3. I have sufficient proof of this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation's</hi> coming from God. I have for <hi>This,</hi> all the proof that I have for the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56374:40"/>
Divine Mission of the Persons who wrote them; so that I must either <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> all <hi>reveal'd Religion,</hi> or allow <hi>This</hi> to be an Article of my Faith.</p>
            <p>But perhaps this man will Object, that thô he shou'd grant it to be an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> yet it is so no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we can <hi>comprehend</hi> it. But I have already made it out at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, that both what we do, and what we cannot know are both in gross call'd the same <hi>Mystery;</hi> and that my assent to what I do <hi>not apprehend,</hi> is founded upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of God, but my assent to what I do apprehend is founded upon Evidence: The first assent is properly Faith, the last is Knowledge.</p>
            <p>And so likewise if I were to give an account of my belief of the <hi>DIVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY OF THE SON,</hi> it shou'd be thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:56374:41"/>I am convinc'd by the <hi>Completion</hi> of Prophecies, the <hi>Miracles</hi> he wrought, and the agreablness of his <hi>Doctrine</hi> to the natural sentiments of our Minds, that whatever <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was, He came from God. I find him in many places, assuming to himself the <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> of God. In discoursing with the <hi>Jews</hi> he useth this form of Speech, <hi>Before Abraham</hi> was I AM, on purpose to signify to them, that he was that very <hi>Divine Being</hi> which was reveal'd to <hi>Moses</hi> under that <hi>Name.</hi> And sometime after he tells them, that as he was the Son of God, so <hi>He and the Father were one.</hi> That the Jews understood him in <hi>this sence</hi> I am sure, because they took up Stones at each of these sayings, to stone him as a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> because <hi>he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self equal with God.</hi> If these expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not to be understood in the <hi>sence</hi> they took them, he wou'd cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have <hi>undeceived</hi> them, and have made it known, that he was not God in the sence they understood him; but that he was only a God by <hi>Deputation,</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:56374:41"/>
according to the wild notion of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians.</hi> But he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>poke the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the Jews understood him <hi>right, That he was eternal God equal with the Father,</hi> the very same God who was signify'd by that sacred name I AM. And he hath never undeceiv'd either <hi>them</hi> or <hi>us</hi> to this day; but instead thereof hath us'd many expressions to <hi>countenance</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> this notion of him; and therefore if I act like a reasonable man, I am under a necessity either <hi>of giving my assent to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or of <hi>utterly rejecting him as an Impostor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now had he been and Impostor, God who shew'd himself always very <hi>jealous</hi> of his <hi>Honour,</hi> wou'd never have confirm'd this Doctrine of his with such repeated <hi>Testimonies.</hi> If we suppose him to be only a <hi>Messenger</hi> come from God, and a <hi>meer Man</hi> who spoke only by his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Commission,</hi> he wou'd never have us'd such expressions as must naturally be <hi>misunderstood,</hi> and lead thousands into the gross sin of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> which of all others is the most detestable to God. <hi>Moses</hi> was never
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56374:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
suffer'd to enter into the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> for a much <hi>less suspicious</hi> expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the heat of <hi>passion</hi> too <hi>Must we bring water out of the Rock?</hi> which was a <hi>vainglorious insinuation,</hi> that they wrought that Miracle by their own immediate power, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per efficacy. This comes much short of these expressions of our Saviour's, <hi>destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it again. I have power to lay down my li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and I have power to take it up. And before Abraham was I am.</hi> And indeed that passage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Moses,</hi> seems to have been upon <hi>Record</hi> by the special providence of God for this very purpose, that it might be a good argument of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Jews</hi> of the Divinity of the Son, since this inference was very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and obvious from it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If God was so incens'd with</hi> Moses <hi>for making use of one expression, which seem'd to encroach upon his Prerogative; then how far wou'd he have been from giving testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of much more frequent and greater Miracles, to a Person who by many plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er expressions, assum'd to himself the full</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56374:42"/>
               <hi>power and perfection of the Godhead; if he were not really what he gave himself out to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this reason I say because I can't reject him as an <hi>Impostor,</hi> therefore I believe this Proposition, and confess, the blessed Jesus the Son of God to be Eternal God equal with the Father.</p>
            <p>Now thus far I proceed in this <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> upon the strictest rules of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Evidence,</hi> and my Faith of this Proposition is founded upon <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct Idea's;</hi> for I know clearly who I mean by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) that <hi>Person</hi> who was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and Crucified under <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> I have a clear and distinct Idea of what it is for <hi>one thing to be equal to another;</hi> and I apprehend very well what is signify'd by the name of <hi>God</hi> here, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) that Divine Being whose necessary <hi>Existence,</hi> I infer from that clear knowledg I have of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56374:43"/>
And of whose <hi>Nature,</hi> thô I have not the least notion <hi>as it is in it self,</hi> yet I form the best Idea of him I can by enlarging all the <hi>Perfections</hi> that are discernable in the Creatures. And I have a clear and distinct Idea, of what it is for <hi>one Person to be the Son of another.</hi> Thus I understand the <hi>meaning of the words;</hi> nor is there any thing in them <hi>contradictory</hi> to my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And lastly I have clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Idea's of those <hi>miraculous proofs</hi> to the senses of men; and of those <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletions</hi> of <hi>Prophecies;</hi> and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that <hi>Doctrine</hi> they confirm, the agreableness of it to the common notions of Men, and it's natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to make men <hi>easy</hi> and <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> to one another. All which raise such an Evidence or Knowledg in my mind of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of his Mission who reveal'd this Proposition to me, that I must do <hi>violence</hi> to my Reason if I do not give my assent to it. And thus far it is not so properly and strictly a <hi>Mistery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:56374:43"/>But when I think of this Proposition again, <hi>Jesus the Son of God, is God equal with the Father.</hi> I must own at the same time I give my <hi>assent</hi> to it, I have no knowledg at all of that <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation,</hi> which I form an <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Idea</hi> of from the <hi>Procreation of one Man from another.</hi> Nor have I any notion of this wonderful <hi>Union</hi> of the Human nature with the Divinity. Nor can I in the least imagine wherein this <hi>Equality</hi> consists. These and all other things relating to the manner of it, are wholly out of the reach of all my <hi>Capacities,</hi> and totally obscur'd from me. These are the things which make it a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and in respect of this part of it, the <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Veracity</hi> of God, is the only ground of my <hi>Perswasion;</hi> and my Christian Faith of this Article consists, in thus giving my assent to the <hi>existence</hi> of things which I have no notion of, when he hath taken care to give me undoubted Testimonies, of the revelation's coming from him. And I trust he will accept of it, because 'tis
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56374:44"/>
no <hi>rash inconsiderate assent,</hi> but that I use those powers of knowledg I have, as <hi>strictly</hi> and <hi>impartially</hi> in this, as I wou'd do in any affair which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly concern'd my life.</p>
            <p>And thus I hope it plainly appears, how little reason these people have to talk to us of a <hi>blind implicite assent</hi> or <hi>easy credulity,</hi> since in our <hi>Christian Faith</hi> we proceed upon the strictest rules of <hi>Reason,</hi> and build our assent upon no foundation but what we know to be <hi>firm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now before I proceed to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his Book, I shall repeat in short the Principles he lays down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or himself to go upon in this, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Books which he threatens the World with.</p>
            <p>The whole summe of his Logick in short then is this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:56374:44"/>1. <hi>Evidence is the only ground of Perswasion</hi> (i. e.) you can never give your assent even to the <hi>reallity</hi> or <hi>existence</hi> of any thing, but when you know as much of it as you do of any thing in the World; and comprehend it as fully and perfectly as that 2 and 3 make 5. which is plainly to say, <hi>you can never believe any thing, but when it is so clearly known to you, that you can't help believing it;</hi> for no man can hinder his assent to a thing he knows perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well: as no man can help believing that 2 and 2 make 4. A thing may be very true indeed, and you not believe it; but if this truth be evident to you, your assent must necessarily follow. So that you can believe nothing, but <hi>when you can't help it;</hi> and when you can't avoid it, then <hi>you must believe it;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 22.</note> for <hi>God hath taken it out of our power to dissent from an evident Proposition.</hi> and <hi>our kind Disposer hath put us under</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 23.</note> 
               <hi>a Law, of bowing before the Light and Majesty of Evidence,</hi> and therefore this Man must make such an Idol of it as totally to exclude all deefrence, or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56374:45"/>
assent to the Word of the true God. For another Principle of his is</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That Authority is only a means of Information,</hi> (i. e.) you can believe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, nor Man upon their <hi>Word,</hi> for they can only relate a thing to you, but neither of them can influence your Mind to an assent. So that to speak <hi>plainly,</hi> 'tis all one in respect of your assent whether God, or Man, or the Devil tells you a thing, for thô you are convinc'd that God <hi>always tells truth,</hi> and the Devil is a <hi>Liar;</hi> yet still you believe the thing never the more because it comes from God. Alas! the <hi>veracity</hi> of God is not to be regarded in the case; no, you must bow before the Light and Majesty of Evidence only.</p>
            <p>But suppose God and the Devil speak two contrary Propositions, as in the case of Eve. <hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely Die.</hi> And, <hi>Thou shalt not surely Die.</hi> The words of these two Propositions were <hi>equally clear</hi> to her; she understood the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56374:45"/>
of them alike; and her <hi>Idea's</hi> of the things spoke of were equally <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct.</hi> What then was the ground of her assent to the latter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it cou'd not be <hi>Evidence,</hi> for according to him, both these Propositions, had equal pretence to her <note n="*" place="bottom">It may be thought that I have taken a wrong Instance, because at first sight, it looks as if it was the consent only of her Will without any delusion of her Understanding. But on second thoughts you will find, this is no other than to disbelieve the truth of the <hi>History,</hi> which records this false perswasion of her Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the temptation which prevail'd upon her; for the consent of her Will did not follow, till the Devil had remov'd her Objection from that saying of Gods, in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dye.</note> assent upon this score; and therefore nothing remains to be the ground of her assent, but the Authority either of <hi>God</hi> or of the <hi>Devil.</hi> And we find by sad experience it was the Authority of the latter that sway'd her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:56374:46"/>But 'tis plain, she had a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Evidence or Knowledg of the truth of the former Proposition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w it came from God who cou'd not lie; and yet we find she rebell'd against this Evidence. Whereas had she been under such a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of <hi>bowing before the Light and Majesty of Evidence,</hi> she wou'd not in all likelihood have transgress'd as she did; and then he had not now been falling down thus prostrate to <hi>Igno rance</hi> and <hi>Errour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which shews the <hi>ridiculousness</hi> of these two Principles is, that upon them we can never believe any thing that is to come, thô it were the <hi>next hour.</hi> For thô we understand the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Words, and that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie</hi> be concerning any of the most <hi>familiar Objects</hi> of Sense and Reason, so that you have the clearest Knowledg of the thing foretold: yet unless you will allow <hi>Authority to be a ground of Perswasion,</hi> you can never
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56374:46"/>
believe the truth of the Relation; for no man can have any knowledg or Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this till the thing comes to pass. So that as to the truth of the Relation there is nothing left to be the ground of assent, but the <hi>Veracity</hi> or <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of some Person or another. And thus he utterly destroys the Faith of all <hi>Prophecies;</hi> for thô they may be <hi>true,</hi> yet we can never believe them so, till the relation is <hi>evident</hi> to us; and this can never be evident to us, till the things actually <hi>come to pass.</hi> So that this is a short way of destroying the <hi>credit</hi> of every thing in the Gospel, which for the most part speaks of things to come.</p>
            <p>I said before that in Divine Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, <hi>Evidence</hi> was a ground of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion in respect of the <hi>Relation it self, or act of Revelation;</hi> and here I say that in respect of the very same, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is a ground of Perswasion. They are both true; and therefore to make this whole Discourse more clear, and prevent all mistakes as far as I am able,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56374:47"/>
I shall once for all, shew the diffe rence between <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Human Revelations</hi> in respect of those three things, which I said were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd in every Revelation.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As to the meaning of the Words,</hi> Divine and Human Revelations are upon equal terms. They must be both intelligible alike, and thus far Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or Knowledg is the only ground of Perswasion in each of them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>As to the substance of the thing reveal'd,</hi> in many cases they both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this too, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are <hi>equally intelligible;</hi> for some of the Revelations of God, are concerning things as knowable by us, as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Phaenomena of Nature. But in respect of a reveal'd Mystery, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human Revelations are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite, for the substance of the thing intended by the revelation, in one must be always intelligible, but in the other it is totally obscur'd. But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56374:47"/>3. <hi>As to the truth of the Relation</hi> it self, or the <hi>very act of Revelation</hi> there is this difference; that in all <hi>Human</hi> Revelations Authority is the only ground of Perswasion; because no meer Man can give any proof, which shall amount to more than a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or strong presumption. But in <hi>Divine Propositions,</hi> the truth of the <hi>Relation</hi> is founded both upon Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Authority. 1. Upon <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> as the truth of it is confirmed by Testimonies which are certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as Prophecy, or Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which can come from none but God, and therefore create a degree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg beyond what is possible to be had of any relation meerly Human. <hi>2dly.</hi> Upon <hi>Authority,</hi> as this Knowledg is not directly of the thing it self, and therefore that we do not know the truth of it by any <hi>direct</hi> or <hi>immediate intuition.</hi> So that these Testimonies are only to convince us that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation comes from God, and then we give our assent to the truth of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56374:48"/>
them, purely upon the account of his Veracity. A third Principle of his is. That</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Divine and Human Revelations differ not as to Perspicuity.</hi> (i. e.) You must understand the meaning of the Words in Divine Propositions as well<note place="margin">P. 42.</note> as Human; for as for <hi>unintelligible Relations, we can no more believe them from the Revelation of God, than from that of Man.</hi> A very subtil piece of Logick indeed, if he had design'd no more than he spoke. But he hath a farther drift in it; he knew it was not every <hi>Reader</hi> wou'd distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>the Sence and Meaning of the Proposition,</hi> which we grant must be equally clear and perspicuous in both, in order to an assent; and, <hi>The reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and existence of the thing, and truth of the Revelation,</hi> in respect of which, the Revelations of God always carry a greater degree of <hi>Perspicuity;</hi> because of that Evidence in the Mind, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd by such proofs which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56374:48"/>
for man to give. What I spoke of this before, I level'd at his design rather than his words, as I am forc'd to do in several other instances.</p>
            <p>But he will say perhaps, these proofs may make the Revelation more <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> but not more <hi>clear.</hi> I grant they don't explain the words of it. But 'tis plain the <hi>Proofs</hi> make the Revelation never the more <hi>true or certain in it self:</hi> But it is in respect of us they make it <hi>more certain.</hi> And to make a Revelation more <hi>certain</hi> in respect of us, is to make it more <hi>clear;</hi> and that is to add a greater degree of <hi>Perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>We can give our assent to nothing, but what we have clear and distinct Idea's of.</hi> (<hi>i. e</hi>) We can believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what we have the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate perception of <hi>Sense,</hi> or <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> for, or know by direct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>Intuition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:56374:49"/>Such stuff as this he lays down for Logick, and if you will argue with him, it must be in his own Method, and upon his own Principles; and then to be sure he will be too hard for you. But if you put him out of his Biass, and keep him to plain undisguis'd Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the receiv'd rules of Arguing, you spoil him quite.</p>
            <p>Now by this time who so blind as not to see? That the design of this Book is <hi>To strike at the Root and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all reveal'd Religion.</hi> And now I have thus brought this Man out of the Clouds, I need not spend much time in striping him of his disguise; for the inferences he wou'd have people make from these Principles, are so <hi>glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>open,</hi> that every body may see them. If Authority be no ground of Perswasion, then we must not believe the truth of any <hi>Revelation</hi> or <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> And if we must give our assent to nothing, but what we have clear and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56374:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
distinct Idea's of, then farewell all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion both <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>reveal'd.</hi> For we know all Religion <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounded upon the <hi>belief of a Deity,</hi> of the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and of <hi>Rewards and Punishments in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other World;</hi> but it is impossible for us now to have as clear and distinct Idea's of these, as we have of a <hi>Stock</hi> or a <hi>Stone;</hi> but we infer these truths only from those things whereof we have clear and distinct Idea's; and therefore upon his Principles we must utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them all.</p>
            <p>And then since by clear and distinct Idea's he means, As <hi>exact and clear a notion as we have even of sensible Objects,</hi> in one sentence he excludes all assent even to the <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>existence</hi> of every thing in the Gospel that respects another World; and rejects all those <hi>Methods</hi> of our Salvation, which are spoke of in the Bible, as so many <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Fictions.</hi> Thus we must disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Change</hi> of our Bodies; the <hi>Happiness</hi> of the blest in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56374:50"/>
Heaven; the <hi>Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of the Son; the <hi>Trinity of Persons</hi> in the Godhead; the <hi>Operations of the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. nay the <hi>whole Christian Religion:</hi> Because, as I have sufficiently shewn, we have not such clear and distinct Idea's of these things, as we have of the ordinary Phaenomena of nature.</p>
            <p>He cou'd not but see this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may well conclude this was his drift. But he did not consider at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the same time, that this wou'd cut off all assent to the very <hi>Being of God.</hi> And thô I am fully convinc'd, that he is the most inveterate <hi>Enemy</hi> to reveal'd Religion, that hath lately appear'd in Print; however I can scarce think he is arriv'd to that height of <hi>Atheism</hi> yet, as to deny the existence of God, thô he has not as clear and distinct an Idea of him, as he has of a Stock or a Stone.</p>
            <p>As for his second Section, 'tis all<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> 
               <hi>foreign</hi> to the matter; and all that he says about seeming contradictions, is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56374:50"/>
plainly level'd at the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> thô <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> be the instance he makes use of. And he proceeds upon the same fundamental Errour he hath hitherto done, That we can believe nothing but what we have a clear and distinct Idea of.</p>
            <p>We say as well as he, <hi>That there is</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> 
               <hi>nothing contrary to Reason in the Gospel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 26.</note> 
               <hi>That there is no contradiction in any point of Doctrine in it. That Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>

               <hi>is a Rational and Intelligible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which are the things he insists upon in this Section, and goes a great way about to prove very aukwardly. And therefore what can he mean by it, unless it be to make <hi>unthinking</hi> People fancy we deny all this. If he hath any thing to object against our Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> let him speak plainly: but nothing is more vile and disingenuous, than for a man to speak thus indistinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and confusedly, and talk all in the <hi>general</hi> with design to make People think us guilty of those <hi>errours</hi> we detest and abhor. If he has any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy with us, let him deal honestly,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56374:51"/>
and instance in any one point of Doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine we believe or teach, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Scripture;</hi> and make it out as plainly, as I have done his Principles to be such. If not, let him own he had no other design but to expose the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and it's <hi>Teachers;</hi> and gratify the <hi>Rancour</hi> of a sort of People, who because of their lewd and debauch'd lives, must naturally hate that Institution, which they shall one day be condemn'd by; and which promises them nothing but <hi>Damnation</hi> in another World.</p>
            <p>This Book which goes under his name, is exactly calculated for them; there is a little superficial shew of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to make it plausible, but not one instance in all the Book of close Reason or Argument. Let him shew me where one link of my <hi>Reasoning</hi> fails, and I will make it up again so firm, that he shall never be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do it. Whereas all his whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is a meer <hi>Rope of Sand;</hi> many bold and false Assertions, sly Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and several things, nothing at all to the question, huddled up together
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56374:51"/>
on purpose to patch up a Book; and amuse such persons who have just Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick enough to be impos'd upon by a Fallacy, but not to see through it.</p>
            <p>Now after this long digression of<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> 
               <hi>two Sections,</hi> in his third and last Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he comes at length to the matter in dispute, but with what success we shall see.</p>
            <p>Here he begins to state the question<note place="margin">P. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> again, and says a <hi>Doctrine above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or a <hi>Mystery</hi> denotes one of these two things. Either</p>

               <hi>cover'd with such a Vail, that Reason cannot penetrate to see what is under it, till it be remov'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:56374:52"/>Which definition agrees perfectly to the Mysteries of the Gospel; for they are all things <hi>intelligible in them selves,</hi> but in this life <hi>so obscur'd from us by this vail</hi> of flesh and blood, that with our strongest Imagination and closest Reasonings, <hi>we cant penetrate into</hi> the true nature of them, <hi>till this Vail be remov'd;</hi> and then we shall see them clearly. Now this is not the definition that he quarrels with, and if he will admit of this little enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, we are both agreed. But the definition he finds fault with, is this.</p>
            <p>2. A Mystery <hi>is a thing of it's own</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 66.</note> 
               <hi>nature unconceiveable, and not to be judg'd of by our ordinary Faculties and Idea's, tho it be never so clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never met with any one Sentence, so fraught with absurdity as this is. For</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56374:52"/>1. <hi>It signifies a thing in it's own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unconceivable,</hi> this is a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right falsity. For every Mystery is in it's own nature <hi>conceivable;</hi> the more truth any thing hath in it the more <hi>conceivable</hi> it is in it self; the Mysteries of Christianity are the <hi>Eternal Truths</hi> of God, and therefore are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves conceivable. But it is <hi>in respect of us</hi> that they are not so, because of the frail and limited condition of our understandings in this life.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Not to be judg'd of by our ordinary Faculties and Idea's, thô it be clearly reveal'd.</hi> Now for a thing to be <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveald</hi> to a Man, and yet that same man know nothing of it (which is his sence of the words, and which he would fasten upon us) is a perfect <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> For it is no other than saying, <hi>that the same man way, and may not know the same thing, at the same time.</hi> He can never come off by saying that a thing may be clearly reveal'd, and yet the Person may have no ability to apprehend any thing of it; for all <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> supposes a <hi>capacity</hi> in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56374:53"/>
to whom it is made, to apprehend something of it; and therefore 'tis non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to say, <hi>that any thing can be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveal'd to a Horse, or</hi> a Stock, or a Stone.</p>
            <p>3. Besides it is absolutely false, <hi>that the Mysteries of our Religion are not to be judg'd of, by our ordinary Faculties and Idea's.</hi> It hath already appear'd, that as to the thing signified and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> we have no Idea, nor faculty to judge of it as it is in it self. But as to all those <hi>means,</hi> whereby God hath discover'd the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and existence of those things to us, we may judg of them all <hi>by our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Faculties and Idea's.</hi> And to make this plain, let us instance in the same Mystery of the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Bodies sown in Corruption, shall be rais'd in Incorruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56374:53"/>This is one of the reveal'd Mysteries of the Gospel, and yet we are to judg of it by our ordinary Faculties and Idea's. For we have Idea's in our heads of what <hi>a body is;</hi> what it is to be <hi>sown or laid in the ground;</hi> what it is <hi>to be rais'd;</hi> and what it is for a <hi>body to be improv'd when it is so.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides our <hi>Faculties</hi> of Understanding are imploy'd, in considering those <hi>many arguments</hi> which prove the truth of this Mystery; and therefore 'tis plain that by our <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Idea's,</hi> we can judg of that part of it which is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by us. But he will say, we can't judg of that part of it which is totally obscur'd from us, and therefore so far it is no <hi>part of our Faith,</hi> and we are wholly unconcern'd in it. But on the contrary, we are bound by express words of Scripture, to believe that this Improvement will be very great, as in 1 <hi>John,</hi> 3. 2. <hi>We know not yet what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him.</hi> Here we are bound to believe that we shall be like Christ, thô we
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56374:54"/>
know not what this likeness is, or wherein it will consist.</p>
            <p>4. On this supposition, that a <hi>thing is in it's own nature unconceivable,</hi> how is it possible for it to be reveal'd? This is another flat <hi>Contradiction ex Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Rei,</hi> as the first was <hi>ex Parte Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi> A thing is in it's own nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable, and yet it may be reveal'd (<hi>i. e.</hi>) <hi>the same thing may, and may not be reveal'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. He makes a thing's being <hi>in it's own nature unconceivable,</hi> and <hi>not to be perceiv'd by our ordinary Faculties and Idea's,</hi> to signify the same thing; whereas they are just as different as Light and Darkness. Thô our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities are now dark and shallow, yet they will hereafter be improv'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd; and then we shall have extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Idea's to represent to us what we have no notion of now: And then the thing will be no way <hi>unconceivable</hi> either in itself, or in respect of us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:56374:54"/>These are not all the absurdities in this sentence; and yet it is the very <hi>Monster</hi> this <hi>Knight Errant</hi> sets up for himself to engage with. It is the spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious off spring of his own brain, and yet he fathers it upon us, by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it with this expression, <hi>It is made to signify, &amp;c.</hi> But it was never <hi>made</hi> to signify this by any besides himself. <hi>I shou'd read the Gospel a million of times over before this definition of a Mistery wou'd have come into my head.</hi> Here he hath made his own words good; <hi>That Contradiction and Mystery are two emphatical ways of saying nothing;</hi> He lays down this absurd definition of a Mystery, and then sets himself with a great deal of Solemnity to encounter it, which is in truth no other than for a man to put himself into a ridiculous <hi>antick posture,</hi> and then quarrel with his shadow for it.</p>
            <p>It is hard to tell how to proceed with this man, he has been running away from the <hi>Question</hi> ever since he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56374:55"/>
began; and now that he put us in hopes of coming to it again, you see how grossly we are disappointed. I wou'd with all my heart stick by the first definition of a Mystery, which with a little addition I allow to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Christian Mystery is a Divine Truth intelligible of it self, but so cover'd and obscur'd from us now in this life, that Reason can't penetrate the Vail to see what is under it, till this Vail be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd in another life by the glorification of our Bodies.</hi> Let him confute this definition if he can, for I will never fall out with him about the other; he shall have it all to himself, 'tis his own <hi>Creature,</hi> let him be as severe upon it as he pleases. But because he has so blindly mistook the matter, I must tell him once more what it is he is to prove, if he has any controversy with us in this point. He is to prove these two things.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:56374:55"/>
               <item>1. That there is nothing reveal'd to us in the Gospel but what we have clear and distinct Idea's of, (i. e.) <hi>either a full comprehensive knowledg of; or as clear and distinct notions, as we have of any ordinary Object in nature. And</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That we are not oblig'd by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to believe that there is any thing intended in some points reveal'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what we are now able thus to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These are the things which lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to prove, if he wou'd have spoke to the purpose.</p>
            <p>It is impossible that any man shou'd argue closely, who mistakes the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he does<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however I shall consider what there is in the rest of his Book that looks like reasoning. He does not proceed to proof yet, but runs upon another Digression, to tell us the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56374:56"/>
signification of the word <hi>Mystery,</hi> and particularly what it signify'd among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But what is this to us? it signifies quite another thing among the <hi>Christians.</hi> But he says not, <hi>for in the New Testament Mystery is always</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 68.</note> 
               <hi>us'd in the first sence of the word, or that of the Gentiles,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For things naturally very intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but so covered by figurative Words</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 73.</note> 
               <hi>or Rites, that Reason cou'd not discover them without special Revelation.</hi> This is the description which he gives both of the Gentile, and Christian Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in common.</p>
            <p>But taking a Christian Mystery even in his own sence, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) <hi>As it was involv'd in Jewish Types and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;</hi> yet they differ very much from those mysteries of the Gentiles. For</p>
            <p>1. The Christian Mysteries were not discoverable but by the <hi>special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> of God, whereas those of the Gentiles were discoverable by the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56374:56"/>2. Besides 'tis absolutely false that the things involv'd in the Jewish Types were <hi>in their own Nature very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</hi> For they were all of such a Nature, that men cou'd never have arriv'd to the least degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning them by strength of Reason; whereas there was nothing in the Heathen Mysteries but what was in it self very obvious to Reason.</p>
            <p>3. The matters contain'd in the Jewish Mysteries and the things inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, were such as concern'd the <hi>Eternal salvation of Mens Souls,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the things contain'd in those of the Heathen were to a quite contrary purpose, in order to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and many other gross sins. And it is not without very good reason I take notice of this difference here, for thô it doth not hit this discription of his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, because he may perhaps say <hi>those were thought to be the concernment of Souls too:</hi> yet it is level'd at the main design of his Book, which by this time no man can be ignorant of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56374:57"/>4. The things contain'd in the Jewish Mysteries, the <hi>Priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were ignorant of;</hi> whereas the Heathen Priests for the most part <hi>knew the bottom of theirs,</hi> and conceal'd them industriously from the People. And this is what he wou'd insinuate of all Christian Priests, <hi>viz.</hi> That we fully comprehend the meaning of all these things our selves, and palm them upon the People for Mysteries. Which is the occasion of those virulent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of his in this Chapter, <hi>That</hi>

               <hi>through ignorance or passion we maintain, what was introduc'd by the craft or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of our fore fathers.</hi> And calls it a <hi>Gainful Opinion;</hi> as if the only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign<note place="margin">P. 73.</note> of Christian Mysteries, were to bring in Money to the Priests. he calls Christianity as it is now receiv'd an <hi>Implicite Constitution;</hi> and says <hi>the</hi>

               <hi>Venerable Teachers, play at this small game to amuse the People.</hi> But he,<note place="margin">P. 74.</note> like a sharp inquisitive man it seems, has found out our Mysteries, and is resolv'd in his next Book to discover
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56374:57"/>
them all, and lay us open to the World, like <hi>Heathen Priests as he makes us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I come to his <hi>second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the <hi>third Section,</hi> where there<note place="margin">P. 74.</note> is the first appearance of any thing like a reason; there is but one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all that <hi>Chapter,</hi> and indeed in all the <hi>Book;</hi> and because he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it confus'dly, I will reduce it to form, and then we shall see clearly what <hi>force</hi> there is in it. And if he thinks I don't do him justice, let him manage it better for himself if he can. The whole strength of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing is this</p>

            <p>
               <hi>If we have as clear and distinct Idea's of God and Eternity, as we have of any thing in nature, then we have as clear and distinct Idea's of every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd in the Gospel, as we have of any thing in Nature.</hi>

            <p>Now do but deny this <hi>Minor,</hi> and he puts you off to another Book for the proof of it, and this is the whole substance of his reasoning here. But to pass by the <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of that saying of his, <hi>That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being it self is not more Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than the most contemptible of his Creatures,</hi> I will give him a reason why it is impossible for him ever to prove what he pretends. And that is, because even the most glorious of his Creatures <hi>are finite and limited,</hi> whereas the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56374:58"/>
nature of God is <hi>Infinite;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore even when we come to Heaven, he will be <hi>mysterious</hi> to us in a more proper sence than any thing else, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we shall not even then have as full and comprehensive a knowledg of him, as we shall have of <hi>the greatest</hi> of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>That which he builds upon is this,<note place="margin">P. 75.</note> 
               <hi>That nothing can be said to be a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, because we have not an adequate Idea of it, and a distinct view of all it's properties at once.</hi> But who ever said that the Mysteries of the Gospel were such only for this reason. I grant him if this were all, then as he says <hi>every thing in nature wou'd be a mystery,</hi> for we have not a full and perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of any thing. The true reason why our Christian Mysteries are such in a more peculiar and proper sence is, because the Idea's we have of them are more imperfect and less adequate, than those we have of the ordinary phaenomena of Nature. This is the point in difference between us, <hi>Whether</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:56374:59"/>
               <hi>we have as perfect and comprehensive a knowledg of every thing reveal'd in the Gospel,</hi> as <hi>we have of any thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> This is what he affirms, and we deny; and for proof as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he refers us to another Book in reversion. Here he only affirms it boldly, and instead of proving <hi>that our notions of these divine things are as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and full, as the notions we have even of sensible Objects;</hi> he spends this whole Chapter in proving by several instances, as of the Table he writes upon; of Rain, and a drop of Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we have not an adequate Idea of any thing. But why does he thus beat the Air? who ever deny'd it? and yet this poor <hi>hungry</hi> thought, is the only appearance of an Argument through his Book; it was for this only the whole was wrote, and the only skill he has shewn in it, is in beating up so little <hi>Sence,</hi> into all this <hi>Froth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now because there is no Proof here, there can be no farther Answer: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever since he hath order'd the matter
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56374:59"/>
so as to make it look like Reasoning, to amuse the Minds of unthinking People, I shall shew the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the things reveal'd to us in the Gospel, and the usual Phaenomena of nature with respect to the measures of our knowledg. And therefore</p>
            <p>1. Thô we shou'd grant what is absolutely <hi>false,</hi> and what he was to have given some proof for if he had been able, <hi>that the things reveal'd in the Gospel, and the ordinary objects of our sences, were upon the same level as to our knowledg,</hi> that we are equally ignorant of both, and comprehend them alike; yet his Inference wou'd not follow from hence, viz <hi>That the things reveal'd in the Gospel are not mysteries, in a more proper sence than a Spire of Grass, a Stock or Stone.</hi> For thô we are equally ignorant of two things, yet there may be much more behind to be known in one than in the other; and therefore upon this score, may much more properly be call'd a Mystery. For certainly thô we knew
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56374:60"/>
as much of God now as we do of a <hi>Stock or a Stone,</hi> yet sure he will allow there is infinitely more yet to be known in that Fountain of all Perfection, that rich Treasure of Wisdom, which is so far from being comprehended now, that he shall never be exhausted to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>We may say the same of all the other Mysteries of Christianity, thô we shou'd grant our Idea's of them were as perfect, and that we knew as much of them now as we do of any thing in nature, yet because they are <hi>infinitely more excellent</hi> in themselves; and that there is much more behind to be known in them, yet they wou'd deserve the name of <hi>Misteries</hi> in a much more <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sence</hi> than any thing in nature. Especially if we add that they are not only more <hi>excellent</hi> in themselves, but they are of much greater <hi>concernment</hi> to us, as they relate to <hi>the salvation of our Souls,</hi> and our well-being for ever in another World: Which makes them deserve more regard, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56374:60"/>
a <hi>better name</hi> if we have it to give them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we may well wonder what end any man cou'd have in start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a <hi>notion</hi> as this is, unless it were to vilify and debase the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Gospel; and cunningly to lessen all <hi>reveal'd Religion</hi> and it's <hi>Teachers</hi> in the opinion of men, as if they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had too great thoughts of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Revelations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But there is a yet greater <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> than this, for the things reveal'd in the Gospel, as to that part of them which makes them <hi>Mysterious,</hi> are such as <hi>exceed our present Capacities</hi> of Knowledg; whereas all the things of Nature fall within their <hi>Sphere,</hi> and are in themselves immediate and proper objects of our Sense and Reason. Thô many of them are such, that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do, nor ever can actually know any thing of them. And to lay this difference open to all, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that this of <hi>being above Reason</hi> is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56374:61"/>
an aequivocal expression, and signifies two very <hi>different</hi> things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It signifies a thing which does not exceed our powers of understanding; but is conceal'd from us, and lies out of our reach,</hi> by some <hi>accidental impediment or obstruction, which it is impossible for us to remove.</hi> And in this Sence it is above our Reason to know certainly, <hi>what is at the center of the Earth;</hi> or <hi>whether there be any Inhabitants in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> or of what species they are; <hi>what are the true motions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies, and what order they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve among themselves;</hi> and the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent configuration of the little parts of matter,</hi> &amp;c. That which makes these things above our Reason, is not any thing <hi>essential to them,</hi> but something <hi>accidental.</hi> And therefore we find our knowledg very much improv'd, and promoted by the help of Glasses, which discover things that by reason of their smalness, and distance were not preceptible by the naked eye, nor certainly discoverable by Reason. So
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56374:61"/>
that we may say, many things were above our Reason before these helps were found out, which are not so now; and if these helps cou'd be carried on, and improved to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to lay open to our view the smallest parts of matter, and at the greatest distance; or that a <hi>rational ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> were given us, of all the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena in Nature, by any <hi>intelligent Being</hi> superior to ours, we should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it distinctly and perfectly, and then nothing in nature wou'd be <hi>above our Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To be above our Reason signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>A thing which in it's own nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds our present Capacities, and is no proper object of those faculties of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which we are now endu'd withall.</hi> And in this Sense the nature of God is more properly above our Reason than a <hi>Stock or a Stone, Eternity</hi> than <hi>Time;</hi> a <hi>Spirit,</hi> than a <hi>Body;</hi> the <hi>Joys</hi> of Heaven, than <hi>Sensual Pleasures;</hi> the eternal <hi>Generation</hi> of the Son, than the ordinary <hi>Procreation</hi> of Man; the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56374:62"/>
               <hi>operations</hi> of the Holy Spirit, than the <hi>nourishment</hi> of our Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is as yet no proportion between these <hi>Objects</hi> and our <hi>Faculties</hi> of Knowledg; our intellectual powers are not yet form'd and so adapted for them, as they are for those things in Nature, which are the proper objects of our Sense and Reason now. So that it is a more improper way of speaking, to say <hi>that these things should be clearly reveal'd to us now, as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi> than to say <hi>that a nice point in Divinity or Philosophy, shou'd be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explain'd to an Infant.</hi> They are indeed plainly reveal'd to us as to their reality and existence, but not clearly as to the true nature of the things. Nothing in the World is more evident than that such things are reveal'd to us; but what or how they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, is impossible for us to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. And this is what the Apostle means by that saying, <hi>That Eye has not seen nor Ear heard, neither have entred</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>into the heart of Man the things which God hath laid up for them that love him.</hi> Which Words, thô by the context
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56374:62"/>
they are more immediately spoke of things past, and then reveal'd in part; yet they have a farther reference to the full completion of all these things in another World.</p>
            <p>I shall make this whole matter plain by an Instance. A Person who was born blind knows as little of the <hi>Sun</hi> as he does of the <hi>real nature of God;</hi> he feels the <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>warmth</hi> of it; he is <hi>cherish'd</hi> by it, and lives and thrives by the secret influences of it; but he neither knows <hi>where,</hi> nor <hi>what</hi> it is: and if he had been ever told that all this was the immediate act of God, he wou'd have thought so, for he knows nothing of the Sun besides the name. Now upon this Authors Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the nature of the Sun, and the nature of God are both equally a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery to this Blind Man. That he is equally ignorant of the true nature of both I grant, however they are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually a Mystery to him. And that this may appear let us suppose this Mans Eyes were opened; then he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56374:63"/>
wou'd see clearly that the Sun is a <hi>large, round, lucid Body</hi> in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but he wou'd be hereby ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to know nothing more of the true nature of God than he did before. And why? because this is beyond the reach of all his natural powers of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; and if all his Senses were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to be a thousand times nice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> than they are, thô he wou'd see much deeper into the nature of all things here, yet the <hi>nature of God,</hi> and the <hi>things relating to another Life</hi> wou'd ly as much out of his reach as ever; he wou'd even then know as little of the Glory of God, as that Man did of the Sun before his Eyes were opened. for Light it self is but a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to our gross Capacities to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Glory of God, which we are told in the Revelations is to be instead of light in Heaven.</p>
            <p>But because this is an Instance only of a sensible Object, let us take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Reason. Let us suppose an <hi>illiterate</hi> person, who never heard of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56374:63"/>
               <hi>Christianity,</hi> or the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ignorant of these two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>The three Angles of a Triangle are equal to two Right ones. <hi>And this</hi>
               </item>
               <item>We shall be rais'd in the likeness of Christ.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These two Propositions this <hi>Derinder</hi> of all reveal'd truths will say, are alike mysterious to this Man. Whereas the contrary will evidently appear if we but take this Man and teach him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, then he shall perfectly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all that is to be known of that demonstration, and how it is impossible it shou'd be otherwise. But teach him the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and make him as learned as he is capable in the Christian Religion, he shall know nothing more of that Proposition (thô he shall be better convinc'd of the Truth of it) than he did at first hearing. And why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>one</hi> was a truth in nature, within the sphere of his intellectual powers; the <hi>other</hi> is <hi>supernatural</hi> and he can never have any notion of the manner of it, till he has new Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56374:64"/>
or those he already hath are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlarg'd.</p>
            <p>But this matter will clear up farther, if we compare some of the Mysteries of our Religion with those things in Nature which bear the greatest <hi>Analogy</hi> with them, and by which they are represented to us in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>If we say a <hi>Son</hi> is like his Father, we immediately conceive in our Minds the same <hi>Stature, Countenance, Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>Complection;</hi> or the same <hi>Humour, Disposition, natural parts</hi> and <hi>Inclinations,</hi> &amp;c. so that we very well apprehend wherein the <hi>likeness</hi> consists. But when we say <hi>we shall rise in the likeness of Christ,</hi> here we stop and our Thoughts can reach no farther.</p>
            <p>Again when we say one Man is the <hi>Son</hi> of another, we apprehend very well the manner of natural procreation, and how it is he came to be his Father. But when we say <hi>Christ is the Son of</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:56374:64"/>
               <hi>God by an Eternal Generation,</hi> we know nothing of the manner of one Spirits producing another; nor can we tell how he came to be born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin without the concurrence of a Man.</p>
            <p>When we say the Spirit of God hath a real influence upon ours in the <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace,</hi> we know much less of the manner of it, than we do of one Bodies moving another by contact: and we know the Food we eat nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth us by undergoing several altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and then being converted into the substance of our Bodies; but we can't know thus much of the manner how Grace administers strength and comfort to our Souls.</p>
            <p>Again we know of <hi>time</hi> that it is <hi>finite</hi> and successive, and we can mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it in certain proportions by the motions of the heavenly Bodies. But as for <hi>Eternity,</hi> for want of a clear Idea we frame a notion of it from time, and thus by a limited thought we do
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56374:65"/>
little less then destroy it's <hi>Being.</hi> For as for saying it is a <hi>perpetual Now,</hi> thô it be the <hi>prettiest</hi> thought we have of it, yet if we attend to this we shall find, we say nothing more than that the same Instant shall remain for ever; and thus attribute that succession to one Instant of time abstractedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, which we us'd to attribute to things which exist in it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is as gross a description of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as a flying Boy is of an Angel.</p>
            <p>And yet it is very pleasant to hear how this man talks of it. It is no more <hi>above</hi> our Reason because we can't apprehend it, than a Circle is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we may. But why? because Reason goes as far as it can in both. The <hi>Circle</hi> is to be imagin'd, but Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is not essentially imaginable; if it were, Reason wou'd have it as well as the Circle, yes that it wou'd: but you wou'd not have Reason to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>thing that is not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? And yet but a few lines after he will make us imagine it in his next Book as perfectly as that 3 and 2 make 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:56374:65"/>But this is a strange <hi>Circle</hi> in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to prove that <hi>Eternity</hi> is <hi>not above our Reason, because it is.</hi> And you see the cause of this blunder is, because he confounds <hi>Idea</hi> with <hi>Imagination,</hi> one of the best distinctions we are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the modern Logicians for. 'Tis plain there are many things we have <hi>Idea's</hi> of, which we are not able to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and Eternity is one of them. And because we can't frame any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of it; it doth not follow that we can't apprehend it at all, for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can frame an Idea of it as it doth of the other things of another life (<hi>i. e.</hi>) by <hi>Analogy,</hi> and for this reason it is more a Mystery than a Circle which we perfectly imagine.</p>
            <p>Once more, thô the <hi>Essence of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> lies hid from us, as well as that of a Spirit, yet we know much more of it's properties, as that it hath <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Extension, Solidity, Impenetrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Divisibility;</hi> and this <hi>Table on which I write</hi> thô I can't actually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56374:66"/>
it into infinite parts, yet I can carry it on in my Mind, and conceive it divisible. Now these are <hi>properties</hi> of matter which agree to it in general, and are not meer <hi>modifications</hi> of it. But we know no more of a <hi>Spirit</hi> but that it thinks (<hi>i. e.</hi>) just enough to prove it's <hi>Existence,</hi> and no more; for as to all the different <hi>modifications</hi> of Thought, it is but thinking still; and therefore is answerable but to that one property of <hi>Extension</hi> in matter.</p>
            <p>Besides we don't attribute this of <hi>Thinking</hi> immediately and positively to a Spirit; for we don't say a Spirit thinks because we know so much of the real nature of it as to discover this: but we say it thinks because we can prove that matter can't.</p>
            <p>Now when I say the Idea we have of a Spirit is not <hi>positive,</hi> I mean that it is not so in respect of our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; because we have no way of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing it to a Spirit, but by a <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it to matter. I must confess if we take a <hi>Spirit</hi> in the sense that some men do (<hi>i. e.</hi>) only for a <hi>Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Being,</hi> then indeed we come to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56374:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the notion of it by <hi>Reflection;</hi> we find something in us that Thinks, and from thence we immediately attribute it to that <hi>Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for any thing that is yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, this Thinking Being may be meer matter; and when we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to infer the existence of an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material</hi> substance (which is the true notion of a Spirit, as it is distinguish'd from matter, and in which sence God is said to be a Spirit) then the Idea we have of it, is as far from being posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as the words by which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it. Then we have no other way of conceiving it, but by removing from it <hi>Extension, Divisibility, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi> &amp;c. which are the properties of Body: and we conclude that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in us that thinks must be imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, because this operation exceeds the power of meer matter, <hi>i. e.</hi> while it is such; for if God shou'd alter all the <hi>properties</hi> of it, so as to make it <hi>something else,</hi> and not matter, then no one can deny but it may think; but how far this implies a contradiction I shall not now dispute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:56374:67"/>So that again I can't but wonder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one shou'd affirm positively, that we have as clear and distinct Idea's of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of Spirit, as we have of Body.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Lock's</hi> Notion of the <hi>Soul</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Letter to the Bp. of <hi>Worces:</hi> P. 69, 70, 71.</note> that of a <hi>thinking substance</hi> without any regard either to the <hi>materiality,</hi> or <hi>immateriality</hi> of it; tho' one wou'd think he inclines to the former, when he shews this to be the sence of the word <hi>Spirit</hi> both in Prophane and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authors. However he says after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that the utmost <hi>Proof</hi> we can have for the immateriality of it will amount only to a <hi>Probability;</hi> and thus much concerning it he thinks deducible from his Principles, and particularly from his supposition of a <hi>System of matter;</hi> and adds that he would gladly see a better proof of it either from the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> or any one else. To speak to this now wou'd be no other then a digression from the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I am upon, but I do not dispair of giving him this <hi>Demonstration</hi> which he wou'd so gladly see; and shewing him

            <p>But to return, it is Evident from what hath been said, that we are so far from forming any Idea of Spirit as clear and distinct as that we have of matter, that we can't form a simple Idea of any property in it, which is positive in respect of our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and therefore since <hi>simple Idea's</hi> are the foundation of all our knowledg as they are laid down by that <hi>Delicate</hi> and <hi>Curious Head,</hi> which this man of <hi>Forehead</hi> only has so grossly mistaken;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56374:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that defect in the first principles shall run through all our after Reasonings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the real nature of it, and render them much more <hi>confus'd</hi> &amp; <hi>imperfect</hi> than those concerning matter.</p>
            <p>I might say the same of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Glorified Body,</hi> that we can frame no Idea of it, but by <hi>negation</hi> of those imperfections that are incident to us in this frail condition of mortality, and those few passages related of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Body after his resurrecton, are wholy unaccountable by us; at least much more than the ordinary appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Nature; as particularly his <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing out of their sight all of a sodain; and appearing in the midst of them, at a time when the doors were shut,</hi> &amp;c. and that these things were not any miraculous operations, but the real properties of a glorifi'd Body, is more likely to think; than that he shou'd have rarify'd the <hi>Door,</hi> or the <hi>Walls of the House</hi> to get entrance; or have secretly convey'd himself along with them, as some learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men have endeavour'd to solve
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56374:68"/>
these passages. Nor can we conceive how a body shou'd be divested of it's gravity, so as to mount the Skies as our Saviour's did at his ascension, and as the Bodies of the Saints shall do at the general resurrection. None of these things are to be solv'd upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles of knowledge that are in us now, because we have not capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties suitable to the nature of them.</p>
            <p>So that now we may wonder what ridiculous meaning this man can have, when he says that all the things which are spoke of in the Gospel, are as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with our <hi>common notions</hi> as <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Stone;</hi> and that we are as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to <hi>comprehend</hi> them; and that our Idea's of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> things are equally clear and distinct. A strange fallacious inference this, <hi>because we fully comprehend neither, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are equally ignorant of both.</hi> And to amuse people that can't see this, that he might seem to speak something to the purpose, he borrows a distinction. <hi>viz.</hi> That between the <hi>Nominal</hi> and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56374:69"/>
               <hi>Real Essence</hi> of a thing. How imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently he hath made use of it in this matter, is very plain from what has been said; which thô we grant it to be a good one, yet it is nothing to the purpose. But it is so far from being a good <hi>Distinction,</hi> that it seems to me not to be good Sence. For nothing can be more absurd than to suppose <hi>two different Essences</hi> in the same thing. Nor can any thing be more directly level'd at those glorious Attributes of God, his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> than what it supposes, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are thus deceiv'd in every thing, and know nothing at all of the true nature of things by those properties that are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable by us. And therefore to use his own words, <hi>This rather becomes Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors to</hi> think, <hi>than the tought of God who hath no interest to delude his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor wants ability to inform them rightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it had been said in plain language, that there is something in natural things <hi>we do apprehend,</hi> and something <hi>we do not;</hi> which means all in that distinction: This wou'd have been Philosophy for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56374:69"/>
the Vulgar; and therefore to make a Mystery of it, it must be call'd the <hi>Nominal</hi> and <hi>Real Essence</hi> of a thing: thô it carry a flat contradiction in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,</hi> and a monstrous consequence in <hi>Morality,</hi> and lays a foundation for Eternal Scepticisme. But supposing there is a meaning in it both <hi>true</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> yet it must be own'd this was the most unhappy way of expressing themselves, that possibly they could have light upon.</p>
            <p>Thus far as to his arguments from<note place="margin">Sect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. C. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Reason.</hi> Now I come to consider those he brings from <hi>Scripture:</hi> and we are like to have very close reasoning from them, when in the very entrance he again confounds these two Propositions. <hi>Whether or no Christianity is Misterious,</hi> and <hi>whether there are no Misteries in</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 90.</note> 
               <hi>Christianity.</hi> Whereas even the latter of them is dubious; for the word <hi>Mystery</hi> is us'd to signify several things. And therefore to remove all ambiguity, and shew the fallacy of his arguing we will lay aside the <hi>Word,</hi> and speak to the <hi>thing it self, (i. e.) Whether we have</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:56374:70"/>
               <hi>not as clear and distinct Idea's, as full and perfect a knowledge of all things reveal'd to us in Scripture, since the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Christ in the World, as we have of ordinary sensible Objects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we had not before he allows, and therefore he grants they were Mysteries then, but now since the coming of Christ they are not. And the whole substance of his arguing in this long Chapter is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If all those things which were signified by the Jewish Rites and Ceremonies are clearly reveal'd to us, then they are no longer hidden from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But all those things signified by the Jewish Rites and Ceremonies are clearly reveal'd to us. </hi>Therefore</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are no longer hidden from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he proves the Minor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Vail is taken away in Christ then they are clearly reveal'd to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Vail is taken away in Christ.</hi> Therefore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are clearly reveal'd to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56374:70"/>And to make this Minor good, he brings all these <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture, and <hi>Quotations</hi> out of the Fathers; to prove that the Vail is taken away, and that they are clearly reveald.</p>
            <p>Now if any amongst us had absolutely deny'd that the Vail was taken away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had affirm'd that they were not plainly reveal'd to us, then he might have had an <hi>adversary:</hi> But there is not a sentence in this Chapter, that looks like a controversy with any but the <hi>Jews.</hi> If this man wou'd have <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd</hi> instead of <hi>Bantring;</hi> he wou'd have distinguisht, and shewn in what sence we <hi>deny it,</hi> and then have prov'd that the Vail was taken away in that sence that we deny. And therefore since he hath dealt <hi>treacherously,</hi> I must make him <hi>honest,</hi> and <hi>distinguish</hi> for him.</p>
            <p>And in order to make this matter very plain, we know that there are four things to be reveal'd concerning any thing that is hid from us. It's <hi>Existence,</hi> it's <hi>Essence,</hi> it's <hi>Properties,</hi> and the <hi>Relation</hi> it hath to us; and every one apprehends at first reading
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56374:71"/>
how a thing may be clearly reveal'd as to it's <hi>Existence,</hi> together with the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it hath to us, and yet remain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally obscur'd as to it's <hi>Essence</hi> &amp; <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> Now therefore what we say is this.</p>
            <p>1. That as to the <hi>internal Essence,</hi> and <hi>real Properties of</hi> these divine things reveald to us from Heaven, we are wholly ignorant of them; and know as little of them in this respect now they are reveal'd in the Gospel, as was known before when they were involv'd in <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That all these things which we call <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and now reveal'd to us in the Gospel, while they were vail'd in Types and Figures under the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saik oeconomy, were very much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scur'd as to their <hi>Existence,</hi> and as to the <hi>concernment of mankind in them;</hi> and therefore the Law is said to have had only a shadow of good things to come, <hi>i e.</hi> Men had but a very dark &amp; imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledg even of the <hi>reality,</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> and <hi>signification</hi> of those things. As of the <hi>Eternal generation of the Son,</hi> his <hi>Incarnation, Crucifixion, Ascention,</hi> the <hi>Trinity of Persons, Resurrection</hi> and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56374:71"/>
               <hi>Glorification</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>Operations of the Holy Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> They had then no clear and certain knowledg of the <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>existence</hi> of any of these things afterwards reveal'd in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, excepting only that of the <hi>Being</hi> of the true God, which was reveal'd to them by <hi>Moses</hi> under the name I AM, which denoted nothing more than his existence.</p>
            <p>3. We say that these divine things, which were hidden and obscur'd before the appearing of Christ, were all of them plainly and clearly reveal'd as to their <hi>Existence</hi> and as to the <hi>Relation</hi> they have to us, (<hi>i e.</hi>) as to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and being of these truths, and our concernment in them. And yet they do not cease to be <hi>Mysteries</hi> still, because they are still infinitely more obscur'd as to their <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> than the common objects of nature. So that now it is clearly reveal'd to us that <hi>Christ is the Son of God,</hi> yet it doth not follow that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we know as much of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that <hi>Eternal Generation</hi> of the Son, as we doe how one Man
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56374:72"/>
is said to be the Son of another. Because it is reveal'd to us that there are endless <hi>Joys in Heaven,</hi> it doth not follow that we know as much of them as we do of <hi>sensual pleasures.</hi> Because it is clearly reveal'd to us that we shall be rais'd at the last day, in the glorious <hi>likeness</hi> of Christ; it doth not follow that we know as well what this Glory will be, as we know what it is to be of a <hi>Fair</hi> and <hi>Beautiful Complection;</hi> and so in all the rest.</p>
            <p>And this is the reason of those seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly opposite expressions of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the one in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. where speaking of the <hi>Clearness</hi> of the Gospel, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the <hi>Obscurity</hi> of the Law he says, <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a Glass the glory of the Lord.</hi> And yet in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 12. speaking of this same <hi>present state</hi> of the Gospel, in opposition to our <hi>future state</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he says, <hi>That now we see through a Glass darkly, but then Face to Face.</hi> By the first he denotes the clearness of the Revelation as to the <hi>Existence,</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of those things now under
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56374:72"/>
the Gospel: by the latter, he denotes the present obscurity of them, as to their <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Properties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be objected here that thus they are but <hi>Types</hi> still, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the things contain'd in the Jewish Rites and Ceremonies, are as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd <hi>now,</hi> as they were <hi>before.</hi> But whosoever makes this Objection can't but know these two things to be true which I contend for, however we are able to reconcile them, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>That those things signified by Jewish Rites and Ceremonies since the coming of Christ are more clearly reveal'd to us than they were before.</hi> And 2. <hi>That now they are more clearly reveal'd to us, yet we have no Idea's of the real Nature or Properties of them,</hi> which I have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prov'd. Whosoever allows these two things, must be of my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whether I were able to answer this objection or no. But it is easy for any one to apprehend, that when I say the <hi>Idea's</hi> we have of the things of another World, are no other than a sort of <hi>Types</hi> or <hi>Figures;</hi> I don't take them in the strictest sence of the Words,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56374:73"/>
as they are applied to Jewish Rites and Ceremonies; which were all of them actions conversant about <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Objects,</hi> and design'd to represent some <hi>divine transaction</hi> which was to have it's completion in this life; and even then was to have a farther refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to something intended by it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World. But my meaning is, that the best notion we can frame of a Divine Object, represents nothing of the real nature of the thing to us as it is in it self; if any one finds fault with the <hi>word,</hi> let them call them by what other name they please, since it is plain they must allow the <hi>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now he sees, if he was really blind before, in <hi>what Sence this Vail is remov'd,</hi> and in what sence we affirm it to remain. and if he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self able to do it, instead of proving <hi>operosely</hi> what no man denies, <hi>that the Vail is taken away in Christ;</hi> let him prove the truth of it in that sence which we deny, <hi>viz. That it is taken away, not only as to the Reality, and Existence, and Intent, of the things reveal'd</hi> which
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56374:73"/>
we allow; but <hi>as to the Manner and Properties of them,</hi> so that now we have as perfect a notion and compre hensive a knowledg of them, as we have of the Manner and Properties of any thing in nature; or in his own can't, <hi>that we have as clear and distinct Idea's of them as of any sensible Objects.</hi> As for instance <hi>Jonas</hi>'s being in the Whales belly, was a Type of our Saviours <hi>Burial</hi> and <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and therefore now this is reveal'd he must make it out, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more mysterious in our Saviours <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection,</hi> than in a mans being carried into a Vault, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out again upon his leggs. The feast of the <hi>Passover</hi> was a Type of Christ, and represented the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and this now is but a Type of the joys of Heaven, as our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self makes it by those words, <hi>Hence</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 26. 27.</note> 
               <hi>forth I shall not drink of this fruit of the Vine, till I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom.</hi> But this man must shew us the real nature of those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which are here signified by <hi>the Fruit of the Vine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:56374:74"/>And now that it appears what he was to have prov'd; to save me the labour of transcribing, do but look over eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Text</hi> he hath quoted by way of <hi>Proof,</hi> and try to make his inference from it, and then you will be satisfied that <hi>Quaker,</hi> or any other <hi>Enthusiast</hi> never apply'd Scripture so <hi>impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Do but apply this distinction of a thing's being reveal'd as <hi>to it's Existence and Design,</hi> and the <hi>Relation</hi> it hath to us only; or <hi>as to the manner and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the thing it self,</hi> and then the little fallacy will appear which runs through his application of them all. I shall only instance in the two or three first.</p>
            <p>1. Cor: 2, 7, 8. <hi>We speak the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 90.</note> 
               <hi>of God hid in a Mystery, which God ordain'd before the World for our glory, which none of the Princes of this World knew,</hi> from whence he makes this inference, <hi>viz.</hi> That this divine Wisdom was then a Mystery for want of revealing Information. Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56374:74"/>
it? and to confirm this he adds the following words. <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into the heart of Man the things which God hath prepar'd for them that love him; but God hath reveal'd them to us by his Spirit,</hi> which proves no more than what every body owns, <hi>That it was impossible by strength of Reason to have attain'd to the knowledg of those means, which God had appointed for our Salvation,</hi> and now they are reveal'd it is only as to the truth and reality of their existence, as to their Intent, and the Relation they have to us; and not as to the Manner and Properties of them.</p>
            <p>The things here spoke of which cou'd not have enter'd into the heart of Man, were the <hi>Incarnation of the Son,</hi> and <hi>the Descent of the Holy Ghost;</hi> which were the contrivances of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdom for the restoration of fallen Man; and this was what the wisest heads among us cou'd never have thought of. These things were obscur'd in Jewish Types and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and at length God reveal'd it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56374:75"/>
clearly to us, that those were the means he had appointed for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Now the inference this man must make, if he wou'd speak to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is, <hi>That therefore we now know as perfectly the manner of that conception wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost in a pure Virgin, as of the ordinary way of Generation;</hi> and because it is reveal'd to us that the Holy Ghost works in us, therefore we must know the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it as perfectly, as we do that of the nourishment of our Bodies by meat and drink.</p>

            <p>When we thus contend for the use of <hi>Reason</hi> in Religion, then on one side we are charg'd as if we deni'd all <hi>Revelation,</hi> and when we defend the truth of <hi>Revelation,</hi> then on the other side we are charg'd with laying aside our <hi>Reason;</hi> as if we must needs cease to be <hi>Men,</hi> before we can be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And therefore I shall state a right notion of this matter as clear as I can in short; and that by these degrees.</p>
            <p>1. We allow that <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> are the only faculties we have of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or judging of any thing either in <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Religion;</hi> and we allow that God in all his <hi>Revelations</hi> applies himself to us by these faculties; and doth not either create any <hi>new</hi> ones, or make any essential alteration in these we have; for then a Stock or a Stone wou'd be as capable of a Divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> as a <hi>Rational Creature.</hi> And therefore</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56374:78"/>2. We allow that what is not agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to these <hi>Powers</hi> of knowledg we are already endued with, is not to be receiv'd or entertain'd by us; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise God who plac'd these in us, wou'd not be consistent with himself, nor wou'd he have us so.</p>
            <p>3. These <hi>Powers</hi> of knowledg are better suited to the present objects of this life than they are to those of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for otherwise we argue God of want of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Contrivance,</hi> and if they were now as well fitted for the Objects of another life, there wou'd be no occasion for a change at the last day.</p>
            <p>4. We affirm that all the things of another World, even after they are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd</hi> are totally obscur'd both from our <hi>Senses</hi> and our <hi>Reason</hi> as to the <hi>real</hi> Nature and Properties of them as they are in themselves. And this I hope I have sufficiently made out; so that if People will believe any thing at all of another life, they must do so without clear and distinct Idea's of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:56374:79"/>5. That since we have not <hi>capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> for them, there is no other way of revealing any thing to us relating to another life, but by <hi>Analogy</hi> with the things of this World. Thus the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Intellectual</hi> Light of Heaven, is reveal'd under the notion of that we have from the <hi>Sun;</hi> the <hi>Generation</hi> of the Son of God, under the notion of one Man's proceeding from the Lions of another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now therefore let me again distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish these two things in every <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> or <hi>Mystery.</hi> 1. That <hi>Analogous</hi> object of this life, under the notion of which God doth reveal any thing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother life to us. And 2. The <hi>Thing</hi> it self that is signified by it. As to the first of these it falls in all respects under the severest censure and trial of our Reason, as to the latter it is wholly exempted from it. As for instance in this Proposition,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Saints shall reign for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:56374:79"/>In this <hi>Mystery</hi> the thing reveal'd is the happy and glorious state of the Saints in Heaven. The <hi>Analogous</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject made use of by God for this, is that of the <hi>Splendour</hi> and <hi>Grandure</hi> of a Kingdom. In respect of this latter our Reason hath full scope and 'tis not only <hi>lawful</hi> but <hi>commendable,</hi> nay our <hi>duty</hi> to be very punctual and exact in our Scrutiny. And therefore we must know the <hi>meaning</hi> of the words, and understand the <hi>matter</hi> of the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we must be satisfied that it hath no impossibility or contradiction in it. Nay more, our <hi>Reason</hi> must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, and we must have a clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our mind, of it's coming from God by such <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ofs</hi> to Mens <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of it's divinity, as shall convince us that it could come from none but God; such as <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Prophecies,</hi> or the agreableness of the thing to our common <hi>Notions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and I am not to give my assent to it unless I have this <hi>Evidence,</hi> which I allow thus far to be the ground of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion. Thus far we are ready to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56374:80"/>
joyn issue with any Adversary of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> purely upon the principles of Reason. And to require it any farther is no other than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a <hi>rational account</hi> from us, of what we grant we have no notion of.</p>
            <p>God never requires our <hi>Assent</hi> to any Proposition, but upon such testimonies and proof as shall cause this Evidence. But as to the thing it self which is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by this analogy, as the <hi>real state</hi> and condition of the blest in Heaven is in this Mystery, it is wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the enquiry of <hi>Reason.</hi> And herein is my <hi>Faith</hi> that I give my assent to a proposition which is sufficiently prov'd to come from God, thô I have no notion at all of that divine truth which is represented to me under the <hi>similitude</hi> of some world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Object.</p>
            <p>And thus you see how <hi>Faith</hi> is nicely and most exactly defin'd. The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> demonstration of things not seen, because <hi>Faith</hi> is no such <hi>precarious implicite</hi> assent, as these Champions for Reason think, but it is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56374:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the giving our <hi>assent</hi> to things which thô we have no notion at all of now, yet the <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>existence</hi> of them are demonstrated to us by such proofs as raise up in our minds the greatest degree of Evidence for the truth of the Relation. And it is this that will strike all these Opposers of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> dumb, when they appear at the Tribunal of God; because they will not then have it to say, that God requir'd their assent to any proposition, but what they understood as well as they could understand any thing in this World. And for the <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> of which, they had sufficient proofs (if they did but consider them) to raise up in their minds an <hi>Evidence</hi> as clear and distinct as they can have of any thing in this World.</p>
            <p>And thus he sees how groundless all those Objections are, and malicious Insinuations against us and our most holy <hi>Faith;</hi> as if we in any point of it declin'd the strictest examination of Reason. We are so far from distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56374:81"/>
our cause, or obliging men to walk blindfold, that we give their <hi>Reason</hi> all the helps we can; and men are never better dispos'd for the belief of our <hi>Christian Mysteries</hi> than when they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the guidance and conduct of it. For our whole Christian Faith is grounded upon the <hi>strictest Retiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore having stated the true extent of <hi>Reason</hi> in the Mysteries of Religion, I shall now proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider<note place="margin">P. 126.</note> his <hi>Friend's</hi> objection against his Book, <hi>viz. That it destroys the nature of</hi> FAITH. A shrewd objection it is, and that which he never will evade, thô he had the wisdom of the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to help him. And that person whosoever he was wou'd have been more his <hi>Friend,</hi> if he had in time opened to him all the other false and impious consequences of his Book; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came abroad to <hi>spread infection,</hi> and <hi>blast</hi> the credit of the Christian <hi>Faith.</hi> But now alas! it is too late, for nothing is so vain as a man of some
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56374:81"/>
               <hi>parts,</hi> where there is not a true sence of Piety to qualify them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is now to stand by it with his <hi>Soul,</hi> and venture <hi>Damnation</hi> rather than lessen himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by a publick <hi>Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> in the opinion of a <hi>half learned</hi> and <hi>debauch'd</hi> sort of people, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest it is to run down that <hi>Institution,</hi> which if it be true must rise up in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against them at the last day.<note place="margin">P. 126.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The force of the objection lies in this. If we can give our assent to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what we have a clear and distinct Idea of in the Mind, so as to believe nothing upon the <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Veracity</hi> of another person, then there can be no <hi>Assent</hi> distinct from <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> and thus there can be no <hi>Faith</hi> either <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Human.</hi> For if a man of whose sincerity you are throughly convinc'd, shou'd tell you <hi>That there are a sort of people in the Indie's, who scourge their Idols severely, when any thing goes cross to their expectations,</hi> it is impossible for you to believe this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you see it. For thô you know the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56374:82"/>
meaning of the words, and apprehend clearly what an Idol is, and what it is to scourge it; yet if the relations of ten thousand People, and ever so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumstances concur'd to the truth of it, yet you can never give your as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it upon any other terms than he did who saw it, for nothing else can give you this evidence or knowledg of the truth and reality of it, which he makes the only ground of our perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</p>
            <p>And then if we can't give our assent even to the Reality and Existence of any thing, but when we have clear and distinct Idea's of the <hi>real modes</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of it as it is in it self,</hi> then we can believe nothing either of God or of any thing relating to another World; For I have made it sufficiently appear that it is utterly impossible for us now to have such Idea's of them. Therefore now let us see how he endeavours to get over this. My <hi>Reader</hi> thinks, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that he is going about to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> with his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:56374:82"/>
But instead of this, he spends sixteen pages in shewing you there is no such thing as Faith; as you will see plainly. I shall take him in order, and answer every Paragraph because this is the most plausible part of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry.</p>
            <p>First he tell's us that to be confident<note place="margin">P. 127</note> of any thing without conceiving it, is no <hi>Real Faith</hi> or <hi>Perswasion;</hi> but a rash <hi>Presumption,</hi> and an obstinate <hi>Prejudice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he means by not conceiving it, <hi>not understanding the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position reveal'd,</hi> he is in the right of it; but if he means by conceiving it <hi>the having as full and compleat a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the thing reveal'd, as we have of any Phenomena of nature,</hi> 'tis abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely false; for as I have shewn at large, we may give our assent to the <hi>Existence</hi> of things when we can't conceive any thing at all of their <hi>real nature:</hi> And that our <hi>Christian Faith</hi> is however no <hi>rash Presumption</hi> or <hi>obstinate Prejudice,</hi> because it is founded upon sufficient
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56374:83"/>
testimonies of the truth and reality of the propositions believ'd, in things whereof we have clear and distinct Idea's.</p>
            <p>This is the thing he drives at, <hi>viz.</hi> that we have a full and compleat know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the things believ'd; and to make it plausible he says that God hath no interest to <hi>delude</hi> his Creatures, nor wants ability to inform them. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rgo</hi> he reveals nothing but what he makes them perfectly <hi>comprehend.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath not reveal'd any thing of the eternal <hi>Generation,</hi> of the Son, the <hi>change</hi> of our Bodies, the <hi>Joys</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of the <hi>operations</hi> of the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because if God had reveal'd them, he wou'd have made you conceive the manner of all these perfectly; and if he did not, it was certainly want of sincerity or ability in him. But let this <hi>Blasphemer</hi> know, that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want of <hi>Veracity,</hi> nor <hi>Ability</hi> in God that is the reason why we don't conceive these things, but the <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Imperfection</hi> of our present <hi>state,</hi> who have no capacities for them as yet. And therefore as we now give
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56374:83"/>
our assent to the Reality and Existence of what we can't conceive, upon that veracity of God which he hath thus endeavour'd to rob of all it's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Influence upon our assent; so God will one day manifest his <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> in bringing all those things to pass, which we can't now conceive; and will so enlarge our Souls that we shall clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend them, and all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of another World. He proceeds and says that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God wou'd loose his end if what he said</hi>

               </gap> God shou'd speak <hi>Nonsence</hi> to you in his <hi>Revelations</hi> you wou'd be never the wiser<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to you that a thing call'd <hi>BLIC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRI</hi> had a being in nature, and not inform you what this <hi>Blictri</hi> was, you could not believe it. Now this very Instance which he intends by way of <hi>Ridicule</hi> of all the Objects of our holy <hi>Faith,</hi> doth happily shew the true dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a <hi>rational Assent</hi> and a <hi>blind Credulity;</hi> and is a sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56374:84"/>
of his whole Book. Let us therefore compare these two words <hi>BLICTRI,</hi> and <hi>GLORY.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the first I know nothing more than that it is made up of seven Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and therefore he that speaks it is a <hi>Barbarian</hi> to me. And as I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, so I can believe nothing concerning it, but the uncertain found it makes to my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t; and that seven Letters makes two Syllables in writing</p>
            <p>As to the other word <hi>Glory,</hi> I grant I know as little of the real nature of the Glory of God, and of the Saints in Heaven, as I do what that <hi>Blictri</hi> means; and yet God doth not speak <hi>Nonsence,</hi> when he reveals to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that there is such a thing in Heaven as Glory. For 1st. Thô I have no notion of the thing as it is in it self, yet it is represented to me by the brightness of the Sun, and Glory of a Kingdom, the greatest I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages I now am able to frame of it. 2. I am made acquainted with the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> this <hi>Glory</hi> hath to me, <hi>viz. That it expects me in the Heavens,</hi> that I
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56374:84"/>
shall enjoy it, and be made partaker of it; and that it will render me happy beyond all imagination. But I am no more able to conceive that Happiness, than that Glory of God which shall be the cause of it. And 3. It is reveal'd by God with this design that it shou'd be a prevailing motive of my Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and an incitement to the practice of Vertue and Holiness. 4. I have not capacities at present to apprehend the real nature of it as perfectly as I can apprehend any thing in nature if it were discovered to me. And thus we see how God in all his Revelations doth not speak <hi>Nonsence</hi> to us, thô we have not clear and distinct Idea's of the things which are reveal'd. Nay thô we have no more Idea of them as they are in themselves, than we have of what <hi>Blictri</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Besides the Text he brings to back<note place="margin">P. 129.</note> this Sophism of his, explains the matter farther and lays open the Fallacy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 6. <hi>He that comes to God must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is, and that he is a reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:56374:85"/>
               <hi>of them that diligently seek him.</hi> By which we see all that is knowable of God by us now is his <hi>Existence,</hi> and the Relation he hath to us, <hi>viz That he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</hi> For I hope he will own that we are bound to believe all we know of God, thô he flatly denies that we are bound to believe any thing more in him than what we know, as well at least as we do any thing else.</p>
            <p>He goes on and asks, <hi>without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 130.</note> 
               <hi>Faith after this manner,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) without making it nothing else but knowledg, <hi>How could Christ be term'd the light of the World? and how could we be said to have the Spirit of Wisdom?</hi> (<hi>i. e</hi>) unless he gives you as clear and distinct Idea's of every thing he reveals, as you have of a Stock or a Stone. I answer by giving us a clear and distinct Revelation of their <hi>Existence,</hi> of which we should have been wholly ignorant but for him, for thus he hath made us wise unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, since he hath given us a clear
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56374:85"/>
               <hi>knowledg</hi> of our Duty, and back't his <hi>Precepts</hi> with the promise of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which we have no notion of; and the best thought we can frame of them is. That they exceed all that we can think or speak.</p>
            <p>But says he, <hi>That remarkable instance</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 131.</note> 
               <hi>of Abraham's Faith will be objected.</hi> Yes 'tis objected, and the way he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers it, is by saying as we do, and leaving his own Opinion to shift for it self. God promised <hi>Abraham</hi> to give him a numerous Progeny in <hi>Isaac;</hi> after this, before <hi>Isaac</hi> hath a Child, God commands him to sacrifice his only Son; He obeys upon this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God was able to raise him up again, by the same power that he at first rais'd him out of the <hi>deadness</hi> of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Womb. Now the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me, is not <hi>Whether this Faith was a firm Perswasion built upon</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 132.</note> 
               <hi>substantial Reasons,</hi> which we allow and contend for, and therefore he says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose. But the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, <hi>Whether Abraham gave his Assent</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:56374:86"/>
               <hi>to what he was not able to comprehend,</hi> which he must own; unless he proves that <hi>Abraham</hi> knew as perfectly the whole manner of God's raising a Body from the dead, or from a Womb past Child bearing, as he did the procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it in the ordinary way of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Had <hi>Abraham</hi> been able to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate</hi> that God wou'd raise his Son, &amp; to conceive exactly the manner how this was to be brought to pass, then indeed it were no <hi>Faith</hi> but Knowledg; but instead of this he had only the promise of God for it; and knew no more how God wou'd <hi>raise</hi> him, than he knew how he <hi>made</hi> the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this he lays down several <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 133.</note> to prove there can be no such thing as <hi>Faith,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) an assent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from Knowledg.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>If Faith were not a Perswasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting from a comprehension of the thing believ'd, there could be no degrees in it.</hi> I answer this is false like all the rest, for thô I know nothing more of a thing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56374:86"/>
than it's <hi>Existence,</hi> and the Relation it hath to me, and therefore am fat from <hi>comprehending</hi> it; Yet my <hi>assent</hi> to the truth of it, shall vary in degrees ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the Proofs I have for it, or according as I <hi>weigh</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Subject of Faith must be intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 134.</note> 
               <hi>to all, since the belief thereof is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded under no less a penalty than Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Who doubts it? let him if he can produce one proposition we <hi>believe</hi> which is not intelligible. But because we don't fully comprehend the thing spoke of, are we therefore wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any thing relating to it, &amp; must we reject it all as Fallacy &amp; Imposture? If it be said <hi>He that believeth not shall be damn'd, Mark</hi> 16, 16. then what will become of him that takes all this pains to shew there is no such thing as Faith? especially since the Belief there mean't is something plainly distinct from Knowledg. For sure he doth not think the meaning of that text is this, <hi>He that hath not as full and comprehensive a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God and the things reveal'd, as he</hi>

               <hi>hath of any thing in Nature, shall be Damn'd,</hi> which is all his notion of Faith. Again.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56374:88"/>
need they have made them more plain and intelligible. As for the other part of them, they knew as little of it as we do; and therefore we don't <hi>Rail</hi> at them as he doth at all the Clergy, as if they had industriously conceal'd any thing from us which they knew themselves.</p>
            <p>He goes on, '<hi>Tis affirm'd that God hath a right to require the assent of his Creatures to what they can't comprehend.</hi> Yes he has, and accordingly doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. And again I say 'tis <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> to affirm that in this he is guilty of such a <hi>Tyranny</hi> as only becomes the Devil.

And yet he is so far from acting like a <hi>Tyrant</hi> in this, that he acts like a <hi>merciful God,</hi> and a tender <hi>Father.</hi> For he herein condescends to our capacities, and <hi>Reveals</hi> the methods of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

and the future state of Heaven to us, after such a manner as we are able to understand them; and promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that if they have that influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us which he designs, (<hi>i. e</hi>) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and make us <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> and <hi>Holy;</hi> he will at the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our bodies, give us capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to see them clearly as they are in themselves. So that these Mysteries <hi>are to be understood at last,</hi> but not till we come to another World. And therefore God doth not reveal them only to <hi>puzzle our heads,</hi> but for wise and<note place="margin">P. 138.</note> excellent ends, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring mankind to salvation by such <hi>Methods,</hi> as are consistent with the <hi>Freedom</hi> of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>From all these <hi>Observations</hi> he con<note place="margin">P. 139.</note> cludes, <hi>That to give our Assent to any thing above Reason in his sence is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory.</hi> 1. <hi>To the ends of Religion,</hi> whereas I have shewn at large that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this supposition, there can be no Religion at all either natural or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd. 2. <hi>To the nature of man,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56374:89"/>
because no man can believe what he knows nothing of, but this Quibble I have sufficiently remov'd.

            <p>Now after all this pains to shew that<note place="margin">P. 139.</note> there is no such thing as <hi>Faith</hi> distinct from <hi>Knowledg</hi> He says this will be objected against him. He is in the right of it, this will be ever obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cted against him, till he recants his Error publickly.</p>
            <p>But how doth he endeavour to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it? Why. <hi>That knowledg which is the present &amp; immediate view o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a thing is not Faith.</hi> He says well. But what is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith is only the understanding what is believ'd</hi> He will <hi>stand by it</hi> with Soul and Body that Faith is nothing else. That the understanding what is believ'd is necessary in order to Faith no one denies; but any man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sence may see, that this and the other definition are the same; for pray what is understanding <hi>what is believ'd,</hi> but having a present <hi>immediate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it,</hi> unless he will say a man
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56374:90"/>
can't believe a thing till he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got he knew it. That which consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the formal act of <hi>Faith</hi> as it is distinct from Knowledg, is an <hi>Assent upon the Authority of another Person.</hi> But according to him Authority is no ground of Perswasion, and Faith is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the understanding what is believ'd, Therefore there can be no such thing as any <hi>Assent</hi> distinct from <hi>Knowledg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now have I done this man any <hi>Wrong,</hi> by charging him with endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>destroy</hi> the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Gospel, and to overthrow the whole <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> In the face of a Christian Government, and in <hi>Defiance</hi> of all Laws and Power <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil;</hi> He tells them plainly that <hi>Faith</hi> is nothing more than understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is beliv'd (<hi>i. e.</hi>) there is no such thing as Faith distinct from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; and consequently the <hi>Faith</hi> of Christians is nothing but <hi>Implicite</hi> Assent and blind <hi>Credulity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore here again I wou'd deliver him into the hands of the Magistrate, not mov'd by any heat of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56374:90"/>
passion but by such a <hi>Zeal</hi> as becomes every Christian to have for his <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here he pleads a <hi>Toleration,</hi> but<note place="margin">P. 110.</note> for what? I hope there is no Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Blasphemy and Prophaness; and thô men are allow'd to believe what they please themselves, yet sure they may be restrain'd from industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously spreading such Impious Notions as are destructive of all <hi>Religion,</hi> and from openly reviling the Christian Faith as <hi>Imposture</hi> and <hi>Implicite blind Credulity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again 'tis objected against him <hi>That</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 140.</note> 
               <hi>his notions of Faith makes Revelation useless.</hi> Yes it doth, for thô we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Words</hi> of the Proposition reveal'd ever so well, and comprehend the thing spoke of as fully as we do a Stock or a Stone; yet we can never give our assent to the truth of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> because that after all is done we must take this upon the Word of another. But much more doth it make all the <hi>Revelations</hi> of the Gospel <hi>useless,</hi> because we have no clear and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56374:91"/>
distinct Idea's of them, and therefore must utterly reject them all upon this score likewise.</p>
            <p>But in opposition to all that can be said, this <hi>Positive Man</hi> asserts here, what he hath been <hi>Asserting</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Book, but gives no reason for; <hi>That Revelation is only of use to inform us, whilst the Evidence of it's subject perswades us. Then reply we,</hi> if so you must believe all Relations true or false indifferently, when you understand the meaning of the Words, and know the nature of the thing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. Nay if two contrary Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions equally intelligible be related he must believe them both.</p>
            <p>And therefore now I hope he won't take it ill of the World, if they believe me when I inform them, that this Book which goes under his name, was the <hi>joint Endeavours</hi> of a secret Club, who set themselves with a great deal of Industry to destroy all <hi>Reveal'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> And that they have made use of this Man as a <hi>Tool</hi> only, and have
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56374:91"/>
pusht him before them, to try with what safety such <hi>Principles</hi> as these may be openly avow'd in opposition to all that is establish't among us; that they might follow and openly maintain what they have been forging in secret Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals.</p>
            <p>Now this is a matter of Fact, and whosoever reads this must believe it, because they understand the meaning of the Words and know the nature of every thing that is spoke of in them; <hi>for Faith is nothing else but understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what is believ'd,</hi> and if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand<note place="margin">P. 139.</note> what is spoke of they must bow before the Light and Majesty of this knowledg. And therefore I hope he will never contradict me in this or any thing else I relate of him; for if he says the contrary then either the World must believe us both when we relate two contrary Propositions or they must be sway'd one way or the other by his <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Mine;</hi> and whether they believe him or me it will sufficiently confute him, for it will shew that Authority may be a ground
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56374:92"/>
of Perswasion as well as a means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. If they believe neither of us, then it will appear they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a necessity of bowing before the Light and Majesty of that <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> he contends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or in all relations.</p>
            <p>The last objection he raises against this Principle of his, is that passage, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 12. Where there is this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>Which things the Angels desire to look into.</hi> The things spoken o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> here are the methods of our Salvation by the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of God, and <hi>Descent</hi> of the Holy Ghost. and 'tis said in the <hi>time present</hi> that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <hi>Desire</hi> to look into them. And I think it a natural inference from hence, that these things yet are Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries even to them in a great degree; which we need not much wonder at when they don't so much as know when the day of <hi>Judgment</hi> will be, and therefore we may the less wonder they are Mysteries to us.</p>
            <p>But we will suppose that this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is mean't of the time past. And
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56374:92"/>
then let me ask him these two Ques<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning it.</p>
            <p>1. Whether the Angels did believe those things they are said to enquire into, or no? if they did believe them, then we find 'tis very possible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve things that we can't comprehend; for if the Angels understood them fully when they believ'd, why shou'd they desire to search into them?</p>
            <p>2. Whether, now these things are come to pass, he will assert that we have as full and comprehensive a knowledg of them all as the Angels have. If we have not, then we may believe things we do not comprehend. If we have, then there is no difference between ours and the state of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, at least in respect of knowledge.</p>
            <p>The last <hi>Objection</hi> he brings against<note place="margin">C. 5. P. 144.</note> his own Principles is <hi>That which is drawn from the consideration of Miracles.</hi> And this likewise is so strong an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against him, that the very supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56374:93"/>
of one true Miracle wrought in confirmation of any point of Doctrine, quite overthrows his whole Book. For</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>thing it self</hi> is in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <hi>Mysterious,</hi> and therefore if he will allow these things related of our Saviour to be true Miracles, he must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low there are Mysteries in Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

And 1. The <hi>substance of the thing perform'd</hi> we grant must be very Intelligible and Possible, for as he says <hi>Contradiction is only another word for Impossible or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> 2. The <hi>manner</hi> of performing it, which is totally obscur'd from us, and lies out of the reach of all our Capacities. As to instance in that Miracle of our Saviours <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ding five</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:56374:93"/>
               <hi>thousand People with five Loaves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> We understand very well what it is, for a great number of men to eat and be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; and what it is for a small quantity of Bread to be encreas'd to a mighty bulk: but as to the manner how this was perform'd, we are wholly ignorant of it, thô we know well how Corn is encreas'd in the ordinary way of nature.</p>
            <p>But he will object here as he did concerning the <hi>Doctrines,</hi> viz. That at this rate <hi>All the Phenomena of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> are miraculous, for we know not the true manner of any one of them. And this is the main drift of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to give us a wrong notion of a <hi>Miracle,</hi> viz. That it is nothing more<note place="margin">P. 150.</note> than the dextrous management of second causes, and not any immediate effect of Almighty God; and therefore in the close he tells us <hi>That Miracles are wrought according to the laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thô above it's ordinary operations, which are therefore supernaturally assisted.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this is the reason of that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56374:94"/>
bold and arrogant expression of his, <hi>That could he tell how a Miracle was wrought, he believes he might do as much himself.</hi> For there is nothing more in it than in a Chymical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and if he were <hi>Philosopher</hi> enough, he would work any Miracle of them all.</p>
            <p>But the true notion of a <hi>Miracle</hi> is, that it is <hi>An operation wrought by the immediate power of God, not by Assisting only, but Over-ruling the laws of Nature;</hi> not only by <hi>hastning</hi> and <hi>accelerating</hi> it's Operations, but sometimes by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantaneous production, of what was never to be effected by the united force of all natural causes. As to instance in the <hi>Raising a Body from the Dead,</hi> all the united force of nature with the most dextrous management, wou'd not be able to effect this; all the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tracting, Mollifying, Mixing, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing, Consolidating,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the ministry not only of Thousands but of Millions at once</hi> wou'd not be able to unite a Soul and Body again, when
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56374:94"/>
once they are seperated: nothing less than the Almighty immediate act of God is able to effect this, and that without the concurrence of any natural cause.</p>
            <p>Again, there are some <hi>Miraculous Operations</hi> which are so far from being <hi>according</hi> to the laws of nature, that they are <hi>contrary</hi> to them. As that of the Sun's going back or standing still, all the laws of nature are dispos'd for it's motion, or at least for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Earth which makes it seem to us to move.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>The making Iron to swim</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.

               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:56374:95"/>
piece of <hi>Iron</hi> while it remains such, to swim in Water no way condens'd, this is not only above but contrary to the laws of nature.</p>
            <p>And so likewise for <hi>Fire</hi> not to burn, is contrary to nature. Indeed if there were nothing more in it than what this man supposes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is don <hi>by repelling the heat, and keeping off the flames,</hi> then it might be <hi>according</hi> to<note place="margin">P. 145.</note> the laws of nature, and there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which by an instantaneous application might extinguish the Fire. But to hinder fire from burning while it remains such, and combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter actually in it, this is contrary to the laws of nature.</p>
            <p>But all those Miracles which are not so directly <hi>contrary</hi> to nature, can't however be said to be according to the laws of nature. And I take these two expressions to be directly opposite. Which he makes the same, <hi>Miracles are according to the laws of nature.</hi> And, <hi>they are above the operations of</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:56374:95"/>
               <hi>it.</hi> For to instance in the first Miracle our Saviour wrought, that of Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Water</hi> into <hi>Wine.</hi> The production of Wine according to the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. must have been by accelerating the growth of the <hi>Vine,</hi> and ripening the Grape sodainly, by application of all those things in nature which could forward it: but to turn Water imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly into Wine, without any of these methods, was to produce it afer a manner wholly different from all the laws of nature.</p>
            <p>Upon his Principles we have no way, from the nature of the thing, of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing between the <hi>Delusions</hi> of the<note place="margin">P. 147<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Divel, those <hi>celebrated Feats of Goblins, and Witches, and Conjurers which</hi> he speaks of; and those which are wrought by the <hi>Finger</hi> of God.

real effect contrary to it, or above it. The Divel indeed may delude mens senses, so as to make them think that <hi>Real</hi> which is only an Appearance; as it is likely he did to mimick that miracle of turning <hi>Aarons Rod</hi> into a <hi>Serpent;</hi> for that of the Magicines was not a real Conversion, but effected by their Enchantments, or as 'tis in the original by their <hi>Wiles</hi> and <hi>Jugling.</hi> For we find when they endeavour'd to imitate <hi>Moses,</hi> in the instantaneous production of any real thing with <hi>Life,</hi> there the Divel fail'd them, and they were forc'd to own it was the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God.</p>
            <p>And thus we see plainly, how this Man strikes at the foundation of all <hi>Reveal'd Religion,</hi> by undermining one of the main <hi>Pillars</hi> on which the Faith and Credit of it is founded. You see his drift all along in every thing he says, is to take away all <hi>Operations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Laws of <hi>Nature,</hi> and all <hi>Doctrines</hi> above the reach of <hi>Reason;</hi> and then all the Religion of Men is consequently resolv'd into <hi>Infidelity,</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:56374:96"/>
an <hi>Heathenism.</hi> So that any one who wishes <hi>Christianity</hi> to be true, must hope at least that this Mans Principles are false, since they are so utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent.</p>
            <p>2. But 2dly, As miracles being in a great degree Mysterious is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable objection against him; so they are altogether useless and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent upon his Principles. He owns<note place="margin">P. 146.</note> 
               <hi>that God does not work them at random, but for some end;</hi> and this end he owns <hi>is for the confirmation of some Divine</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 150.</note> 
               <hi>Doctrine.</hi> But why for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Doctrine? for he hath told us over and over, that it is only the <hi>Evidence or immediate knowledg of the Doctrine it self can perswade us. That Faith is nothing more than the knowing what is beleiv'd &amp;c.</hi> And therefore all <hi>Miracles</hi> for the confirmation of any Doctrine are <hi>needless</hi> and <hi>superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> If they are so evident to our <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> or our <hi>Reason</hi> that we know them to be true, what necessity is there of farther conviction? if a thing be so

               </gap> Senses or Reason that I know it to be true, nothing can make me surer of it.</p>
            <p>So that we see the reason of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles is, that they may be a proof of something that we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected here that at this rate, if both the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are mysterious, <hi>Then you prove one Mystery by another.</hi> I answer that they are not <hi>equally mysterious,</hi> for a misterious Doctrine is <hi>totally</hi> obscur'd from us, both as to the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>substance</hi> of the thing signified, as it is in it self. But in a Miracle the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the thing is obvious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and the <hi>Manner</hi> only of the operation is conceal'd.

            </p>
            <p>He can't say that thô the <hi>Doctrines</hi> are plain, yet that they came from God is not so; and therefore <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> were to assure us of this. For if the knowing they come from God makes us give our assent to them, then <hi>Authority</hi> is a ground of Perswasion. And besides if they have that <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of their truth in themselves, which he contends for, let them come from whence they will we must give our assent to them.</p>
            <p>And now I am come to his last<note place="margin">Sect. 3. C. 4. P. 151.</note> Chapter, wherein he pretends to give an account <hi>When, Why,</hi> and <hi>by Whom Mysteries were brought into Christianity.</hi> There is not here so much as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reasoning, but several vile <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:56374:98"/>
against all the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> against the <hi>Clergy</hi> of all Ages, and against <hi>Christianity</hi> it self, making it as it is now profest only a sort of <hi>Heathenism,</hi> and the Ministers of it in all respects no better than <hi>Pagan Priests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the title of this Chapter he was to have shewn how these Mysteries came into Christianity, but instead of this (of which he says not a word) he talks in general how some <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> were introduc'd, and some <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> abus'd to superstition. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all along was about <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and now it is turn'd to <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> of which he speaks too after a confused manner, making no difference between the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Heretical</hi> Professors, but charging all the mistakes and errors of every Sect indifferently, upon the whole body of Christians in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. That miscarriages and errors crept in, and that the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was corrupted and abus'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Primitive times to supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is without all doubt; it is so
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56374:98"/>
now, and is like to be so to the end of the World, for <hi>it must needs be that Offences come.</hi> But what is all this to those who are not guilty of these things? suppose every thing in this Chapter true, what is all this to us? who in the celebration of <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> have rejected all these numerous Rites and superstitious Ceremonies which he speaks of.</p>
            <p>As for those Ceremonies retain'd by us, it is time enough to defend them when he says any thing against them; and proves, either that <hi>the Worship of God and Celebration of the Sacraments can be perform'd without any Ceremonies.</hi> Or, <hi>That those which we have retain'd are unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All he wou'd insinuate here of them, is that they were in use among the Heathens; and the force of what he says, if it hath any, is this. Heathens us'd a <hi>White Garment</hi> in their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Worship, they had certain <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> appropriated to the Worship of their Idols; therefore 'tis unlawful to have
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56374:99"/>
any thing of this nature in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the true God.</p>

               </gap>uff.</p>
            <p>What he would insinuate here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Sacraments</hi> is, that by a multitude of Ceremonies we obscure the nature of them, we make them <hi>Misterious,</hi> and do not celebrate them wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h that simplicity they were at first instituted. But let him in his next Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k shew, what it is that we know our selves concerning the Sacraments, which we conceal from the People. In short let him make out that he hath any other drift in this whole Chapter,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56374:99"/>
than to shew that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is by way of <hi>Amusement</hi> to People who do not know when a man speaks to the purpose; <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are not <hi>Mysteries,</hi> nor do they make a thing <hi>Mysterious.</hi> Those things which we call Mysteries, are the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> of God; the <hi>Eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and <hi>Incarnation of the Son,</hi> and <hi>Procession of the Holy Ghost;</hi> The <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Divine and Human Natures in Christ;</hi> the <hi>Resurrection of our Bodies;</hi> the <hi>Operations</hi> and <hi>Influences</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God upon ours; the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Persons</hi> in the Godhead; the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Felicity</hi> of the Saints in Heaven; The <hi>Solemnity</hi> of the last Judgment <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These are the Mysterious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of our Religion. Let him shew us <hi>When, Why,</hi> and <hi>by Whom</hi> these <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Mysteries,</hi> as he calls them, were brought into Christianity. For we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that they were brought into Christianity by <hi>Christ himself;</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56374:100"/>
was able to reveal them. That they came in at the first publication of the Gospel; and with design to make us <hi>wise unto Salvation;</hi> and therefore <hi>we own our selves so fond of them,</hi> that we<note place="margin">P. 120.</note> will hazard any thing, <hi>Life</hi> and all rather than part with them.</p>
            <p>And thus I have gon through his Book, and answered every thing that look'd like <hi>Reasoning</hi> in it. If he will shew me where I have overlook'd any thing that hath the appearance of an Argument; or where my <hi>Answer</hi> fails, I will promise him not to let it pass.

            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:56374:100"/>In the next Book he speaks of, he has two things to perform.</p>
            <p>1. To shew that we are not oblig'd by Scripture, to believe that there is any thing, in any point of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, which we do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend as fully and perfectly, as we do the common objects of this World.</p>
            <p>2. To discover to all the World those secrets in Religion, which the Clergy have industriously conceal'd from the Laity, under the notion of <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and make them so plain that they shall cease to be such; so that every one of them shall be as wise as e're a Priest of us all. And indeed he is much to blame that defers it all this while; He that pretends so much Zeal and Concern for the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> shou'd not let them remain so long in Ignorance, to be thus miserably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon, by the craft and cunning of their Priests.</p>
            <p>What <hi>strange unheard of Design</hi> this Man has in that second Book, which is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56374:101"/>
now a forging, is hard to tell. For by it he is to inform the World of things they never <hi>heard</hi> or <hi>thought</hi> of; He is to reveal to us more than ever <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath done; and what never yet cou'd enter into the heart of Man to think, or into his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to frame any true and <hi>proper</hi> notion of. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> The World had any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his abilities to perform what he pretends with this <hi>hardy confidence,</hi> we shou'd all of us expect this <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Book</hi> with much impatience. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by all these promises of so much New Light to the World, which hath liv'd in darkness so many hundred Years, we can't guess he designs to be no more than Head of an ordinary Sect, but to be as famous an Impostor as Mahomet, He hath laid a fair foundation for it, for he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er's posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in one place, <hi>that if he knew the way how a Miracle was wrought he wou'd work it himself.</hi> And again he openly says, <hi>That nothing related in the Gospel is Mysterious, either as to the manner or Substance of the thing,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56374:101"/>
'tis not unlikely that we shall have this man shortly confirming his Doctrines with Miracles.</p>
            <p>For my part, I can't imagine how he will go about what he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; however thus much I dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to promise him, that whenever any thing is built upon that Rotten Foundation which is here laid, by the <hi>Grace of God</hi> I will pull it down.</p>
            <p>When this Book of his comes out (which after all will tell us no more concerning these Mysteries, than what we have heard an <hi>hundred times over;</hi> but by what he promises must take place of the <hi>Bible</hi> it self, which gives us no such clear and distinct Idea's of the things of another World) Then we shall give a better guess at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Man.

               <hi>and intelligible</hi> than they were before, He had don worthily; and might have hop'd for a Reward from God, and <hi>Esteem</hi> from Men; And the Ministers of the Gospel wou'd have been so far from resenting it, that they wou'd have thank'd him for it, and not fail'd to have acquainted their People with it.

               <hi>Contrivance only to bring us Gain and Credit:</hi> as if we had no sence at all of Religion, and that a little Vain glory and profit were all our aim.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:56374:105"/>He levels the whole Book mainly at the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and doth all he can to render us odious in the sight of the People. And to do it more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he all along makes the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> two opposite Parties, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to raise in them jealousies and suspicions of our gulling and abusing them, in order to prejudice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense them against us. And that his Sophistry might pass upon them the better, he paints us out under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Heathen Priests;</hi> he draws <hi>their Picture,</hi> and then leaves the <hi>Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to mistake it for <hi>ours;</hi> endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring everywhere, to make all People of his Faith, who thinks that <hi>Priests of all Religions are the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What this Man advances here, is but a Branch of that bitter Root of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism,</hi> which hath opened a <hi>Door</hi> for introducing and reviving many of those <hi>Heresies,</hi> which have formerly infested the Church, and troubled the Faith of Christians. These Men dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer among themselves, and there is as great variety of them as there were of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56374:106"/>
the Arrians formerly; yet they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in Destroying Reveal'd Religion and the establisht Doctrine of that Church, of which they yet profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Members. Thus these <hi>Vermin</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in the Body of it, at the same time they strike at one another, do all equally contribute to devour the whole, from whence they first deriv'd their life and being.</p>
            <p>I hope I need not here enter into a <hi>Defence</hi> of our Order, or make any long <hi>Apology</hi> for the Ministers of the Gospel. This one Book of his, is a sufficient Proof of the <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Usefulness</hi> of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> for had it not been for us, such ridiculous <hi>Sophisms</hi> as these might have pass'd with the People for sound Reasoning. If it were not for them, whose business it is to confute the Arguments of these pretenders to <hi>Reason,</hi> to lay open their <hi>Fallacies,</hi> and detect their <hi>Villanous Designs;</hi> there wou'd not, in a little time, be so much as a <hi>Face</hi> of Religion omong us. And if the <hi>Experiment</hi> were not too dangerous, and the consequences of it
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56374:106"/>
never to be retriev'd, there cou'd not be a greater demonstration of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> and <hi>Usefulness</hi> of the Clergy, than the universal desisting of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours only for a very short space, For then all Religion would degenerate into Barbarity and Heathenism.</p>
            <p>If we are guilty of all these <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> with which this Man brands us, there is no punishment either in this World, or the next too bad for us. But if we are not, and that this Man doth not make out what he so posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively asserts, then what will he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve? We appeal to any <hi>Power</hi> that is able to take account of the matter; And if the strength of all Laws <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> should once be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax't, that every one may openly vent what they please against the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion,</hi> and it's <hi>Teachers,</hi> without restraint (which God forbid) then we must leave it to him to defend his own <hi>Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The World is at this time so dispos'd for the reception of all Discourses that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56374:107"/>
seem to set up <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Reveal'd and Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Doctrines of Christianity,</hi> that nothing less than the <hi>Interposition of Authority,</hi> can stop this current of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity</hi> and <hi>Prophaness</hi> which threatens to overwhelm these Nations.</p>
            <p>How far Men in Power, according to their several stations, are oblidg'd to intermedle in point of <hi>Conscience,</hi> I shall not now <hi>enquire.</hi> But sure I am in point of <hi>Policy,</hi> it is become no less than necessary. For the writers of this <hi>Strein</hi> have given broad <hi>Hints,</hi> that they are as little Friends to our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> as our <hi>Religion.</hi> This Man can say, <hi>That Magistrates are made for the People,</hi> and every one knows, what <hi>Doctrines of Rebellion</hi> men are wont to insinuate by this <hi>saying.</hi> And again he says. <hi>That God alone, and such as are inspir'd by him can prescribe Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>

               <hi>relating to the World to come, whilst Human Powers regulate the Affairs of this.</hi> By which 'tis plain his meaning is, that they have nothing to do, to meddle any way in the Affairs of Religion

Now what would this man have said, if he durst have spoke as plainly of <hi>Government</hi> as he hath done of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whosoever observes these men's way of writing as to this one point, will be convinc'd they deserve to be look'd too; Their Numbers grow <hi>Formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> They begin to speak out their <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Prophaness,</hi> as plain as some of them do <hi>Treason;</hi> they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly <hi>forming</hi> themselves into <hi>Clubs</hi> &amp; <hi>Caballs,</hi> and have their <hi>Emissaries</hi> into all parts, which are supported by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions: And I make little doubt, but that their design is at length to shew us, That all <hi>Dominion</hi> as well as <hi>Religion</hi> is founded in Reason.</p>

            <p>I Have designedly left the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those <hi>Passages</hi> he cites out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to the last, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd by themselves; because many Persons who will read the <hi>rational</hi> part, don't care for troubling themselves with the examination of these. And indeed, because I design'd to dwell much longer upon them, than I find the length of this <hi>Letter</hi> already will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
            <p>The very <hi>Quoting</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> is a confutation of himself; for if there be no other ground of Perswasion but <hi>Evidence,</hi> what can the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Fathers signify to encline Mens Assent either one way or the other? and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of Scripture it self? All <hi>Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Divine</hi> or <hi>Human</hi> are useless &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent upon his Principles. For what he wou'd perswade by them is evident in it self or it is not. If it be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56374:108"/>
evident, we shall certainly believe it, let who will say it; but if the truth of it be not evident from the nature of the thing it self, all the <hi>Pompous</hi> Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the World signify nothing.</p>
            <p>He was sensible of this, and that is the true reason why he gives the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> as foul language, as he doth the modern Clergy; not considering that the same objection holds against the Bible it self. For if the Authority of God be not a ground of Perswasion, then a Text out of the Bible will be of as little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orce, as a Quotation out of any fabulous Heathen Author, to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceo ur Assent to any Proposition.</p>
            <p>He introduces them after the most scornful manner he could contrive, and says, that the mentioning of <hi>Schut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons puts him in mind of the Judgment of the Primitive Church.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he hath this expression, by way of ridicule, <hi>The Fathers, The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> their <hi>Opinions</hi> he calls <hi>Whymsies.</hi> And their Works <hi>insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Labyrinths.</hi> And calls the just Esteem we have for them, <hi>A Blind</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:56374:109"/>
               <hi>Veneration for those who liv'd before us.</hi> He never mentions them without the <hi>greatest contemt,</hi> and says, <hi>He is not to be put out of countenance by Venerable names, and Pompous Citations, that have no value, but such as an ugly Rust and Colour give antient Coins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>similitude</hi> that he designs by way of derision, doth very well express the worth and usefulness of the Fathers. For as antient Coins are now of no greater intrinsick value than the bare weight of the Metal they are made of; yet they are of excellent use to give us light into the times and customs of Antiquity, and upon that score are of vasily greater value than any modern Coins. So it is with the Fathers; they were <hi>Men,</hi> and wrote like such; and thô we should grant that some of their works, are not in themselves more excellent than what hath been written in after ages; yet these Writings of theirs are much more to be valu'd, because they liv'd nearer the times of Christ and his Apostles, and therefore had greater advantages of coming to right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56374:109"/>
of all things relating to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, than it is possible for any after them to have. Not but that some of them seem to have wrote by a more peculiar influence of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And therefore this Mans arrogant treatment of the Fathers, puts me in mind of that passage of the <hi>ignorant Childrens reviling the Prophet, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him Baldpate;</hi> who saw nothing of him beyond those <hi>common infirmities</hi> that are incident to <hi>Human Nature,</hi> and did not discern any thing of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit that was in him.</p>
            <p>We do not blindly and implicitely acquiesce in any thing they say, but we have a just Veneration for them, and deserence to their Authority; And if he could have produced any thing from them which had made against us, we would have own'd he had gaind a great point. But all the Citations he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, are only to prove that the things reveal'd under the Gospel, were call'd Mysteries under the Law; and That the Vail is taken away, both which we allow. Let him bring one Text out of the <hi>Bible,</hi> or one Quotation out of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56374:110"/>
               <hi>Fathers,</hi> to prove that the Vail is taken away in the sence that we deny, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in respect of the true Nature, and real Properties of those things which we call Mysteries For that it is taken away as to the <hi>Existence</hi> of those things, and as to the <hi>Relation</hi> they have to us, as to the intent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of them we allow.</p>
            <p>And this is a sufficient answer to all his Quotations, if he brought a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand more to the same purpose he hath don these. However I shall consider them in particular. And</p>
            <p>1. He says <note n="*" place="margin">STROM. Lib. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> hath the same notion of Mysteries with him. For he says the Christian Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because it brought hidden things to light.</hi> Very true. <hi>But not because it brought them so to light, as to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the real Nature and Properties of every thing reveal'd; and give us as clear and distinct notions of all divine things as they are in themselves, as we have even of sensible Objects,</hi> Which this
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56374:110"/>
Man ridiculously contends for. And this he would have seen if he had read but Ten Lines farther, where he has this Expression,</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By which he affirms the nature of God, to be above all we can conceive or speak of him. So that 'tis plain the Father in direct opposition to this <hi>Scribler,</hi> is of opinion that God is still <hi>Mysterious,</hi> notwithstanding all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations we have of him.</p>
            <p>The whole drift of the former part of that 5th. Book, is to shew that the true nature of <hi>FAITH,</hi> consists in giving our assent to the truth of things which we cannot know, upon the Authority of God; and to this he applies that Text of the Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5 where he adviseth us <hi>that our Faith should not be founded on the Wisdom of Men,</hi> who as he explains it <hi>pretend to make us know every thing we believe.</hi> But on the <hi>Veracity of God,</hi> who saves
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56374:111"/>
us by <hi>pure Faith,</hi> without that <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of the thing it self, which some Men require. The Father's own words are these.</p>

            <p>The next Quotation is out of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> who hath this expression in his Apology. <hi>Cum vel ex Formâ omnibus Mysteriis silentij fiides habeatur</hi> &amp;c. He is in that place defending the Christians, from those crimes of <hi>Incest, Adultery,</hi> and <hi>murdering</hi> of Children, which the Heathen charged them, as being guilty of in there meetings. That they were groundless Rumours and nothing more, He argues thus;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56374:113"/>
               <hi>These things must be first discovered either by our selves, or others; not by others, because they have no way to know them, but by such as are privy to them; not by our selves, for none who are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of such horrid Crimes, would discover things which must expose them to the immediate punishment of the Laws, tho the vengeance of God were deser'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the force of the comparison with the Heathen Mysteries lies in this. If the Samothracian and Elusinian Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are kept so secret, which are not of such dangerous consequence to discover; How much more must you think such Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and dangerous Mysteries as you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose ours to be, will be kept secret.</hi> And his In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erence is very natural viz <hi>That these things must needs be meer Rumour, since if they were true they would not be discover'd;</hi> or, <hi>if they were discover'd, must expect no mercy from the Heathen, who would be sure not to spare them.</hi> And therfore he says.</p>
