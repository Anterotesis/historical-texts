         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This lustie youth (as I earst said) seeing them already in this maze of bitter sweetnes, he goes round about, turmoyling himselfe in seeking an entrance, and taking such paines to finde his owne paine, that in the end, in he gets, when for the hast he makes, to haue a taste of these supposed delicates, he hath no leisure to thinke, or no care to prouide those things that are hereunto requisite. The iolly yonker be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus gotten in, doth for a time swim in delight, and hath no desire at all to wind him selfe out againe, till time and vse, which makes all things more familiar and lesse pleasing, doe qualifie this humor, then glutted with satietie, or pinched with penury, he may perhaps begin to see his follie, and repent as well his fondnes, as his too much forwardnes, but all too late, he must haue patience perforce: his wife must be maintained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her degrée, and withall (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly it happes she carie the right stomacke of a woman) slender maintenance will not serue, for as their mindes mount aboue their estates, so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wil they haue their abillements.

Why my sweet hart what ailes you, are you not well? I pray thée wife tell me, where lies thy griefe? or what is the cause of your discontent: wherevpon the vile woman fetching a déepe sigh, makes this answere. O husband God help me, I haue cause enough to gréeue, and if you knew all you would say so: but alas it is in vaine to tell you any thing, seeing that whatsoeuer I say, you make but light reckning of it: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is best for me to bury my sorrowes in silence, being out of hope to haue any help at your hands.

In truth husband it were to no purpose, for I knowe your custome well inough; as for my words, they are but wast wind in your eares, for how great soeuer my griefe is, I am assured you will but make light of it, and thinke that I speake it for some other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

But alas I speake not this for my selfe, for God wot I passe not how meanely I am apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but I speake it for your credit &amp; my friends.

the world: doe you thinke that <hi>Law. Tom. &amp; N. M.</hi> (who were both suters to me) doe kéepe their wiues so? no by cochs body, for I know the worst cloathes that they cast off, is better then my very best, which I weare on the cheifest dayes in the yeere: I know not what the cause is that so many good women die, but I would to God that I were dead too, that I might not tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you no more seeing I am such an eie sore vnto you. Now by my faith wife saith he, you say not well, there is nothing that I thinke too good for you, if my abillitie can compasse it. But you knowe our estate, we must doe as we may, &amp; not as we would, yet be of good cheare, and turne to me, and I will straine my selfe to please you, in this or any other thing. Nay for Gods sake let me alone, I haue no mind on such matters, and if you had no more desire therto then I, I promise you, you wou'd neuer tuch me. No wife (saith he) hoping so with a iest to make hee mery, by my honestie I sweare, I verily thinke that if I were dead, you would not be long without another husband. No maruaile sure saith she, I lead such a good life with you now. By my christian soule I sweare, there should neuer man kisse my lipps againe. And if I thought I should liue long with you, I would vse meanes to make my selfe away: herewithall she puts finger in the eye making shew as though she wept. Thus plaies she with the sillie sot her husband (meaning nothing lesse then to doe as she saies) while he poore foole is in mind both wel and ill apaid, he thinkes himselfe well, because he imagines hee of a cold constitution, and therefore exceeding chast: he thinkes himselfe ill, to sée her fained teares, for that he verily supposes she loues him, which doth not a little gréeue him, being so kind and tender hearted. Therefore he vseth all meanes possible to make her quiet, neither wil he giue her ouer, till he hath effected it. But she prosecuting her former purpose, which she hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie set in so faire a forwardnes, makes as though she were nothing moued with his gentle perswasions; Therefore to crosse him, she gets her vp betimes in the morning, sooner a great deale then she was wont, pouting and lowring all the day, &amp; not giuing him one good word. But when night comes,

and they againe both in bed, laying her selfe sullenly downe, and continuing still silent, the good man harkens whether she sléep or no, feeles if she be wel couered or not, he softly plucks vp the cloaths vpon her, lapping her warme, being dubble diligent to please her ying all this while winking, noting his kindnes and carefulnes towards her, séemes on a suddaine to awake from a sound sléepe, gruntling and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By lady wife, and so I doe: and since yesternight I haue bethought me (hauing well considered your words) that it is very meete and requisite, that you should be better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with apparell then heretofore you haue bene, for indéed I must confesse thy cloaths are too simple. And therfore I mean against my cousin <hi>M.</hi> wedding (which you know wil be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that you shall haue a new gowne, made on the bell fashion, with all things sutable thereunto, in such sort that the best wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the parish shall not passe you.

But it falls out otherwise, for his wife begins to chide; whose words carries such a sway with the Seruants, that whatsoeuer their Maister saith, they make small account of it; but if their Mistresse command any thing it is presently done, and her humor followed in all things, else must they packe out of seruice: so that it bootes not him to bid them doe any thing, or rebuke them for not doing it: And his poore man that hath bene with him, dares not likewise open his mouth to call for any Uictualls to comfort himselfe, or for the Horses, least they should suspect him to be of his Maisters fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (who being wise, and of a quiet and milde nature) is loth to make any stirre, or bréede any disquietnes in the house, and therefore takes all in good part, and sits him downe farre from the Fire, though hee be very colde: But his wife and children stand round about it, but all their eyes are cast on her, who lookes on her Husband with an angrie countenance, not caring to prouide ought for his supper; but contrariwise taunts him with sharpe and shrewish spéeches, whereto for the most part, he answers not a word, but sometimes (perhaps being vrged, through hunger or wearines, or the vnkindnes of his wife) he doth thus vtter his minde.

Sometimes they haue Children, sometimes they haue none; yet this notwithstanding, the Wife can take no paines, yet must be maintained according to her degrée, to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands excéeding charges: for the furnishing whereof, the poore Man is forted to take extreame toyle and paines, and yet for all this, thankes God, for vouchsafing him so great a grace, as to be matcht with her: If now and then they grow to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus doth she keepe him in awe, and in a kinde of seruitude, by telling him of them, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps haue matcht her better, and not with him, but for some priuie scape that she hath had before, whereof the poore soule knowes nothing, or if perhaps he hath heard some inkling thereof, yet because he is simple, the credit that he might giue thereunto is quickely dasht, by a contrarie tale of others sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornd by them, who perchance will not sticke to sweare that this is a slaunder raised by euill tongues, and forged maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously against her, as the like is done against many other good women, whose good names are wronged, and brought in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion by bad persons on their tipling bench, because themselues cannot obtaine their purpose of them: notwithstanding, if her husband be not able to maintaine her according to her minde, then will she be sure to haue a friend in store, that shall afford it her: if her husband denie it, and in the end she remembers that such a Gentleman at such a feast proffered her a diamond, or sent her by a messenger some 20, or thirtie crownes, which she as then refused, but now purposeth to giue him a kind glance, to renew his affection, who conceiuing some better hope, and méeting soone after with her chamber maid, as she is going about some busines, cals to her, saying; Sister, I would faine speake with you. Sir quoth she, say what you please. You know (quoth he) that I haue long loued your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, without obtaining any fauour: but tell me I pray you, did she neuer speake of me in your hearing? In faith sit (saith she) neuer but well: I dare sweare she wishes you no harme.

She being glad of such a bootie, hyes her home, and tels her mistres how she met with a Gentleman that was in a passing good vaine: and to be short, after some questions vsed by her mistres, it appeares to be the very same man whom she would faine intrap. I tell thée saith she to her maide, if he be as kinde as he is proper, he were worthie to be any womans loue. Beléeue me mistres (saith the maide) <note place="margin">A maid sit for such a mistres.</note> his very countenance shewes that he is kind, it séemes that he was onely made for loue, and withall he is wealthie, and thereby able to maintaine her beautie, and her person in brauerie whom he affects.

Alas quoth she what should I doe, I haue had him so long, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now set my heart on any other. Tush (quoth the maid) it is a folly for any woman to set her heart so on any man, for you know they care not how they vse vs when they are once Lords ouer vs. Beside your husband though he would, yet cannot maintaine and kéepe you according to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée: but he of whom I speake will furnish and maintaine you gallantly what garments soeuer you will haue: and what colour and fashion soeuer you like best, you shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently haue it, so that there wants nothing else, saue onely a quaint excuse to my Maister, making him beléeue you had it by some other meanes.

next morning to market she hies, somewhat more earely then she was wont, and by the way she méetes with this lustie gallant, who hath waited for her at least thrée houres, he hath no sooner spyed her, but he presently makes towarde her, and at her comming, thus salutes her: Sister, good morrow, what newes I pray, and how doth your faire mistresse?

Out on him slaue (saith he) but I pray you tell me what answere gaue your mistresse touching my sute? In faith (quoth she) I spake vnto her, but she would not agrée thereunto, for she is wonderfully afraide to purchase her selfe discredit, and is beside plagued with such a froward and suspitious husband, that although she were neuer so willing, yet could she not, being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally watcht by him, his mother and brethren: I thinke on my conscience vnlesse that it were that she spake to you the other day, the poore woman talkt not with any man these foure moneths, yet she speakes very often of you, and I am well assured that if she would bend her minde to loue; she would choose you before all men in the world.

Ifaith sir (saith she) I thinke it best that you should speake with her your selfe, and now you haue an excellent opportunitie, for my maister hath refused to giue her a gowne, whereat she stormes not a little, you shall doe well therefore to be to morrow at the Church, and there salute her, telling her boldly your desire: you may also offer her what you thinke good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I know she will take nothing: marrie she will thinke the better of you, knowing thereby your franke and bountifull nature.

Shee, hauing her lesson thus taught her by her maide, gets her vp betimes the next morning, and to the Church shee goes, where this amorous gallant hath awaited for her comming euer since foure a clocke. She being set in her pew, makes shew as if she were deuoutly at her prayers, when (God wot) her deuotion is bent to the seruice of another Saint: it were worth the noting to sée how like an image she sits: and yet for all her demurenes, she applies all her fiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and that full zealously in this new humor of religion.

               <head>CHAP. VI. The Humor of a Woman that striues to maister her Husband</head>
               <p>THe next humor wherevnto a Woman is addicted, is, when the Husband hath got a faire young Wife, who is proper and fine, in whome hee takes great delight; yet perhaps she is bent altogether to crosse, and thwart: the man being of a kinde and milde nature, louing her entierly, and maintaines her as well as he can, notwithstanding her frowardnesse: It may be also that she hath care of his credite and honestie, and doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre such leaudnesse, as shee of whome we spake before did vse, yet hath shee neuerthelesse an extreame desire of Soueraigntie, (which is knowne a common fault amongst Women) and to be her Husbands commaunder, and a busie medler in his matters; be hee a Iudge, a Nobleman, or Gentleman, she will take vpon her to giue sentence, and answere Suters, and whatsoeuer shee doeth he must stand to it.</p>
               <p>This is, (I say) a generall imperfection of Women, be they neuer so honestly, neuer so kindly vsed, and haue neuer so much wealth and ease, to striue for the Bréeches, and be in odde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie humours, of purpose to keepe her Husband in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thought and care how to please her.</p>
               <p>He gets him vp betimes in the morning, leauing her in Bed, to take her ease, while hee stirres about the house and dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his busines, looks to the seruants that they loyter not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

No (saith he) I will neither sit downe, nor eate a bit till she be here; So receiuing his second message by his Maid, or perhaps by one of his children, replyes thus; Go tell him againe that I will not dine to day. He hearing this, is not yet satisfied, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sometimes it may be she will, and then he must leade her by the hand like a bride, and set her chaire rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for her, meane while it is so long before he can get <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ast likewise: whereat she smiles inwardly, hauing brought him so to her bowe, first in crossing him, then in making him to fast from dinner: wherein (to say the truth) she hath reason, for what néedes a woman to seeke his fauour, who doth alreadie loue her, and shew her all the kindnes that he can. Sometimes the good man ryding abroad about his businesse, méetes with two or thrée of his friends, with whom perhaps he hath some dealings, and hath bene long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them: It may be also that he inuites them home to his house, as one friend will doe to another, and sends his man before to his wife to make all things readie in the best sort that she can for their entertainment: the poore seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gallops in such hast, that both himselfe and his horse is all on a sweate, when he comes home he doth his ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now by my faith (saith she) I will not meddle in it, he thinkes belike that I haue nothing else to doe, but drudge about to prepare banquets for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, he should haue come himselfe with a vengeance, and why did he not? Forsooth (saith the seruant) I know not, but thus he bad me tell you. Go too (saith she) you are a knaue that meddles in more matters then you haue thanke for. The poore fellow hearing this holds his peace, she in a fume stings vp into her chamber, and which is worse, sends out her seruants, some one way, some another: as for her maydes, they haue
<pb facs="tcp:16146:21"/>
their lesson taught them well enough, knowing by custome how to behaue themselues to wearie their maister: well, he comes home to his aforesaid friends, calls presently for some of his seruants: but one of the maides make answere, of whom he demaunds whether all things be readie: In good faith sit my mistresse is very sicke, and here is no body else can doe <note place="margin">Oh fetch the aqua vitae bottle quickly.</note> any thing: with that he being angry, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>des his friends into the hall, or some other place according to his estate, where he findes neither fire made, nor cloath laide. Iudge then in what a taking he is, although it may be that his friends percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the sending of his man, that his commaundements were not of such force as an act of parliament. The good man being ashamed, calls and gapes, first for one man then for an other, and yet for all this there comes none, except it be the scullion or some chare woman, that both vse his house, whom his wife hath left there of purpose, because shée knew they could serue to doe nothing. Being herewith not a little mooued, vp he goes into his wiues chamber, and thus speakes vnto her: Gods precious woman, why haue ye not done as I wild ye? Why (saith she) you appoint so many things to be done that I know not what to doe. Before God (saith he) and with that scratches his head, you haue done me a greater displeasure then you thinke: these are the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest friends that I haue, and now here is nothing to set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Why (quoth she) what would you haue me to doe? I wis if you cast your cards well, you shall finde that we haue no néede to make banquets: I would to God you were wiser, but sith you will needes be so lustie, euen goe through with it your selfe on Gods name, for Ile not meddle with it. But what the diuellment ye (saith he) to send all the seruants abroad? Why (quoth she) what did I know that you should néede them now: yet did she kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:16146:21"/>
haue spent a hundred crownes then it should so haue fallen out. But she cares not a whit, being well assured, that howsoeuer she thwarts him, he will hold his hands, and in scolding she knowes her selfe to be the better. To be short, the poore man being vexed, with shame and anger, runnes vp and downe the house, gets as many of his seruants together as he can: If his prouision be but slender at ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, he sendes presently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, in the meane while he calles for a cleane towell, the best table cloath, and wrought napkins. But the maide an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres him that he can haue none. Then vp to his wife goes he againe, and tels her that his friends doe intreate her to come downe and bare them companie, shewing her what a shame it is, and how discourteously they will take it if she come not: And finally, he vseth all the fairest speeches that he can to haue her come, and to welcome and entertaine them for his credites sake. Nay in faith (quoth she) I will not come, they are too great states for my companie, and no doubt they would scorne a poore woman as I am: It may be shée will goe, but in such sort, and with such a countenance, that it had bene better for him she had not come at all, for his friends will somewhat perceiue by her lookes, and gesture, that howsoeuer they be welcome to the good man, she had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue their roome then their company. But if she refuse to come (as it is the more likely) then will he aske her for the best to well, table-cloth and napkins. Napkins (quoth she) as though those that be abroad alreadie be not good enough for greater and better men then they are: when my brother or any of my kinsmen come, which are I wis their equals in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry respect, they can be content to be serued with them: but were these your guestes neuer so great, yet could I not now fulfill your request, though my life should lie on it: for since morning I haue lost my keyes of the great chest where all the linnen <note place="margin">Oh lyer, lyer.</note> lies: I pray you bid the maide looke for them, for in good truth I know not what I haue done with them, and no maruell, for I haue so much to doe, that I know not how to bestir my selfe: well I wotte, I haue spoyled my selfe with continuall care and trouble.
<pb facs="tcp:16146:22"/>
Now in good faith (quoth he) you haue drest me fairely, but it is no matter: Before God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>le breake open the chest. Now surely then (quoth she) you shall doe a great act, I would faine see you doe it, I would for my part you would breake all the chestes in the house. The poore man hearing her in these termes, knowes not well what to doe, but takes that which he next lightes on, and therefore shifts as well as he can: he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his guestes to sit downe at the table, and because the beere then a broach is on tilt, and therefore not very good, he bids one of the seruants broach a new barrell and fill some fresh drinke, but then there is neither tap nor spigget to be found, for his wife of purpose hath hidden them out of the way. Towards the end of the dinner he cals for cheese, and fruite, but there is none in the house, so that he is faine to send to the neighbours for the same, or else be vtterly desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: meane while his boy being at the table with the guestes, at last tels them how his mistresse faines her selfe sicke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is not pleased with their maisters comming. Well when bed time comes, he can get no cleane sheetes nor pillow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeres, because forsooth the keyes are lost, so that they must be content to lie in those that be foule, and haue bene long laine in. The next morning they get them gone betimes, séeing by the good wiues countenance that they are nothing welcome. By the way their Lackies tell them what the Gentlemans boy reported, whereat they laught hartily, yet finde themselues agréeued, vowing neuer to be his guest any more. The husband also, getting him vp betimes in the morning, goes presently to his wife, and thus begins: By Iesus wife, I muse what you meane to vse me thus. I know not how to liue with you. Then she replies saying: Now God for his mercy, am I so trouble, some? God wot I am euery day (poore soule) troubled with kéeping your hogs, your geese, your chickens, I must card, I must spin, &amp; continually kéepe the house, looke to the seruants, and neuer sit still, but toyling vp and downe to shorten my daies, and make me die before my time, and yet I cannot haue one houres rest, or quietnes with you, but you are alwaies brawling, &amp; doe nothing your selfe, but spend &amp; wast your goods
<pb facs="tcp:16146:22"/>
and mine with odde Companions. What odde Companions (satch hee) as though you knowe not that these are such men, as can either much further, or much hinder me: It is a signe that you deale very well, that you must stand in distrust of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <head>CHAP. VII. ¶ The humor of a couetous minded Woman.</head>
               <p>THe next humor belonging to a Woman is, when the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is matched to a modest ciuil woman, who is nothing giuen to that thwarting and crossing humour whereof I spake before. But be she good or bad, this is a generall rule ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiues hold and stedfastly belieue, that their owne Husbands are worst of all others. It oft happens that when they match to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they are both young, &amp; entertaine each other with mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all delights, so much as may be, for a yeare or two, or longer; till the vigor of youth grow colde. But the woman droopes not so soone as the man; the reason whereof is, because she takes no care, thought, nor griefe, breakes not hor sléepe, and troubles not her head as hee doeth, but doth wholly addict her thoughts to pleasure and solace. I denie not, that when a Woman is with Childe, shee bides many times great paines, and is often verie ill at ease, and at the time of her deliuerance, shee is for the most part, not onely in excéeding paine, but also in no lesse daunger of death: But all this is nothing to the Husbands troubles, on whose handes alone restes the wholecharge, and waight of
<pb facs="tcp:16146:23"/>
maintaining the house, and dispatching all matters, which is oftentimes intangled so with controuersies, and so thwarted with crosse fortune, that the Poore man is tormented with all veration of minde.</p>
               <p>Being thus wearied, and as it were worne away with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall griefe, troublous cogitations, toyle and trauell, haue no minde on any other pleasure; whereas shee on the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

You may be well assured, that this change in him, makes her also change her countenance; from Mirth and chéerefulnes, to lowring Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalie, seeking occasions of disagreements, and vse them in such sort, that their former loue and kindnes was not so great, as are now their brawles, iarres, and discords. It doth also ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times happen, that the Woman by this meanes wastes and consumes all, giuing leaudly away her Husbands goods, which hee with great paines and cares hath gotten. The Good-man, he goes euery way as neare as hee can, and warily containes himselfe within his bounds, casting vp what his yearely Reuenues are, or what his gaine is by his profession, bee it Marchandize or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then what his expences be; which he finding greater then his commings in, begins to bite the lip, and becomes very pensiue: his Wife and he being afterwards priuate together in their chamber, he speakes thereof vnto her in this manner. In faith Wife, I much maruel how it comes to passe that our goods goe away thus, I know not how? I am sure I am as rarefull as a man can be, I can not finde in my heart to bestow a new coate on my selfe; and all to saue monie.

After her Churching, she inuited by some of her Neighbours, who also inuites fiue or six others of her Neighbors and friends, who is receiued and feasted with all kindnes; which Banquet doth perhaps cost her Husband more then would haue kept the house a whole fortnight: Amongst other, she propounds a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and makes a match to goe all together to a certaine Faire, which wilbe within ten dayes at such a place, to the which place they shall haue a most braue and pleasant iourney by reason of the faire weather, for they will alwayes conclude such an agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in some of the best seasons of the yeare, and she takes vpon her to make this motion, chiefly in regard of her Gossip, which was lately brought abed, that shee may after her long paine and trauaile somewhat recreate and refresh her selfe.

After this agréement, home she comes with a heauy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; the Good man asketh what she aileth. Marry (quoth she) the Child is very ill at ease, (though he were in neuer better health since hee was borne) his flesh burnes as though it were fire, and as the Nurse tells me, he hath refused the Dugge these two dayes, although she durst not say so much till now. He hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, and thinking it true, is not a little sory; goes present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sée his Childe, and wéepes for pittie.</p>
               <p>Well, Night comes, to bed they goe, and then she fetching a sigh, begins thus: Husband, I sée you haue forgotten me. How meane you that (saith hee?)

The time comes, he hires Horses, buyes her a new riding Gowne, and doth furnish her according to her mind, peraduenture there goes in their company a lusty Gallant, that will frollicke it by the way on her Husbands cost, for his Purse must pay for all.

               <p>Gentlewoman, I would to God you knewe my thoughts. Your thoughts Sir (saith she) how should I know them, except you tell them mee: If may be you thinke some thing that you are loth to tell.

               <p>Then thus (saith he) I acknowledge without faining, that I am farre vnworthy of so great a fauour, as to bee accepted for your Seruant, Friend, and Louer, which art so fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>God Syr (quoth shee) I heartily thanke you for your kinde offer, but I pray you speake no more of such matters; for I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowe what Loue is, nor yet care for knowing it: This is not the lesson that my Mother teacheth me now adayes. Why (saith hee) if it please you she shall know nothing of it; yet the other day I heard her talke of preferring you in marriage to one Maister <hi>G. R.</hi> How say you to that (quoth shee?)

But that (saith she) should be no profite to either of vs both, and beside it would be to my reproch, which I had not thought you would seeke. Nay (qd. he) I had rather die then séeke your discredit. Well sir (saith she) speake no more hereof, for if my Mother should perceiue it, I were vtterly vndono. And it may be her Mother makes her a signe to giue ouer, fearing that shee doth not play her part well.</p>
               <p>At the breaking vp of their amorous Parley, hee conueyes into her hand a gold Ring, or some such toy, desiring her to take it and keepe it for his sake: which at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

him that thou wilt speake with mee about it, and that for thy owne part thou couldst find in thy hart to haue him to thy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band rather then any man else: vpon this lesson the Daughter sleepes, reuoluing it all night in her minde.</p>
               <p>The next morning shee walkes into the Garden, and this lusty Yonker followes; when hauing giuen her the time of the day, he falls to his former sute.

               <p>But on the other side, a Young man cannot loue an olde Woman, howsoeuer hee doth dissemble, neither is there any, that more endaungers his death: for it is with him, as with one that drinketh mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

While shée thus staies her husband, the younger betakes him to his heeles, running downe the staires amaine, and out of the doores, as if the Diuell were at his taile, and after him the good man as fast as he can driue. But when hee sees that he cannot ouertake him, hee turnes backe in a like rage, to wreake his anger on his wife. But shée dreading as much, gets her hastily (before his returne) to her mother, to whom shee complaines of his cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse suspition, and diuellish furie, iustifying her selfe, as if she were not the woman, that would commit so leaud a part: But her mother sifting the matter narrowly, her daughter cousesseth her fault, but to make it séeme the lesse, shee tels her a large Tale of the young mans unportunitie, who for so long time together, did continually trouble her, and whether soeuer shee went, hee would be sure to follow her, begging pittifully her loue and fauour, that she had often sharpely answered him, and flatly denied his sute, yet could she not for all that be rid of him: so that in the end, she was inforst for her owne quietnes to graunt his request. She repeates withall, how kindly and intirely he loues her, how much he hath bestowed on her, how many soule iournies he hath had for her sake, in raine and snow, as well by night as day, in danger of théeues, in perrill of his life, and how narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he escaped her husband the last time, so that for very pittie and compassion, she was moued to fauour him, and no woman could be so hard harted, as to suffer so true and kind a yong man to languish for her loue, and die vnregarded: for on my life mother (saith she) if I had not yéelded, he would haue dyed for thought.</p>

My maister (saith she) I neuer saw a man in that taking: I dare say that since yesterday morning when this misfortune happened, he hath not eaten one crum, dranke one drop, or slept one winke all yesternight. To day he sat downe to dinner, and put one bit in his mouth, but could not swallow it, for he spit it out presently, and sat a good while after in a dumpe: In the end striking his knife on the table, he rose hastily, and went into the garden, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately came in againe: To be short, he is altogether out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and can rest no where: he doth nothing but sigh and sob, and he lookes like a dead man: hereat they laugh apace, and to be short, they determine that two of the chiefe of them, shall goe and speake with him the next morning, and that when they are in the midst of their talke the rest shall come in afterward. The mother with her two Gossips, according to this plot doe procéede in the matter. And next morning finding him in his dumpes, one of them gentilly askes him what he ayles: hereto he answeres onely with a sigh: whereupon she takes occasion thus to speake.

               <p>Ah Gossip (saith shee) if my Daughter were in fault, by our good Lord I would kill her my selfe. But thinke yée I haue no cause to be moued, when I sée my childe, being guiltles thus v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? With that shee flings out of doores in a rage, and all the Gossips come vppon him thicke and thréefolde, who is so full of sundrie thoughts, and so grieued and troubled, that hee knowes not whereon to resolue, nor what to say.</p>
               <p>In the ende they growing somewhat calmer, promise, if hee will, to vndertake the reconciling of him and his W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s, which
<pb facs="tcp:16146:40"/>
hee most earnestly desireth them to doe.</p>
               <p>They accordingly performe it, so that all controuerties are ended, all strife ceased, the matter hushed vp, and his Wife ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken home againe, who taking greater courage by the successe hereof, and being now cleane past shame, will growe farre bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in her villainy then before. And hée poore Meacocke, on the other side, hauing his courage thus quailed, will neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fall at oddes with her, for feare of the like storme, but will suffer her to haue her owne saying in all things, and bée in a manner subiect to her, spending the remnant of his life, in care, feare, discontent and griefe, his Goods wasting hée knowes not how, and himselfe become a laughing stocke to all that knowes him.</p>
