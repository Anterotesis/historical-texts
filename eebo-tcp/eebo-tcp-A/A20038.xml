         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This lustie youth (as I earst said) seeing them already in this maze of bitter sweetnes, he goes round about, turmoyling himselfe in seeking an entrance, and taking such paines to finde his owne paine, that in the end, in he gets, when for the hast he makes, to haue a taste of these supposed delicates, he hath no leisure to thinke, or no care to prouide those things that are hereunto requisite. The iolly yonker be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus gotten in, doth for a time swim in delight, and hath no desire at all to wind him selfe out againe, till time and vse, which makes all things more familiar and lesse pleasing, doe qualifie this humor, then glutted with satietie, or pinched with penury, he may perhaps begin to see his follie, and repent as well his fondnes, as his too much forwardnes, but all too late, he must haue patience perforce: his wife must be maintained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her degr√©e, and withall (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>monly it happes she carie the right stomacke of a woman) slender maintenance will not serue, for as their mindes mount aboue their estates, so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wil they haue their abillements.

Why my sweet hart what ailes you, are you not well? I pray th√©e wife tell me, where lies thy griefe? or what is the cause of your discontent: wherevpon the vile woman fetching a d√©epe sigh, makes this answere. O husband God help me, I haue cause enough to gr√©eue, and if you knew all you would say so: but alas it is in vaine to tell you any thing, seeing that whatsoeuer I say, you make but light reckning of it: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is best for me to bury my sorrowes in silence, being out of hope to haue any help at your hands.

the world: doe you thinke that <hi>Law. Tom. &amp; N. M.</hi> (who were both suters to me) doe k√©epe their wiues so? no by cochs body, for I know the worst cloathes that they cast off, is better then my very best, which I weare on the cheifest dayes in the yeere: I know not what the cause is that so many good women die, but I would to God that I were dead too, that I might not tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you no more seeing I am such an eie sore vnto you. Now by my faith wife saith he, you say not well, there is nothing that I thinke too good for you, if my abillitie can compasse it. But you knowe our estate, we must doe as we may, &amp; not as we would, yet be of good cheare, and turne to me, and I will straine my selfe to please you, in this or any other thing. Nay for Gods sake let me alone, I haue no mind on such matters, and if you had no more desire therto then I, I promise you, you wou'd neuer tuch me. No wife (saith he) hoping so with a iest to make hee mery, by my honestie I sweare, I verily thinke that if I were dead, you would not be long without another husband. No maruaile sure saith she, I lead such a good life with you now. By my christian soule I sweare, there should neuer man kisse my lipps againe. And if I thought I should liue long with you, I would vse meanes to make my selfe away: herewithall she puts finger in the eye making shew as though she wept. Thus plaies she with the sillie sot her husband (meaning nothing lesse then to doe as she saies) while he poore foole is in mind both wel and ill apaid, he thinkes himselfe well, because he imagines hee of a cold constitution, and therefore exceeding chast: he thinkes himselfe ill, to s√©e her fained teares, for that he verily supposes she loues him, which doth not a little gr√©eue him, being so kind and tender hearted. Therefore he vseth all meanes possible to make her quiet, neither wil he giue her ouer, till he hath effected it. But she prosecuting her former purpose, which she hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie set in so faire a forwardnes, makes as though she were nothing moued with his gentle perswasions; Therefore to crosse him, she gets her vp betimes in the morning, sooner a great deale then she was wont, pouting and lowring all the day, &amp; not giuing him one good word.

and they againe both in bed, laying her selfe sullenly downe, and continuing still silent, the good man harkens whether she sl√©ep or no, feeles if she be wel couered or not, he softly plucks vp the cloaths vpon her, lapping her warme, being dubble diligent to please her ying all this while winking, noting his kindnes and carefulnes towards her, s√©emes on a suddaine to awake from a sound sl√©epe, gruntling and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By lady wife, and so I doe: and since yesternight I haue bethought me (hauing well considered your words) that it is very meete and requisite, that you should be better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with apparell then heretofore you haue bene, for ind√©ed I must confesse thy cloaths are too simple. And therfore I mean against my cousin <hi>M.</hi> wedding (which you know wil be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that you shall haue a new gowne, made on the bell fashion, with all things sutable thereunto, in such sort that the best wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the parish shall not passe you.

Before God, saith another, I had rather s√©e my husbands eyes out then he should serue me so: therefore if you be wise vse him not to it: neither in this sort let him tread you vnder foole: I tell you it is a foule shame for him, and you may be well assured sith he begins thus, that hereafter he will vse you in the same order, if not worse. In good sooth saith the third, it s√©emes very straunge to me, that a wise woman, and one of such parentage as you are, who as all men knowes is by blood farre his better, can endure to be thus vsed by a base companion: Blame vs not to speake good Gossip, for I protest the wrong that he doth you, doth likewise touch vs, and all other good women that are in yourcase.</p>
               <p>The Child wife hearing all this, begins to w√©epe, saying, Alas Gossip, I know not what to doe, or how to please him; he is so diuerse and wayward a man, and besides, he thinkes all too much that is spent.

               <p>THe next Humor that is by nature incident to a woman, is, when the husband hath bin married nine or or ten yeares, <note place="margin">Being tyred with scolding, as a hackney Iade with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</note> hath fiue or sixe children, hath passed many euill daies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet nights, and troubles aforesaid, hath his lustie youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes spent, so that it is now high time for him to repent: But such is his grosse folly that he cannot, and such his dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, through the continuall vexations, which haue tamed and we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

First, that they may be the sooner sued vnto by lustie gallants: Secondly, because his denying hereof, should nothing auaile: for his wife which knowes his daughters humors by her owne, when she was of the like yeares, will s√©e that they shall want nothing: Thirdly, they peraduenture, bearing right womens mindes, if their father k√©epe them short, will finde some other friends that shall affoord it them. The poore man being thus perplexed on all sides, by reason of the excessiue charges which he must be at, will (as it is likely) be but honestly attired himselfe, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how he goes so he may rubbe out, be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:16146:14"/>
once plunged in the perplexing Ponde, or rather (Pounde of Wedlocke and House-keeing: for howsoeuer, when hee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the aforesaide charges and troubles, hee begins to haue no ioye of himselfe, and is no more mooued then a tyred Iade, which forceth not for the spurre: Yet for the furnishing of his Wife and Daughters, so that hee may haue peace at home, and enioy an easie bondage, hee must trudge vp and downe earlie and late about his businesse, in that course of life which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth;</p>
               <p>Sometimes he iourneys thirtie or fortie miles off, about his affaires: Another time, twice so farre to the Tearme of Assises, concerning some olde matter in Lawe, which was begunne by his Graund father, and not yet towards an ende, hee pulles on a paire of Bootes of seuen yeares olde, which haue beene cobled so ofte, that they are nowe a foote too short for him, so that the toppe of the Boote reaches no further then the calfe of his legge, he hath a paire of Spurres of the olde making, whereof the one wants a Rowell, and the other for want of Leathers, is faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his foote with a poynt: Hee puttes a laced Coate on his backe, which hee hath had sixe or seuen yeares, which he neuer wore but vppon High-dayes, whose fashion is growne cleane out of request, by reason of new inuented Garments; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer sports or pleasures he lights on (by the way on his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, hee takes no ioy in them, because his minde is altogether on his troubles at home, hee fares hard by the way, as also his poore Horse, (if he haue any) his man followes him in a'turnde sute, with a sword by his side, which was found vnder a hedge at the siege of <hi>Bull<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:16146:15"/>
rests no where by the way. And hereby it chaunteth that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times he comes home at such an houre, as is as neare mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as to night, and findes nothing to eate, for his Wife and Seruants are in bed, all which hee takes patiently, being now well vsed to such entertainement: Surely for my part, that God sends such aduersitie and distresse to those only whose good and milde nature, he knowes to be such, that they will take all things in good part.</p>
               <p>But to proc√©ede, it is very likely that the poore man is very weary, his heart heauy, by reason of the care and thought which he hath of his businesse; and it may be (h√©e lookes to be welcome to his owne house, and there to refresh himselfe) howsoeuer he forgets not his former vsage. But it falls out otherwise, for his wife begins to chide; whose words carries such a sway with the Seruants, that whatsoeuer their Maister saith, they make small account of it; but if their Mistresse command any thing it is presently done, and her humor followed in all things, else must they packe out of seruice: so that it bootes not him to bid them doe any thing, or rebuke them for not doing it: And his poore man that hath bene with him, dares not likewise open his mouth to call for any Uictualls to comfort himselfe, or for the Horses, least they should suspect him to be of his Maisters fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (who being wise, and of a quiet and milde nature) is loth to make any stirre, or br√©ede any disquietnes in the house, and therefore takes all in good part, and sits him downe farre from the Fire, though hee be very colde: But his wife and children stand round about it, but all their eyes are cast on her, who lookes on her Husband with an angrie countenance, not caring to prouide ought for his supper; but contrariwise taunts him with sharpe and shrewish sp√©eches, whereto for the most part, he answers not a word, but sometimes (perhaps being vrged, through hunger or wearines, or the vnkindnes of his wife) he doth thus vtter his minde. Well Wife, you can looke well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to your selfe, but as for me, I am both wearie and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, hauing neither eaten nor drunke all this day, and being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side wet to the very skinne, yet you make no reckoning to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide any thing for my supper.</p>
               <p>

Ah (quoth shee) you doe well to beginne first, least I should, which haue most cause to speake: Haue you not done very well (thinke yee) to take your man with you, and leaue me no bodie to white the Cloathes? Now before God, I haue had more losse in my Linnen, then you will get this Twelue-month. Moreouer, you shutte the Henne-roost doore very well, did you not? when the Fore got in, and eate vp foure of my best broode-Hennes, as you (to your cost will soone finde) by the masse: if you liue long, you will be the poorest of your Kinne. Well wife (saith the Good-man) vse no such wordes I pray you, God be thanked I haue enough, and more shall haue when it pleaseth him: and I tell ye, I haue good men of my Kinne. But quoth shee, I knowe not where they bee, nor what they are worth. Well (saith he) they are of credite and abilitie too. But for all that (quoth shee) they doe you small good. As much good (saith hee) as any of yours. As any of mine (saith shee,) and that she spake with such a high Note, that the house rung withall, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: By Cocks-soule, were it not for my Friends, you would doe but sorily.</p>
               <p>Well good wife (saith hee,) Let vs leaue this talke; Nay, (saith shee) if they heard what you saide, they would answere you well enough. The good-man holds his peace, fearing least shee should tell them, being of greater abilitie then hee was, and besides, because hee was loth that they should be offended with him. Then one of the Children falls a crying, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, which his Father loued best, whereupon the Mother pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently tooke a rodde, turned vp the Childes taile, and whipt him well fauoredly; and the more to despight and anger her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, then for ought else. The good-man being herewith some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what moued, wills her to leaue beating the Childe, shewing by his bended browes that he was not a little angrie at her doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Now gyp with a murren (quoth she) you are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with them, they cost you nothing, but it is I that haue all the paines with them night and day.

fiue Egges: In good faith Syr, it is a shame for you, that at your comming home, when all the whole house should be glad thereof, that you should contrari wise put it thus out of quiet; Saith he, (is it I that make this stirre?)</p>
               <p>Then is the whole Household against him, when hee s√©eing himselfe thus baited on all sides, (and the match so vnequall,) gets tim to Bed quietly without his Supper, all wette and dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; or if he doe suppe he hath but thinne fare: and being in Bedde, where hee should take his rest, hee is so disquieted with the Children, whom the Nurse and his Wife (doth on purpose set on crying,) to anger him the more, that for his life he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sl√©epe one winke.</p>
               <p>Thus is he vexed with continuall troubles, wherwith he s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be well pleased, and would not though he might be fr√©e from them, but doth therein spend his miserable and vnhappy life.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. The humor of a Woman that marries her inferior by Byrth.</head>
               <p>A Woman inclined to another kinde of humour, which is, when the Husband hath bene married, and hath passed so many troubles, that he is wearyed therewith, his lustie youthfull blood growne colde, is matched with a Wife of better birth then himselfe, and perhaps yonger, both which things are very dangerous, and no wise man should seeke his owne spoyle, by wrapping himself in either of those bonds, because they are so repugnant, that it is both against reason and nature to accord them. Sometimes they haue Children, sometimes they haue none; yet this notwithstanding, the Wife can take no paines, yet must be maintained according to her degr√©e, to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands exc√©eding charges: for the furnishing whereof, the poore Man is forted to take extreame toyle and paines, and yet for all this, thankes God, for vouchsafing him so great a grace, as to be matcht with her: If now and then they grow to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¶</desc>
                  </gap>ot words together (as ofte it happens) then presently in vpbraiding and
<pb facs="tcp:16146:16"/>
menacing sort she tels him, that herfriends did not match her to him to be his drudge, and that she knowes well enough of what linage she is come, and will brag withall, that when she list to write to her friends and kinsmen they will presently fetch her away. Thus doth she keepe him in awe, and in a kinde of seruitude, by telling him of them, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps haue matcht her better, and not with him, but for some priuie scape that she hath had before, whereof the poore soule knowes nothing, or if perhaps he hath heard some inkling thereof, yet because he is simple, the credit that he might giue thereunto is quickely dasht, by a contrarie tale of others sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornd by them, who perchance will not sticke to sweare that this is a slaunder raised by euill tongues, and forged maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously against her, as the like is done against many other good women, whose good names are wronged, and brought in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion by bad persons on their tipling bench, because themselues cannot obtaine their purpose of them: notwithstanding, if her husband be not able to maintaine her according to her minde, then will she be sure to haue a friend in store, that shall afford it her: if her husband denie it, and in the end she remembers that such a Gentleman at such a feast proffered her a diamond, or sent her by a messenger some 20, or thirtie crownes, which she as then refused, but now purposeth to giue him a kind glance, to renew his affection, who conceiuing some better hope, and m√©eting soone after with her chamber maid, as she is going about some busines, cals to her, saying; Sister, I would faine speake with you. Sir quoth she, say what you please. You know (quoth he) that I haue long loued your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, without obtaining any fauour: but tell me I pray you, did she neuer speake of me in your hearing? In faith sit (saith she) neuer but well: I dare sweare she wishes you no harme. Before God sister saith the Gentleman, if you will shew me some kindnes herein, and doe my commendations to your mistresse, assuring her of my loue and loyaltie, it shall be worth a new gowne vnto you, meane while take this in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, with that he offers her a p√©ece of gold: She then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a lowe cursie, sayth: Sir, I thanke you for your
<pb facs="tcp:16146:17"/>
good will, but I will not take it. By my faith saith he but you shall, and with that he forceth it on her, adding these words: I pray you let me heare from you to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. She being glad of such a bootie, hyes her home, and tels her mistres how she met with a Gentleman that was in a passing good vaine: and to be short, after some questions vsed by her mistres, it appeares to be the very same man whom she would faine intrap. I tell th√©e saith she to her maide, if he be as kinde as he is proper, he were worthie to be any womans loue. Bel√©eue me mistres (saith the maide) <note place="margin">A maid sit for such a mistres.</note> his very countenance shewes that he is kind, it s√©emes that he was onely made for loue, and withall he is wealthie, and thereby able to maintaine her beautie, and her person in brauerie whom he affects. By this light (saith the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres) I can get nothing of my husband. The more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you (saith the maide) to be so vsed. Alas quoth she what should I doe, I haue had him so long, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now set my heart on any other. Tush (quoth the maid) it is a folly for any woman to set her heart so on any man, for you know they care not how they vse vs when they are once Lords ouer vs. Beside your husband though he would, yet cannot maintaine and k√©epe you according to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gr√©e: but he of whom I speake will furnish and maintaine you gallantly what garments soeuer you will haue: and what colour and fashion soeuer you like best, you shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently haue it, so that there wants nothing else, saue onely a quaint excuse to my Maister, making him bel√©eue you had it by some other meanes. By my troth quoth her mistres, I know not what to say. Well mistres (saith the maid) aduise you well, I haue promist to giue him an answere to morrow morning. Alas (saith the other) how shall we doe? Tush mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres (answeres the maid) let me alone: As I goe to morrow to the market I am sure he will watch to meete with me, that he may know what newes, then I will tell him that you will not agr√©e to his desire for feare of discredit, this will giue him a little hope, and so we shall fall into further talke, and I doubt not but to handle the matter well enough. According to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb facs="tcp:16146:17"/>
next morning to market she hies, somewhat more earely then she was wont, and by the way she m√©etes with this lustie gallant, who hath waited for her at least thr√©e houres, he hath no sooner spyed her, but he presently makes towarde her, and at her comming, thus salutes her: Sister, good morrow, what newes I pray, and how doth your faire mistresse? I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faith sir (saith she) she is at home very pensiue, and out of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, I thinke that neuer any woman had such a froward husband. Ah villaine (saith he) the diuell take him. Amen (saith the maide) for both my mistresse and all the seruants are wearie with tarrying with him. Out on him slaue (saith he) but I pray you tell me what answere gaue your mistresse touching my sute? In faith (quoth she) I spake vnto her, but she would not agr√©e thereunto, for she is wonderfully afraide to purchase her selfe discredit, and is beside plagued with such a froward and suspitious husband, that although she were neuer so willing, yet could she not, being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally watcht by him, his mother and brethren: I thinke on my conscience vnlesse that it were that she spake to you the other day, the poore woman talkt not with any man these foure moneths, yet she speakes very often of you, and I am well assured that if she would bend her minde to loue; she would choose you before all men in the world. He being raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with these words, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In good faith (saith she) I haue done more for you alreadie then euer I did for any man in my life. And thinke not (saith he) that I will be vnmindfull of your kindnes, but what would you counsell me to doe? Ifaith sir (saith she) I thinke it best that you should speake with her your selfe, and now you haue an excellent opportunitie, for my maister hath refused to giue her a gowne, whereat she stormes not a little, you shall doe well therefore to be to morrow at the Church, and there salute her, telling her boldly your desire: you may also offer her what you thinke good<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but I know she will take nothing: marrie she will thinke the better of you, knowing thereby your franke and bountifull nature. Oh (saith he) I would she would gladly

take that, which I would gladly bestowe on her. Nay, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres the maide, I know she will not, for you neuer knewe a more honest woman: but Ile tell ye, how yee may doe it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: Looke what ye purpose to bestowe on her, you shall deliuer vnto me, I will doe my best to perswade her to take it, but I cannot assure you that I shall preuaile. Surely sister (saith he) this is very good counsell: herewithall they part, and she returnes home, laughing to her selfe, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Marrie (saith the maide) this lustie Gentleman is all on fire, to morrow he will be at Church, purposing there to speake with you: now must you demeane your selfe wisely, and make very strange of it, but stand not off too much least you dismay him cleane: as you will not wholly graunt, so must you f√©ede him with some hope. Shee, hauing her lesson thus taught her by her maide, gets her vp betimes the next morning, and to the Church shee goes, where this amorous gallant hath awaited for her comming euer since foure a clocke. She being set in her pew, makes shew as if she were deuoutly at her prayers, when (God wot) her deuotion is bent to the seruice of another Saint: it were worth the noting to s√©e how like an image she sits: and yet for all her demurenes, she applies all her fiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and that full zealously in this new humor of religion. To be short, he steales vnto her, sneaking vnto her, from the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey vnto her pew, and being come, gr√©etes her after the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous order, and from greeting, he fals to courting, whereto she doth in no wise y√©eld consent, neither will she take ought that he offers, yet answeres him after such a sort, that he doth thereby assuredly gather that she loues him, and stickes onely for feare of discredit: whereat he is not a little ioco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All this while I will haue in my keeping that which hee will giue you, for he hath appointed to deliuer it me to morrow, and I will make him belieue, that you would by no meanes take it. But when the matter is brought to this passe, then will I make shewe to offer you his gift before him, t√©lling you, that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bestowe it on you, to buy you a Gowne-cloth withall; Then must you chide, and seeme to be angrie with mee for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, charging mee to deliuer it backe againe to him, but be sure I will lay it vp safe enough.

a little further: I know she loues you well, and as good happe is my Maister is not now in towne, if you therefore will be about the doores towards sixe of the Clocke at night I will let you in, and so conney you secretly into my Mistres chamber, who doth sleepe very soundly; for you know she is but young, being there I could with you goe to bed so her, and for the rest you n√©ede not (I trust) any tutor: I protest that I know no other meanes for <note place="margin">Iust as Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans lippes.</note> the compassing of this matter, perhaps it will fadge: For it is a great matter, when a Louer and his Mistres are both together naked and in the darke, which doth helpe forward a Womans conceit, to that which in the day time perhaps she would hardly graunt. O my sw√©et friend (qd. he) for this kindnes my Purse shall be at thy command. To be short, night comes, he is there according to promise, whom she straight conueyes into her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse chamber; then he presently vnclothes himselfe, and steps softly into her Bedde, and being once in, h√©e begins to embrace her: hereat (she that s√©emes till then asl√©epe) starts vp on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and with a fearfull voyce asks who is there? It is I sw√©et Mistres (saith he) feare nothing. Ah (qd. she) thinke you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile thus? No, no, and with that she makes as thogh she would rise, and call her maide, who answeres not a word; but alas for pittie, like an vndutifull seruant leaues her at her greatest n√©ed. She therefore (good woman) s√©eing that shee is forsaken; sayes with a sigh, Ah me, I am betraid: then begin they a stout battell, He vrging his aduantage, shee faintly resisting, but alas what can a naked woman doo against a resolute Louer? there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no other remedie, but that at length (poore soule,) being ont of breath with striuing, she must n√©edes yeelde to the stronger; shee would faine haue cried out (God wot) had it not beene for feare of discredit; for thereby her name might haue bin brought in question, therefore all things considered, she doth vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God knowes, let him supplie her husbands place, garnishing his temple, for pure good will, with <hi>

               <head>CHAP. VI. The Humor of a Woman that striues to maister her Husband</head>
               <p>THe next humor wherevnto a Woman is addicted, is, when the Husband hath got a faire young Wife, who is proper and fine, in whome hee takes great delight; yet perhaps she is bent altogether to crosse, and thwart: the man being of a kinde and milde nature, louing her entierly, and maintaines her as well as he can, notwithstanding her frowardnesse: It may be also that she hath care of his credite and honestie, and doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre such leaudnesse, as shee of whome we spake before did vse, yet hath shee neuerthelesse an extreame desire of Soueraigntie, (which is knowne a common fault amongst Women) and to be her Husbands commaunder, and a busie medler in his matters; be hee a Iudge, a Nobleman, or Gentleman, she will take vpon her to giue sentence, and answere Suters, and whatsoeuer shee doeth he must stand to it.</p>
               <p>This is, (I say) a generall imperfection of Women, be they neuer so honestly, neuer so kindly vsed, and haue neuer so much wealth and ease, to striue for the Br√©eches, and be in odde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie humours, of purpose to keepe her Husband in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thought and care how to please her.</p>
               <p>He gets him vp betimes in the morning, leauing her in Bed, to take her ease, while hee stirres about the house and dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his busines, looks to the seruants that they loyter not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

No (saith he) I will neither sit downe, nor eate a bit till she be here; So receiuing his second message by his Maid, or perhaps by one of his children, replyes thus; Go tell him againe that I will not dine to day. He hearing this, is not yet satisfied, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sometimes it may be she will, and then he must leade her by the hand like a bride, and set her chaire rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for her, meane while it is so long before he can get <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sometimes the good man ryding abroad about his businesse, m√©etes with two or thr√©e of his friends, with whom perhaps he hath some dealings, and hath bene long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them: It may be also that he inuites them home to his house, as one friend will doe to another, and sends his man before to his wife to make all things readie in the best sort that she can for their entertainment: the poore seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gallops in such hast, that both himselfe and his horse is all on a sweate, when he comes home he doth his ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now by my faith (saith she) I will not meddle in it, he thinkes belike that I haue nothing else to doe, but drudge about to prepare banquets for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, he should haue come himselfe with a vengeance, and why did he not? Forsooth (saith the seruant) I know not, but thus he bad me tell you. Go too (saith she) you are a knaue that meddles in more matters then you haue thanke for. The poore fellow hearing this holds his peace, she in a fume stings vp into her chamber, and which is worse, sends out her seruants, some one way, some another: as for her maydes, they haue
<pb facs="tcp:16146:21"/>
their lesson taught them well enough, knowing by custome how to behaue themselues to wearie their maister: well, he comes home to his aforesaid friends, calls presently for some of his seruants: but one of the maides make answere, of whom he demaunds whether all things be readie: In good faith sit my mistresse is very sicke, and here is no body else can doe <note place="margin">Oh fetch the aqua vitae bottle quickly.</note> any thing: with that he being angry, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>des his friends into the hall, or some other place according to his estate, where he findes neither fire made, nor cloath laide. Iudge then in what a taking he is, although it may be that his friends percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the sending of his man, that his commaundements were not of such force as an act of parliament. The good man being ashamed, calls and gapes, first for one man then for an other, and yet for all this there comes none, except it be the scullion or some chare woman, that both vse his house, whom his wife hath left there of purpose, because sh√©e knew they could serue to doe nothing. Being herewith not a little mooued, vp he goes into his wiues chamber, and thus speakes vnto her: Gods precious woman, why haue ye not done as I wild ye? Why (saith she) you appoint so many things to be done that I know not what to doe. Before God (saith he) and with that scratches his head, you haue done me a greater displeasure then you thinke: these are the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest friends that I haue, and now here is nothing to set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Why (quoth she) what would you haue me to doe? I wis if you cast your cards well, you shall finde that we haue no n√©ede to make banquets: I would to God you were wiser, but sith you will needes be so lustie, euen goe through with it your selfe on Gods name, for Ile not meddle with it. But what the diuellment ye (saith he) to send all the seruants abroad?

haue spent a hundred crownes then it should so haue fallen out. But she cares not a whit, being well assured, that howsoeuer she thwarts him, he will hold his hands, and in scolding she knowes her selfe to be the better. To be short, the poore man being vexed, with shame and anger, runnes vp and downe the house, gets as many of his seruants together as he can: If his prouision be but slender at ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the maide an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres him that he can haue none. Then vp to his wife goes he againe, and tels her that his friends doe intreate her to come downe and bare them companie, shewing her what a shame it is, and how discourteously they will take it if she come not: And finally, he vseth all the fairest speeches that he can to haue her come, and to welcome and entertaine them for his credites sake. Nay in faith (quoth she) I will not come, they are too great states for my companie, and no doubt they would scorne a poore woman as I am: It may be sh√©e will goe, but in such sort, and with such a countenance, that it had bene better for him she had not come at all, for his friends will somewhat perceiue by her lookes, and gesture, that howsoeuer they be welcome to the good man, she had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue their roome then their company. But if she refuse to come (as it is the more likely) then will he aske her for the best to well, table-cloth and napkins. Napkins (quoth she) as though those that be abroad alreadie be not good enough for greater and better men then they are: when my brother or any of my kinsmen come, which are I wis their equals in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry respect, they can be content to be serued with them: but were these your guestes neuer so great, yet could I not now fulfill your request, though my life should lie on it: for since morning I haue lost my keyes of the great chest where all the linnen <note place="margin">Oh lyer, lyer.</note> lies: I pray you bid the maide looke for them, for in good truth I know not what I haue done with them, and no maruell, for I haue so much to doe, that I know not how to bestir my selfe: well I wotte, I haue spoyled my selfe with continuall care and trouble.
<pb facs="tcp:16146:22"/>
Now in good faith (quoth he) you haue drest me fairely, but it is no matter: Before God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¶</desc>
                  </gap>le breake open the chest. Now surely then (quoth she) you shall doe a great act, I would faine see you doe it, I would for my part you would breake all the chestes in the house. The poore man hearing her in these termes, knowes not well what to doe, but takes that which he next lightes on, and therefore shifts as well as he can: he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his guestes to sit downe at the table, and because the beere then a broach is on tilt, and therefore not very good, he bids one of the seruants broach a new barrell and fill some fresh drinke, but then there is neither tap nor spigget to be found, for his wife of purpose hath hidden them out of the way. Towards the end of the dinner he cals for cheese, and fruite, but there is none in the house, so that he is faine to send to the neighbours for the same, or else be vtterly desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: meane while his boy being at the table with the guestes, at last tels them how his mistresse faines her selfe sicke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is not pleased with their maisters comming. Well when bed time comes, he can get no cleane sheetes nor pillow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeres, because forsooth the keyes are lost, so that they must be content to lie in those that be foule, and haue bene long laine in. The next morning they get them gone betimes, s√©eing by the good wiues countenance that they are nothing welcome. By the way their Lackies tell them what the Gentlemans boy reported, whereat they laught hartily, yet finde themselues agr√©eued, vowing neuer to be his guest any more. The husband also, getting him vp betimes in the morning, goes presently to his wife, and thus begins: By Iesus wife, I muse what you meane to vse me thus. I know not how to liue with you. Then she replies saying: Now God for his mercy, am I so trouble, some? God wot I am euery day (poore soule) troubled with k√©eping your hogs, your geese, your chickens, I must card, I must spin, &amp; continually k√©epe the house, looke to the seruants, and neuer sit still, but toyling vp and downe to shorten my daies, and make me die before my time, and yet I cannot haue one houres rest, or quietnes with you, but you are alwaies brawling, &amp; doe nothing your selfe, but spend &amp; wast your goods

               <head>CHAP. VII. ¬∂ The humor of a couetous minded Woman.</head>
               <p>THe next humor belonging to a Woman is, when the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is matched to a modest ciuil woman, who is nothing giuen to that thwarting and crossing humour whereof I spake before. But be she good or bad, this is a generall rule ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiues hold and stedfastly belieue, that their owne Husbands are worst of all others. It oft happens that when they match to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they are both young, &amp; entertaine each other with mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all delights, so much as may be, for a yeare or two, or longer; till the vigor of youth grow colde. But the woman droopes not so soone as the man; the reason whereof is, because she takes no care, thought, nor griefe, breakes not hor sl√©epe, and troubles not her head as hee doeth, but doth wholly addict her thoughts to pleasure and solace. I denie not, that when a Woman is with Childe, shee bides many times great paines, and is often verie ill at ease, and at the time of her deliuerance, shee is for the most part, not onely in exc√©eding paine, but also in no lesse daunger of death: But all this is nothing to the Husbands troubles, on whose handes alone restes the wholecharge, and waight of
<pb facs="tcp:16146:23"/>
maintaining the house, and dispatching all matters, which is oftentimes intangled so with controuersies, and so thwarted with crosse fortune, that the Poore man is tormented with all veration of minde.</p>
               <p>Being thus wearied, and as it were worne away with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall griefe, troublous cogitations, toyle and trauell, haue no minde on any other pleasure; whereas shee on the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

You may be well assured, that this change in him, makes her also change her countenance; from Mirth and ch√©erefulnes, to lowring Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalie, seeking occasions of disagreements, and vse them in such sort, that their former loue and kindnes was not so great, as are now their brawles, iarres, and discords. It doth also ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>times happen, that the Woman by this meanes wastes and consumes all, giuing leaudly away her Husbands goods, which hee with great paines and cares hath gotten. The Good-man, he goes euery way as neare as hee can, and warily containes himselfe within his bounds, casting vp what his yearely Reuenues are, or what his gaine is by his profession, bee it Marchandize or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then what his expences be; which he finding greater then his commings in, begins to bite the lip, and becomes very pensiue: his Wife and he being afterwards priuate together in their chamber, he speakes thereof vnto her in this manner. In faith Wife, I much maruel how it comes to passe that our goods goe away thus, I know not how? I am sure I am as rarefull as a man can be, I can not finde in my heart to bestow a new coate on my selfe; and all to saue monie. By my troth Husband (saith she) I do as much maruell at it as you: I am sure for mine owne parte, that I goe as neere in Housek√©eping euery way as I can.</p>
               <p>To be short, the poore-man not doubting his wife, nor suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her ill carriage, after long care and thought, concludes, that the cause thereof is his owne ill Fortune, which k√©epes him downe, and crosseth all his actions with contrary successe, but it may be that in processe of time, some Friend of his (being more

And it may be her Mother makes her a signe to giue ouer, fearing that shee doth not play her part well.</p>

Hee being rauisht with these words, and yeelding her infinite thankes, trots presently to the Mother, to get her good will.</p>

But in the midst of this their mutuall loue and sollace, it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that she dies, whereat hee grieues so extreamely, that hee is almost beside himselfe with sorrowe: hee mournes, not onely in his Apparell, for an obtward shewe, but vnfainedly, in his very heart; and that so much, that hee shunnes all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of pleasure, and all companie, liues solitarily, and spends the time in daily complaintes and mones, and bitterly bewailing the losse of so good a wife, wherin no man can iustly bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But on the other side, a Young man cannot loue an olde Woman, howsoeuer hee doth dissemble, neither is there any, that more endaungers his death: for it is with him, as with one that drinketh mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But now to returne to our Young-man, yoakt (as before I said) to this old Widow, I thus conclude, that his estate is most miserable: For besides the daunger of his health, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>If hee goe to any of her Friends about businesse, yea, to the Church to serue God, yet will shee alwayes thinke the worst, and assure her selfe, that hee playes false, though indeede he be neuer so continent; who whatsoeuer he pleadeth in his owne defence; yea, though hee proue himselfe blamelesse, by such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as shee can by no reason confute, yet will not all this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her: such is the peruersenesse of her stubborne, crabbed, and malicious nature, made worse by Dotage and raging Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie: for being priuse to her owne de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

She repeates withall, how kindly and intirely he loues her, how much he hath bestowed on her, how many soule iournies he hath had for her sake, in raine and snow, as well by night as day, in danger of th√©eues, in perrill of his life, and how narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he escaped her husband the last time, so that for very pittie and compassion, she was moued to fauour him, and no woman could be so hard harted, as to suffer so true and kind a yong man to languish for her loue, and die vnregarded: for on my life mother (saith she) if I had not y√©elded, he would haue dyed for thought.</p>

               <p>This motion doth her Mother faintly contradict, but in the end most voyces preuailes, he is sent for, and comes with a trice; then there is much good chat, manie a reproach and kinde scoffe giuen the poore Husband: And to mend the matter comes in the Chamber-maide; who was priuie to all the former close packing betw√©ene her Mistresse and her sw√©ete heart, and for her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of them askes how her maister doth? My maister (saith she) I neuer saw a man in that taking: I dare say that since yesterday morning when this misfortune happened, he hath not eaten one crum, dranke one drop, or slept one winke all yesternight. To day he sat downe to dinner, and put one bit in his mouth, but could not swallow it, for he spit it out presently, and sat a good while after in a dumpe: In the end striking his knife on the table, he rose hastily, and went into the garden, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately came in againe: To be short, he is altogether out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and can rest no where: he doth nothing but sigh and sob, and he lookes like a dead man: hereat they laugh apace, and to be short, they determine that two of the chiefe of them, shall goe and speake with him the next morning, and that when they are in the midst of their talke the rest shall come in afterward. The mother with her two Gossips, according to this plot doe proc√©ede in the matter. And next morning finding him in his dumpes, one of them gentilly askes him what he ayles: hereto he answeres onely with a sigh: whereupon she takes occasion thus to speake. In good faith gossip I must chide you, my gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sip your wiues mother told me I know not what of a disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gr√©ement betw√©ene your wife and you, and a certaine fond hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor that you are fallen into: I wis I am sorry to heare it: And before God you are not so wise as I had thought you had bene, to wrong your wife thus without a cause, for I durst lay my life there is no such matter. By this good day (saith another) I haue knowne her euer since she was a little one, both maide and wife, and I neuer saw but well by the woman: And in good sooth it gr√©eues me to the very heart, that her name should now come in question without caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

face me downe of that which my selfe saw? Oh Gossip, (quoth one of the Dames) God forbid that euery man &amp; woman which is alone together should doe euill. I denie not (saith the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaide,) that the villainous Knaue hath long sued vnto my Mistresse for such a matter; but by my honesty Maister, I know that there is neuer a man aliue whom she hates most: and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then she would commit any such follie with him, she would see him hangd, and be burned her selfe: I maruell how the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill h√©e got into the house?</p>
               <p>Here the other Gossips come in, one after another, and each giues her verdit: In good faith (Gossip saith one) I thinke, that next your wife, there is neuer a woman in the world that loues you better then I doe: and if I knew or thought any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I would not let to tell you of it. Surely (saith another) this is but the Diuels work to set them at variance; for he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>not abide that Husband &amp; Wife should liue well together. In good faith saith the third, the poore woman doth nothing but weepe. By Christ, (qd the fourth) I feare it will cost her her life, she grieues and takes on in such sort. Then comes the Mother w√©eping and crying out, making as though shee would scratch out his eyes with her nailes; exclaiming in this sort.</p>
               <p>Ah cursed Caitiffe, woe worth the houre that euer my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matcht with th√©e, to be thus shamed and slandered, and haue her name spotted without cause. But shee is well enough ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that would take such a base Churle, when she might haue had sundry good Gentlemen. Ah good Gossip (saith another) be not out of patience.</p>
               <p>Ah Gossip (saith shee) if my Daughter were in fault, by our good Lord I would kill her my selfe. But thinke y√©e I haue no cause to be moued, when I s√©e my childe, being guiltles thus v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? With that shee flings out of doores in a rage, and all the Gossips come vppon him thicke and thr√©efolde, who is so full of sundrie thoughts, and so grieued and troubled, that hee knowes not whereon to resolue, nor what to say.</p>
               <p>In the ende they growing somewhat calmer, promise, if hee will, to vndertake the reconciling of him and his W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:16146:40"/>
hee most earnestly desireth them to doe.</p>
               <p>They accordingly performe it, so that all controuerties are ended, all strife ceased, the matter hushed vp, and his Wife ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken home againe, who taking greater courage by the successe hereof, and being now cleane past shame, will growe farre bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in her villainy then before. And h√©e poore Meacocke, on the other side, hauing his courage thus quailed, will neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fall at oddes with her, for feare of the like storme, but will suffer her to haue her owne saying in all things, and b√©e in a manner subiect to her, spending the remnant of his life, in care, feare, discontent and griefe, his Goods wasting h√©e knowes not how, and himselfe become a laughing stocke to all that knowes him.</p>
