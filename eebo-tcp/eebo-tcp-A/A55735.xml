            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all the Lovers of DARBY-ALE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I <hi>Have often wonder'd, That we, who are profess'd Lovers of this Liquor, should not have among us one Generous Son of</hi> Apollo <hi>that dare draw his Pen in the defence of our Cause; I am sure the universal Contagion of Dulness has not so overspread us, but we have</hi> Poetick Forces <hi>enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer any of our Opposers; yet were it otherwise, that a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness of Fancy had possess'd us, the Subject it self would (like the</hi> Ovidian Deo Agitante) <hi>point us out the Road to</hi> Parnassus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of</hi> Darby-Ale <hi>I own I'm a passionate Admirer, and no fond Amorist was ever more captivated with the Charms of his Mistress, than I with the Charms of its Brightness: Where there is Love, there is Admiration; and where Admiration, Respect: and from hence proceeds my Regret to have</hi> Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums <hi>cast upon the Object of my Wishes: when the sawcy</hi> I Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon, <hi>called,</hi> Sot's Paradice, <hi>at every Bookseller's star'd me in the face; I've been possess'd with Fury almost to Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; a long time I have fed my self with hopes of Revenge, that some new Champion would enter the Lists and foil the Pigmie Satyrist: Hitherto I have found my Expectation balk'd; but rather than our</hi> Divertive Clubbs, <hi>and</hi> Inspiring Liquor <hi>should suffer the stains and aspersions they now lie under, I chose to undertake the Combat my self, in hopes to put a stop to the growing Tyranny of</hi> Re-printing Sot's Paradice. <hi>This is the sole Reason that I have attempted</hi> An Encomium; <hi>and if my Poem has diminish'd the intrinsick Worth and Delight that our Liquor deserves, impute it rather to my unskilfulness in Fancy and Numbers, than the weakness of the Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gallant Souls are prov'd by their actions, and those actions are more conspicuous and noble which proceed purely from Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Resolution: I have serv'd several Campaigns under</hi> Darby-Ale, <hi>with success, and it would be very ungenerous (in this time of danger) to desert my Standard; had it no</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57166:3"/>
               <hi>secret Spell to engage me in its Service, I should not (like Mr.</hi> W—d) <hi>basely turn Traytor and Runagado from that which had done me such eminent Service; for, let him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue its Ruin with the utmost rack of Thought and Invention, and pretend what aversion he pleases, he ow's his</hi> Trip to Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, <hi>and some other of his best Compositions, to its Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, Gentlemen, since we have Enemies (and those too so potent) I hope you will not leave me to stand the shock of their Rage. I shall know your intentions by your favourable acceptance of this Piece; but, be it how it will (as</hi> Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas <hi>said to his Buckler, so say I to my Liquor)</hi> Me De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendas, &amp; Ego te Defendam, <hi>I have no more to add, but hope when this comes to your Hands, you will drink the Health of</hi>

               <l>When they assume some high Poetick task;</l>

               <l>'Tis <hi>Darby-Ale</hi> alone shall me Inspire;</l>
