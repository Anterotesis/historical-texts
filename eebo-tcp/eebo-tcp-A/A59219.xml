            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>FOURTH APPENDIX. Subverting Fundamentally and manifoldly my Ld. of <hi>Downs</hi> DISSUASIVE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. I Had observ'd my self and was inform'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers what harm my L. of <hi>Down's DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUASIVE</hi> did to divers persons; yet I found also that it wrought different Effects in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Readers according to their respective abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of understanding. Those who were tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly <hi>Intelligent</hi> universally dislikt it as a very weak and ungrounded Discourse; but the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> or rather <hi>meaner</hi> sort of Schollers who have sufficient capacity to apprehend the <hi>Sence</hi> of an Objection, yet not enough to weigh by Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and so comprehend the <hi>force</hi> of it, nor to distinguish between Church and Schools, much less the Sagacity to dive into the many Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries, Artifices, and Indirect dealings which mis-used Rhetorick can employ to delude men's eye-sight, were many of them startled, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd a high conceit of it. To which helpt, that their well-meaning and natural sincerity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them not to suspect, and so be aware of any deceit in a discourse manag'd all along with so much <hi>formal Gravity</hi> and showes of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Piety</hi> that could be: For a <hi>grave carriage</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63121:3"/>
where Nature is not perverted wilfully, the <hi>proper Effect</hi> of a sincere Earnestness and perfect <hi>Seriousness</hi> in the heart, and, <hi>Piety</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to be that which ought to heighten super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally that interiour disposition, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently apt to breed in the observer of them a conceit of the greatest <hi>Seriousness</hi> in the world; Nay even, to those who are very weak and mean well, it gains the Affecter of this way so much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that it persuades those who esteem them for it they have perfect Assuredness of what they so soberly write or affirm. Whence follows that this kind of grave and seemingly pious demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, especially if carry'd on with a Constancy, is the most Effectual Engin in the world to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigle rational souls which are not aware of the craft or by looking into Principles <hi>above</hi> it, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Discourser pleases: And I conceive our Country hath already so much felt its lamentable Effects out of Pulpits in the beginning of the late troubles, that all reflecters on it are sufficiently warn'd not to think all to be the solid gold of Truth which glitters with Saintly shows. Now, in this consists the most efficacious part of my L. of <hi>Downs Dissuasive;</hi> the rest, whether Reasons or Citations being very ordinary: And, 'twas this exceeding Plausibleness, and, by means of this, Harmfulness of that Treatise, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd me to alter my Resolution, and make the Answer to it a fourth Appendix to <hi>Sure-footing,</hi> which I had refused to the suggestion of my first
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63121:3"/>
Thoughts, hoping some other would lay it open more at large. But how shall I go about to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it: For, as <hi>Sampson's</hi> strength lay in his hair, the weakest part that can be found in a man, so the chief Virtue of the <hi>Dissuasive</hi> lies in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of its style; which being meer voluntary words and most unapt to make up Propositions expressive of connected Sence or to compile a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Discourse, 'tis by consequence the weakest peece of performance which can possibly spring from a reasonable Creature; Yet with this weapon I am soonest beat; nothing being more averse to my Genius than to <hi>Saint</hi> it in Scripture-phrases (a performance in which, I confess, a <hi>Quaker</hi> would easily worst me, and would even put the Dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himself very hard to it) especially in a <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy,</hi> which ought to be a severe proof of the Truth of the point under debate. The way then which sutes my humour best, and, as I hope, is most efficacious to conclude and satisfy, is to examin by Principles whether there be force of Truth at the bottome, grounding the Dislua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's long Invective. If there be, it ought to have all handsome advantages of Expressions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd it; If not, 'tis no more, as to the Harmony of Truth, but the running a great deal of divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon no Ground.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I shall suppose the Reader of this Appendix hath already perus'd &amp; weighed the force of my Reasoningsin SURE FOOTING; which done, he will easily comprehend the strength of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63121:4"/>
and the manifold weakness of my L. of <hi>Downs</hi> DISSUASIVE. All Truths being <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected,</hi> it follows that every Errour is by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence opposit to all Truths, and They to it. Hence each single Errour lies open to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed <hi>many wayes,</hi> if the method of Reason or <hi>Connexion</hi> be taken. I take therefore that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; because, by its priviledge of bringing things to First-Principles, 'tis apt to undermine and blow up Errour from its very Foundations. Eight several mines I lay to perform this Effect; each of which Wayes is alone sufficient to do my work.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>First Way.</head>
               <p n="3">3. THe First is to alledge that my L. of <hi>Downs</hi> has not one First or Self-evident Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to begin with, on which he builds his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasive</hi> from Catholick Faith. If I wrong him, let him do himself right by pointing it out and showing that 'tis opposit to our Churchees Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; which if he does, I here yield my self absolutely confuted. In the mean time I have proved that Traditiones Certainty is the <hi>First Principle of CONTROVERSY,</hi> and am confident in the Invincible force of Truth that all the Wit in the World cannot confute that position. And if it stands, he is convincet not onely to <hi>want</hi> the <hi>First Principle</hi> of the Science we are to discourse in, but (his Cause forcing him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63121:4"/>
Tradition's Certainty) to go point-blank <hi>against</hi> it, and so to invalidate to our hands all he shall write as a Controvertist; and how weakly he behaves himself where he goes about to lay other Principles, shall be shown when I come to answer his <hi>First Section.</hi> Now, seeing all Reason has force by relying on the Truth of the Premises, and they are known to be true either by being <hi>First Principles</hi> themselves, or by being finally resolvable into others which are such, it follows there can be no <hi>true Reason</hi> where there is no <hi>First Principle.</hi> Till he shows us then that he builds his Dissuasive on some First Principles, it will follow his whole Endeavour is to dissuade not by way of <hi>Reason</hi> but <hi>Fine Words,</hi> which are indeed the Substantiallest, strongest and most effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious part of his whole Book.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>Second Way.</head>
               <p n="4">4. THe Second Way is to exclude him all right to alledge either Scriptures, Fathers or Councils; I add, Reason, History or Instances, (See <hi>Corol.</hi> 12. 15, 16, 18, 19.) And, it is done thus. All discourse supposes that <hi>Certain</hi> on which it builds: But, if <hi>Tradition</hi> or the way of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down matters of Fact by the former Ages te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying can fail, none of these are <hi>Certain:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Protestant or Renouncer of Tradition cannot with Reason pretend to discourse out of any of these: that is, (Reason being Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63121:5"/>
he has lost his natural right to alledge any of these in way of proof. Now, that none of these are <hi>Certain</hi> if Tradition be renounc't is shown thus. Scripture's Letter as to its Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptedness, nay its very Being, is <hi>Uncertain</hi> alone, or without Tradition, as is confest by Protestants, and proov'd <hi>Sure-Footing</hi> Disc. 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. So are Fathers and Councils too; For, <hi>Fathers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eminent Witnessers to Immediate Posterity or Children of the <hi>Churches</hi> Doctrin <hi>received,</hi> and Councils Representatives of the Church, their strength as Proofs, nay their very Existence is not known till the notion of Church be known, which is part of their very Definition and to which they relate. Nor is the Being or Nature of Church known, till it be Certainly known who are truly <hi>Faithful</hi> or have <hi>true Faith,</hi> who not; which must be manifested by their having or not having the true <hi>Rule of Faith:</hi> Wherefore, since the Properties of the Rule of Faith do all agree to Tradition our Rule, and none of them to theirs, as was evidently and at large shown there in my five first Discourses: it follows, the Protestant or Renouncer of Tradition knows not what is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right Scripture, Father or Council; and so ought not to meddle with them, nor alledge them. Again, since pretended Instances of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Failing depend on History, &amp; Historical Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty cannot be built on dead Characters but on <hi>Living Sence</hi> in men's hearts deliver'd from age to age that those passages are true; that is, on
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:63121:5"/>
                  <hi>Tradition;</hi> it follows, that, if the way of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can fail, all History is <hi>Uncertain;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, all Instances as being matters of Fact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on History. And, lastly, since Reasons are fetch't from the <hi>nature</hi> of things, and the <hi>best Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in what it is, abstracting from disease or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Unalterable,</hi> is the Ground of the <hi>human part</hi> of Christian Tradition, and most incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble strength is superadded to it as it is <hi>Christian</hi> by the supernatural Assistances of the Holy Ghost (<hi>Disc.</hi> 9.) 'tis a wild conceit to think any piece of Nature or Discourse built on it can be held <hi>Certain,</hi> if Tradition (especially Christian Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) may be held <hi>Uncertain.</hi>

Protestants) to Assent to the <hi>contrary;</hi> which therefore must needs require the Evidentest Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod imaginable, obliging their Reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a man who takes this way of Discourse cannot but make good what he sayes; at least, that it may be strongly hop't from his method he will do it. This reflected on, let us weigh the <hi>Method</hi> my Ld. takes in his <hi>Dissuasive;</hi> and, if it be Evident to every ordinary capacity, that, as to the <hi>Godly</hi> part of it, the <hi>Quakers</hi> out-do him; and, as to its quoting part the <hi>Smectym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuans</hi> us'd the same against the Protestants to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute Episcopacy (for They too quoted and gloss'd Scriptures and Fathers both) and indeed every Sect that has not yet shaken of the shame to disrespect all Antiquity; then it is also Evident that this Method is <hi>Common</hi> to those Discourses which have in them <hi>power</hi> to satisfy the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and those who have <hi>no such power.</hi> Now, that being most evidently <hi>no</hi> Method or Way to such an Effect, which many follow and take, yet arrive <hi>not</hi> at that Effect, 'tis plain to Common Sence that my Ld. of <hi>Downs</hi> miscalls his Book a <hi>Dissuasive</hi> and that it can have in it <hi>no power</hi> of moving the Understanding one way or other, unless he can first vouch some Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in the Method <hi>he</hi> takes above whats in <hi>others,</hi> in which we experience miscarriage, and himself professes we, though taking it, miscarry in it. Let us then search after this Particularity in his way of writing. Is it that he brings some
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63121:6"/>
stronger or more unavoidable sort of Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies then were ever yet produc't by others? No: Every Scholler sees they are so common that they have been hundreds of times produc't, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (p. 1. &amp; 2.) acknowledges their vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But perhaps he invalidates all the Answers our Controvertists have given to those Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and presses them <hi>farther</hi> against us, beyond what any has done yet! Quite contrary. He barely and rawly puts them down as if this were the very first time they had seen light, nor takes the least notice of any Answer at all given to them formerly. But it may be he layes Grounds to distinguish and press home his Testimonies, and so gives them their full weight which others have not done. Alas, no; I fear he never thinks of that, but judges (if we may conclude from his carriage) the deed done, so he but <hi>quote;</hi> nor can I see <hi>one</hi> Principle laid in his <hi>whole</hi> Book strengthening any one Testimony by bringing it to its Ground, <hi>Experimental Knowledge</hi> in the Authour he cites, that the Churches constant Voice and Practice manifested this her Sence; but as they are put down carelesly, so they are past over slubberingly, without the least enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eing them by way of laying Principles: Is he at least Particular in his Sincerity and Ingenuity? I know not how they will be satisfied with it who read his late Adversary Impeaching him for the contrary Vices, and some passages in this present Appendix, Where, lies then this <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:63121:7"/>
in his Method, without which his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasive can never in reason be held Creditable? I speak ingenuously and from my heart; All the Particularity I can observe in it lies in these two things; First, that he huddles together multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of his own sayings, without any pretence of proof for the most part, and when he brings any they are such as we have spoken of. Next, that instead of enforcing his Proofs by way of Reason, he overflowes strangely with godly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Scripture-phrases; with which plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible manner of Expression most unreasonably and unnaturally he strives to combat the Wills of his Readers, before he hath brought any thing able to satisfy their Understandings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yet, though his Method have <hi>no</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in it as to its <hi>quoting</hi> part, who knows but it may be <hi>very particular</hi> as to its Rational part, that is, full of Proofs which conclude evidently or <hi>Demonstrations!</hi> But I am so far from <hi>feeling</hi> the <hi>force</hi> of any <hi>one</hi> such Proof in his whole Book that I cannot <hi>discern</hi> its very <hi>Existence,</hi> or even any <hi>Attempt</hi> of that kind; and I dare affirm my Ld. of <hi>Downs</hi> never meant it or dream't of it. If he have any such I request his Lp. would in his Reply single them out from all the Pious and Inconclusive Talk which swell his Book, and I promise them very heartily to lend them a due and respectful Confideration. But I am sure he will neither pretend he has any, nor attempt the having any if he but reflect that a <hi>Demonstration</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:63121:7"/>
is a Proof which has in it a virtue of <hi>obliging</hi> the Understanding to <hi>Assent,</hi> and that it obtains this virtue by building on <hi>Intrinsecal Mediums;</hi> that is, on <hi>Proper Causes</hi> or <hi>Effects,</hi> of which 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible the one should be without the other. This <hi>clearing Method</hi> onely the Champions of Truth <hi>dare take,</hi> and the Defenders of Errour <hi>must avoid</hi> under penalty of having their Cause quite ruin'd and crush't to pieces. And this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Method of finding Truth, relying on the Goodness of my Cause, I fear not to take and stick to in <hi>Sure-Footing</hi> as appears there by my <hi>Transition:</hi> which sufficiently shows the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity of <hi>my</hi> Method; I expect now my Ld. of <hi>Downs</hi> would show me the particularity of <hi>his,</hi> or renounce all right and Title to <hi>Dissuade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. I have been something longer about laying open the Necessity of a <hi>Proper Method to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade</hi> ere one can in reason hope to perform that <hi>Effect,</hi> because I see plainly that, in the pursuit of Truth, <hi>Method</hi> is in a manner <hi>ALL;</hi> and, that 'tis impossible any Controversy should hover long in debate if a right <hi>Method</hi> of concluding evidently were carefully taken and faithfully held to. I have told my Ld. of <hi>Downs</hi> where he may see mine; and I desire him earnestly as he loves Truth either to admit it as <hi>Conclusive</hi> and follow it, or show it <hi>Inconclusive</hi> and propose us a better to begin and proceed with Evidently: And, that I may more efficaciously endeavour to bring him, nay provoke him as far as I may
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63121:8"/>
with Civility, to a Method particular and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to dissuade, I declare here before all the world that I know his Cause to be so unable to bear it, and hope himself is so prudent, that he will never either venture to allow our Method competent to conclude evidently, nor yet go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to establish a better of his own.</p>

               <head>Fourth Way.</head>
               <p n="8">8. THe fourth Way of disanulling my Lp's whole Endeavours, is to speak <hi>ad hominem</hi> and challenge him thus. Your Grounds allow neither Fathers to be <hi>Infallible</hi> in any Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you produce from them to <hi>dissuade</hi> with, nor yet your self in interpreting Scripture; nor (I conceive) will you say that you see with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Certainty any Proposition you go about to deduce by Reason (if there be any such in your Dissuasive) to be necessarily consequent from any First or Self-evident Principle, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore You are <hi>Certain</hi> of nothing you alledge in your whole Book. If then His Lordship would please to speak out candidly, he ought to say; <hi>I know not Certainly that any thing I say against your Religion is true, yet notwithstanding I would fain dissuade you from holding the Faith of your Forefathers, and to relinquish a Religion you judge unalterable and hope to be sav'd by holding it.</hi> Which were it profest and deliver'd ingenuously as it lies at the very bottome of his heart,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63121:8"/>
his Lp's <hi>Dissuasive</hi> would be a pleasant piece, and lose all power to move any Child of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sence, nay the vulgar Reason of the wild <hi>Irish</hi> would be too hard for it. Now, that this ought in due candour to be profest, in case neither the Fathers nor Himself be Infallible in any saying or Proof of theirs, is thus Evidene't. For, since to be <hi>Infallible in None, hÃ®c &amp; nunc,</hi> (taking in the whole Complexion of assisting Circumstances) is the same as to be <hi>hÃ®c &amp; nunc Fallible in All,</hi> or <hi>Each,</hi> and if they be <hi>Fallible</hi> or <hi>may be deceived</hi> in <hi>Each,</hi> they can be <hi>Sure</hi> of <hi>None;</hi> it follows that who professes the Fathers &amp; Himself (though using all the means he can to secure him from Errour) <hi>Fallible in Each,</hi> must, if he will speak out like an honest man, confess he is <hi>Sure of None.</hi> Let then my Ld. of <hi>Downs</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vouch Infallible Certainty in himself reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Interpreting, or in the Authorities he cites, (I mean Infallible considering their endeavours in complexion with all the means on foot in the world to preserve them so) or else confess that, notwithstanding all means us'd by them they are in each Saying and Proof Fallible, and so him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>sure</hi> of never a Motive he brings to <hi>dissuade</hi> with. Now, to see so Eminent a Writer and chosen out on purpose (as he professes) by the whole Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> go about to combat a settled Persuasion, held sacred, unalterable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending from Christ by Attestation of Forefathers the Way to Bliss, &amp;c. and bring no better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:63121:9"/>
to do it but such as are (were he put to declare it and would speak out) <hi>confessedly Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,</hi> is so far from being a competent <hi>Dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> from Catholick Faith, that 'tis when laid open (which is here perform'd) as good a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasive</hi> for the Generality of Catholicks to hold stedfastly to it as man's Wit can invent; and far better to the weaker sort of Speculaters than to demonstrate the Infallibility of the Ground of Faith. Such advantage Catholick Faith gains by the Opposition from her Adversaries, if they be rightly handled, and their Discourses brought to Grounds.</p>

my Ld's case) it follows that if there be <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities</hi> for the other side, the way to <hi>dissuade</hi> from It is to put all those probable reasons in the opposit ballance, and then, by comparing them, show they have <hi>no</hi> considerable weight, counterpos'd to those he brings for <hi>his</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. Now, that there is <hi>no</hi> Probability for <hi>our</hi> side is very hard to be said, since the whole world sees plainly we still maintain the Field against them, nay dare pretend without fearing an absolute baffle (which must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low had we not at least Probabilities to befriend us) that our Grounds are Evidently and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrably Certain; nay more, dare venture to take the most clearing Method imaginable to stand or fall by, and withal are bold to challenge them that they have <hi>no</hi> Evident Grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with, nor dare venture to pursue that eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Method.

                  <hi>had a name.</hi> Thus he. By which words 'tis Evident we have Probabilities and high ones too, on our side; else how could they be able <hi>very easily to persuade persons of much reason?</hi> especially, they having as he sayes <hi>more piety;</hi> or <hi>more then much,</hi> that is <hi>very much;</hi> which argues rather that those motives for Catholick Faith were <hi>sutable to Piety</hi> or <hi>Truths;</hi> ot at least exceedingly-seeming-Pious; so as the <hi>great Piety</hi> of those persons, neither checkt at the practice according to those Motives, nor their <hi>much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> reach't to a discovery of their Fallaciousness. Whence, we may gather farther than those Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives so standing for us, are to be rankt in the highest degree of Probability. For since those Persons are confest to be very <hi>Pious,</hi> that is, very Good, and, so, unapt to be byast by Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and withal to have <hi>much Reason,</hi> 'tis plain the Cause of their Assent to Catholick Faith must be look't for in the Object, and have a wonderful appearance at least of Evidence or highest Probability which is able to conquer and satisfy so Rational and sincere Understandings.

deliverd faintly by himself though an Adversary, are such, as, had he laid them open at large as he does his own Objections, he would have been infinitely puzzled to find others to overballance them with any show of Reason. But I will not put him upon so large a task: Let him onely consider on what Grounds the Rule of our Faith is built, to wit on sensible and unmistakable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact from age to age, and this unmistaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness confirm'd supernaturally by the concern of the Thing, obliging the Beleevers best care to preserve it, and by the Goodness implanted in their hearts by Christ's Doctrin, which kept lively awake that care (as it is at large laid open in <hi>Sure-Footing</hi>) and then compare it with Descanting upon Scripture's Letter by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Skills, which is the Ground of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants Faith as contra-distinguish't from ours, (or rather of their Dissent or negative Tenets) and show those Grounds preponderating ours, and then his Reader will have some encouragement to heed his Dissuasive, otherwise he can have none.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Those of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, or Sayings of Writers on his own side are not worth mentioning: nor yet the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. or pieces of Scripture interpreted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; unless he will show us he proceeds on Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Principles in sencing them, which so force the meaning he gives them that they can possibly bear no other. Till he does this, all his glosses are presumable to have no other foundation but meer strength of Fancy; and since he professes (p. 9.) that his <hi>Dissuasive wholly relies</hi> on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is on the <hi>sence</hi> he conceives it to have, the common mode of interpreting Scripture by
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:63121:14"/>
Fancy which reigns so in the world, will make any sober man doubt, unless he show us the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Principles which necessitated his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that his whole Dissuasive is perfectly built on his own Imagination.</p>
               <p>The Dissuasive hath two or three other faulty Heads of Citations besides those mention'd; as <hi>Vnauthentick</hi> ones: such is <hi>Origens</hi> p. 98. and that against the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Synod p. 103. Those also which cite an Authour but no place where they are to be found as S. <hi>Cyril</hi> p. 99. And lastly, brought to impugn Faith, but speaking onely of Alterable practices, as those p. 123. which he is to show Authentick, well-cited and Pertinent; And as well of those as the former he is to make good if he will go to work like a solid man that they have in them the true nature of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, and such Certainty as may safely be rely'd on for Principles of those serious Discourses he makes upon them. See <hi>Sure-Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> p. 172, 173, 174.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But that I may do right to the Dissuader, I am to confess ingenuously that he has in him one Citation which hath in it the true nature of a <hi>Testimony,</hi> or depending on the Authour's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge had by <hi>Sence</hi> of the present Doctrin of the Church at that time. Now, though it be the Testimony only of one single Father, and so I am not in severity bound by Catholick Grounds which vouch onely <hi>Consensus Patrum,</hi> (which I understand to mean a Consent of so many and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:63121:14"/>
so qualify'd as is apt to convince) to answer it, and not at all by Protestant Grounds which yield them all Fallible; yet I have that regard for any thing that tends (though remotely) to <hi>Solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that I will even remit something of my own advantage to give it a respectful Consideration. The Testimony is of <hi>Gennadius</hi> cited by my L. p. 58, &amp; 59. thus. <hi>For, after Christ's Ascension into Heaven the Souls of all Saints are with Christ, and going from the body they go to Christ, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the resurrection of their body, with it to pass into the perfection of perpetual bliss.</hi> To which my Ld. subjoyns, <hi>and this he delivers as the Doctrin of the Catholick Church.</hi> I take this excellent Testimony as put down by himself, to do which the usage of St. <hi>Greg. Nazianzen's</hi> immediately foregoing, gives me small encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. In answer then, I affirm that this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony so insisted and rely'd on as against us, is as plain a declaration of the Faith of our Church at present as any now-adayes Catholick could pronounce. For, since no Catholick holds that any goes to Purgatory but they who die <hi>Sinners</hi> to some degree, and that all who are <hi>Saints</hi> are <hi>with Christ in Heaven,</hi> as is evident by the Churches common language affirming constantly <hi>the Saints are in Heaven,</hi> and never that the <hi>Saints are in Purgatory,</hi> but the <hi>Souls</hi> onely, it is manifest that the words are as expresly for us as we our selves could invent or wish.</p>
               <p>I hope it will not wrogMethod, if on this occasion
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63121:15"/>
I show how Protestant Writers speed when they bring against us any Testimony of a Father speaking as a Father, that is, declaring that he delivers the sence of the Catholick Church; however in other Testimonies which speak not narratively, or matter of Fact, the very nature of words joyn'd with the variety of their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances must needs afford room for ambiguity and several Glosses. I affirm then that this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony not onely is not in the least opposit to us, but is directly opposit to the Protestants in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther point of Faith in which we differ. To dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this let us reflect on the words [<hi>After Christes Ascension into Heaven the Souls of all Saints are with Christ,</hi>] and ask what mean these words <hi>After Christs Ascension?</hi> And first 'tis Evident it puts a distinction between the Souls of Saints <hi>before Christs Ascension</hi> and <hi>After it</hi> in some Respect, and what is this Respect? most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly this that the Souls of the Saints <hi>After Christes Ascension go from the body to Christ,</hi> that is, that <hi>before the Ascension</hi> none did. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Doctrin of the Catholick Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing that those who die Saints in the Law of Grace go straight to Heaven, but that the best Saints before our Saviours dying for them and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending with them, did not. Whence also we hold that Christes <hi>descending into Hell,</hi> was to free them from that State of Suspence and Want of their strongly desired and hopet for <hi>Bliss.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Hymn of <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> and <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:63121:15"/>
in the Common-prayer-book, so oft said over by rote but never reflected on, <hi>When thou hadst overcome the Sharpness of death thou didst open the Kingdome of Heaven to all Believers:</hi> Signifying plainly that no Believers sound Heaven open for them till after Christ's death. By the Success of this one Testimony is seen how utterly the Protestant Cause would be overthrown by way of Testimony as well as Reason, were Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions distinguish't, brought to Grounds, and those onely admitted from the Fathers in which 'tis manifest they speak <hi>as Fathers</hi> or Witnessers of what is the present Churches doctrin.</p>
               <p>To close up this Discourse about the Dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Citations. He is to show us first that they fall not under the Faulty Heads to which they are respectively assign'd, or under diverse others of those Heads. Next, that they have in them the nature of <hi>Testimonies:</hi> And, lastly, (which is yet harder) that though they have in them the nature of <hi>Testimonies,</hi> their Authority is <hi>Certain</hi> and their language <hi>unambiguous</hi> so that they may be safely rely'd on for Principles or Grounds of a solid Discourse; This if he shows of any one citation which strikes at our Faith, I promise him very heartily to subscribe to the validity of all the rest.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Thus much for his Authorities. Next should follow a Refutation of his Reasons produc't against our Faith; for, as for those against our School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Divines or Casuists they concern not me as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertist:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:63121:16"/>
Let him and them fight it out. Now, Reasons that strike at our Faith must either be against the <hi>Ground</hi> of Faith, and those shall be consider'd in my Answer to his First Section; or against, <hi>points</hi> of Faith: And these, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed two wayes; First by showing those points Incomprehensible to our Natural Reason, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutable to our Faney; and this way he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes, making a great deal of game upon such subjects, as any Atheist may do by the same way in points common to him and us. But this hurts us not in the least; in regard we hold not Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Faith Objects of Human Reason; nor Spiritual Things the Objects of Fancy; and, so, these Reasons need no farther Answer. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way Reasons against Points of Faith may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, is to show those Points contradictory to some Evident Principles, at least to some other known or else acknowledg'd Truth? And these were worth answering; But such as these I find none in his whole Book, rather that he builds his sleight Descants or Discourses on some controvertible Text or Citation, relying on them as firmly as if they were First Principles.</p>
               <p>Indeed p. 65. the Dissuader tells us of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi> of his for the Novelty of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantion and that a <hi>plain</hi> one too: But, I shal manifest shortly from the very words of the Author <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> on which his <hi>Plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi> relies, that 'tis either a <hi>plain mistake</hi> or <hi>plain Abuse</hi> of him; nay argues the <hi>direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to what the Dissuader product it for.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:63121:16"/>
               <p>Some Consequences also he deduces <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem</hi> against diverse points of our Faith, built on our own Concessions or Allow'd Truths taken from the Fathers; by which he attempts to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it: But these Consequences are so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inconsequent, and those tenets he would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose so far from Contradictory, that 'tis hard to imagin whence his Reason took its rise to leap into such remote conclusions. I'le instance in two, found p. 49, and 50. That the <hi>Conflagration of the last day,</hi> and the Opinion of some Fathers that <hi>the Souls were detain'd in secret receptacles till the day of Judgment,</hi> do both destroy <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Purgatory.</hi> Which Consequences if he will make good, I will vield his whole Book to be Demonstrative and Unanswerable.</p>
               <p>In a word, all the good Reasons he brings, are taken from some of our Divines writing against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and he hath done himself the right to chuse the best; which levelled against the opinion of a less able Divine in stead of a point of Faith, must needs bear a very plausible show.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Next follows the <hi>Manner</hi> how he manages this <hi>Matter;</hi> which in the civillest Expressions I use I must call so many sleights to delude his Reader; and those so craftily coucht that none but a Scholler can discern the snare.</p>
               <p>The first and Fundamental one is his wilfully mis-stating the Question all over. As <hi>p.</hi> 16. when he confounds the making new Symbols or Creeds, which signifies the <hi>putting together</hi> into a Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:63121:17"/>
of Faith Articles formerly-held (as did S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council) with <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new Articles.</hi> All his whole Section 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> which he makes to signify meerly those which pardons sins or pains after this life; whereas yet himself confesses <hi>p.</hi> 40. that those were not defind by our Church. So also his next Section of Purgatory, by which we mean a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal State for those who die imperfectly contrite, and from which they are deliverable by the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church Militant: Instead of which he impugns sometimes material Fire, sometimes the duration of it. It were tedious to reckon all his Faults in this kind, scarce one point escapes this voluntary misprision; that is, he scarce dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses steadily (though perhaps he may glance at it accidentally) against one point of our Faith rightly stated or as taken in the declarative words of our Church. Now, common Honesty tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us that if one be to impugn any mans Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, the first thing natural method leads him to is to put down that man's very words profest by him to express his Tenet, and not what others deem, conceit or talk about the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; my Ld. ought in due candour have first produc't the words of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and then have leveld his opposition against <hi>them:</hi> and not have told us what School divines say about the point; or (having thus conceald the point it self) argu'd against some Circumstance or Manner of it instead of the Substance. Now
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:63121:17"/>
this kind of carriage so evidently preternatural, and so constantly us'd, forces me to judge it sprung from voluntary Insincerity and not from Accident or Inadvertency.</p>
               <p n="15">15. His second Disingenuity at once Evidences and aggravates the former. 'Tis this, that, when by such a management he hath made the point odious, he uses to bring in our Churches Tenet in the rear; and, whereas Her speaking abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly frees her absolutely from the invidious parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities he would fasten on her Faith, he (as if he had resolv'd to abuse her, right or wrong) makes that very thing which should <hi>clear</hi> her tend to <hi>disgrace</hi> her more: As is seen p. 40. where he is forc't to confess our Church defin'd <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi> onely <hi>in general terms</hi> (that is, none of his former Discourses so particularizing toucht her or her Faith) and then cries out the Council <hi>durst not</hi> do this nor the other: That is, she <hi>durst not</hi> do, and consequently <hi>did not</hi> do, what all his former discourse would persuade the world our Church <hi>had</hi> done: Worse then this is his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance p. 60. where after he had pretended in the whole 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Section to impugn Purgatory, which he had confounded with School-opinions to p. 45. with the time of delivery p. 48. 51. 56. with a state of merit or demerit p. 57. 58. with his own Parenthesisses p. 59. and told us some stories of Revelations and Apparitions which seem'd to him most ridiculous; Lastly confounded it with <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his Opinion, <hi>Plato's</hi> or <hi>Cicero's</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:63121:18"/>
conceit, and <hi>Virgils</hi> Fiction; After all this he adds, <hi>this doctrin which in all the parts of it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and in the late Additions to it in Rome is certainly false, is yet with all the Faults of it past into an Article of Faith by the Council of Trent.</hi> Now these big words <hi>All the parts of it, the late Additions, All the Faults of it,</hi> and all these said to be <hi>past into an Article of Faith by the Council of Trent,</hi> would make one think that Council had defin'd all that medley he had hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled together, for Christian Faith; but looking in the Council, not a Syllable of any of these is to be found, but barely these few words, that <hi>There is a Purgatory,</hi> and that <hi>the Souls there detain'd are help't by the prayers of the Faithful.</hi> Where we see but <hi>two parts</hi> at most, for there are but <hi>two</hi> Propositions in the whole definition: Again, <hi>the late Additions</hi> which he sayes are defin'd by the Council can be but <hi>one</hi> at most, that is, the second Proposition, that those Souls are helpt by the Faithfull's prayers; And lastly, when he sayes <hi>this Doctrin of Purgatory with all its Faults is past by the Council into an Article of Faith,</hi> the large word <hi>All its Faults</hi> can mean onely the same second Proposition; there being nothing defin'd, besides the very doctrin of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory it self, but <hi>this.</hi> Which kind of carriage of his, so sinisterly descanting on the point all along, not pretending to put down our Tenet at all till towards the End, then deforming it to be a bundle of God knows how many Faults defin'd
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:63121:18"/>
for Faith, putting all these upon the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and yet avoiding to put down the words of the Council at all (though so few) lest they should discover he had lavish't out at randome, show evidently the Dissuader stands not much upon Conscience or Sincerity, so he can colour and hide his disingenuities, and he is the greatest master of that craft I ever yet met with. Now, to avoid this Calumny (it being frequent in his book) I discourse thus, Points of Faith are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Truth which stand in the abstract, and it is the work of Divines not of the Church-Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative to draw long trains of Consequences from them, and dive particularly into the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners how they are to be explicated, or into their Extents if it be some Power: Nor is this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the point of Indulgences or Purgatory, but is found in all the other points of Faith, as every learned Divine knows very well. Again, 'tis against the Principles of Universal &amp; Supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for a Church Representative defining Faith to descend out of its highest Sphere and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in particularities (especially if they belong not to them, as School-opinions do not) but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to order in common, and leave the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Common Orders to those who are to execute, or to Inferiour Officers; and, should they engage in particulars which are both below their highest office, and oft-times contingent and uncertain, they would commit the greatest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence in the world. Since then my Ld acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:63121:19"/>
here p. 40. that the Council orders <hi>all hard and Subtil questions concerning Purgatory, all that is suspected to be false, and all that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and whatever is curious and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and for filthy lucre be laid aside,</hi> he should have shown that it befitted a Council's Gravity to descend to particulars, or to define negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the School-opinion concerning the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Treasure, and not rather order in Common and leave it to Inferior Officers to execute as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances should work upon their Prudence: which is, that in Opinions which pretend a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to and Coherence with Faith, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines should first clear their Incoherence with it ere They engage their Authority against them, and then to do it efficaciously being back't with the Majesty of the Council's Orders.</p>
               <p>My Lds words that the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>set their Doctors as well as they can to defend all the new, curious and scandalous Questions, and to uphold the gainful trade,</hi> is indeed to the purpose, but withal (by his leave) an unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and most false Calumny against so many Persons of Honour and Quality; and so Invidious a Charge, that could he have proov'd it, he had not slubber'd it over so carelesly without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any proof for it but his bare word; nor with a sleight proper to himself, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had directly charged it, have half recant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with <hi>However it be with them:</hi> that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they <hi>did any such thing or no,</hi> as he had so
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:63121:19"/>
lately and so pressingly challeng'd them to <hi>have done.</hi> And this I note as a <hi>Third Head</hi> of his <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity,</hi> frequent in his Book; that he brings very good proofs for diverse particulars which concern not our Church, but when it comes to the very point and which directly strikes at her, his own bare word, <hi>We know,</hi> or, <hi>it is Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> (p. 54. l. 22. p. 62. p. 63. p. 67. &amp;c.) is the best Argument he produces.</p>
               <p n="16">16. A fourth disingenuity is his Perverting wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Intention of Catholick Authours. How he hath dealt with the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in the two late mention'd points of <hi>Indulgences</hi> and <hi>Purgatory</hi> is already shown. In like manner has he treated the <hi>Expurgatory Indies;</hi> For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the word <hi>Purgari &amp; emaculari</hi> in a Citation of his own p. 21, it is manisest they meant but to amend Corruptions of the late by the Antient Copies, he makes as though out of <hi>gripes of Conscience</hi> (forsooth) <hi>that the Fathers were not right on our side,</hi> they had therefore purposely gone about to corrupt the Fathers themselves, (p. 18. and 19.) so to make them on our side be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we could not find them so. An Attempt impossible to fall into head of any man not stark mad; For this altering the Fathers could not have serv'd our turn unless we had made it known and publish't it; and, if made Publick could not be imagin'd to do the deed neither, for the Fraud must needs be made as Publick as the Book: So that an Action thus intended must
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:63121:20"/>
be a Human Action without a Motive or Reason, which is a Contradiction. Worse is what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows p. 21, &amp; 22. but withal the malice of it is more easily discoverable: For 'tis evident by the particulars he mentions in those Indexes or Tables that the Printer or Correcter who made them was an Heretick, and put in those Tables what his perversness imagin'd was found in the Fathers: Whence it was but fit his whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex should be expung'd: Not that we fear the Fathers, but that we disallow the wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Index-maker, who abuses the Fathers to injure us.</p>
               <p>So p. 62. he would make Catholikes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>dissatisfy'd</hi> of the <hi>Ground of Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> because they say <hi>'tis not express'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> as if Catholiks held that nothing could be of Faith but whats expresly found there; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he well knows they universally teach and hold the contrary. But his abuse of <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> p. 64. &amp; 65. is very remarkable, though perhaps it might spring out of his little Experience in School-divinity. To make <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> seem a Novelty he would persuade his Reader <hi>Lombard</hi> sayes, <hi>he could not tell whether there was any Substantial change or no:</hi> Whereas that Authour Dist. 10. brings Testimonies of the Fathers to prove it, and concludes thence that <hi>'Tis evident that the Substance of Bread is convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Christ's Body, and the Substance of Wine into his Blood,</hi> which is what the Council of

                  <hi>Trent</hi> calls <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> And there ends that Distinction; After which immediately succeeds the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>De modis Conversionis, of the Manners of this Conversion;</hi> and of these he sayes he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sufficiently define whether <hi>this Conversion be Formal, or Substantial, or of another kind.</hi> So that <hi>Substantial</hi> here supposes the <hi>Conversion of the Substance of Bread into Christes Body,</hi> and is put by him onely to signify one of the <hi>manners</hi> of this Conversion; which he explicates to be, <hi>Sic Substantiam converti in Substantiam ut haec essentialiter fiat illa, that one Substance is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into another Substance that the one is made essentially the other.</hi> Whereas others who also hold Transubstantiation do yet explicate that Conversion by putting the body of Christ to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed under the same Accidents in place of the Substance of Bread annihilated. Now this <hi>Manner</hi> of Conversion (calld by him a Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Manner, in opposition to <hi>Formal,</hi> which he makes to be a Conversion both of Substance and Accidents, and not in Opposition to the change of one Substance into another) he leaves Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd; but the Conversion it self of the Substance of Bread into the body of Christ which is our point, he both defines, hold, proves out of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (Disc. 10.) and calls them <hi>Hereticks</hi> that deny it: How unfortunate is my L. to quote an Authour as not holding Transubstantiation, then to call that Citation a <hi>plain Demonstration</hi> that it was <hi>not known in his dayes;</hi> whereas he both
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:63121:21"/>
professes to hold it, and, by alledging Fathers for it, evidences he holds it was held anciently; and, lastly, gives my L. such hard language for not holding it himself. Whether it be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my L. should light by some accident in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> onely on the 11th. Dist. and never read or light on the end of the 10th. let Indifferent men judge. I onely desire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to observe how ill my L. comes of with his <hi>plain Demonstration,</hi> and to remark that he ever succeeds worst when he most ayms at a good and solid proof; the reason of which is because Truth being Invincible, the neerer one closes to grapple with her the worse still he is foil'd. Those few Instances may suffice for the 4th. Kind of the Dissuaders disingenuities, which is to pervert the Intentions of his Authours; of which sort, were it worth the pains, I would undertake to show neer an hundred in my Lds. <hi>Dissuasive.</hi> This piece of Art being now so customary to him that 'tis even grown into a second Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="17">17. His fifth kind of disingenuity is a most wilful one and most frequent too, for it takes up far the better half his book. 'Tis this that he rakes up together all the less solid or ill Opinions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (and sometimes deforms the good ones) of some private Writers in the Church which he will needs lay upon the Church her self as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of our Faith. Nay, so strangely unjust he is in this Particular, that whereas it evidently
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:63121:21"/>
clears our Faith, disengages the Church, and shows it but Opinion when other Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors uncontrolledly write against such an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Explication, himself often alledges that very thing which should clear the Church, and and makes use of it to her farther disgrace; First, making the <hi>School</hi> and <hi>Church, Private Opinions,</hi> or Explications and <hi>Faith</hi> all one; and, at next, that the difference amongst such Opiners and Explicaters argues our difference in Faith; How strange a malice is this! Was there ever any time since the Apostles in which there were not in the Church diverse persons and even some Governours bad in their lives, and also Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous in their Opinions, when the Abstracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christian Faith restrain'd not their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings from descending to particulars nor secur'd them in such discourses depending much upon human Sciences? Do not the best Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of Protestants object to the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers themselves such Errors in Opinions? Yet no ancient Heretick was ever so weak as to make that an Argument against the Church of those times. Did not many Protestant Writers holdma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Roman-Catholick Tenets, as may be seen at large in the Protestants Apology? Yet no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in his Wits thought therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> her self was Roman-Catholick, I have heard that one of their Chief Ecclesiastical Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, namely Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> writ a book purposely to justify the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Rebellion against the King
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63121:22"/>
of <hi>Spain,</hi> maintaining that Subjects might in some Cases rise against their Soveraigns and turn them out of their Government? And yet Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks are far from that peevishness to esteem the Protestants disloyal in their Principles but honour them highly for the contrary Virtue, even though they are pleased to permit us their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-sufferers for the same loyal Cause, to be abused and branded publickly for Traytors by every disloyal Scribbler. And, to come neerer home, did not my L. himself formerly write some strange Opinions, (I need not name them) yet no Catholick was ever so absurd as to charge his Church with those Tenets. But, which is yet far worse, he imputes to the Catholick Church such licentious Cases, which not onely Private Authours may and do freely contradict but even Mulritudes of Church-Officers, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly almost all the Bishops in <hi>France</hi> in Diocesan Synods, nay the Head of the Church himself has disapproov'd in condemning the Apology writ for them. Yet, for all this, all must be our Churches fault whether she will or no; and our Doctrin, though she condemns it. Was ever such a disingenuous Writer heard of! But what aggravates most the Case is, neither the Church of <hi>England</hi> nor the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> nor any Officer or Bishop of hers that we heard of did ever in any solemn Act blemish those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours cited in the Protestants Apology by condemning their Books, nor yet those writ by
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:63121:22"/>
the Dissuader, though they judg'd them amiss; but, on the contrary his person is advanc't and chosen for their Champion; and yet our Writers are soberer &amp; more candid than to impute to their Church any of these not-yet-disavow'd Faults, whereas my Ld. (for want of better Proofs) will needs clap upon our Church any misreasonings of private men, though our chief Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and many Inferiour ones have discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc't and blemish't them. Nor is it onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very defect human nature is liable to in reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or acting which must be made our Churches Crimes, but every unfavorable Circumstance Man's Nature can light into, and their defective Effects are all made by the Dissuader's Logick to spring from meer Popery; nay the very National Rudeness of his wild <hi>Irish</hi> is (in his Preface) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded by his carriage with our Churches Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; and the Inability of their Teachers with much Rhetorick complained of, and charactered to be Popery, when himself enjoyes the revenue which should educate them better and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them.</p>
               <p>Against this kind of unreasonable procedure in the Dissuader, I levelled those Corollaries from Corol. 31. to. 40. which I intreat my Reader to review and him to consider particularly. In the mean time I would ask him on this occasion a few short Questions. May not any one remain a Catholick, and never hold or practice these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Opinions? Do not Catholicks impugn
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:63121:23"/>
them as much as Protestants? Does he find any of those Opinions or Cases in our Catechisms, or any Command of our Church to hold or act them, nay even in that most common point of extending Indulgences to the next world; but they who will use them, may, who will not, need not? How then does he hope to dissuade from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, by impugning that which touches not that Religion nor concerns any ones being of it? And why does not he rather fear all sober men will see his aym by this declamatory kind of Opposition to endeavour to gain credit as a great Anti-papist, and not to convince solidly his Readers, whose experience (if they know any thing) enables them to give a ready and satisfactory answer in their own thoughts to all those Questions I have now ask't, and so, to confute neer three parts of His Book. He saw it himself, and though he carries it on all along as if he were willing all should be thought the Doctrin of our Church or Faith, yet, fearing the Calumny is too manifest to be cloak't, he provides excuses and Evasions before hand, in his Title (p. 127.) saying, <hi>The Church of Rome, AS IT IS AT THIS DAY DISORDER'D, teaches doctrines and uses practices which are in themselves or in their immediate CONSEQUEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CES direct Impieties,</hi> &amp;c. So that he speaks of our Church precisely as having some <hi>disorders</hi> in her, and that they lead to ill onely by <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> drawn from such disorderly Tenets; and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:63121:23"/>
who's the drawer of these Consequences? Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But, grant his position that there are Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in the Church (I mean not in Faith, held Universally and obligatorily, but in unobligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Opinions and Practices) I ask does he think there was ever any time in which there were not some Disorders in the Church, or ever will be while Original corruption lasts? Does he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> the very time of the Apostles was exempt from such frailty; or that S. <hi>Paul</hi> complain'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Pastors in those primitive and purest times (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. v. 21.) that <hi>Omnes quae sua sunt quaerunt non quae sunt Jesu Christi!</hi> Again, thinks he it any wonder that a disorder'd Tenet or a Falshood in a point belonging to manners is apt to lead <hi>by consequence</hi> to ill actions; none doubting but that as Virtue is the connatural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Truth, so is Vice of Falshood. What hath he got then by this kind of Proceeding, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up better half his book? Onely this, he hath proov'd there is Original Sin in the world, and so it's Effects, Ignorance and Interest; Again, let him consider how disputative an Age this last Century has been, and what infinit multitudes of Writers concerning Opinionative Points of all sorts have been in our Church, how volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, how descending to particulars, or Cases, and this both in School-divinity, Morals and Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Law; and then let him speak seriously whether he can conceive it possible in human Nature, there should not be much Contingency in such
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:63121:24"/>
an Universality depending on their private Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; whereas scarce two men debating the same point particularly, can light into the self-same Consequences, but differ in their deductions. Thinks he it possible many should not be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and so miscarry casually, many Passionate and incline to some Tenets because sutable to their humour; many conceited of their new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and thence, judging their Consequence to be connected with the point of Faith, cry it up to be <hi>de side</hi> in their opinion, and alledge that, denying <hi>this,</hi> you by consequence deny <hi>Faith?</hi> This being so, nay impossible to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and every Reader that sees the Dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's unreasonableness against us easily judging he would pick out the worst Instances he could find in that Infinity of Authours, and (the very complexion of his style being wholly Invidious) expose them to shame with all the most disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Rhetorick so great a wit as his heighten'd by that bitterest of Passions could deliver; he will easily be able to make an Estimate what he may judge of my Ld's performance in this kinde.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But now whates all this to to our Church? For his Title p. 127. tells us 'tis <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> which <hi>teaches such Doctrins</hi> and <hi>uses such Practices,</hi> &amp;c. The Notion of <hi>Church,</hi> as one would conceive, is terminated and bounded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely within the limits of its Definition, <hi>a Body of the Faithful;</hi> and Logick tells every one who
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63121:24"/>
understands it, that, since we work by abstracted notions, or conceive a thing now thus, now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, we must not confound those notions but hold strictly to the formal meaning of the word which expresses the thing we undertake for. We are then to expect in honesty, that, since the Dissuader charges all those Doctrins and Practices on our Church, all his Testimonies to fasten them on her should be of our Churches words, or Expressions of the Churches Faith; we need not doubt then but they will all be Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of General Councils. Let the Margent inform us. The first Citation is of <hi>Navarr's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiridion,</hi> a private Casuist. The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus,</hi> another Casuist. The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, of <hi>Sotus</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> two other School-Divines. Then comes in <hi>Reginaldus</hi> again, &amp; then <hi>Sotus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; &amp; in this tenour he proceeds for 133 pages; that is from p.127, to p. 260. not quoting the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> past 3, or 4. times (but once, as I remember, the words of that Council) and as oft abusing it by his strange misconstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For instance take his first Quotation of that Council p. 135; which I the more insist on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause on that occasion I shall lay open his crafty and voluntary defiling every point he touches with most abominable misrepresentations, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, lest prudent men should
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:63121:25"/>
think it too much; which I intended for a SIXTH Head of his disingenuities.</p>
               <p>After then p. 133, and 134. he had made all the most odious Cases he could pick out <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Doctrin,</hi> because the books of three or four Authours perused and allow'd by two or three others as not opposit to Faith, (See Coroll. 33.) that is, the private Reasons of half a dozen Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines conceiv'd so, which he amplifies beyond all bounds of moderation, that one would judge a General Council or Provincial one, at least that many Church Governours or Bishops had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended those Cases to be held and follow'd; at length he tells you sadly p. 134. that <hi>This, though INFINITLY INTOLERABLE, yet it is but the BEGINNING OF SORROWS;</hi> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>SUPER-INFINIT Sorrows</hi> themselves; the first of which <hi>Sorrows</hi> is the Council of <hi>Trent's</hi> Doctrin; and, if it be <hi>Naught,</hi> 'tis certainly the <hi>Chief</hi> of them, and so (had I a word to express it so high which the Dissuader's Rhetorick would easily reach) it should be phrased something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Super-infinit;</hi> in regard by the Sacredness of it's Authority it would be a Ground and an Abetment to all the wicked Cases issuing from it. Ere I come to examin it I premise this note that such Testimouies as This are onely to my Ld's purpose if he will argue against our Churche<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Doctrin; In the success of these then lies the whole Trial of our Cause. We have seen how he has sped formerly in his <hi>plain Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:63121:25"/>
and his onely efficacious Testimony of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; let's see how he thrives in this, which we must acknowledge beyond all Evasion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the sence of our Church.</p>
               <p n="20">20. His last Â§. then p. 134. begins with describing a true and Perfect Contrition and its Sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends as sufficient to blot out Sin; All this is well, nor is there, as far as I know, a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in the world that was ever taught other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; what follows? Yet, sayes he, <hi>the Church of Rome does not allow it to be of any value unless it be joyn'd with a desire to confess their sins to a Priest, saying, that a man by Contrition is not reconcil'd to God without their Sacramental or Ritual Pennance actual or votive. And this is decreed by the Council of Trent,</hi> &amp;c. Then comes thundring in a Declamation fraught with such Invidious yet Holy Rhetorick that any honest unexamining Reader would almost lay his Salvation on't, he had all the Reason in the world. <hi>Which things</hi> (adds he) <hi>besides that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Scripture, &amp; the promises of the Gospell, and not onely teaches for Doctrins the Commandments of Men, but evacuates the Goodness of God by their Traditions, and weakens &amp; discourages the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance &amp; prefers repentance towards men before that which the Scripture calls Repentance towards God, &amp; Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> And there ends his paragraph, in which his passion was in such hast that he forgot to add an <hi>Also</hi> to answer to the word <hi>Besides.</hi> Now Ld have mercy upon usl
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:63121:26"/>
What strangely wicked Doctrin is this which can occasion such a clutter of Devotion and Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveness jumbled together! Attend Reader, and from one Instance which I pick't not out purposely, but took the first that my discourse led me to accidentally, learn the nature of all the rest; for scarce one passage in his whole book is free from this Fault.</p>
               <p>The Council Sess. 14. as it is commonly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd, (not 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, as perhaps his Printer mistook it) c. 4. speaks of <hi>Contrition;</hi> which it distinguishes into <hi>Perfect Contrition,</hi> the same my Ld describes; and declares that <hi>It reconciles a man to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Sacrament</hi> (to wit, of <hi>Pennance</hi>) <hi>be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally received;</hi> and <hi>Imperfect</hi> or Attrition, spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Consideration of the vileness of Sin, or fear of Hell,</hi> not from Love of God as its motive; and to <hi>this</hi> it requires <hi>actually</hi> the Sacrament of <hi>Pennance,</hi> this being properly efficacious to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance by Preparations to it beforehand, (which Attrition gives them will to make use of) and the whole course of Exercises in it or belonging to it, that <hi>Attrition</hi> into <hi>perfect</hi> or properly call d <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition:</hi> And (speaking of the first sort or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Contrition,) It adds farther, that <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God is not to be ascrib'd (ipsi Contritio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni sine Sacramenti voto QUOD IN ILLA INCLUDITUR) to Contrition without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the Sacrament WHICH IS INCLU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DED IN IT;</hi> that is, <hi>in Contrition.</hi> Thus the Council. I note</p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:63121:26"/>
               <p>First, the Dissuaders craft in not putting down the words of the Council. A practice frequent with him (as I show'd before) and purposely omitted, as appear'd evidently then and will do more now, because not at all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to his insincere humour of deforming all he meddles with.</p>
               <p>Next, by this means, he, handling onely <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Contrition,</hi> makes our Church require <hi>actual or votive Pennance</hi> to <hi>Its</hi> Sufficiency; Whereas the Council expresly voids any necessity of actual Pennance to this or proper Contrition, and onely requires it to <hi>Attrition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. He omits the words <hi>which is included in it;</hi> which put down had disanull'd all his whole discourse and cleard our Church from all his Calumnies; For this shows the Councils sence to be that Contrition alone, if qualifyed as it ought to be, reconciles to God; but that to be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd as it ought to be, it <hi>includes</hi> a purpose or desire of doing other duties incumbent on the sinner by reason of his Sin; and signalizes this particularly of his duty to the Church in resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to come to the Sacrament of Pennance. Let us parallel it. Suppose the Council had said. <hi>True sorrow for sin will save you; but not, unless you have a will to restore what you have stoln, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise your sorrow is not true, in regard true sorrow for Sin includes a will to rectify what sin had disordered.</hi> Where's now the occasion of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:63121:27"/>
my Lds. ranting declamation of the Councils <hi>going against Scripture, and the promises of the Gospel, teaching for Doctrins the Commandments of men, of evacuating the goodness of God by Traditions, of weakening and discouraging the best Repentance,</hi> and of <hi>preferring Repentance towards men, before that which the Scripture calls Repentance towards God and Faith in our, Ld. Jesus Christ.</hi> Yet, supposing that sinners are commanded by Christs Law to give account of their Souls to the Church and receive their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and Pennance from her, as well as they are to restore what's stoln, the case is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly parallell.</p>
               <p>But, since many other duties are included in Contrition, as an obligation to restore credit or goods unjustly taken away, to repair temporal damages our Neighbours have incurr'd by us, and the spiritual ones of Scandal, asking pardon for affrontive Injuries, curing our former Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness and wordliness by giving Almes, and such like: a purpose of all which, if our Contrition be right, ought to be included in it; 'tis worth Enquiry why the Council particularises this of coming to the Sacrament of Pennance. And to Catholicks who understand the nature of that Sacrament, the Answer is so easy that 'tis needless. For, after the heart is contrite or substantially turn'd, there remains no more to be done but to wash of the tainture of bad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations Mortal Sin uses to leave behind it, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:63121:27"/>
to make Satisfaction to our Neighbour or the World: Wherefore, because the wholsome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Pennance, rightly us'd, is ordain'd and apt of its own Nature both to wash away those remaining staines by sorrowful and penal actions enjoyn'd by Church disciplin, and also to ty men to the Execution of all due Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the injur'd World; hence, the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly converted interiorly, this Sacrament is the most Efficacious means to set all else right, &amp; so to come to it is the onely remaining duty (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all else) and for that reason 'tis particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly exprest by the Council that true Contrition must <hi>include</hi> a purpose to come to it; because, if true, it must needs include a desire to take the best means to rectify what's amiss. And, lest a Sinner should be apt to conciet and say within himself thus, I am truly sorry for my offending God, there is then no more to be thought on; the Council most prudently declares that, That will not do unless they desire likewise to set right what they had disorder'd, of which the Church is to be the Judge and careful Overseer, and so 'tis their duty to the Church to let her take Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of it. The Dissuader did ill then to phrase it <hi>Ritual Pennante,</hi> as if onely a dry Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony had been enjoyn'd by the Council ere the Soul could be <hi>reeoncild</hi> to God, whereas 'tis a Sacrament of its own nature executively satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory of all the kinds of duties, and efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously reparative of all the disorders which are
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:63121:28"/>
the Arrears and Effects of a sinful Action: But he did worse to omit the Councils words, and so leave out totally <hi>Quod in illÃ¢ includitur,</hi> which candidly put in had made all his Process to no purpose: But worst of all, when he could not but see all this, to inveigh against so innocent, so rational, charitable and wise Proceedure of this Grave and Venerable Council with the harshest Expressions that ever were clad in Holy Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And, it were good my Ld. who is so high against our Casuists, would let us know by what Cases he guides himself in his whole Book, where he sprinkles Scripture Holy-water all over as if every thing were a Devil he met with, and here particularly, in wilfully publickly and caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly calumniating not a private person, but an whole Council consisting of so great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the most Grave, most Venerable, and most Sacred Personages in the whole Christian World.</p>
               <p n="21">21. A seventh kind of his Disingenuities is his Exaggerating and magnifying manner of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; by virtue of which he can make any <hi>mote</hi> seem a <hi>Beam;</hi> and though the Fault would ly in a very small room, perhaps require none at all, yet, as men blow up Bladders with wind, he can so swell and puff it up by plying it with his aiery Rhetorick, that it looks as big as a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; whereas come neer it, examin and grasp it, that will not now fill your hand which before took up the whole prospect of your Eye. He
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:63121:28"/>
can also by placing things in false lights make even the greatest Virtue seem a Vice, and then make that new-created vice a monstrous one; Both which were visibly discovered in our last Instance out of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>

               <p n="22">22. I pass by many other of his petty Disingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as his interposing Parenthesisses of his own; speaking most confidently where he has least Ground, so to make up the want of <hi>this</hi> with abundance of <hi>the other.</hi> His confounding good Cases with bad; Some private Bigotteries with acts of true Piety; Books approved by the Church with those of private Authours; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>spiritual</hi> things grosly and <hi>materially;</hi> as in his whole business of Exorcisms: In which, were I in as merry an humour as his Lp. is there, I could make his discourse there far more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than he makes any thing found in the Churches Ritual, which book we are onely to defend or he to object, if he would deal can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly. Himself confesses the Inquisition of <hi>Spain</hi> corrected one of those Books, he names, and I know no obligation any man has either to use or abet the others; and then to what purpose were they brought against the Church?</p>
               <p n="23">23. The last greatest and most notorious disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity is his most unworthy and most Intolerable Calumny against all Catholicks that they are Traytors, and unfit for human Society. He names not these words but that he endeavours to have the thing beleeved by his Readers appears
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:63121:29"/>
thus: The Title of his third Chapter, p. 260. is this: <hi>The Church of Rome. teaches Doctrins which in many things are destructive of Christian society in General, and of Monarchy in special.</hi> We see here what he charges on our <hi>Church:</hi> and, since 'tis known all Catholicks not onely are oblig'd to <hi>hold,</hi> but to hold as <hi>Sacred</hi> and of <hi>Faith</hi> what the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> teaches, nay, to be ready to dy for that Faith, 'tis plain his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are to make us pass in the Opinion of his Readers for persons who hold Treason and Villany <hi>Lawful,</hi> nay <hi>Sacred,</hi> and that we are ready to dy and hope to be sav'd by such dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable points of Faith. Nor will his false-hearted Pretence, p. 462. exempt any, while 'tis known that nothing is more deeply rooted in our hearts than our obligation to beleeve as the <hi>Church</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves and teaches. In particular he assures his Reader, p. 462. that, <hi>No Contracts, Leagues, Societies, Promises, Vows or Oaths, are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>nt security to him that deals with one of the Church of Rome:</hi> And p. 279. that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins of our Church are <hi>great Enemis to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Security, to the Powers and Lives of Princes.</hi>

               <p>'Tis not fit we should use here the Language proper to express what's the due return and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuin brand for so malicious a Calumny: But perhaps it were not unfit nor injuring the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of Subjects humbly to beg Protection for our Innocence against the virulent tongues and pens

of our uncharitable accusers; whom neither Reason nor Experience will restrain from going on still to stigmatize us all with the Faults of a few rash (or sometimes misconstru'd) Writers. But when writes the Dissuader this? After such fresh Testimonies of the unanimous Loyalty of Catholicks to His sacred Majesty and his Royal Father, spending their lives and Fortunes in his service. And against whom? Against a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in which are found very many Noble and Honourable Personages, and many thousands of others very considerable and remarkable for their Fidelity. How strange a Wickedness is it then to calumniate so highly and so publickly so many eminently deserving and Honourable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Majesty! Now, the mischiefs natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally apt to flow from such a Calumny are these. It breeds ill Correspondence between our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects and us, and makes us ill look't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by them, which violates Civil Unity so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the Peace and strength of a Kingdome; especially being between those two parties who have ever been so friendly and brotherly in their Affection and Allegiance to their Prince, and Fellow-Acters and Sufferers for his Cause; It dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages Loyalty to see that after such best Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of it we are not even able to obtain a bare acknowledgment that we are Loyal, but that it shall still be lawful for any one at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to brand us for Traytors, and this publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in print in the face of all England? And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:63121:30"/>
(were not our known Fidelity too strong an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote for his malice) it tends to breed a conceit in our Governours that we are not to be endur'd in any State, and onely fit to be ruin'd and extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; not to mention the breach of Charity ensuing such unworthy Criminations, which must needs breed very many Feuds, and unneighbourliness between private persons all over <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Nor will there be ever any hearty Union in Church or State, till thatwicked Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of affixing upon a whole party the faults of some few be totally laid aside.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Now on what does my Ld ground these hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Charges against our Church, or how proceeds he to make them good? After the old fashion, of quoting the private Opinions of a few Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, <hi>viz. Emonerius,</hi> Father <hi>Barnes, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel SÃ , Tolet, Vasquez, Navar,</hi> &amp;c. Now my Ld supposes his. Readers are to be credulous silly Asses, and to believe that these private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists or Discoursers are the <hi>mouth of our Church;</hi> that she by them <hi>declares</hi> what we are to <hi>believe;</hi> that such private Discourses are so many <hi>defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of our <hi>Churches</hi> Doctrin or <hi>Faith:</hi> That these Discourses are held by our Church to be <hi>Constant</hi> and <hi>Certain</hi> (for <hi>such</hi> all Catholicks hold <hi>her Doctrin</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> to be) whereas every Child knows these and such like Opinions are controllable &amp; <hi>changeable</hi> as the Moon; that they were taught by Christ and his Apostles, whereas any one may and himself does quote who
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:63121:30"/>
first invented them: that they who deny or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn them are <hi>Hereticks,</hi> whereas yet others <hi>do</hi> and any one <hi>may</hi> write against them at pleasure. Lastly, that these Points are all <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> whereas the very nature of the thing shows and himself confesses they are all <hi>Human dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> These Madnesses which are my Ld's First Principles in this whole Chapter and the Chapter foregoing, that is, in better half his book, if his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be such a Bedlam as to yield to, then all his discourse is as sure as Gospel; but if not, then 'tis Evident such Pretences are flat and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscionable Calumnies against our Church.</p>
               <p>Little better is his quoting two or three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Acts of some Popes: does he think the words <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Pope</hi> are Equivalent, or that the word <hi>particular act</hi> signifies <hi>Doctrin</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> that he should think three or four Acts all in several kinds, that is, one in each kind, argue the <hi>Churches Doctrin</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> in those points. This in case he deals truly with those Popes; but I know he is apt to deform all he meets with, and I see he does that of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> p. 268. which makes me suspect the rest. That Pope extinguish't the <hi>Templars;</hi> and consest that <hi>de Jure</hi> he could not do it, but that he did it <hi>ex plenitudine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatis.</hi> Here my Ld so interprets <hi>de Jure</hi> that he makes the Pope disown <hi>any Justice</hi> in doing it, that is <hi>own</hi> an <hi>Injustice</hi> in doing it, for that's my Ld's Intention in wresting those words; which being impossible to conceive the Pope should
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:63121:31"/>
prosess of himself, 'tis clear he meant by <hi>de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> the same we mean by the words [<hi>by Law</hi>] that is, that there was no <hi>positive Law</hi> of the Church impowering him to dissolve them, yet, the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency requiring it, his Office might give him a <hi>natural right</hi> to do it; by which if Governours might not act in great Emergencies, but must be ty'd to let all go wrong because it happens no provision is made against it in any <hi>written Law;</hi> All Churches, Kingdomes, Cities, nay Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies would be at the same loss the Spanish Master was at, who hiring a proud Servant and agreeing with him that he should do nothing but what was concluded between them and writ down, a while after falling in the dirt under his horse, and calling to his man to help him out, he told him he would first consult his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Paper whether that were put down there or no; where not finding it, he let his Master ly. But the case of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> is far from the Envy he would asperse it with: for why may not the Pope dissolve the Templars by his Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law, whereas Christian Princes and the Church universally complain'd of them, and mov'd him to it, and so their Consent went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with this action of their Chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</p>
               <p n="25">25. He hath onely two passages in that whole Chapter which even seem to concern our Church. One of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> concerning a point of Practice put down by him thus, p. 266, 267.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:63121:31"/>
                  <hi>That if a man have promist to a woman to marry her, and is betroth'd to her and hath sworn it, yet if he will before the Consunimation enter into a Monastery, his Oath shall not bind him, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is null, but his second promise that shall stand, and he that denies this is accurst by the Council of Trent.</hi> Thus my Ld.; where he tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologizes and layes it out at large to amplify it the more, adds the words <hi>hath sworn it,</hi> not found in the Council, but put in by himself because he was resolvd we should be <hi>Perjur'd,</hi> and avoids, (as was his frequent custome) to put down the Councils own words in a distinct Letter; so that his additions, may be safer and in more hope to escape too open shame. But to the point, I ask my Ld. as a Divine; Does not he hold Heaven our last End, consequently that all our Actions are to be steps towards it, consequently that there can be no ty to embrace any state of life in case it appear upon mature consideration of circumstances highly unapt and dangerous to the attainment of Bliss? I ask again; would not my Ld. himself renounce actually living with a wife if he in his conscience judg'd so, but keep his promise let his Salvation go whether it would? If he sees this plainly, then the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty consists not in breaking a promise made to a Temporal end, subordinate to our spiritual Last End for our Last Ends sake, but in this whether such a Case can be put. I propose him one; may not a man come to see by better
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:63121:32"/>
knowledge of his Spouses humour, her newly-discover'd dishonesty, the Inconveniences he shall incur by her ill-condition'd Friends, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such like, that such a Cohabitation tends to make his whole Life a hell upon Earth; which case is very possible and sometimes happens, to the eternal and temporal ruin of both parties, and the Infinit Scandal to the World? In this case does he not think in his conscience it had been better in all respects they had been parted ere Matrimony had been consummated? If then the man or woman to redeem their rashness in so lightly promising chose to debar themselves from all future hopes of marriage, and quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the world to serve God in a Religious Life, it at once clears the reality of the Inconvenience, and the persons Intentions, and satisfies Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expectations, nay ennobles in the conceit of good Christians the Attempt by the knowledge, as far as any human Action can give of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that the person had no <hi>base End</hi> in his Action, but that which is <hi>infinitly Best.</hi> Oh, but this will <hi>break all Contracts, Leagues, Vows,</hi> &amp;c. Let not my Ld. fear, there is too much Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal sin in the world, for very many to run ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a severe Life in a Monastery, and there to make vows of Chastity than to go to bed with their Brides. By this may be judg'd how my Ld. jumbles some <hi>good</hi> Cases with other <hi>bad</hi> ones, and makes all equally <hi>naught,</hi> did my designe of an Appendix give me leave to trace him through them all.</p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:63121:32"/>
               <p n="26">26. His next passage seeming to touch our Church is alledg'd, p. 265. <hi>Thus it is affirm'd and was practic't by a whole Council of Bishops at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> &amp;c. This is something now, being the <hi>Affirmation</hi> (I suppose he means or would be thought to mean <hi>definition</hi>) and <hi>Practice</hi> of an approv'd General Council. Attend now, Reader, for here the Dissuader once or twice at least in a whole Chapter ayms to speak to the purpose.</p>
               <p>But first, what a favour is this of my Lds. not to put down the <hi>words</hi> of the Council where it <hi>affirms</hi> this? For this had made the case <hi>plain</hi> and the fault unavoidable. Next, (which is yet a greater kindness) he not so much as cites the <hi>place</hi> in which this Affirmation is found; and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuse the Reader, I assure him faithfully there is no such place or words found in the Council. To say that Safe Conduct given by Lay men absolv'd from the Secular Court but not from the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, is quite another thing from his Invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Proposition, and withal very Rational; For why should it, since both their Cauies and Laws are distinct? Whereas to violate Faith given, and upon this score because the party to whom I gave it is an Heretick, which my Ld. falsely charges, is most unmanly, nay Diabolical. Yet, though it lay in the Churches power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed Juridically her way, yet it lay in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours to hinder or differ the Execution if any publick Concern made it prudent. But what I
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:63121:33"/>
stand upon (with leave of others) is that <hi>no safe Conduct was promist them to return,</hi> but onely to appear and have a fair trial. My reason is, because in the <hi>Safe Conduct</hi> given by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to <hi>Hierom,</hi> (and we may with reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it was equivalently given to both) we find it given with this conditional clause, <hi>Justice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still preserv'd;</hi> Also, <hi>Appear according to the tenor of thy foresaid writing to answer to those things which one or more will object to thee in the cause of Faith, that thou mayst receive and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in all things the accomplishment of Justice.</hi> Which implies that he was to expect Justice from the Council if he clear'd not himself. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, a disciple of <hi>Husse's</hi> who writ his tryal and death, and professes himself as much verst in the particulars as his senses could make him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines indeed of safe conduct given by <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> in Writing of coming and returning; yet, putting down the very form of Safe Conduct, no such thing as <hi>returning</hi> is found in it. Nor did <hi>Hus</hi> in all his defence complain of <hi>Safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct violated,</hi> except when he was first bound, which was upon occasion of his flying and being brought back. Nay, the Emperour alwayes threatned <hi>Hus</hi> that he had rather burn an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Heretick than defend him. In a word, all this clamour is built on the Testimony of the Hussites, and an imperfect relation writ in <hi>Dutch</hi> by an unlearned Catholick, which was greedily catcht at by such as leapt for joy to find any licks
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:63121:33"/>
thing to bespatter the Church with, and start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling some unattentive and too credulous Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, drive them, zealous of defending the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to an unwarrantable position; which Tenet and its practice my Ld. himself knows well the Generality of Catholikes hate and detest as much as himself.</p>

               <head>Eighth Way.</head>
               <p n="27">27. THe eighth and last Way is to pick out as well as I can those Propositions or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples my Ld relies on, and show their Weakness; which is sufficiently performed by singling them out, and then naming them PRINCIPLES, they are so quite unlike what they're call'd. Now his <hi>Principles</hi> he layes in his first Section: I mean, his main and Fundamental Propositions, which because he relies on, yet never proves, we are from his carriage to take for <hi>Principles</hi> and Self evident to him, though he himself calls them not so; for 'tis dangerous to them who have not Truth on their side even to mention the word <hi>Principle, Evidence</hi> or <hi>Demonstration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His First concerning Scripture I shall speak to anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A second seems to be this p.</hi> 6. We all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the whole Church of God kept the Faith entire and transmitted faithfully to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ages the whole Faith; <hi>that is,</hi> to the Ages next after the Apostles, <hi>as he expresses a little before, call'd by him p.</hi> 7. the first and best Antiquily,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:63121:34"/>
and signify'd to mean <hi>the First three Ages.</hi> Now the Positive part of this Principle is good and Assertive of Tradition, but withall unapt to stead him. The Negative part of it, or that the third Age transmitted it not to the fourth, and so forwards, imply'd in his Discourse, would onely stead him; but 'tis left unproov'd, and so is a Voluntary Assertion, and strangely ridiculous. For, if the first two Ages kept the Faith entire and transmitted it to the third, 'tis Evident the Third was able to transmit it to the fourth, and so forwards; wherefore, it being Evident from the Concern of the Thing it was also <hi>willing</hi> to do so, 'tis demonstrable it <hi>did</hi> so. This Principle then on which he so much builds is either not for him, or else highly against him.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Another main and Fundamental Proposition (or Principle) is found p. 7. and as the former concern'd the Tradition of the Church, so this and the three following ones concern the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Fathers. <hi>The present Roman Doctrins</hi> (saith he) <hi>which are in difference were Invisible and unbeard of in the first and best Antiquity.</hi> That is, no Heretick had arisen in those dayes (or in the first three hundred years) denying those points, and so the Fathers set not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to write Expresly for them, but occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally onely; and yet, by his leave, our Controv<gap reason="illegible" extent="6 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> are frequent in citing them for diverse points, especially for the Ground of our Faith, the Churches voice or Tradition, to the utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:63121:34"/>
of the Protestant Cause. So far this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proov'd and main position, disannulling all use of the Fathers of the first 300 years in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, is from not needing proof or being <hi>Self evident.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29. It may be his respect and value for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the next Ages will make amends for this rashness. He tells us immediately after, that in <hi>the Succeeding Ages, secular Interest did more prevail, and the Writings of the Fathers were vast and voluminous, full of Controversy and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Sences fitted to their own times and questions, full of proper Opinions, and such variety of sayings, that both sides eternally and Inconfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably shall bring sayings for themselves respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Now, if they be so qualify'd that both sides may <hi>eternally</hi> dispute out of them, and neither be ever able to <hi>confute</hi> the other or conclude, then let him speak out and say all the Fathers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the first 300 years are not worth a straw in order to decision or Controversy; nor yet the Fathers of the first 300 years because they spoke not of our points <hi>in difference;</hi> and so there is a fair end of all the Fathers and of his own Dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive too for that part which relies on them, which looks like the most authoritative piece of it. The Reader will easily judge now whether we (as he charges us, p. 18.) <hi>have many gripes of Conscience concerning the Fathers that they are not right on our side, or the Dissuader.</hi> Our constant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow'd Doctrin is (that the Testimony of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:63121:35"/>
speaking of them properly as such, is <hi>Iufal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;</hi> that in two Cases they speak as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that is, when they declare it the doctrin of the present Church of their time, or when they write against any man as an Heretick or his Tenet as Heresy. Some complexions of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances also may be found out by much reading and comparing several considerations which make it Evident they speak as <hi>Witnesses;</hi> though it be more laborious and tedious to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass a Satisfaction this way. Whereas (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by our Dissuader) the Protestants neither acknowledge them <hi>Infallible,</hi> nor indeed <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> And this is my Ld's FOURTH PRINCIPLE, which with the former destroyes the Efficacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all the Fathers, &amp; invalidates all that part of his own Book which should seem weightiest.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Notwithstanding the two former Principles to invalidate the Fathers, it may still be said by the Catholicks in behalf of their validity (as was by me now) that the Sayings of Fathers as <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> are <hi>Convictive;</hi> and therefore it should seem sit my Ld did lay <hi>another</hi> Principle to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against that. He is not unmindful of it, but hath taken order about it. For, though p. 9. he tells us <hi>the Fathers are good Testimony of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin deliver'd from their Forefathers down to them of what the Church esteem'd the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> yet that is to be understood according to the Rule premised p. 8. thus. <hi>Things being thus it will be Impossible for them</hi> (the Catholicks)
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:63121:35"/>
                  <hi>to conclude from the sayings of a number of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that the Doctrin they would prove thence was the Catholick doctrin of the Church, because any number that is less than all does not proove a Catholik Consent.</hi> So that unless each single Father affirm each single point to be of Faith or <hi>the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Catholick Church</hi> (which, morally speaking; is Impossible to happen) it follows by his words that <hi>'tis Impossible to conclude thence the Catholick Doctrin of the Church;</hi> which amounts to this, that <hi>'tis Impossible to conclude any thing in Controversy from the Fathers even taken as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</hi> And this is his FIFTH PRINCIPLE. A strange conceit, that it should be Impossible to know the Consent of all <hi>England</hi> in a matter of Fact, (for example, the late war) without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with each single man in the whole Nation. Yet this is his Discourse when he sayes that <hi>no number less than all can prove a Catholick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">31. Yet some use certainly he allows of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for all this, else why does he quote them. Yes, and the Principle (which I reckon his SIXTH,) by virtue of which he enforces them is this, p. 8. <hi>The clear saying of one or two of those Fathers truely alledg'd by us to the Contrary will certainly prove that what many of them (suppose it) do affirm, and which but two or three as good Catholicks do deny, was not then a matter of Faith or a Doctrin of the Church.</hi> I wish my Ld. had been so Ingenuous as to have made use of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:63121:36"/>
this Principle when he charg'd our <hi>Church it self</hi> with the mistakes of a few Writers contradicted, not by <hi>one or two,</hi> but sometimes by a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this Principle shows 'twas not <hi>Reason</hi> in him but <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> which made him so hot. As for his Principle it self, it subsists not at all. For is it not known that more than <hi>one or two,</hi> that is S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the African Fathers deny'd the Baptism of Hereticks Valid, yet the Contrary was notwithstanding found and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to be Faith and the Sence of the Church. Let him consider how perfectly he engages himself in the very Sphere of Contingency and recedes from Universality, the Sphere of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, when he comes to rely on <hi>one or two;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he can show those <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> strangely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and upheld by Universal Nature or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring Circumstances. 'Tis possible even one or two Lawyers may hap to be ignorant of two or three Acts of Parliament. But, my Ld is still the best confuter of himself, as appears lately by this present Principle apply'd to his former car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage against our Church; To himself then let him answer. I conceive that if <hi>one or two's</hi> (not <hi>denying it to be of Faith</hi> or affirming expresly <hi>'tis not-of-Faith,</hi> he engages not so far; but) bare <hi>denying</hi> a point, argues what <hi>many</hi> do affirm, to be <hi>not-of-Faith; Ã  fortiori,</hi> one or two's <hi>affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> positively that to <hi>be of Faith and the Doctrin of the Catholick Church</hi> which many others bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny, argues <hi>'tis</hi> of Faith: 'Twas of Faith
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:63121:36"/>
then what <hi>Gennadius</hi> cited by himself, p. 59. affirms, that <hi>After Christs Ascension the Souls of all Saints go from the body to Christ;</hi> This being so, let him reflect what himself asserts, p. 49. that <hi>Justin Mariyr, Tertullian, Victorinus Martyr, Prudentius,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostom, Arethas, Euthimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and S. <hi>Bernard</hi> affirm none go to Heaven till the last day. Either then <hi>Gennadius</hi> his Testimony <hi>delivering the doctrin of the</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church is Inefficacious, and yet 'tis incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably the best, nay the onely Efficacious one in my Lds. whole book, or else according to him many Fathers (and not <hi>one or two</hi> onely) denying a point is no argument but that point may be of Faith. Whether all those Fathers held so or no is another Question and requires a longer discussion.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Fathers then are useless to the Dissuader, as having according to him no <hi>virtue</hi> at all of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Understanding; Yet he must make a <hi>show</hi> of them, else all's lost; and so he tells his Readers, p. 8. as if all were well, two things, both very remarkable. The one, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, <hi>In the prime and purest Antiquity</hi> the Protestants <hi>are indubitably more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours</hi> in the Fathers. A high Expression! but, compar'd with what he sayes; p. 7. that in those times our present <hi>differences were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of,</hi> it signifies that they miraculously <hi>more then conquer,</hi> where (if his words be true) no mortals else could either conquer or even <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque</hi>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:63121:37"/>
For how should one fight against such points in difference from those Fathers who <hi>never heard</hi> of those points! The other is, that <hi>even in the Fathers of the succeeding Ages</hi> the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants <hi>have the advantage both numero, pondere &amp; mensurÃ , in number weight and measure;</hi> which, joyn'd to his words at the bottome of p. 7. that <hi>each side may eternally and inconfutably bring sayings for themselves out of those Fathers,</hi> which signifies that 'tis to no end or purpose to alledge them, amounts very fairly to this, that he brags Protestants have a far greater <hi>number</hi> of Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are <hi>to no purpose</hi> than Catholicks have; that those Citations which have no possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force of concluding or <hi>no weight at all,</hi> do weigh more strongly for <hi>them</hi> than for <hi>us;</hi> and, lastly, that they have a greater <hi>measure</hi> than we of proofs not worth a rush with which they can bubble up their books to a voluminous bigness. And we willingly yield them the honour of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a very great advantage in all three, in case they be such as his own words qualifie them, to wit that each side may <hi>Eternally and Inconfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably</hi> alledge them.</p>
               <p n="33">33. We come now to his <hi>main</hi> and most Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and (in comparison) his <hi>onely</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, p. 9. laid out thus. <hi>We do wholly rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scriptures as the Foundation and final resort of all our Persuasions, but we also admit the Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. To finish our Discourse about the Fathers will make way to the Scripture. What means
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:63121:37"/>
                  <hi>admitting</hi> as contradistinguisht to <hi>relying on?</hi> Not, <hi>relying on;</hi> that's certain, for 'tis contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguisht to it; And yet to alledge any thing for a <hi>Proof</hi> as they do Fathers, and not to rely on it, is to confess plainly (for Truth will out) that they alledge them meerly for a <hi>show.</hi> He sayes they admit them as <hi>admirable Helps for the Understanding the Scriptures and good Testimony of the Doctrin deliver'd from their Forefathers.</hi> Have a care my Ld.: This supposes the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Tradition;</hi> For, if there be no Certainty of <hi>delivery,</hi> there is no <hi>doctrin delivered,</hi> nor consequently any thing for them to <hi>testify;</hi> and so the words <hi>good Testimony</hi> (unless our Ground of <hi>Continual Tradition</hi> stands) mean directly that they are <hi>good for nothing,</hi> as your former Discourses or Principles made them. But I ask, is their Interpretation of Scripture or Testimony <hi>Certain?</hi> If not, why should they even be <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted?</hi> Or how can <hi>Vncertain</hi> Interpreters and <hi>Witnessers</hi> be <hi>admirable Helps</hi> to interpret right and <hi>good Testimony?</hi> I fear my Ld. can onely mean they are <hi>Admirable Helps</hi> as Dictionaries and Books of Criticisms are to assist his Human Skill about the <hi>outward Letter.</hi> (which is a rare Office for a Father) and not to give him the <hi>inward Sence</hi> of it or the deliver'd Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Catholick Church; for, unless <hi>All</hi> conspire to speak to the same point, if any one be silent concerning it, it argues not (according to my Ld. p. 8.) <hi>a Catholick Consent,</hi> and so is
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:63121:38"/>
far beneath an <hi>admirable help.</hi> And this is what we reprehend exceedingly in the Protestants, that they love to talk gaily in common of any Sacred or Grave Authority for an affected <hi>form</hi> or show; but not at all value the <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> of such an Authority, not judge interiorly they have any worth valuing. They would credit themselves by pretending <hi>Fathers,</hi> yet at the same time lay wayes to elude them at pleasure; or (which is their very temper, springing from their renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Living and determinate Sence, and adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dead unsenc't words) they study to speak Indeterminately and confusedly, not particularly and closely.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Do I wrong them? Let my Ld. clear me; His First Principle is by him exprest to be the <hi>Scripture:</hi> and, on this Expression he so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly builds that p. 10, 11. he concludes thence, and <hi>Certainly</hi> too, thus. <hi>The Religion of our Church</hi> (sayes he) <hi>is therefore certainly Primitive and Apostolick, because it teaches us to believe the whole Scriptures of the old and New Testament, and nothing else as matter of Faith.</hi> What mean the word <hi>Scriptures?</hi> Any <hi>determinate sence</hi> of it, or the <hi>dead Characters?</hi> Alas, their Church is far from teaching them the <hi>first,</hi> or from having grounds to own such a pretence; but puts the Book in their hands and bids them find the <hi>sence</hi> of it or their <hi>Faith,</hi> for there is their <hi>Rule.</hi> 'Tis the bare <hi>Letter</hi> then unsenc't he means by the word <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and so he must say 'tis the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:63121:38"/>
                  <hi>Cuaracters</hi> his Church <hi>teaches us to believe, and nothing else as matter of Faith;</hi> that is, their whole Faith has for its object, <hi>Ink thus figur'd in a Book;</hi> A worthy Argument to proove their Church is certainly Primitive and Apostolick: whereas itis known, Faith was <hi>before</hi> those Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; and besides, if this be to be <hi>Apostolical,</hi> we owe nothing to the other Apostles for our faith, but onely to those six who writ. But we mistake him, he means <hi>neither sence</hi> of the word <hi>Scripture,</hi> and hates these distinctionswith all his heart which would oblige him to either. He meant to talk of <hi>Scripture</hi> indeterminately and confusedly, which might make a <hi>fine show,</hi> and yet expose him to no Inconvenience by giving any particular account of his meaning. His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from this his First Principle, being an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate one, will utterly overthrow the Papists without doubt; <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he p. 11.) <hi>unless there can be New Scriptures we can have no New matter of Belief, no new Articles of Faith.</hi> No my Ld: Yes, as long as by <hi>Scriptures</hi> you mean <hi>no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate sence</hi> of Scriptures, but the <hi>bare Letter</hi> onely, whose sence is fetch't out by <hi>Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and these (as we experience) depend on menes private Judgments and <hi>Fancies;</hi> if menes Fancies may vary <hi>every hour,</hi> you may have diverse In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations <hi>every hour,</hi> and so <hi>new Articles of Faith</hi> every hour. Is not this a mad kind of arguing, to conclude as absolute an unerrable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Faith, as if they had not onely a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63121:39"/>
Principle but even as self-evident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistakable as the First Principle in Metaphysicks to guid themselves by, whereas our daily ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight and their own sad experience every day teaches us by the practice of this Principle, and yet their differing in the Sence of Scripture in most high and most concerning Points, that the Speenlation is naught, and the Principle it self a false and mis-guiding Light. Nay I doubt my Ld. himself has no hearty value for this his First Principle, though he sayes he wholly relies on it; For I never saw Protestant Book in my Life thinner and sleighter in Scripture-Citations than is his Dissuasive: so that if that be his First Principle he makes little use of it.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Many other Propositions or Supposals are imply'd in his book to give it force. As that It matters not how a Citation is qualify'd so it be but alledg'd. 'Tis no matter whether the question be rightly stated or no. The Tenets of our Church are not to be taken from the use of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions found in approved Councils, speaking abstractedly, but from the particular Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some Divines. Every Foppery is a proper Effect of the Churches Doctrin. Points of Faith ought to be comprehensible to Reason, and Spiritual things sutable to Fancy. The Act of an Inquisition, Sayings of a few Divines or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists are all Catholik Faith and the Doctrin of the Church. That is <hi>rationally dissuasive</hi> which is <hi>confessedly Uncertain.</hi> No Answer was ever
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:63121:39"/>
given to the Citations or Reasons produc't in the Dissuasive. Talking soberly and piously about a point is oftentimes as good as prooving it. That tis Self-evident Scripture's Letter can bear but one Interpretation as wrought upon by Human Skills. These and multitudes of such like, though not exprest yet run imply'd in his carriage all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long this book, and suppos'd true to give it any force; yet so evidently false and weak, that to pull them out thence and make them show their heads, is enough to confute them.</p>
               <p>I conclude, and charge the Dissuader that he not onely hath never a Principle for his <hi>Dissuasive</hi> to subsist by, but farther, that 'tis Impossible but himself should know in his own Conseience that he <hi>has none,</hi> nay more that the Protestant Cause (and the same I say of all out of the Church) <hi>can have none.</hi> The first part of my charge I have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldly prooved in this present Appendix; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of it which charges him with Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of having no Grounds, hath two branches; and; for the former of those I alledge that the wayes he takes all along to manage his <hi>Dissuasive,</hi> are so evidently studious, so industrious, so designed and perfectly artificial, that, though one who is guided on in a natural way is oftentimes not aware of his thoughts or their method till he comes to reflect, yet 'tis Impossible <hi>he</hi> should not be aware of <hi>his.</hi> which he postures with such exquisit craft and such multitudes of preternatural sleights to render his Discourse plausible. For the later of those Branches
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:63121:40"/>
namely, that he cannot but know the Protestant Cause can have no Principles, to make it Evident I discourse thus <hi>ad hominem,</hi> what I have prov'd in <hi>Sure-Footing</hi> out of the nature of the Thing. 'Tis their most constant and avow'd Profession, and his p. 9. that they <hi>do wholly rely upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the foundation and final resort of all their Persuasions.</hi> This being so, Fathers and Councils are not held at all by <hi>them,</hi> but as far as they are agreeable to Scriptures; that is, their Testimony has no <hi>basis</hi> of Certainty from themselves or <hi>of their own,</hi> but what they participate from Scripture. Wherefore either they are <hi>No</hi> Principles, or else <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ones</hi> to their First Principle, <hi>Scripture.</hi> Unless then <hi>It</hi> be Certain or deserve the name of a <hi>Principle, They</hi> can never be held by Protestants <hi>such,</hi> nor consequently can merit the name of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> (even <hi>Subordinate</hi> ones) because then pretended <hi>First Principle</hi> from which onely they can derive Title to that dignity is, in that case, <hi>none</hi> it self: To <hi>Scripture</hi> then lets come. By which word if they agreed to mean any <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sence of it certainly known to be the true one,</hi> their Discourse were well-built: But, since their Church can own no determinate Sence of the Scripture deriv'd down from Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <hi>in antecedency to the Scripture's Letter,</hi> but (having renounc't <hi>that</hi> Way or Tradition) must say she has it meerly from that <hi>Letter</hi> as yet unsenc't, She must mean that 'tis the Scripture <hi>Letter</hi> She <hi>relies on</hi> as <hi>the foundation and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>

                  <hi>resort of all her Persuasions,</hi> nay for her Persuasion that this is the Sence of it. Since then Principles are determinate <hi>Sences,</hi> not characters or Sounds, neither is <hi>Scripture</hi> (as they take the word) a <hi>Principle,</hi> nor consequently Fathers or Councils, whose Certainty is resolvable into It. They'l say, that Letter is a <hi>Certain Way</hi> to arrive at a determinate Sence, and consequently that they have determinate Sence by means of it. I ask, is the Letter <hi>alone such?</hi> Then, in case it alone be absolutely sufficient to such an Effect, it will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it in every one; as, if Fire be alone sufficient to burn all the world, and so overpower all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of the matter, do but apply it, 'twill do that effect or burn it. Is there requisit some <hi>Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lership</hi> in the Subject Scripture's Letter is to work upon, or <hi>desire</hi> to see Truth in their Will? Then, if this be the onely requisit, it will work its Certifying or determining Effect upon all Schollers and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaners; and so no Schollers and well meaners can disagree in the Sence of it. The contrary to which all sober men acknowledge, &amp; daily Experience teaches us as much as we can be sure of any Human Action. The like Discourse holds whatever requisits they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; for still it will follow they must say, that in whomsoever they place that requisit they cannot dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the since of Scripture, which Common Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will confute. Nor will it avail them to run to Fundamentals, unless it be said the Trinity is no Fundamental, which the Dissuader makes the onely one p. 12. for the Socinians deny this, amongst whom
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:63121:41"/>
'tis a strange Immodesty in the Protestants to say there is nonc <hi>well-meaning, Learned</hi> or <hi>unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd</hi> to Scripture. Adding then to this most Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Proposition that <hi>a Cause proper to produce such an Effect if we put the Patient dispos'd and the Application, alwayes produces its Effect,</hi> on the Truth of which all Nature depends, adding this, I say, to the obvious and common Experience of Differers about Scriptures sence, in all whom 'tis Impossible to judge either Disposition of the <hi>Patient</hi> or <hi>Application</hi> is wanting, for all read it and strive with all the wit and skill they have to find the sence of it; it will follow most Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that the Fault is in the <hi>Agent</hi> or <hi>Cause,</hi> that is, that Scriptures Letter is <hi>unsit to Certify</hi> or bring us to a <hi>determinate sence</hi> of it: and therefore, since, till we know the <hi>Sence</hi> of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 'tis to us but meer <hi>Words,</hi> I am forc't by my reason to judge they have <hi>no Principles</hi> (Those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sence</hi>) but that their whole way is <hi>wordish;</hi> and, not out of disrespect to them (for this touches not them more than it does all others who have lest off the way of conveying down determinate Sence by Living voice and Practise, or Tradition) but I am oblig'd by Conscience and my duty to my Cause to declare that their whole Ground of their Faith is thus hollow and empty. Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test out of the nature of the thing, that their Cause can bear no way of <hi>Sence</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> but must forcibly be upheld by Wordishness; as by quoting Texts without any Certain Interpreter,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:63121:41"/>
Citations of Fathers not brought to <hi>Grounds</hi> not held by themselves <hi>Certain,</hi> fine Scripture phras'd flourishes of piety, and such like, In which the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suader is Excellent; Or else (if the Objecter be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry witty and have taken a great deal of pains in the way of Scepticism to be too hard for himself) by bringing all into Uncertainty, which is the acutest way of Wordishness, and most <hi>proper</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any Discourse that tends to Establish and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, because most opposit to it; and so I am to expect Necessity will force them to take this way when any replies to <hi>SURE-FOOTING.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know some will expect I should have answer'd the Dissuasive particularly; but I know no reason why I should be sollicitous to stand cutting of each single Branch of Errour or be careful to hinder their growth, after I have once pluck't the Tree that bore them up by the Roots.</p>

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFter I had printed <hi>Sure-Footing,</hi> I heard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally that you had been pleas'd to take notice of my <hi>Way</hi> and some signal Passages in <hi>Schisms Dispatcht.</hi> I was glad to hear that so ancient a Friend of mine had offer'd me a fair occasion to renew our acquaintance, resolving to take an account of his Exceptions, and requite them with a due Satisfaction assoon as I could find a season proper. Wherefore, when the last sheet of my Appendix against the Dissuader was under the press, finding both leasure and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to second my Intentions, I took your Book, perus'd diverse chief passages in it, and particularly what concern'd my self, p. 87.</p>
            <p>The first glance of it put me in some Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the difference I found between you in your Book and the character of you in my Thoughts long ago imprinted there: For in these I found you a solid sober man, a good Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as also ingenuous and candid; but in your Book, particularly in those passages, I saw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and was troubled to see it) you had either <hi>none</hi> of those Qualities I imagin'd in you, or to a very <hi>small</hi> degree. But, I began straight to reflect with my self that as, when I was a child,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:63121:43"/>
I fancy'd rooms very spacious and streets very long. which, coming to the state of a Man, I found very strangely diminisht; so my riper and more Judicious Thoughts saw now the measure of your virtues in their true demensions, which my younger and unexperienc't years had so strangely magnify'd and enhanc't. I doubt not but your outward appearance will make it thought by those that know you, I have said too much, let's see how I can justifie my self.</p>
            <p>I complain then that your carriage in this one page discovers you at once an absolute stranger to Science, and withal very uncivilly Injurious to me all along without any imaginable need, Ground or the least occasion given.</p>
            <p>You begin with a mistake of the reason why the Rational Way explained in <hi>Rushworth's Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi> was follow'd by me in <hi>Schism Dispatcht,</hi> or rather why that way was <hi>devised;</hi> and conceive 'tis because we despair of maintaining the Popes Personal <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and think all your own if you disprove this; So that you strongly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this the basis of all our Faith. By which I see Opinion and Faith is all one with you. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not your self nor your Readers Sir; our D<hi rend="sup">râ€¢</hi>. came and do dispute against personal Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilities far more strongly than you are even likely; and if you please to look into our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils you find no news of building Faith on any such ground, but onely on Tradition. The Way I take is the old-and-ever-Way of the Church;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:63121:43"/>
the <hi>farther Explication</hi> of it is indeed new, not occasion'd by our relinquishing Personal Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Pope, (you shall never show the Church ever built her Faith on a disputable Ground) but by this occasion.</p>
            <p>Had you look't into Things and consider'd the progress of the Rational part of the world as well as you pore on Books, you would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd that the Wits of this last half Century have been strangely curious and Inquisitive, and straining towards a Satisfaction apt to bring all into doubt which they conceiv'd to hinder their way to it. Had you reflected on those Heroes of such Attempts, the Noble and Learned Sr. <hi>Kenelm Digby, des Caries, Gassendus, Harvey,</hi> and now <hi>the Royal Society,</hi> those living Libraries of Learning in their several wayes, you would have found that, parallel to them in the matter of <hi>Controversy</hi> were the Ld. <hi>Faukland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chillingworth;</hi> whose acute wits sinding no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment nor Satisfaction in the Resolution of our Faith as made by some particular Divines, nor yet in the Grounds of the Protestant Beleef, endeavour'd to shake the whole Fabrick of <hi>our</hi> Faith, and allow but a handsome Probability to <hi>their own.</hi> Whence, Doubt and Inquisitiveness being the Parents of Satisfaction and Evidence, Catholick Controvertists began to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more closely and regardfully to look into the Ground<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Church, proceeded upon by Councils and all the Faithful, insisted on and stuck to by the Fathers, especially those) who were most Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversial as <hi>Athanasius,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin, Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> &amp;c. and at large by <hi>Vincentius Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis;</hi> and, to consider how Proper Causes lay'd in Things by the Course of God's Providence had the virtue to produce the Effect of deriving down with Infallible Certainty Christ's doctrin to us. Hence sprung our <hi>farther Explication</hi> of this way which so much bewonders you. This is your mistake; now to your Injuries.</p>
            <p>I quoted <hi>Rushworth's Dialogues</hi> and call'd it <hi>The rich Store-house of motives fortifying Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Upon this your Reason works thus. <hi>This I do not understand; I never heard of such an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour; and it is possible the better to cry himself up he might borrow another name.</hi> What means <hi>This I do not understand?</hi> I'le acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It means you are so wedded to talk <hi>by the book</hi> that you are utterly at a loss if an Authour be quoted you have not heard of: The reason of which is because as I see by your Discourses, which look like so many dreams, your Genius inclines you not much to trade in Books which pretend to the way of Reason; and, if <hi>Schism Dispatch't</hi> so amaz'd you, 'tis to be fear'd that <hi>Sure-Footing</hi> and its <hi>Corollaries</hi> may put you out of your wirts. But with what Civility should you hint I so extoll'd my self under another name, it being (as you say) but <hi>possible.</hi> Should
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:63121:44"/>
I put upon you all things that were possible, what a Monster might I make you? But it abundantly manifests your short reach of reason that 'tis <hi>highly Improbable.</hi> For either I must have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd my self to the world to be Authour of <hi>both</hi> books and then I had sham'd my self with so high self-praises; or not have manifested it, and then where's the credit I had got by the other book I had so extoll'd.</p>
            <p>Your next Injury is that <hi>I make nothing of, and disclaim the Testimonies of Popes and Prelates, calling them the words of a few particular men,</hi> and cite for it <hi>Schism Dispatch't</hi> p. 98. where there is not one word of either <hi>Pope or Prelate,</hi> nor of <hi>disclaiming</hi> any <hi>Testimony,</hi> nor of calling those <hi>the bare words of a few particular men;</hi> Now, if this be so, every word you charge against me is an injurious Calumny and your whole charge a direct Falsisication. My words are these. <hi>By this is shown in what we place the Infallbility of the CHURCH, not in the bare words of few particular men, but in the manifest and ample Attestation of such a Multitude,</hi> &amp;c. Where, though you cannot or will not, yet the Reader, if he understands plain <hi>English,</hi> will see I meddle not with who is or is not Infallible <hi>besides</hi> the Church, nor sean the validity of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of Popes or Prelates</hi> but treat in what the Infallibility of the CHURCH consists: Now the word CHURCH denothing in its First Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication an <hi>Universality,</hi> I place her Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:63121:45"/>
in Universal Attestation from Age to Age. Notwithstanding which, my Corollaries in <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Footing,</hi> if your Wonderment at my <hi>new Way</hi> or your own habituation to words will let you understand them, will let you see I also place In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in lesser Councils; &amp; even in particular Sees, but most in the Popes or the <hi>Roman;</hi> not by way of an <hi>Afflatus</hi> (of which I for my part an able to give no account) but by a course of Things Natural and Supernatural, laid by Gods sweetly-and-strongly ordering Providence in <hi>second Causes.</hi> But what aggravates your Falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is, that whereas I there counterpose <hi>bare words</hi> and <hi>Attestation,</hi> rejecting the first and making use of the later, you make me affirm <hi>Testimonies</hi> to be <hi>bare words;</hi> To which how much I attribute every such passage of mine will tell you; for on them the way I follow entirely builds. So that this whole Charge is either quite opposit or else disparate to what I say in the place whence you cite my words.</p>
            <p>Your third Injury (and 'tis a strange one) is that <hi>I sleight Scriptures, Fathers and Councils as much, (in this business)</hi> and <hi>call them in scorn Wordish Testimonies;</hi> for which you cite <hi>Schism Dispatch't</hi> p. 42. But not such a word is found there, nor I will undertake any where else in my Writings. 'Tis likely indeed, that speaking of such things as you use to call <hi>Testimonies,</hi> (for you name every sleight Citation <hi>such</hi> whether it have the nature of <hi>Witnessing</hi> in it, that is, be
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:63121:45"/>
built on <hi>Sensations</hi> or no) I may say <hi>they</hi> are <hi>wordish,</hi> in regard you have no Certain means to arrive at their Sence; and till then I beseech you what are they else but meer <hi>WORDS?</hi> or rather meer <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Sounds?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What high deference I give to Scripture see Â§. 18, &amp; 19. beginning p. 146. in <hi>Sure-Footing:</hi> To Councils, see Corol. 27. To Fathers, taking them properly, you may be inform'd by the whole Body of my Discourse concerning Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which they are a <hi>part,</hi> and the Eminentest Members of it in Proportion to their number.</p>
            <p>Your 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Injury is that <hi>the onely thing I place Infallibility in is Oral Tradition and the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Fathers of Families;</hi> whereas I place <hi>Infallibilities</hi> also in other things, though I make this the <hi>greatest.</hi> But your discourse makes me disesteem and exclude all others, both <hi>Popes, Prelates, Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> by establishing <hi>this;</hi> Whereas by settling <hi>this,</hi> I establish <hi>all others,</hi> nor find you any such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in my Book; on the contrary 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by those words I <hi>include</hi> them; unless you think <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> are not <hi>Fathers of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> but take lodgings or hire rooms in other mens houses by the week. Truth is, being to express the obligatory descent of Faith from Age to Age, I cast about for a common word fit to express such Deliverers, and conceiv'd this of <hi>Fathers of Families</hi> the aptest; because the Church consisting of <hi>Families,</hi> this was most
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:63121:46"/>
General; and every Master of a Family, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such, has an <hi>Obligation</hi> to see all under him taught their Catechism or Faith. This in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which was enough for my purpose then. But, were I to distinguish the strength of those Testimonies, I should show that a <hi>Priest</hi> hath an Incomparable advantage above a <hi>Layman,</hi> a <hi>Bishop</hi> above <hi>him,</hi> and the <hi>Head of the Church</hi> above a <hi>Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Injury is lighter, because it speaks but your own Apprehensions and I am to expect no better from you. My many <hi>chimerical suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi> and my <hi>Impertinencies</hi> in which <hi>I so please my self, must needs begets wonder</hi> (say you) <hi>in case the man (as probably) be of any account and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the world.</hi> Now my <hi>Suppositions</hi> in the way I take are chiefly these, that men in all Ages had Eyes and Ears, the wit and (if they were good Christians) the Grace not to tell an open and damnable ly to no purpose; and, for these, I should much <hi>wonder</hi> my self if you did not <hi>wonder</hi> at such odd Grounds, and esteem them <hi>Chimerical,</hi> because you have read them in no ancient <hi>book;</hi> for you use not to look into <hi>Things. By this extravagant kind of dealing,</hi> you say <hi>you cannot but suspect</hi> me <hi>to be one of the Fraternity of the new-pretended Lights.</hi> I believe you heartily: For, to begin with Self-evident principles and thence to deduce Immediate Consequences is such a <hi>new Light</hi> to you, as I dare undertake scarce one beam of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:63121:46"/>
it ever enter'd into the Eye of your Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I conceive 'tis the difference between your way &amp; ours which breeds all this mis-intelligence. Ours ayms to bring all Citations to Grounds by way of Cause and Effect; yours to admit them confusedly, especially if writ by some old Authors provided they speak not for the Interest of Papists, for then they are questionable. Ours is to be backwards in assenting to any thing writ long ago, till our Reason be satisfy'd no Passion or mistake could invalidate its Authority; yours to believe them hand over head, if the book be but <hi>said</hi> to be Authentick; which is to a degree the same Weakness as that of the rude Country people who think all true they see <hi>in Print,</hi> and that their having a ballad of it is sufficient to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticate it. Our Principle is that no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>deserves any Assent farther than Reason gives it to deserve,</hi> and hence we lay Principles to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Veracity</hi> in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour ere we yeeld over our <hi>Assent</hi> to his sayings. Yours is kinder-hearted than to hold them to such strict terms, and is well appay'd if some Authour you have a conceit of, praise the other for a <hi>good Writer,</hi> or his work for a <hi>good Book.</hi> Ours is to lay <hi>Self-evident Principles</hi> and deduce <hi>immediate consequences,</hi> and by this means to cultivate our <hi>Reason,</hi> that noblest Faculty in us which constitutes us <hi>Men;</hi> yours to lay up mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Notes gleand from several Authours; and, if you better any Spiritual Faculty you
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:63121:47"/>
have, 'tis your <hi>Memory</hi> not your <hi>Reason.</hi> Hence we carry, for the main of our Doctrin, and as far as 'tis antecedent to written Authority, our Library in our <hi>Heads;</hi> and can as well study in a Garden, as sitting in a Library stufit with books; whereas your way of Learning ties you to turn over leaves of Authours, as children do their Dictionaries, for every step of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: and as an ingenious man said of those Poets who spun not their Poems out of their own Invention, but made them up of scraps of wit transcrib'd from other Authours
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>â€” Lord! how they'd look</l>
                     <l>If they should chance to lose their paper Book?</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
So we may say of you; that, if your Notes you have with much pains collected, hap to miscarry, you are utterly at a loss; so that little of your Learning is <hi>Spiritual</hi> and plac't in your Soul, as true Learning should be, but in <hi>material</hi> and perishable paper and characters. In a word, your whole performance ends here, that you are able to declare <hi>what other men say;</hi> whereas ours aims at enabling us to manifest <hi>what our selves KNOW.</hi> No wonder then if our wayes being so different, we cannot hit it; but that, as you <hi>think</hi> ours <hi>Chimerical,</hi> so I <hi>assure</hi> my self yours; and consequently all you write in that way, is (as far as you go about to <hi>conclude</hi> or <hi>cause Assent</hi> by it) exceedingly <hi>ridiculous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I doubt not, will confirm you in what you said before, that I am <hi>no Friend to Ancient</hi>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:63121:47"/>
               <hi>Books or Learning.</hi> To <hi>Note-book</hi> Learning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not much; to <hi>true</hi> Learning or <hi>Knowledge,</hi> very much; and even to <hi>the other</hi> as far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to <hi>This.</hi> To Books I am so much a Friend, that I desire not a few should be selected of each sort by a General Council of Schollers, and the rest burn'd, as did an ingenious person; but I would onely have the riff-raff burn'd ('tis no great matter if that tedious Legend of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dee's</hi> Sprights accompany them) and the Generality preserv'd; but so, that their Contents should be gather'd in Heads or Common-place books for Schollers to look in occasionally, not for <hi>rational</hi> Creatures to spend their whole lives in poring on them and noting them with a foolish expectation to find <hi>true Knowledge</hi> by stuffing their Heads with such a gallimawfry, and after 40. years thus spent, never the wiser; for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is little better than for one to hope to frame himself a good sute of Apparel by pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thrums ends out of a multitude of old and overworn Garments. But to the point, I distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish <hi>Books.</hi> And, as for the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their Letter and Sence (which is done by Tradition) 'tis clear they are of Incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value; not onely for the Divine Doctrin contain'd in them, but also for many particular passages, whose Source or first Attestation not being universal, nor their nature much Practical, might possibly have been lost in their conveyance down by Tradition. Next, follows those of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:63121:48"/>
               <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> and (supposing Christ a perfect Law-giver) 'tis clear all they have to do with Faith is to <hi>witness</hi> the Churches beleef; and the former of them to <hi>declare</hi> or explain Faith or the <hi>Churches Sence</hi> against obstinate Hereticks. As <hi>such</hi> then their Books are to be valu'd, that is <hi>exceedingly.</hi> Next, follow such as <hi>Euclid's</hi> or <hi>Archimedes</hi> his, which express <hi>Science;</hi> and those are of very great worth, in regard they acquaint us with and manifest to our hands the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the former world; which being <hi>Speculative,</hi> little of it could have come down by Tradition, except when that Speculation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Practical, and exprest it self in Matter by many useful or rather <hi>needful</hi> Arts, Trades or Manufactures. After these succeed <hi>Opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Books,</hi> of which this last Age has produc't multitudes; and these also are very useful, if the Reader go not too credulously to work, but have right Principles laid already in his head; for then the variety of mens Conceits and their Reasons for them will hint to a Considerer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Consequences, which otherwise the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and distractedness of our Reason would not have light of; nay, even the miscairiages of such Reasoners avail a wise man, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> out of the <hi>contrary</hi> Opinions of Philosophers, whom he saw failing in their Grounds, gathered very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the <hi>middle</hi> Truth. These Books therefore are worth preserving. <hi>Human Histories</hi> come next; and These second Tradition in her object,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:63121:48"/>
               <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> after she hath authenticated <hi>them</hi> and the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of their Writers. There are others fit for Explications or Rational Declarations of a point by Similitudes, allusions, Examples &amp; such like, as <hi>Pliny's Natural History,</hi> Emblems, Fictions, &amp; others of an <hi>Ornamental</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which being useful for Sermons and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses sutable to the middle size of the world, 'tis plain they are preservable: With this caution that these and chiefly <hi>Opinionative</hi> books be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kept from the weak and credulous vulgar, or else in the Preface to them some learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority declare in common how far they are to be credited; lest by imposing on the reasons of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, they hinder the world's improvement. <hi>Prayer-books</hi> and <hi>Recreation-books</hi> 'tis almost as Evident they are to be preserv'd, as 'tis that Prayers and Recreations are to be used. Onely caution is to be had the <hi>former</hi> be examin'd well and approov'd by Ecclesiastical Authority, and that the <hi>later</hi> be <hi>chast</hi> and <hi>unabusive.</hi> You have here my sentiment concerning Books; against which you shall find nothing in <hi>Schism Dispatch't,</hi> or any of my Writings. In a word, I would have every thing distinguish't, examin'd by Grounds, &amp; allow'd as far as 'tis reasonable: Nor wonder I much at your mistake of me in this point, for you are not the onely man that thinks all Books, and even Authority to be absolutely deny'd, when they are sorted, and rank't in their just degree of merit; that is, indeed, settled and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish't;<pb n="340" facs="tcp:63121:49"/>
 for we <hi>Metaphysicians</hi> think nothing to stand firm but by <hi>being,</hi> or <hi>being held-to-be,</hi> truly what <hi>it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You denounce <hi>Wo to Colledges and Libraries</hi> if these men <hi>should prevail.</hi> Yet, you see now I leave you <hi>Libraries</hi> enow, and permit you your onely darlings, <hi>Books;</hi> and onely desire you would love them <hi>wisely.</hi> Neither will <hi>Colledges</hi> forfeit their Libraries to my Discourse. Onely, whereas you would have Schollers educated there, onely <hi>pore</hi> on books, <hi>Note</hi> and (when they come to write,) <hi>quote,</hi> I would have them take Principles along with them by which to judge and consider of what they read. Without which 'tis to be fear'd their much reading will do them more harm then good; and even pervert honest <hi>natural Reason</hi> in them by filling their heads with a multitude of unconnected and unconne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctible Ends of <hi>Sayings,</hi> impossible to be ever postur'd in the frame of Reason, and themselves unfurnish't of means to know which rather to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to; which may sit them to talk indeed of many things, like Parrats; yet, all the while, for want of Principles, <hi>know</hi> nothing of what they say. If you would have Colledges consist of such, I conceive I am a far better Friend to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges than your self are, and that no great cause of <hi>Woe</hi> will come to them by my means. But, as our way in your conceit brings <hi>Woe</hi> to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Libraries, so you affirm that <hi>Atheism and Mahometism will get by it.</hi> By which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:63121:49"/>
what a Disputant you are. I beleeve you would quote Scriptures and Books to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute an <hi>Atheist</hi> or <hi>Mahometan;</hi> whereas I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, since all Discourse supposes an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Discoursers in some Common Principle, and they denie or undervalue your <hi>written</hi> proofs, you must begin to confute them by Maxims of <hi>common Reason,</hi> antecedent to all Authority. For <hi>these,</hi> Human Nature obliges all men to hold to, unless they have quite irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaliz'd themselves into perfect Scepticism; whereas they reject or sleight the <hi>other;</hi> which to render Efficacious you must go to work first with Principles of plain reason.</p>
            <p>Your last Injury which I account the worst of all the rest, is deliver'd thus. <hi>Others, of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved worth and abilities have met with this man, who, I think, have done him more credit than he deserved.</hi> This argues you are so set to abuse me, that no Testimony, though never so valid, and confest to be such, can stave you of. And the Judgment or Veracity of my Friends, who speak by Experience shall be question'd, rather than you will be brought to entertain any conceit of me that's handsome. You leap vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily into Falsifications and ill-languag'd mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceits without any motive, but are so restif and backward to think or speak in the lest <hi>civilly</hi> of me, that witnesses <hi>of approved worth and abilities,</hi> cannot win you to favourable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions nor keep you from pursuing your reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:63121:50"/>
Censoriousness. Had you found half that Testimony for the Authentickness of an old Writer in some mouse-eaten rag of Antiquity it had gone down currently with your Genius, and bin next to Gospel. I value not your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of me; but highly and equally dislike your humour as void of all Ingenuity, whether it had been us'd to my self or another. When you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view <hi>Schism Dispatcht,</hi> and see your mistakes, I hope you will have a good conceit of my Friends at least; for whom in this passage I apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize.</p>
            <p>But that I may re-acquaint my self with you, I am to tell you that you also have met me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly and knew me very well. Nay, that I am exceedingly bound to you for the best favour in the world; which is that, accidentally, you contributed to make me a Catholick. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis long ago, I am forc't to remind you of it by two Tokens. One is that in <hi>Durham</hi>-house where you at that time lodg'd when you came to <hi>London,</hi> and in your chamber there, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of reading a book writ by a certain Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Bishop against the <hi>Real presence,</hi> I observ'd, and acquainted you with my observation, that, to my Judgment, the Fathers spoke more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably for the Papists tenet than the Protestants: Hereupon, you took me by the hand and told me <hi>they were mad who read the Ancient Fathers and saw not they meant Christ was as really in the Sacrament as in Heaven.</hi> The other was yet
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:63121:50"/>
more remarkable, and this; that (either your Grandfather or Father, I know not which, but I think) your Grandfather was intimate with Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and, when he had put out his Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Christ's presencein the Sacrament, which dodg'd and shuffled between <hi>really</hi> and <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>really,</hi> that is, between <hi>is</hi> and <hi>is-not,</hi> he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> with it, and laid open to him the non-Sence and indefensibleness of it, asking him why he put out so strange an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which he was never able to make good? at which Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> took hold of his own finger, and said, <hi>See you this? I would willingly cut it off on condition I had never put it out so.</hi> To which your Grandfather reply'd, <hi>You should then explain it some other way;</hi> Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, <hi>My Institutions are so spread all over France that 'tis now too late.</hi> Thus you, letting me see by a Testimony very <hi>immediate,</hi> that the late Authour of this Tenet which now so reigns all over <hi>England,</hi> wish't his finger cut off when he writ it. How you will reconcile this with the late new piece of the Rubrick in the Common-Prayer-book, absolutely renouncing all <hi>real presence,</hi> in which point the Church of of <hi>England</hi> formerly exprest her self abstracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do you consider.</p>
            <p>Sir, I beseech you let this be a fair warning to you how you deal disingenuously for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and pardon some of my expressions to my high provocation and exceeding great hast: I
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:63121:51"/>
am sure the worst of them is a Civility compar'd to the harsh carriage you have us'd towards your self in openly falsifying both my words and sence, and causlesly wresting to an ill constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction every passage you touch't; yet not doing me the right to go about to answer any one in the least, that so I might see by your Reasons you had Grounds to think as you writ. Had you argu'd against me I know too well the right of a Writer, to take it ill if you laid open and <hi>nam'd</hi> my conceived Faults, though the <hi>names</hi> of them had been <hi>harsh Words;</hi> but not even to attempt to confute them, yet to flie into such Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is the very definition of <hi>railing.</hi> I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme sorry to lay open the Fault of a Friend, though my own Concern made it Fitting, and your demerit <hi>Just,</hi> and do assure you that onely the Injury to my Cause, which went along in that action oblig'd me to this Vindication. Setting aside the duty I owe to <hi>That,</hi> I am still as ever.</p>

            <p>I Am certainly inform'd there is an Answer to my Book intended, and a Person chosen out for that Employment; whose Name I am unconcern'd to know, it being only his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as a Writer I have to do with. I receive the Alarum with great chearfulness; knowing that, if my Adversary behaves himself well, it will exceedingly conduce to the clearing and settling the main point there controverted. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is difference between being <hi>call'd</hi> an Answer and <hi>being</hi> an Answer, and that 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely opposit to my Genius, to be task't in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open mens Faults even as Writers, (though it has been my unhappiness formerly to meet with Adversaries, whose way of winning made that carriage my only duty) wherefore to prevent, as much as I am able, all occasion of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savory oppositions, and to make way to the clearing the point, that so our Discourse may redound to the profit and satisfaction of our Readers, I make bold to offer you these few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions; which in effect contain no more but a Request you would speak to the <hi>point,</hi> and in such a <hi>way</hi> as is apt to bring the matter nearer a clearing. This if you please to do, you will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63121:52"/>
very much credit your self and your endeavours in the opinion of all ingenuous persons. If you refuse, and rather chuse to run into Rhetorical Excursions, and such Discourses as are apt to breed new Controversies not pertinent to the present one under hand, you will extreamly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage both your self, your party and your Cause, and give me an exceeding advantage against them all; I shall also have the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have manifested before-hand by means of this Letter, that I have contributed as much as in me lies to make you avoid those Faults, which I must then be forc't to lay open and severely press upon you, little to your Credit nor your Causes neither; You being (as I am informd and Reason gives it) signally chosen out as held most able to maintain it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there may be no more distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us than what our Cause enforces, I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assure you that though I highly dislike your Tenets negatively opposit to what we hold Faith, and the Way of Writing I foresee you must take (unless you resolve to love Candour better than your Cause) as being Inconclusive and so apt to continue not finish debates, yet I have not the least <hi>pique</hi> against yours or any mans Person. Nor have I any particular aversion against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant party; rather I look upon it with a better eye than on any other Company whatever which has broke Communion with the Catholick Church: It preserves still unrenounc't the form of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63121:52"/>
the Church-Government instituted by Christ; and many grave Solemnities and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which make our Union less difficult: Many of their soberest Writers acknowledge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the renounc't Tenets to be <hi>Truths:</hi> some of them also profess to hold <hi>Tradition,</hi> especially for Scripture's Letter; and even for those Points or Faith-Tenets in which they and we agree; that is, where their Interest is not touch't. I wish they would as heartily hold to it in all other Points which descended by it, and look into the Virtue it has of <hi>ascertaining,</hi> and declare in what that Virtue <hi>consists;</hi> I am confident, a little can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of confessing truly what they finde, joyn'd with an endeavour of looking into Things rather than Words, would easily make way to a fair Correspondence. I esteem, and even honour the Protestants from my heart for their firm Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his Sacred Majesty and his Royal Father; This uniting them already with all sober Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks under that excellent notion of good Subjects, and in the same point of Faith, the Indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the duty of Allegiance we owe our Prince by Divine Law. Lastly I declare, that for this as well as for Charitable Considerations, I have a very particular zeal for their reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their Mother-Church; and that 'tis out of this love of Union I endeavour so earnestly to beat down the wordish and <hi>dissatisfactory</hi> way of Writing, and go about to <hi>Evidence</hi> the <hi>Ground</hi> of all our Faith; knowing, that, as wounds are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63121:53"/>
never connaturally and solidly cur'd, by uniting the distant sides at the surface, and leaving them disunited and unheal'd at the bottom, but the cure must begin there first; so, the onely Way to heal the Wounds of the Church, is to begin first to win some to acknowledge the most radical and bottom-Principle of all Faith, as controverted between us; without which all agreement in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points must needs be unsound and hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted. This is my onely aym in <hi>Sure-Footing.</hi> That therefore you may not obstruct so good a work, and withall perform the duty of a solid and candid Writer, I offer to your self and all ingenuous Readers these few Reflexions: not sprung from my Will (for what Authority have I to prescribe you your method) but from true Reason working upon the Thing; which makes it just duty in you, and so ought oblige you to follow it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the first place, fince the scope of my whole Book is about the <hi>First Principle in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy,</hi> or the Ground of all Faith, as to our Knowledge; that is, about a Point antecedent to all particular Points; I conceive it reasonable you should let your Discourse stand firm to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, and not permit it to slide into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies about Particulars. For so, 'tis evident, we shall be apt to multiply many words little to our present purpose. On what conditions you may have right to alledge Particulars as pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Instances of Traditions failing, shall be seen hereafter.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63121:53"/>
            <p n="4">4. Next, I desire you would please to speak out Categorically, and declare whether you hold Faith <hi>absolutely Certain to us,</hi> or else <hi>Possible to be false for any thing we know.</hi> To explicate my self better, that so I may void some common and frivolous Distinctions, my intent is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you in behalf of the Christian Reader and his due satisfaction, whether you hold Gods Providence has laid in the whole Creation any Certain means, by way of Proper Causes to such an Effect, to bring down Faith truly to us, and whether we can arrive at Certain Knowledge of those means, that is, come to <hi>see</hi> or <hi>know</hi> the Connexion between such Causes and their Effect spoken of. I make bold to press you earnestly to this declaration; and my reason is, because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will more conduce to the Conclusion of our present Debate: For, in case such Causes <hi>be</hi> laid and can be <hi>seen</hi> by us, then they are Evident or Demonstrative Reasons for the Ground of our Faith's Certainty: But, if no such Causes be <hi>laid,</hi> or being laid, cannot be <hi>seen</hi> by us, then all the Wit of man can never avoid the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but that we can have onely Probability for all our Faith; that is, for any thing we abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely know, 'tis all as false as an old wife's tale; since there are no <hi>degrees</hi> in Truths and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. If you advance this Civil piece of Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, you must pardon me if I be smart with you in opposition to so damnable and Fundamental an Errour: I love Christianity and Mankinde <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63121:54"/>
well to suffer that Position which destroyes effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually the Root of all their Eternal Happiness, and the Substance of all their Hope, to pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigmatiz'd, as it deserves. Nor think to avail your self by some Discoursers in our Schools, It will be shown, when prest, that they are still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd good Christians through the virtue of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which they all hold to, notwithstanding their private speculations: but you not, because of your want of Certain Grounds, to make you rationally <hi>hold</hi> Christs Faith. They onely mistook a Word, whereas you will be found to erre in the whole <hi>Thing,</hi> or the ordinary Means to true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
            <p>Again, if such Causes be fitting to be laid by God's Providence, 'tis impossible to avoid the Doctrin propos'd in <hi>Sure-Footing,</hi> because 'tis absolutely Impossible to invent any thing that looks like such Causes, but those which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd there; nor did any other Way ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to show any such. Whence I foresee your Cause will force you to fly for refuge to the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Uncertainty, or possible Falshood of all our Faith for any thing any man living knows by ordinary means. A sad consequence of an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous tenet! But 'tis connatural, and, so to be expected, such Effects should follow the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Rule of Faith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thirdly, I conceive it very reasonable that you would please to declare whether <hi>Controversy</hi> onght to have any First Principle or no; If <hi>none,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63121:54"/>
then to speak candidly out, and confess that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertists</hi> are <hi>Certain</hi> of <hi>nothing</hi> they say, since their discourse has no <hi>Ground</hi> or First Principle to rely on. If <hi>any,</hi> whether Tradition be It; or, if it be not, what else is; and then vouch (as plain reason tells us you ought) that what you assigne has truly in it the nature of a <hi>First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> which common Reason gives to be <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidence.</hi> Or, lastly, to profess (if you judge it your best play) that, what you substitute in stead of Tradition, though it be a First Principle, yet it need not be at all <hi>self-evident.</hi> Any thing shall content me, so you will but please to speak out, and to the point.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Again, since it is evidently your task to argue against <hi>Tradition's Certainty,</hi> 'tis as Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that while you argue against it, you must bear your self as holding It <hi>uncertain;</hi> I conceive then plain Reason obliges you not to produce any thing <hi>against</hi> Tradition which depends <hi>upon</hi> Tradition for its Certainty; for, in doing so you would invalidate and even nullify all your own proofs: Since, if Tradition be held by you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and they have no certainty but by means of It, they must be confest Uncertain too; and so they would be incompetent to be produc't as <hi>proofs,</hi> and your self very <hi>dis-ingenuous</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them: I add <hi>self-contradicting</hi> too, and <hi>Unskilful;</hi> Nature and <hi>Aristotle</hi> teaching us, that a Discourser ought not sustain contrary to himself. Hence plainest Reason excludes you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63121:55"/>
from alledging any kind of Testimony, either from Scripture, Councils, Fathers, or History, till you answer my Corollaries 12, 15, 16. which pretend to demonstrate the Certainty of all these depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on Tradition's; and the onely way to show my discourses there to be weak, is to manifest my mistake by declaring into what other thing your Certainty of those Testimonies is finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvable, which is not coincident with Tradition. When you produce such a Principle, and prove it such, you have right to alledge the foresaid Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, for then you can make good their Authority: Till then, you can have no right in true reason to do it. Not onely, because till then you are to be held a Renouncer of that Thing's Certainty upon which there are pretended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations against you Theirs is built; and those presum'd true ones, because you let such strongest Attempts pass unanswer'd; but very particularly for this Consideration that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent matter restrains you from it: For, our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is about the Ground of that Authority which ascertains to us Faith; which theresore is antecedent to the notions of Faith, Faithful, Church, Councils, Fathers, nay and creditable History-books too; since those rely on Tradition (taken at large) for their Certainty, as is evident by plain reason, Coroll. 16, 24. which devolves into this, that Tradition is FIRST AUTHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITY, and so not proovable or disproovable by any other secondary <hi>Authorities,</hi> but ought to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63121:55"/>
be impugn'd by pure <hi>Reason.</hi> But, if you think fit to grant this Certainty to Tradition taken at large, yet deny it to <hi>Christian</hi> Tradition, which hath, besides its Human force most powerful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Motives also to strengthen it; please to speak it out, and the strange unreasonableness of the position will quickly be made appear. Or, if you grant <hi>Christian</hi> Tradition Certain in bringing down those common Points in which we agree, yet Fallible, nay actually erring, in bringing down to us those other points which we were found holding upon Tradition when you left us, and for which, as grievous Errors, you pretended to leave us; please to declare in what you hold the <hi>virtue</hi> of Tradition consists, <hi>ascertaining</hi> to us both those common points, and how we come to know Tradition is engag'd for them; which done, it will quickly appear whether its ascertaining vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue has its Effect upon <hi>some,</hi> and not others; or on <hi>all.</hi> Unless you do this, your very admittance of Tradition's Certainty in some, overthrows you without more ado: for, to acknowledge it argumentative for the Certainty of <hi>some,</hi> grants it a virtue of Ascertaining, which therefore you are oblig'd to grant in <hi>all,</hi> unless you give the reason of your Exception: otherwise to admit it when your Interest is not toucht, and reject it when it opposes you, is plainly to confess that Tradition is able to <hi>certify,</hi> yet that you admit it when you list, and reject it when you list.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Being inform'd then by Evident Reason,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63121:56"/>
that no kind of Authority but only the way of Reason is a competent Weapon to fight against Tradition with; I have three things to propose to your Thoughts on this occasion, which I hope will sound reasonable to any intelligent man by the very mentioning. First, that you would not alledge such Arguments as strike as well at the Constancy of every <hi>Species</hi> in Nature, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rational Nature; that is, such natural <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> as tend to destroy all Natural Certainty. Secondly, that your objections be not forrain, or fetch't from afar of; for these are multiplia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without End, and apt to be suggested by Fancy upon every not-seeing the coherence of some other remote (whether real or conceited) Truth, with the Tenet we aim to impugn; but that they be <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>close,</hi> that is, taken out of the Intrinsecal Nature of the Thing; For so, they will be more forcible and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be apt to do your Cause much service; and unless they be such, they will do it none: For, in regard my whole process is grounded on the nature of the Thing, as appears by my Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and every Logician knows that <hi>remote</hi> and <hi>common</hi> considerations are liable, for any thing we know, to be connected or not-connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the point we would apply them to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we see no Connexion but what's Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; it follows that 'tis a very incompetent and dissatisfactory way to impugn an Adversary who endeavours all along to frame his discourfe out of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63121:56"/>
the Intrinsecal Nature of the Thing, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, or unimmediate, that is, indeed, Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected <hi>Mediums.</hi> The third thing I request is, that you either grant that no Argument or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is Conclusive, Obliging-to-Assent, or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, but what is either Proper (at least Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary) Cause or Effect; or else show us out of Logick that other <hi>Mediums</hi> have this virtue, and how they come to have it. This way of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure will give me a great respect for you as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king honestly the Way which is apt to clear Truth; and you will have this Satisfaction to your Conscience that you have endeavour'd it to your power by following the best method you could imagin to give your Cause its due advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, in case it can bear that Test; that is, in case it be Truth. And, if it cannot bear it, that is, if it be no Truth, 'tis your own best Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by this strict procedure to have discover'd it. Your Judicious Readers also that look seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously for satisfaction, will rest much edify'd and thankfull for your pursuing that Method which is likely to save them a great deal of fruitless pains in reading multitudes of books writ in a loose way, whence no Conclusion or Satisfaction is likely to result.</p>
            <p n="8">8. My fifth request, and I hope 'tis just and reasonable, is this; that, if you conceive your Discourse has made good the Certainty of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Authorities or quoted Testimonies, <hi>without</hi> Tradition, (which I see isimpossible,) and hence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63121:57"/>
you make account you have title to produce them against Tradition's Certainty, (That being the matter in hand) and therefore you resolve to pursue the way of Citing Authours; you would then be please'd to vouch your Citations to have truly in them the nature of Testimonies; that is, to be built on <hi>Sensible</hi> Knowledge, and not on <hi>Speculative,</hi> or Opinion in the Authour alledg'd, and that they fall under none of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pierce's</hi> faulty or Inconclusive Heads; or else show they are Conclusive though thus Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is done by confuting my Grounds laid in my First Appendix. Â§. 6, 7, 8. Or, lastly, to declare, that though thus Faulty and Inconclusive they ought still to be alledgd; and to give your reason for it; which, candidly spoken out, I am sure will be this, that you must either produce such, or none. I hope all our ingenuous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will think me very reasonable, who am well contented with any thing which is spoke out expressly and declaratively of what <hi>method</hi> or <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Satisfying</hi> you take; and onely desire you would not quote and speak <hi>confusedly</hi> and <hi>in common,</hi> as if you meant to persuade your Readers that your discourse has in it some strange force taken in the bulk, though you will vouch no one particular piece of it to be Certain; or, as if you suppos'd their reasons were to be amazd and stupify'd meerly at the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Names</hi> of Authors and the solemnity of a diverse-letter'd, or diverse-languag'd quotation.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63121:57"/>
without clearing to their Judgements the <hi>virtue</hi> by which such Citations can pretend to have force able to subdue their understandings to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or (which is all one) <hi>satisfy</hi> them. If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to do me reason in this point, and still resolve to pursue the huddling together Testimonies without warranting their Certainty by showing upon rational grounds they must be such, I shall declare beforehand to my Readers, that I must be fore't to do right to my self; which is, to rank all your Testimonies under Dr. <hi>Pierce's</hi> Faulty Heads, and so let them go as they are.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Particularly, I beg the Justice of you not to think to over-bear me with the conceiv'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of other Divines resolving Faith in their Speculative Thoughts after another manner than I do: since this can onely tend to stir up Invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness against my person (which yet their charity secures me from) and not any wayes to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date mv discourse. For, every one knows tis no news Divines should differ in their way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating their Tenet, which they both notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hold never the less firmly; and every learned man understands that the word <hi>Divine,</hi> importing a man of <hi>Skill</hi> or <hi>Knowledge</hi> in such a matter, no Divine has any Authority but from the Goodness of the Proofs or Reasons he brings and on which he builds that Skill. Please then to bring, not the empty pretence of a Divines Authority or Name to oppose me with, and I shall freely give you leave to make use of the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63121:58"/>
of their Authorities, that is their <hi>Reasons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me as much as you will. I easily yeeld to those great discoursers, whoever they be, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency in other Speculations and Knowledges, to which they have been more addicted, and for which they have been better circumstanc't; In this one of the Ground of Faith, both my much Practice, my particular Application, my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses with our nations best Wits of all sorts, my perusing our late acute Adversaries and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to them, with other Circumstances; and lastly, my serious and industrious studying the Point, join'd with the clearing Method God's Providence has led me to, have left me (as far as I know) in no disadvantage. What would avail you against me and our Church too (for my Interest as defending Tradition is indissolubly linkt with Hers) is, to show that our Church proceeds not on Tradition, or that in Her Definitions She professes to resolve Faith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way rather than mine, or (which is equivalent) to rely on somthing else more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fundamentally than on Tradition. But the most express and manifold Profession of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to rely constantly on Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has so put this beyond all possible Cavil on my side, that I neither fear your Skill can show my Grounds in the least subcontrary to hers, nor the Goodness of any Learned and considering Catholik (however some may conceive the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church plac't <hi>ad abundantiam</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63121:58"/>
in somthing else) will or can ever dislike it. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you may go about to disgrace my Way as <hi>new:</hi> But I must ask, whether you mean the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of it is <hi>new,</hi> or onely that 'tis now <hi>deeper</hi> look't into and <hi>farther</hi> explicated than formerly: If you say the former, my <hi>Consent of Authorities</hi> (p. 126, 127, &amp;c.) has clearly shown the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and common sense tells us no other way was or could be possibly taken (for the Generality of the Church at least) in Primitive times till Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was publisht universally and collected: If the later, please to reflect, that every <hi>farther</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication or Declaration, as far as 'tis <hi>farther,</hi> must needs be <hi>new;</hi> and so, instead of disgracing us, you most highly commend our reasons for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consequences <hi>farther</hi> than others had done before us. Again, if it be onely a farther <hi>Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> it is for that very reason <hi>not-new;</hi> since the Sence of the Explication is the same with the thing explicated; As 'tis onely an Explication, then 'tis <hi>not-new;</hi> as <hi>farther,</hi> 'tis indeed <hi>new,</hi> but withal innocent, nay commendable. But there are three things more to be said on occasion of this object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Catholik Divines; One is, that, taking Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the living voice of the present Church as I constantly declare my self to do, not one Catholick does or can deny it; for he would <hi>eo ipso</hi> become no-Catholick but an Arch-heretick; and this all acknowledge. In the <hi>thing explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> then, that is, in the notion of Tradition all agree with me (and consequently in the <hi>Substance</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63121:59"/>
of my Explication) nor can any do otherwise, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be equivocated in the Word <hi>Tradition</hi> and mistake my meaning, which I conceive none will do wilfully after they have read here my declaration of it so unmistakably laid down. The second thing is, that an Alledger of those Divines will onely quote their Words as Speculaters, not those in which they deliver themselves naturally as Christians or Believers; which Sayings were they collected, we should finde them unanimous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sounding to my advantage, and not one of them oppositely. And, lastly, speaking of our Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to its <hi>manner,</hi> Divines contradict one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in other kinds of Explications, but not one Author can be alledged that expresly contradicts this which I follow.</p>
            <p n="10">10. My sixth request is, that you would speak to the main of my Book, and not catch at some odd words, on the by as it were: Otherwise, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Readers will see this is not to answer, but to cavil.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And, because we are (I hope) both of us endeavouring to clear Truth (I am sure we ought to be so) therefore, to acquit your self to your Readers that you ingenuously aim at it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you will do your self a great deal of right, and me but reason, nay (which is yet weightier) do the common Cause best service, if you will joyn with me to retrench our Controversie as much as we can. Let us then avoid all Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Digressions and Affectations of Witty and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63121:59"/>
fine Language; which I have declin'd in my whole Book, and chosen a plain downright man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Expression, as most sutable and connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to express Truth. Likewise all Repetitions of what particulars others have said or answer'd before us, such as are the Objections made by that ingenious person, the L. <hi>Faukland,</hi> and the Answers given them in the Apology for Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; unless it be conceiv'd those Solutions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient, and Reasons be offer'd why they are judg'd so. For I conceive it an endless folly to transcribe and reprint any thing others have done before us, except it be Grounds which ought to be oft inculcated and stuck to; and those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which we show to be not yet invalidated, but to preserve still their strength. Much less do I suspect it can fall under the thought of one who aims to discourse rationally (such my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer ought to be) to rake together all the filth and froth of the unwarrantable Actions or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of some in the Church, or to run on end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly with multitudes of invective &amp; invidious say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on his own head without proof; &amp; then apply them to the Church, as does the Disswader. It would also very much conduce to the bringing our differences to a narrower compass if you would candidly take my Book endwayes, and declare what in it is evident, and so to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; what not: What Principles are well laid or Consequences right drawn; and what are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: To requite which favours, I promise the

same Carriage in my Reply to you. By this means it will be quickly discover'd whether or no you have overthrown my Discourse by show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ill coherent, and how far 'tis faulty; that, if I cannot clear it to be connected, I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my fault and endeavour to amend it. For, however I see my Grounds Evident, yet I am far from judging my self Infallible in drawing my Consequences; though I see withal the method I take, will not let me err much; Or, if I do, my Errour will be easily discoverable; because I go not about to cloud my self in <hi>words,</hi> but to speak out as plain as I can from the nature of the <hi>Thing.</hi>

            <p n="12">12. In the next place I earnestly request you, as you love Truth, not to shuffle of the giving me a full Answer, nor to desist from your Enterprise (as I hear a Certain person of great esteem for his learning and prudence has already done) though you find some difficulty where to fasten upon the Substantial part of my discourse. There are perhaps many difficult passages which my Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness forc't me to leave Obscure; These will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally occasion mistake, and Mistake will breed Objections to impugn me with. Please, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fail, to make use of those at least. 'Tis no discredit in you to mistake what's obscure; rather it argues a fault in me (did not my circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of writing Grounds, &amp; onely to Schollers, excuse me) that I left it so; To make amends for which I promise you to render it clear when
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63121:60"/>
I see where it pinches you or others. And on this score, I owe very particular thanks to Mr <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> that by speaking clearly out his thoughts, he gave me a fair occasion to open that point he impugn'd, I think, upon mistake of our Tenet.</p>
            <p n="13">13. If you think fit somtimes to argue <hi>ad hominem,</hi> be sure what you build on be either our Churches Tenet or mine; for I am bound to defend nothing else. If then you quote Fathers, first, see they speak as Fathers, that is as Believers and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessers; for so 'tis evident our Church means them by her Expressions in the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> as also did Antiquity. For both of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly alledge and stand upon <hi>Traditio Patrum,</hi> not <hi>Opinio Patrum:</hi> Next, see you bring <hi>Consensus Patrum,</hi> or an agreement at least of very many of them speaking as Witnesses, otherwise you will not touch me nor our Church; for she never abetted them further. In case you bring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, it would be very efficacious you would chuse such Testimonies (if you can finde them) as I brought from the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> that is, such in which they declare themselves (or the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances give it) they proceed upon their <hi>Rule of Faith:</hi> For, otherwise, every one knows that Bishops in a Council have in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Quality of <hi>Faith-Definers,</hi> those also of Governours, and of the most Eminent and solid <hi>Divines</hi> in God's Church. If Scripture, you must make Evident the Certainty of your way of arguing from it, ere I or our Church shall allow
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63121:61"/>
it argumenative. Thus much for Authority. If you oppose me by my own Principles or Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of my Reason, I must defend my self as well as I can. One thing on this occasion, I must mind you of; 'tis this, that though you should conquer in this way of arguing <hi>ad hominem,</hi> you onely conquer <hi>me</hi> as a Discourser, by showing that I contradict my self; not my <hi>Tenet:</hi> for to prove that false, you must fix your foot and build your discourse on some Certain Ground; which bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my <hi>holding</hi> it (on which your discourse <hi>ad hominem</hi> relies) cannot make it. You must build then on some Grounded Truth if you will go about to overthrow a pretended one. Indeed, if you can show Tradition contradicts her self, you will do more than miracle, and so must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. But I fear not the Gates of Hell, much less Man's wit can prevail against that impregnable Rock. Onely, I beseech you bring not as Parallels against our Tradition in hand, which is a vast and strong stream, other little petty rivulets sprung originally from the Sensations of two or three: For, then, as one side was liable, in a thing not known publikly, to bely their Senses; so the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance down of such sleight built Attestations may easily be self-contradictory. In a word, if you will argue, take first into your Thoughts the nature of the Thing you argue against, and then fall to work assoon as you will. Now, if you should chance to say you hold the Sayings of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils (some at least, to be <hi>Certain,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:63121:61"/>
my Reason tells me from Principles, that, having renounc't Tradition which onely could ascertain them, rational nature in you will not let you have any hearty conceit of their Convictiveness, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you pretend; but that you rawly alledge them, and so let them go with a <hi>valeant quantum valere possunt.</hi> That therefore we may have some security more than your bare word (which Experience tells us is now affirmative now nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in this point, as it best sutes your Interest, or, after a pretty Indifferent manner, half-one-half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tother) that your profession of holding to such Authorities is not hollow-hearted but rooted in your Reason, 'tis just your Readers should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you would declare in what the virtue of <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying</hi> consists, and that They have this virtue. This if you do, you acquit your self to go to work solidly, and you offer us fair play in giving us some hold of your Reason, whereas a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Expression gives none. This Procedure also will show, when apply'd, whether you are Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siable or no for admitting some Authorities of that nature and rejecting others.</p>
            <p n="14">14. My last request is, that, if in the course of your Answer you think fit to complain of me for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing History and other Proofs heretofore common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without more ado admitted, into Incertainty: please to amend the fault you finde, and settle their Certainty on some better Principles than I have endeavour'd. In the mean time 'tis Evident my whole Book ayms at settling the Certainty of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63121:62"/>
all Authority, by evidencing the Certainty of <hi>First Authority;</hi> upon which the Assuredness of History, Fathers, Councils, Church, Faith, nay Virtue or Christian Life must all be built. This is my way; if you judge it incompetent to do the Effect spoken of, be pleas'd to manifest it Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and show us a Better.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Perhaps I may have demanded more of you in some particulars than is due from the strict duty of meerly answering: in the Schools, a bare denial, or distinction is enough for a Respondent. But I conceive <hi>we</hi> are not on these terms: in regard we are not met face to face, where the returns of the one to the other can be quick on every occasion. This obliges us, for the Readers satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to enlarge our selves and bring reason for everything we affirm or deny, lest we should be thought to do it <hi>gratis.</hi> And, your case here, is particularly disadvantageous: For, if you go about to overthrow that on which I aym to show the Certainty of all Authority built, and yet <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> not on what your self hold them built, and, by your faithful promise to show it shortly, give them strong hopes you will perform it; you send them away very much dissatisfy'd either with you or with all the Authority in the world, though built on Sensitive Knowledge: Of which it being impossible Rational Nature should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to doubt, they must needs dislike your attempt, and have an ill conceit of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>

               <hi>SIR,</hi> I understand, to my exceeding Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that multitudes ofthe most Eminent, Solid and Ingenuous Wits of our Nation have been diligent perusers of my Book. Consider, their eyes are upon you while you Answer; I am confident they will judge I have requested no more of you in this Letter, but what's reasonably due to their and my satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and so, will look your Answer should be correspondent. They are weary of endless Contests about Faith; and, seeing we are not now contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the signification of some ambiguous Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but penetrating deep into the very bowels of a point which is of the greatest concern in the whole world; and pursuing (in a method likely to decide) the clearing of it, their expectations are very much erected and attentively observing what will be the issue of this rational combat. Frustrate not their desires to see Truth manifested by bringing the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion back from the plain open field of Evidence-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our-method, to a Logomachy or word-skirmish in a Wilderness of Talk, out of which the Thread of Grounds or Principles had disent angled it. To them therefore as well as your self I address this: requesting those of them who are acquainted with my Answerer, to press him to do himself, me, the world (his Cause too, if it can bear it) the right due in Reason, and here demanded. This <hi>Sir,</hi> if you will perform, I shall lay aside the remembrance of the Justice I have to it, and look upon it purely as a Favour and most obliging Civility to him who is, next to Truth's,</p>

            <p>IF you complain of this Fore-stalling as <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual;</hi> as long as it is <hi>rational</hi> you can have no reason to do so: and it will appear <hi>such</hi> to him that considers it was an <hi>unusual</hi> Circumstance occasion'd it. IT is this: I had endeavour'd to bring Controversie from an Endless to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Way: and both my Reason and Experience made me apprehend my Protestant Answerer would have such strong Inclinations to bring it back into the way of quoting and glossing Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (that is, into a wordish scanning a great part of all the Libraries in the World) that a slender touch at it in my Book was not forcible and express enough to oblige him to take notice of it. Having communicated therefore my thoughts with intelligent and ingenuous persons, both Catholiks and Protestants, and receiv'd their approbation, I resolv'd, and pursued it as you see; And I hope the manifold Usefulness of it (as shall be seen what way soever now you take upon you of answering) will sufficiently justify my Action.</p>
