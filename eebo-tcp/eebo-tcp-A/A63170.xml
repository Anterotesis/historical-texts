            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Capt. <hi>Wickham</hi> being able to prove that his Lieut. <hi>Coleman</hi> had ſold Nine of his Men at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> deſired to know of the Judge Advocate the Method of bringing an Indictment againſt him, and the rather for that he was informed that <hi>Coleman</hi> was now the Evidence againſt him, but the Judge Advocate's Anſwer was, that there was no need of it, for the Charge againſt <hi>Coleman</hi> would naturally ariſe in the Tryal; becauſe when Capt. <hi>Wickham</hi> ſhould plead the Loſs of his Ship was occaſioned by the want of Men, he would then have a fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to accuſe the ſaid <hi>Coleman;</hi> but notwithſtanding this, the Judge Advocate ſaid at the Tryal that <hi>Coleman</hi> was now the King's Evidence, and whatſoever the Captain had to ſay againſt him ſignified nothing, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not then a proper time to accuſe an Evidence.</p>

                  <p>What Men I ſpared to the Merchant-men were their own, or in lieu of ſome of thoſe I had taken from them at their firſt coming to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes,</hi> if I had not returned them part, they muſt never have ſailed from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31922:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thence. And moreover, their Majeſties Orders are poſitive againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling Homeward-bound Ships, and that upon Miſcarriage in ſuch caſes the Captain ſhall be anſwerable for the loſs of them; but I had Sir <hi>Francis Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>'s Orders to aſſiſt all the Ships under my Convoy, as much as was poſſible: I never took a bribe of any Man, neither did I ſpare above twelve Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the thirty Ships that came with us from <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and thoſe were to ſuch as I had diſabled. I can prove that Lieut. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſold nine or ten of my beſt Men at our coming away, as is well known to Coll. <hi>Holt</hi> and Maj. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laval,</hi> who are both here, and will ſwear to the Truth of it;</p>
               </sp>
               <p> upon this a man was called, who ſaid that he and two more were put on board one <hi>Elderidge</hi> at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and that he was told that Captain <hi>Wickham</hi> had a Reward of fifteen Guineas.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt. <hi>Wickham.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I did put that Man and two more on board that Ship, I do acknowledge, but it was by order of Sir <hi>Francis Wheeler,</hi> and here is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Maſters Hand to avouch that I had of him no manner of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſaid Men, but ſpared them to him in Obedience of Sir <hi>Francis Wheelers</hi> Orders.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The Man own'd it was done while Sir <hi>Francis Wheeler</hi> was there.</p>
               <p>Then the Gunner's Depoſitions were read, which agreed with the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, that the Ship was not in ſo good a condition to receive the Enemy as ſhe ought to have been, and by the Captains Neglect; and that he the ſaid Gunner ſpoke to the Captain five or ſix times to get more Guns out below, and that the Captain replyed, No, it ſignified nothing, only put out four more to windward.</p>
               <p>The Carpenters Depoſitions were read, that the Captain did not order more Ports to be knockt open than the Gunner ſpeaks of.</p>

                  <p>Why was not your Ship in a Readineſs when the Enemy approacht?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt <hi>Wickham.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I ordered the lower Guns to be run out, ſo far as a Gun before the Main-Maſt, which was a great many more than I had hands to manage, and if more Ports had been opened, not having Men to defend them, it would but have expoſed us the more to the Enemies ſmall ſhot, having many Occaſions in time of Battle to run forward for Powder and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries at ſuch a time; and beſides, it was giving them more breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to enter in at, when they boarded us: This was what I was cautious of: And the Enemies made themſelves Maſters of thoſe ports we had open, for want of Men to defend them, as ſoon as any other part of the Ship. A fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before we come near the Channel, I ordered all the Sea-ments Cheſts into the Hold, all the Cabbins to be knockt down upon the Gun-Deck, that all might be clear at a minutes warning, and this very Gunner, as well as my Lieutenant, hath often ſaid to me, that we were in ſuch a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it was impoſſible we ſhould be ſurpriſed by an Enemy. I ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times told them and the other Officers, that if any thing they could think of in the Ship were out of Order, they ſhould acquaint me with it, and if we had had ſucceſs, they would have remembred the care I took at all times to have my Ship in a readineſs to enter upon Service. They both own that I ordered them to manage the Gun-Deck, and that to be their Charge, and all the Men to their Quarters there, and yet they have ſworn that I would not ſuffer more than five or ſix Guns to be put out; we were engaged three quarters of an hour before we were boarded, and for them to employ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch hands as we had at four Guns or ſix, is ſomewhat ſtrange, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twenty ſpare Guns by them, which they themſelves might have run out in a minute, or as many of them as they could have managed. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed my Lieutenant and Gunner to do the beſt Service they could upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31922:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Deck, and if there was not Service done, it was their fault and not mine. I managed the upper Deck to the utmoſt of my Power, without any aſſiſtance; my Maſter was bed-ridden, the Eldeſt Lieutenant diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in a little time the chief Mate was blown up; and if this Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Gunner had not more Guns below out, (altho' they had my expreſs order for it) they ſhould have come up upon Deck, and help'd to have defended the Ship there, but Coll. <hi>Holt,</hi> Capt. <hi>Garth,</hi> Capt. <hi>Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon,</hi> and my ſelf, were left alone, as they are ready to certifie, after we were boarded by the Ship of forty Guns, and three hundred Men, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Ninety at leaſt; they can likewiſe witneſs whether this Lieutenant and Gunner came to aſſiſt us with any of the Men they had with them, tho' I called to them ſeveral times, and did what I was able to get them to our aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but they thought themſelves ſafe, and very well knew upon whom the blame of all would be laid. If they had been the Men they pretended to be, they would have done ſomething extraordinary with the Men they had, and if they had not done it out of their Zeal for the Service of their King and Countrey, yet I did verily believe the favour I had ſhown them would have inclined them to have ſtood by me in ſuch an Exigency, and not have left me to ſhift for my ſelf. Capt. <hi>Garth</hi> can teſtifie, that when he and I retreated upon the Gun-Deck, in hopes to joyn ſome of our Men there: We found the Enemy was entred, and we ſaw not beſide the Gunner above three of our Ships Company.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>The Merchants Ships in our Company were ſo weak, that I ſhould have run a great hazard in diſabling them at Sea, for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my having two good Ships, and the Advantage of their ſailing, one of them might have kept me in play whilſt the other had taken all the Merchant-Men, and then I muſt have been accountable for their loſs, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants would have ſaid two Privateers would never have attempted a Man of War and a Fire-ſhip, tho' I had been ill manned. But beſides this, moſt of them kept to windward, and at ſuch a Diſtance that my Boat might have been intercepted by the Enemy, and then I muſt have ſuffered for ſending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Boat at ſuch a time with ſo many Men.</p>

                  <speaker>Judge Advocate.</speaker>
                  <p>Why did you go down between Decks, and tell them they muſt take Quarter?</p>

                  <speaker>Capt. <hi>Wickham.</hi>

                  <p>Coll. <hi>Holt,</hi> Capt. <hi>Garth</hi> and <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> can all teſtifie, that I was ſo far from asking quarter, that I ſtood with thoſe three Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in our Steerage, till at laſt having neither Officer nor Seamen to ſtand by me, forty <hi>French</hi> Men were in the Great Cabbin, Coll. <hi>Holt,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> were ſeiz'd in the Steerage, and Capt. <hi>Garth</hi> and my ſelf leapt down between Decks, in hopes to joyn ſome of our Men there, but inſtead of meeting with them, were immediately engaged there with three or four <hi>French</hi> Men, one of which he killed with his Sword, I wounded another of them, and then were we preſently blown up, and both ſuffocated, as the ſaid Captain <hi>Garth</hi> will teſtifie upon his Oath.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then the Purſers Depoſition was read, purporting, that after the Ship was engaged, he retreated into the Forecaſtle with ſeven or eight Men, and defended that till he heard the Captain had taken Quarter.</p>
               <p>Another Man depoſed, that he ſaw Captain <hi>Wickham</hi> in the Hold, after the Ship was blown up between Decks.</p>

I remember very well, after we were board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Philippo,</hi> upon the Starboard-quarter, the Captain order'd every Body to their cloſe quarter, and Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> who was ſhot thro' the arm, Major <hi>Garth</hi> and my ſelf retired along with the Captain off the Quarter-Deck into the Steerage, the <hi>French</hi> at the ſame time entering at the Gallery in the great Cabbin; we defended the Steerage as long as it was poſſible; I verily believe the Ship that boarded us had forty Guns, and three hundred Men, and at the ſame time the Captain had no body to ſtand by him but the Gentlemen which I have named, tho' he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he could to get more men to our aſſiſtance. We had ſome Powder fired in the Steerage by their Granado-ſhells, which almoſt ſuffocated us, and I ſaw it was to no purpoſe for us to pretend to hold out much longer, unleſs we had had more men, being at that time not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four or five to defend the Steerage, the reſt of the Men being run away: The great Cabbin was full of the <hi>French,</hi> who were then entering in every where, the other Ship of thirty ſix Guns within half Piſtol ſhot upon our Weather bow. In this Condition Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and my ſelf were ſeized on by the <hi>French,</hi> both of us took quarter, and the Captain and Major <hi>Garth</hi> jumpt down between Decks. I ſaw a Declaration ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Capt. <hi>Wickham</hi>'s Officers and Sea-men at <hi>St. Maloes,</hi> which gives a true Account of the Action, it expreſſes the Men we had Killed and Wounded, and alſo the weak Condition we were in when we began to Engage. If the Captain of the Fire-ſhip had acted his part, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we ſhould not have miſcarried in that dayes Action.</p>

                  <p>When we ſaw the Enemy firſt in the Morning, I heard the Captain order the Ship ſhould be cleared, and all things ready to engage, he immediately brought too, to ſtay for the Merchant-men, and made them a Sign to give Notice to them to clear their Ships; I heard Capt. <hi>VVickham</hi> call to Capt. <hi>Perry</hi> in the Fire-Ship to keep cloſe under his Lee-quarter, within call, and when we made the two Ships plain to be <hi>French-men,</hi> the Captain ordered all the Ships Company up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Deck, told them to this effect, that they had now an Opportunity to do their Majeſties Service, added, that the Enemies Ships were ſmall ones, and we muſt fight a dozen ſuch as they were; he took particular Notice that none of his Men were drunk, and drank their Majeſties Healths to them, afterwards ordered every Man to his Quarters. I remember one of the Ships came firſt upon our Larboard-ſide, pretty near, and we fired warmly one at the other for a conſiderable time, and I obſerved this Ship did us very much Damage: Then the other of forty Guns, and I verily believe three Hundred good Men, fired their Broad-ſide in our Star-board quarter, and boarded us there; preſently after the Captain upon their Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, ordered every body to their cloſe Quarters, and at that time I took Notice, that upon the Quarter-deck, where I and the reſt of the Land-Officers were with Capt. <hi>Wickham,</hi> there were not above five left but were Killed or Wounded, the Enemies ſmall-ſhot did us ſo much damage there. Coll. <hi>Holt,</hi> Major <hi>Garth</hi> and my ſelf, along with the Captain, retired into the Steerage, which place we defended as long as we could. Major <hi>Garth</hi> guarded the great Cabbin-door with a Blunderbuſs, it being then in the Enemies poſſeſſion: Their Granado-ſheels fired ſome Powder in the Steer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which almoſt ſuffocated us all; and I obſerved the Captain received much Damage at that time; there was no body but the Gentlemen I have named, and a Boy along with us, beſides what were diſabled, tho' the Captain did his utmoſt Endeavour to get more to our aſſiſtance, the great Cabbin being full of the <hi>French,</hi> Coll. <hi>Holt</hi> and my ſelf ſeeing there was no poſſibility of any longer reſiſtance, being ſeized on took quarter. Captain <hi>VVickham</hi> and Major <hi>Garth</hi> leapt down between Decks, I verily beleive that in the two Ships the <hi>French</hi> had five hundred good men.</p>

                  <p>I ſaw Capt. <hi>VVickham</hi> all the Action, and know he did as much as was poſſihle to defend their Majeſties Ship, after we were board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Ship of forty Guns, and three hundred Men, by the Captains Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders we retired to our cloſe Quarters, and there was not one of his own Men ſtood by him, or was along with us in the Steerage, beſides Coll. <hi>Holt,</hi> Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> wounded in the Arm, my ſelf and a Boy, tho' the Capt. endeavoured as much as he could to get more to our aſſiſtance, the Great Cabbin was then full of <hi>French</hi> Men, who entered at the Star-board-gallery, which they laid open with their great ſhot. I defended the Cabbin door with a Blunderbuſs as long as I was able, till at laſt they ſeized Coll. <hi>Holt,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> at the ſame time: Capt. <hi>Wickham</hi> and I jumpt down between decks, in hopes to joyn with ſome of our Men there, but the firſt we met with were four <hi>French</hi> Men, who asked us to take quarter, but we engaged with them; and I my ſelf kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one, and threw another of them towards Capt. <hi>Wickham</hi>; and in this condition we were both of us blown up, and quite ſuffocated. I do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe declare, that I did not ſee beſides the Gunner, above three of our men upon the Gun deck, and whoever ſays that Capt. <hi>Wickham</hi> did not to the utmoſt of his Power endeavour to defend their Majeſties Ship,

as long as any body ſtood by him, wrongs him to the greateſt degree in the World.</p>

                  <p>If you were, then you quitted it to the Enemy, for we were boarded upon the ſame quarter I ordered him to lye, which they could not have done without being on board of him, if he had been in his ſtation, as he pretends he was; I appeal to the Court-Marſhal, whether it was poſſible for the Enemy to have boarded us where they did, if Capt. <hi>Perry</hi> had not ſheered from them as they paſt him.</p>

                  <p>You were to have made me a Sign with your Sprit-ſail Top ſail, which I have to ſhow under your hand.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt. <hi>Wickham.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I own it, but you well knew that was in caſe I could not ſpeak with you before we engaged; if ſo, I was to have made you the ſign you ſpeak of, but this caution was added to my Orders, that Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents might happen which might hinder us from making the ſign afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, therefore when we ſaw an Enemy, I ordered him to uſe his utmoſt Endeavour to get within call of me and that I would then appoint him a ſtation, where I thought it moſt proper: He likewiſe knew, I chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon his intercepting the Enemies boarding of us, if he ſaw them attempt it, and that was my Orders to him, and his not doing it was the loſs of our Ship: Nay, his own Maſter prompted him to board the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they paſt him, which I can prove; Capt. <hi>Perrys</hi> anſwer was, he would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31922:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not be Fool-hardy, and at the ſame time commanded the Helm, a Weather, which I think was plainly ſheering from them, his Maſter likewiſe minded him of our weak condition, and told him to this Effect, that the Enemy had four times our number on board, and would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry us, if he did not endeavour to intercept them; at this time the other Ship of thirty ſix Guns, and two hundred men, lay within half Piſtol-ſhot, upon our Weather-bow, which Capt. <hi>Perry</hi> could not but ſee. But beſides all this, not half an hour before we engaged, he ſent his Boat on board me for a barrel of Powder to prime his Ship, which was a great Token of his Readineſs to go upon Service, when he had concealed his want of Powder till that time of day, tho' he had in our paſſage, I am certain, been twenty ſeveral times on board me, without making the leaſt complaint of any manner of want; neither did he ſo mu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> as open his Sally-port, which the <hi>French</hi> declared themſelves, that if they had ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to have been a Fire-ſhip, they durſt not have attempted what they did. The Ship that Boarded us paſt by Capt. <hi>Perry</hi> without ſo much as firing on ſhot, great or ſmall, at him, neither had he one man hurt in the Action: He knew I had not above eighty well men in the Ship, and might have reaſonably concluded we muſt needs have ſome of them ſhot down in that time, the Ship of thirty ſix Guns having then engaged us near three quarters of an hour, within half Piſtol ſhot, and the <hi>Phillipo</hi> which paſt him and boarded us, had forty Guns, and three hundred and odd men, they were plain enough to be ſeen by Capt. <hi>Perry,</hi> for they were mann'd half ſhrowds high, as thick as they could ſtand on the contrary ſide to him, ready to enter us as ſoon as they got on board. I am certain Capt. <hi>Perry</hi> cannot pretend they blinded him with the ſmoak of their Guns, as they paſt by him; for, as I ſaid before, they did not fire one great Gun, or ſmall one at him, but juſt as they boarded us, fetched a large ſheer, and fired a whole broad-ſide in at our quarter. This was all the Service Capt. <hi>Perry</hi> did me in that unhappy days action, and I hope the Court-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal will take it into their conſideration, and likewiſe pleaſe to conſider how impoſſible it was for me to have the Ship better mann'd then we were, after ſerving four years in a Country ſo ſickly, that two died out of three on board all the Ships that came into thoſe parts, in that time. Beſides what I have already laid to Capt. <hi>Perry</hi>'s Charge, I can prove he had Sugar and Rum on board, to the value of three or four hundred pounds, which was no ſmall temptation to him to preſerve his Ship, for the ſake of ſo conſiderable a Cargo.</p>
