         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 28.</note> but in
that breuitie, and in

hee effectuailie comprehendeth the

yea, therein hee ſummarilie ſetteth

all and whatſoeuer is needefull
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27242:13"/>
or expedient, for ech true Chriſtian to
doe &amp; performe. For, to <hi>examine a mans

throughly to trie, narrowly to ſearche,
and diligently to proue, who and what
maner of perſon he is; &amp; in what caſe
he inwardly feeleth his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
To the ſame effect, purpoſe and

place ſay,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Let euerie man prooue his owne

               <p>He therefore is to bee vnderſtoode,

ſearcheth out, tryeth, groapeth, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
rippeth vp euery corner of his

vnto his Conſcience, and
(as it were) ſtrictly enditeth and iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
arraigneth at the Barre, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a moſt ſeuere Iudge. And looke
how neceſſary it is for euery one that

the Sacramentes, that doth not firſt
carefully trie and examine his owne

doth a man either heare, reade, or

               <p>Let therefore euerie one ſpeedily, &amp;

for all thoſe good and ſpeciall

ſpecially after this life: and partly to
bee (as it were) a cooperator in their

all the euill ſuggeſtions of the wicked

For it cannot otherwiſe be, but
that whoſoeuer receiueth the Holy

For as he is a gift himſelf, ſo is he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a bountifull beſtower, &amp; a liberall

               <p>Theſe ſixe moſt notable and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27242:22"/>
autentically ſealed, partly in thee, and
partly through and by thee: and ought
therefore of thee to bee borne in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
&amp; neuer to ſlide out of thy dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and hourely remembrance.</p>
               <p>Now doth it ſtand thee vpon, yea it
is thy bounden duty, and an eſpeciall
part of thy chiefeſt care, diligently to
conſider in what caſe thou ſtandeſt:
thou muſt (I ſay) now enter into thine
owne Conſcience, and there make a
true ſuruey of all thy dealinges, howe
thou art, howe thou haſt beene in life
and actions anſwerable vnto the ſame,
and after what ſort thou haſt perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
thy promiſe, and obſerued theſe
thy ſealed couenants. God for his part
doth (doubtleſſe) ſtand to his promiſe:
for hee is true and faithfull, and neuer
ſtarteth from his worde, nor changeth
his purpoſe. And therefore gaue he to
thee then, and from that time foorth,
his holy ſpirit, as a pledge of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
promiſe and aſſured good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
thee.</p>
               <p>Now, if thou on the other ſide, wilt
for thy part exactly ſift out, and ſearch
thy ſelf, how thou haſt diſcharged thy

thy faithfull and ſolemne promiſes,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27242:23"/>
thou ſhalt without all doubt finde thy
ſelfe many and ſundrie waies guiltie.
Confeſſe the truth (I pray thee) and
ſpeake vnfainedly, whether thou haſt
not ſince that time fallen into thine
olde byas, and turned backe to thine
old crooked nature and corrupt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?
Whether the lawe of thy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and the reliques of ſinne, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſtill cleauing vnto thee, haue not
manie times prouoked, allured, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
yea enforced thee to attempt &amp;
practiſe ſome thing againſt the lawe of
God? Whether thou haue not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
liſtened, giuen eare and place
vnto Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (who alwaies lieth in waite
to catch theee) and hearkened to his
wicked temptations, allurementes,
counſells, and ſuggeſtions? Whether
thou haue ſo intirely continued dead
vnto ſinne, that thou haſt hitherto li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
onely vnto righteouſneſſe? Alas,
it is too plaine and true, that thine
owne Conſcience heerein accuſeth
thee, and within thee with open crie
teſtifieth againſt thee, that thou haſt
moſt hainouſlie manie times reuolted
from thy bargaine, falſified thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and careleſlie run headlong into

               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:27242:23"/>
If this then bee true, (as (alas) it is
moſt true) there is no ſhift but thou
needs muſt acknowledge &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe thy
ſelfe to be a creature moſt vile, wicked
&amp; miſerable. For firſt, thou muſt needs
yeeld, that thou art a leaguebreaker, a

violatour of thy couenant made vnto
God the father: then which, what can
bee more horrible? Thou haſt fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the wholſome effects of the death

examine thine actions, that thou muſt
looke well about thee, and conſider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe, whether in one and

                     <p>¶ If thou haue corrupted anye

againſt the <hi>ix. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
thee to giue falſe witneſſe.
But if thou diddeſt it, with an intent
and meaning to rake and ſcrape a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
gaine vniuſtly to thy ſelfe, with
the loſſe and hinderance of an other,
thou art therein guiltie of the breach
of the <hi>viii. Commandement,</hi> whereby is

                     <p>If furthermore in this behalfe,
thou haue deceiued anie that is thy

                     <p>To be ſhort, if this circumſtance do

                        </gap>tie practiſe
were by thee doone on the Sabbaoth
day, then haſt thou heerein incurred
the diſpleaſure of Almightie God for
prophaning and not ſanctifying the
Sabbath day. Laſt of all, it may bee,
that in this bargayning and ſelling,
ſome ſuch woordes might paſſe from
thee, as might make thee further guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
For if thou ſweareſt vainely, and
without cauſe, with an intent &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to auouch any thing that thou
wouldeſt haue to be beleeued, then
art thou therein guiltie of the <hi>thirde
commaundement. Thou ſhalt not take the
name of the Lorde thy God in vaine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>¶ Thirdly, we ſhall doe well, in the
examining and dicuſſing of thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to giue thee charge, circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to conſider euerie particular circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to wit, the time, the place, the
perſon, the cauſe, the end, the maner,
the inſtrument, &amp;c. No man wil denie,
but that the offence is farre greater &amp;
hainouſer, which is committed on the
Sabbath daye, or at ſuch time as all
men for ſome publike calamitie, are
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:27242:91"/>
in a generall heauines: againe, when
it is committed in the ſight and face
of many honeſt and graue perſons:
furthermore, when it is doone by, or
againſt any man in high authoritie;
moreouer, when no manner of allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
occaſion went afore, to drawe or

we may not ſlightly paſſe ouer, howe
much, and how greatly theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
doe aggrauate and augment
thy fault.</p>
                     <p>4 Fourthly, it ſtandeth thee vpon,
moreouer, often and many times to
conſider with thy ſelfe, and plainely
to confeſſe, that thou canſt neuer call
to memorie all thy ſinnes committed:
and againe, that thou canſt neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
ynough iudge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ow greeuous &amp;
deteſtable thoſe be, which doe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

O clenſe me from my ſecret faultes.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 12.</note> For ſo
ſtandeth thy caſe, that euen where
thou leaſt thinkeſt, thou there ſinneſt
moſt greeuouſly. And the thinges
which thou thinkeſt well and iuſtlie
done, are in the ſight of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        </gap>ectrue.
And therefore the Prophet I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah
cryeth out thus: <hi>We haue been all
as an vncleane thing, and al our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is as a filthy clout.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jſa. 64. 6.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore the caſe thus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
it is thy part and dutie, plainely
to confeſſe, that much ignoraunce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
in thee, and that the ſame is
in thee a great ſinne: for the which,
vnleſſe God in mercy do pardon thee,
hee may hurle thee headlong into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
damnation.</p>
                     <p>5 Fiftly, thou muſt conſider that
there is cauſe ynough to condemne
and pronounce thee guiltie, for that
thou haſt not done thoſe good workes
which in the lawe are commaunded.
For looke how many ſinnes in euerie
particular commaundement are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
ſo many good workes in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
commaundement are commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
To euery ſinne there ought to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
his contrarie, and that is, ſome
good worke.</p>
                     <p>¶ Now if thou throughly examine
thy conſcience, thou ſhalt ſoone eſpy,
that thou haſt not perfourmed, no
not the leaſt part and portion of thoſe
thinges which the lawe of God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:27242:92"/>
at thy handes: yea, if thou nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
ſearch euery corner of thy ſelfe,
thou ſhalt finde that either thou haſt
fulfilled and perfourmed nothing at
all, or if thou haſt perfourmed anye
thing, yet ſhalt thou finde it to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
corrupt, and with ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

To drawe therefore the effect of all
the chiefeſt and eſpecialeſt pointes to
be conſidered of in this matter, into
ſmall roume and briefe wordes: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi>
is a moſt vehement affliction,

So that all this abaſhment,
vexation, affliction, perplexitie, and

like: yet becauſe our queſtion in this

               <p>And to this end are the wordes of

is ſhut vp and ſtopped.</p>
               <p>For Contrition, is as it were a keye,

For ſeeing that it is wholly reſident

it is brought to paſſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed
in verie ſhort ſpace of time,

ſo that thou haue a ſtedfaſt &amp; an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

thy former wickedneſſe. For in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
thou muſt wholly and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
die vnto thy ſinnes: that is, thou
muſt ſo renounce them, as though
thou neuer intedeſt any more to haue

reſolutely, and directly confeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to haue thereby iuſtly deſerued
al thoſe plagues, which God by Moſes
and the Prophetes hath threatned,
and thundered out vpon all the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers

meekely and humbly crauing
pardon of thy ſinnes and miſdeedes.
Vnto this humble proſtrating of thy

this free &amp; franke confeſſion of their

conſolation from the mouth of
Chriſte himſelfe;<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 15.</note> after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Therefore it is out of all doubt,
that faith is altogether and neceſſarily
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:27242:103"/>
behoouefull to all true &amp; penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
wherewith they may raiſe vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

nowe, howe truely ſorrowfull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant
ſinners may by fayth, againe
be rayſed vp, we will plainely and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declare.</p>
               <p>Faith is a ſure and ſtedfaſt truſt,
whereby we aſſure our ſelues that god
will performe vnto vs all thoſe things
that he hath promiſed, chiefely and
ſpecially, ſpirituall benefites, and in
them, remiſſion of our ſinnes; and
righteouſneſſe in Chriſt &amp; for Chriſt.
Which is confirmed by the authour of
the Epiſt, to the Heb,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 17</note> in theſe wordes.
<hi>Faith is the grounde of thinges which are
hoped for, and the euidence of thinges
which are not ſcene.</hi> The interpretation
and expoſition of which deſcription
(ſo farre as concerneth the vſe and
practiſe thereof) who ſo is deſirous to
know, may ſee ſet down in the 4. chap.
of the Epiſt. to the Rom. Wherein af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Apoſtle had ſayde that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
was iuſtified by faith, and that the
inheritaunce of the worlde was giuen
to him through fayth; he afterwarde
addeth, that this reuerend and bleſſed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:27242:103"/>
Patriarch had reſpect vnto the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and power of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>whereby hee
quickeneth the dead, &amp; calleth thoſe things
which bee not, as though they were: And
therefore that aboue hope, that he should be
the father of many Nations, according to
that which was ſpoken to him. So shall thy
ſeede be.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>And be not weake in this fayth,
conſidered not his owne bodie, which was
now dead, being almoſt an hundreth yeares
old, neither the deadneſſe of</hi> Saraes <hi>wombe:
Neyther did he doubt of the promiſe of God
through vnbeliefe, but was ſtrengthened in
the fayth, and gaue glorie to GOD, being
fully aſſured, that hee which had promiſed,
was alſo able to doe it, and therefore it was
imputed to him for righteouſneſſe. &amp;c.</hi>
Hereby may euery one eaſily perceiue
that faith vndoubtedly beleeueth that
thoſe thinges ſhall be perfourmed, and
through the goodneſſe and power of
God be brought to paſſe, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſeeme neuer poſſible to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
that faith doth alwayes looke
into the promiſes and power of God:
and finally, that faith is an aſſured,
certaine, vndoubted, and inuincible
perſwaſion, conceiued of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and power of God, whereby this
glorie is aſcribed, attributed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:27242:104"/>
to God, that hee both will and
alſo can ſaue vs. All which are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in that vſuall and accuſtomed
fourme of confeſſion, which euerye
one priuately vndertaketh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
for himſelfe, ſaying: <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in God.</hi> For in theſe fewe wordes
is ſet foorth and contayned the whole
ſumme and ſignification of fayth.</p>
               <p>Nowe heare and marke in fewe
wordes, howe thou art iuſtified by
fayth. Euen as the Apoſtle teacheth
vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 5.</note> that Abraham was iuſtified by
fayth, without workes, and that his
fayth and ſure perſwaſion of Gods
goodneſſe and power was imputed to
him for righteouſneſſe: ſo muſt thou
make thy reckoning (whoſoeuer thou
bee that acknowledgeſt thy ſelfe a
greeuous ſinner, and that thou art
guiltie of the manifolde breache of
Gods law, and that thou haſt no good
workes of thine owne to oppoſe and
ſet againſt the ſeueritie of Gods iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
that thou likewiſe and in the
ſame ſorte, ſhalt bee iuſtified by <hi>faith
without workes,</hi> as the Apoſtle in that
Chapter euidently and plainely teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.
He ſayth there alſo further, <hi>that
it is not written for him onely, that it was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:27242:104"/>
imputed to him for righteouſneſſe, but alſo
for vs, to whom it shalbe imputed for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
which beleeue in him that ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vp Jeſus our Lorde from the dead: who
was deliuered to death for our ſinnes, and
is riſen againe for our iuſtification.</hi> This
therefore is required at thy hand (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou haſt no manner of helpe in
thy ſelfe, whereby to obtayne thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
eyther by thine owne workes
or any others) that thou conceaue a
ſure and vndoubted fayth, and a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
and firme perſwaſion of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and power of God: and that thou
be fully perſwaded, and throughly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
in thy conſcience: that God the
father, will receiue thee againe into
fauour, that he will pardon &amp; forgiue
thee thy ſinnes, and that he will iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and make thee righteous for his
ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, as he by his owne
expreſſe words, by his holy Prophets,
and laſt of all, by the ſame his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
ſonne, hath graciouſly promiſed.
For if from the bottome of thy heart,
thou vnfaynedly beleeue the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of God touching this matter made
vnto the holy fathers of olde, be thou
aſſured that thou art in the kings high
way to iuſtification and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:27242:105"/>
Theſe promiſes haue euer from
