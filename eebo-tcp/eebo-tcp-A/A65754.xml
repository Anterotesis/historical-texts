         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N THE NAME OF GOD AMEN. I Iohn White Doctor in Diuinitie, weake of body, but of perfect remembrance, being fully perſwaded of Gods loue and mercy to me, do briefly make this my laſt Will and Teſtament in manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: Firſt I bequeath my ſoule into the hands of Almightie God, who infuſed it when I was borne, and all the daies of my life hath enriched it with ſuch graces and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, as haue enabled me vnto the ſeruices whereto he hath called me, of what nature ſoeuer they haue bene: And my body to be interred at the pleaſure of my deare and louing brother Maiſter Edward White, where and in what manner he ſhall thinke good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And touching Religion, and the ſtate and diſpoſition of my conſcience therein, I profeſſe that I depart in peace, beleeuing with a Chriſtian faith all things contained in the Apoſtles Creede, and other Creeds receiued in the Church of England: To whoſe iudgement I perfectly adhere, in the articles of the Deitie, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, Creation, the fall and Reparation of mankind; Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt alone, Iuſtification, Faith, and neceſſity of good works, &amp;c. touching the nature and inſtitution of the Church, authoritie of the Scriptures, vſe and number of Sacraments, and doctrine concerning death, and the reſurrection of the dead, and the ſtate of the world to come: And all that which our Church doth vniformly teach againſt the Church of Rome.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And whereas I haue theſe twenty yeares paſt, by preaching and writing, publiſhed in two bookes, ingaged my ſelfe againſt Papiſtry, I profeſſe I haue done nothing therein againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but deſire all men to aſſure themſelues, that if any error haue eſcaped me, it hath paſſed me through ouerſight; for I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bended my ſelfe to that worke of writing with much humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to God, and ſuch diligence as I was able to vſe; and hauing the bookes alwaies by me, I writ nothing but what I found in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and in the writings publickly receiued in the Church of Rome it ſelfe. And I do conſtantly auouch, that what I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is the truth, and haue bene the more confirmed therein by the vnconſcionable dealing of my aduerſaries againſt me, when no learned man amongſt them hath encountered me, but onely ſuch as vſe baſe courſes of railing and ſcurrilitie, vnbefitting Chriſtian Religion. The which my writings I commend to my children, praying God they may liue and die therein, without opening their eares vnto ſeducers: and to all my people to whom I haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; and generally to all people that haue bene acquainted therewith And this my Proteſtation I was deſirous to inſert in my will, wiſhing it were alſo printed in my bookes; nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but Romiſh Prieſts and their followers, when they ſhall heare of my death (according to a common practiſe of theirs) will be readie enough to diuulge ſome tales or other touching my vncertainty in Religion.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>And hauing finiſhed his Will and Teſtament, ſeeing himſelfe almoſt ſpent, he uſed theſe words following</hi>:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am ſcarce able to ſay any more, greater occaſion calles me off, my owne weakeneſſe and more neceſſary meditation with God, breakes me off, and haue taken me by the hand; with whom I hope to be ſhortly, hauing a ſtedfaſt perſwaſion, that through faith in Chriſt, I ſhall ſee him, and enioy him, and liue with him for euer. Which he grant of his abundant mercy, who will haue mercy on whom he will haue mercie; and will ſhew compaſſion on whom he will ſhew compaſſion. Amen.</q>

            <head>A POSTSCRIPT OF A LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER WHICH DOCTOR WHITE WRlT <hi>to a friend of his, who hauing found comfort thereby, is deſirous it ſhould be printed for the comfort and good of others alſo.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ET him that will liue repoſedly, and die chearfully, heare, pray, meditate, do. Firſt heare Gods word in the Scriptures, and in the pulpit, in the Scriptures daily, and in the pulpit make choiſe of a fit tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and ſticke to him; for the practiſe of Gods word giues knowledge, workes holineſſe, breakes downe naturall corruption, and fils with ſtrength and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort againſt all aſſaults.</p>
            <p>Secondly, prayer hath three rules: dayly, without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: free, that the mind be vnladen. Go to prayer as you go into the water to ſwim, go not hote in, but take a time, and firſt coole your ſelfe, feeling that the words touch your ſoule. The day I neglect either Gods word or prayer is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie. That God being ſo neare, and within me, I ſhould neither ſpeake to him, nor he to me, that were too much betweene a man and his wife.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, meditation is the mod ſoueraigne cure of the ſoule that is. My courſe is this: I miſſe no day but I retire my ſelfe (if I be at home) to my ſtudie, or the field, and there firſt I pray to God to giue me a recollected mind; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I enter into conſideration of my ſinfull ſtate, and examine my ſelfe, I call for helpe to God; thirdly, I take notice of my paſſion, diſpoſition and inclination, and ſo I come to the knowledge of my ſelfe. Fourthly, I arme my ſelfe by vowes, reſolutions, and prayer, to conquer my, ſelfe as a Citie. Fiftly, I call to mind if anything hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betweene my neighbour (any other) and me: if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any vnkindneſſe offered, or receiued, I waſh it out, I cleare the ſcore, I ſuffer no mans infirmitie to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe me with conceit. Sixtly, I enquire after the day of my death in this ſort; firſt I ſet it before my eyes; next I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether I be fit, prepared, readie, willing to die: thirdly my cowardly ſoule I encourage, and teach it to looke death in the face: Laſtly I end this point with flying to my Sauiour for helpe, till I become more then a conqueror. I wil with great and tender paſſion, in this point powre out my ſelfe and weakeneſſe to him. Seuenthly I thinke alſo (in the next place) of my worldly ſtate; and if it proſper, I giue thankes, and lay humility and compaſſion in my mind: if it be poore, I pray for ſupply, and bethinke me of ſome honeſt and lawfull meanes: (here I remember wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſeruants, and purpoſe to bring them towards God.)</p>
            <p>Fourthly, doing is the life of all; for it is nothing to be religious in ceremonies. Here are foure principall points. Firſt, beware of doing againſt your conſcience. Secondly, omit no occaſion, place, or time, or perſon, if you can do good. Thirdly, follow the good of your owne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: too many meddle with the good that belongeth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do, as Vzzah. Fourthly, the beſt good in the world, is compaſſion, and almes, and comforting in diſtreſſe, as ſickneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Life is ſhort, the dayes are euill, our company is ſmall, the account is certaine, the comfort vnutterable.</p>
