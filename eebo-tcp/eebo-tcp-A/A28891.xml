            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I moſt humbly preſume to lay at your Feet, this my true and loyal Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Earl of <hi>Tyrones</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt your Sacred Perſon. Some there are who did ill in tranſgreſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Majeſty, but did well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and detecting their own and the foul Crimes of others. As to the latter of theſe in being a Diſcoverer, I account my ſelf happy: as to the former, doubly
<pb facs="tcp:97012:3"/>
that Providence gave me the means to diſcover without ever being diſloyal. What I was, and what my Progenitors always were, I am, a true and faithful Subject to my Prince. Nor was it any other motive then my Allegiance and diſdain of treacherous propoſitions that urg'd me to a ſpeedy Diſcovery. From whence I hope I ſhall not offend your Majeſty, if I claim that advantage to my ſelf of being the firſt that openly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this detection in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the firſt that cut the Knot for others to unravel the miſtery of this deep Deſign. And I alſo hope the rude dreſs of my Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſhew how void it is of ſubtlety or contrivance. I muſt confeſs, I did not think to meet within your Majeſties Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions with ſo ſevere and cruel uſage, for doing my Duty to my Soveraign.

Friends, that they of equal Rank durſt not afford me the Comfort of their kind Viſits, nor they of ſuperior quality ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to give me any Countenance.

            <head>THE INFORMATION OF Hobert Bourk, Firſt Diſcoverer of The Popish PLOT In <hi>IRELAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>Who ſaith,</opener>
            <p>THAT he is Son and Heir apparent to <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Bourk,</hi> late of <hi>Poole-more</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Clare,</hi> Gent That after his ſaid Fathers deceaſe, his Mother placed him with an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, with whom this Informant lived, until he was able to Practice for himſelf; which ſaid Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Informant followed until he was hindred and moleſted, as the enſuing paſſages will declare.</p>
            <p>This Informant going into the County of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> about five years ago, to viſit ſome Relations of his, was by them earneſtly courted and invited to ſtay with them in the ſaid County of <hi>Waterford,</hi> in regard he the ſaid Informant was a ſingle perſon, and for that there was greater employment and buſineſs to be had for an Attorney in that County than in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> by which perſwaſions and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements of his Relations, this Informant was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97012:5"/>
upon to ſtay with them; and after that ſpent moſt of his time at one Major <hi>John Butlers</hi> Houſe, at <hi>Crebanaugh,</hi> who was married to a Kinſwoman of this Informants.</p>
            <p>This Major <hi>Butler</hi> living within a Mile and a half of the Earl of <hi>Tyrone's,</hi> was wont always to viſit the ſaid Earles Houſe twice a Week, and thither I muſt alſo bear him Company. At length it came to that paſs, that if he, or this Informant, failed to go every Week once or twice to the ſaid Earls Houſe, then there was a Letter ſent for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Butler,</hi> if not for this Informant too: By which means this Informant grew familiar and well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſaid Earl, his Lordſhip frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowing this Informant the Honour of his Company when he went a Hunting, or play'd at Tables, or ſometimes to read <hi>Iriſh,</hi> ſometimes to go a Fiſhing with him, and in ſuch like Exerciſes and Paſtimes wherein his Lordſhip moſt delighted: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, the Informant was appointed Deputy-<hi>Seneſchall</hi> to his Lordſhip; in which Employment he continued for the ſpace of two years and a half, or thereabouts, and ſo might have done till this time, if the Informant had kept his Lordſhips Sedrets in Relation to the Plot.</p>
            <p>This Informant further ſaith, That he was ſeldom or never in the ſaid Earles Company, but he and Major <hi>Butler</hi> would always be talking of high matters, praying for the <hi>French</hi> Kings proſperity, and diſcourſing how little <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> would be in his hands, if he would but come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; and ſaying further, That the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> were good Souldiers in their Tongues over a Cup of Ale, with long Pipes of Tobacco in their Mouths; but that they were too tender now to lye in the Fields after thirty years reſt, and that they were ſo Foggy, ſo Fat, and full of Guts,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97012:5"/>
that they were not able to fight any better than a company of Swine; and that he the ſaid Earl, with three hundred <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Iriſh,</hi> of his own choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, would undertake to rout and break a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them.</p>
            <p>And this Informant ſays further, That if he ſhould go about to take notice of all the Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſages and words that were ſpoken by the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> Major <hi>John Butler,</hi> Father <hi>James Power,</hi> Father <hi>John Power,</hi> Father <hi>Robert Power,</hi> and Father <hi>Patrick Ronane.</hi> (the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Pariſh Prieſt) who were altogether moſt commonly at the ſaid Earls Houſe, contriving of Plots, or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Treaſonable Lectures, relating thereunto; he could be able to make up, together with what the Informant mentions here, a large Volume.</p>
            <p>This Informant further ſaith, That he hath obſerved, that <hi>John Power,</hi> and <hi>Dynough Macnemarrah,</hi> came very often to the Earl of <hi>Tyrone's</hi> Houſe, and went from thence into the Counties of <hi>Typperary, Limbrick, Clare</hi> and <hi>Gallaway,</hi> and in a ſhort time returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain very Brisk and Gay, well Hors'd and Armed, with their Caſes of Piſtols themſelves, their men, and their followers.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Gallants are both Papiſts; the one of them <hi>John Power,</hi> that kill'd (as they ſay) the Lord <hi>Moone,</hi> and fled into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the other a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Fortune, that had left the <hi>French</hi> ſervice in diſcontent. Both Perſons of no Eſtates, nor any other concerns in any of the Counties aforeſaid, as the Informant has reaſon to believe, but only to ride about upon Meſſages from the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> in reference to the Plot.</p>
            <p>The Informant further ſaith, That he hath ſeen and obſerved the Intelligencers that were ſent by the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> to the ſeveral Counties, <hi>viz. Pierce Power,</hi> alias <hi>Pierce,</hi> and <hi>Grenane</hi> to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97012:6"/>
of <hi>Clare</hi> and <hi>Gallaway,</hi> and <hi>William Fench</hi> into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part of the ſaid County of <hi>Clare,</hi> whoſe anſwers to any that queſtioned them, were, that their buſineſs was to order and ſettle the Earl of <hi>Angleſeys</hi> chief Rents, having had but very little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do formerly in either of thoſe two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Lawrence Sullivane</hi> was employed to the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> and <hi>William Butler</hi> employed by his Brother, Major <hi>John Butler,</hi> or the Earl of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> into the County of <hi>Wexford:</hi> All theſe Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were conſtantly employed upon Meſſages in the Months of <hi>May, June, July, Auguſt, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> 1678. In which Month of <hi>October,</hi> the Informant was alſo ſent for to joyn in the ſaid Plot by the Earl of <hi>Tyrone;</hi> in reference whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I ſhall here give a Relation of what paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Lordſhip and this Informant as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>The Informant being at a place in the County of <hi>Waterford,</hi> called <hi>Kill</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in company of one <hi>Richard Power,</hi> Gent. on the laſt day of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1678. which was of a <hi>Fryday,</hi> and being then at Breakfaſt, one <hi>Thomas Samſon,</hi> Gent. and Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> came into our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who after Breakfaſt was over, ſpoke to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant in theſe words; Mr. <hi>Bourk, my Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter deſired me to pray you to come to him to</hi> Corough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>this night, or to morrow following, telling me he had ſome earneſt buſineſs to ſpeak with you about, but what it is I know not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Informant told the ſaid Mr. <hi>Samſon,</hi> that he the Informant had been at that Houſe in <hi>Kill</hi> Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> at a Sheriffs Court all the day before, and that his Horſe was either ſtrayed or ſtoln; and farther told the ſaid <hi>Samſon,</hi> that if the Informant thought that his Lordſhips ſending for him was of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence or haſte, he the Informant would hire a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97012:6"/>
Horſe to wait upon his Lordſhip that night. The ſaid <hi>Samſon</hi> anſwered, He did not know what the matter was, but that was the Meſſage which his Lord bid him deliver.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Samſon</hi> was but then newly come to my Lords Service, ſo that he having ſummoned a Court-Baron at <hi>Kill Mr. Thomas</hi> aforeſaid that day, where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant was to appear as Attorney for the Earl of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi> in a Cauſe depending in that Court, betwixt the ſaid Earl and ſome of his Neighbours and Tenants, concerning certain Treſpaſſes, it behoved this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant to ſtay till the Court was diſcharged. But that being done, this Informant hired a Horſe and went with the ſaid <hi>Samſon</hi> to my Lords Houſe. So ſoon as this Informant arrived there, this Informant was given to underſtand that his Lordſhip was at Supper with Strangers, but returned his thanks to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant for travelling ſo far in a dark night to viſit his Lordſhip, and withall to deſire this Informant to come to his Lordſhip the next Morning: Which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly this Informant did, being the firſt day of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> 1678.</p>
            <p>This Informant attending his Lordſhip upon the Morning already mentioned, his Lordſhip bad the Informant welcome; after which his Lordſhip asked this Informant, <hi>What News?</hi> This Informant anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he preſumed his Lordſhip had the beſt Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of any on that ſide the Country, and that for the Informant's part he had none worth his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips hearing. His Lordſhip then told the Informant that he had received Intelligence out of <hi>France,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he underſtood that the <hi>French</hi> were very powerful, and that <hi>Parlez vous Francois</hi> ſhould be plentifully heard here (meaning in <hi>Ireland)</hi> e're long. This Informant asking his Lordſhip what great Exploits the <hi>French</hi> King hath done? <hi>Done,</hi> ſays he, <hi>he hath done wonders, and we may without doubt call him the Defender</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97012:7"/>
               <hi>of the Faith, for he beſt deſerves it, and I am ſure the Hand of God is with him.</hi> This Informant told his Lordſhip, that a man would be apter to think, that if the <hi>French</hi> were intended that way, he would rather venture upon <hi>England</hi> firſt, than come into <hi>Ireland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> His Lordſhip anſwered he had received a Letter from one <hi>Robert Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who ſtudied the Law at one of the Ihns of Court in <hi>London,</hi> which declared that the <hi>French</hi> had a great ſtroke in <hi>England</hi> already; and then, ſaid his Lordſhip to this Informant, before you are half a year older the <hi>French</hi> will ſubdue <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and little harm thereby: For they in <hi>England</hi> have no Faith in them; for they no ſooner grant a thing but they recall it again; juſt as they have dealt with me about the Lands of <hi>Dea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e: But,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>before the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, by Goge I will loſe the beſt Blood in my Body.</hi> The Informant was aſtoniſhed to ſee in what temper his Lordſhip was; yet told his Lordſhip, That if the <hi>French</hi> ſhould come there, they would kill all as that were the poor Subjects. His Lordſhip anſwered, As for that, ſaid he, I have made my Conditions for this ſide of the Countrey; and if you will but joyn with me, I will put you in a quick way to get an Eſtate. The Informant told his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, That he wanted it, but could not tell how to come at it. Then his Lordſhip drew out of his Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket a great quantity of Papers rolled up, and deſired the Informant to ſubſcribe his Name in one of thoſe Papers, wherein, upon a ſudden glance, the Informant could read the Names of <hi>Paul Strange, Richard</hi> and <hi>John Power;</hi> and, as this Informant verily believes, there were the Names of above a hundred Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in all. This Informant deſired his Lordſhip to excuſe him for the preſent, alledging, That he was not fit to be employed in Matters of ſuch high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; and the Informant ſaid further, That he never heard of any of his Name that had ever proved
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97012:7"/>
Traytors to their Kings, and that he, this Informant, would not be the firſt. With that, his Lordſhip cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this Informant Coward, and drew his Sword al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of his Scabbard to kill the Informant: But, as God would have it, his Lordſhip eſpied a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man coming towards him, who was Sir <hi>John Ponſopy</hi>'s Son: Upon which his Lordſhip went to ſalute him, and left me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> However, after he had walked with him into his Houſe, his Lordſhip went himſelf to the Bridge of <hi>Corroghmore,</hi> before the Informants face, and called forth one <hi>William Power</hi> a Broag-maker, and commanded him in all haſte to go and bring him <hi>John Daniell</hi> to inform againſt this Informant for that this Informant had ſtruck the ſaid <hi>Daniell</hi> half a vear before; though the Buſineſs amounted to no more than two ſlight Blows with this Informants bare Hands, in the Informants own defence, and for which the ſaid <hi>Daniell</hi> had releaſed the Informant the next Morning after he had ſtruck him, before four Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. However, at my Lord's Command, the ſaid <hi>Daniell</hi> came to <hi>Corroghmore,</hi> and was forced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form againſt this Informant for the ſaid Battery, his Lordſhip threatning the ſaid <hi>John Daniell,</hi> that he would crop his Ears if he did not inform againſt the Informant. Thereupon, upon the ſaid <hi>Daniell</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, this Informant was diſarmed, and by a <hi>Mittimus</hi> from the ſaid Earl was to be ſent to the Gaol of <hi>Waterford;</hi> but it being <hi>Saturday</hi> late at night, the Conſtable took the Informant's word to meet him at a certain Place on <hi>Munday</hi> following. In the mean time the Informant procured Bail, and brought them to <hi>Corroghmore,</hi> to his Lordſhip's Houſe; but his Lordſhip refuſed to take any Bail for the Informant, and moreover ordered, that if the Conſtable made any delay to obey his Warrant, and did not go forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with with the Informant to <hi>Waterford,</hi> he would ſend the Conſtable to Gaol too: And more than that, his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97012:8"/>
Lordſhip ſent to the ſeveral Juſtices of the Peace him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that they ſhould not bail the Informant upon any account. His Lordſhip ſaid further, <hi>That if the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant did not ſtarve in Gaol, he would hang him the next Aſſizes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the way, as the Informant was going towards <hi>Waterford,</hi> the Informant writ a Letter to <hi>William Smith</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> deſiring him to ſpeak to my Lord to take Bail for the Informant. My Lord, at his Requeſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the ſaid Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> he would; but when it was tendred, he would take none. Then, ſince it could not be avoided, the Informant was put into <hi>Waterford</hi> Gaol, about the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> and there remained until the Fourteenth of <hi>March</hi> following; during which time, the Informant wrote Five Letters to his Grace the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the hard Uſage he had received, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what further he had to ſay as to the Plot: Of which Letters, two of them were ſealed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder of <hi>Waterford</hi>'s Lady, becauſe there was neither Fire or Candle allowed where the Informant was kept: But neither of thoſe two, nor of three more, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant could ever have an Anſwer; ſo that either they miſcarried, or were taken up at the Poſtmaſter's Office in <hi>Waterford:</hi> for it ſeems the Lord Lieutenant received none of them, as his Grace was pleaſed to tell this Informant afterwards.</p>
            <p>As to the reſt of my Condition, it was ſuch, that if any body out of Friendſhip came to ſee this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, he durſt not come the ſecond time, for fear of the Earl, or purchaſing his Indignation. At length came the Aſſizes, and then the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>viz. Thomas Samſon</hi> his Steward, <hi>Thomas Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> his Sollicitor, and <hi>William Buckner</hi> his Attorney, went to work with great eagerneſs againſt the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, in ordering an Indictment againſt the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and brought the ſaid <hi>Daniell</hi> to prove it: But
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97012:8"/>
the Informant travers'd the ſaid Indictment, and was acquitted by the Jury. Upon my Acquittal, the Judges, finding that there was ſomething more than ordinary in the matter, and wondering that a Man of the Informants Capacity ſhould be kept four Months in Gaol, without Bail, for onely ſtriking another Man in his own defence, began to inquire a little further into the matter; whereupon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant gave them his Information in Writing: upon which, Sir <hi>William Davis,</hi> one of the Judges, adviſed the Informant to ſtay in Gaol three or four days longer, and that he would ſend to <hi>Dublin</hi> for a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, to have the Informant brought before the Lord Lieutenant and Council.</p>
            <p>The further Examination of <hi>Hobert Bourke,</hi> who ſaith, That after he was diſcharged at <hi>Waterford</hi> from the beating of <hi>John Daniell,</hi> he was ſent for by the Lord Lieutenant and Council, to appear before his <hi>Grace</hi> and the Council, to give Evidence for the King concerning the Deſigns of the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> which was the Informants chief aim and deſire. In ſhort, a Warrant was given to a Meſſenger, directed to the Sheriff of the County of <hi>Waterford,</hi> commanding him to ſend the Informant well guarded to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where he ſhould be relieved, and a freſh Guard be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſafe Conduct of the Informant: but in ſtead of a good Guard, the Sheriff aforeſaid, <hi>William Dobbin</hi> by name, being a great Friend to the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and knowing that the Informant had impeached the ſaid Earl, ſent onely two of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-Boys along with the Meſſenger as Guards, and Cords to tie the Informants Legs under the Horſes Belly, which was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>At length the Informant coming to <hi>Dublin,</hi> was examined by Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> Secretary of State, who told the Informant, that he knew the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> ſo well, that he would not believe any thing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97012:9"/>
ſhould ſay of him; and would often ſay to the Informant, <hi>Pray anſwer me,</hi> Mr. Bourke, <hi>and let alone your telling of Stories;</hi> of a ſet purpoſe to put the Examinant out of the way of telling the true Contents of his Information. For, as for this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, he could not add or diminiſh from what he had delivered to Sir <hi>VVilliam Davis</hi> at the Aſſizes in <hi>VVaterford:</hi> but Sir <hi>John</hi>'s intent was to ſee whether he could catch the Informant in any diſadvantage, or derogation from what he had delivered in Writing, as aforeſaid. But for all this, the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> was confined to his Chamber, and afterwards gave Bail to anſwer the Informants Challenge at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> the next Term, which was <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term, at what time his Lordſhip and this Informant were both to appear. In the mean time the Earl made it his buſineſs to make the Informant the greateſt Rogue in the World: To which purpoſe, he was charg'd by the ſaid Earls People, <hi>viz.</hi> his Attorney Mr. <hi>Buckner,</hi> his Sollicitor <hi>Thomas Cowdall,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Cartie</hi> Deputy Clerk of the Aſſize for <hi>Munſter</hi> Circuit; which Perſons brought an Indictment againſt the Informant, for ſtealing of a Horſe out of the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> which, as they pretended, was about three years before. But as the ſame was but a meer Contrivance, ſo it was found upon tryal by the Judges of the <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to render the Informant infamous, that his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt the ſaid Earl might be of no value.</p>
            <p>When they could not prevail againſt the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant by this means, the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> gave Bail to anſwer the Informant at <hi>Waterford</hi> Aſſizes then next enſuing, hoping in all that time among his Friends and Relations to find ſome other means to ruine and deſtroy the Informant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That this <hi>Thomas Cowdall</hi> was a Servant to <hi>Robert Bower,</hi> that ſent the Letter to the Earl of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> which Letter was mentioned in my firſt Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97012:9"/>
and Mr. <hi>Cartie</hi> was a Perſon who was under Promiſes to diſcover all Secrets to the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> that he knew as a Clerk of the Aſſize. But this Informant being bound to appear in <hi>Waterford,</hi> to proſecute the ſaid Earl at his own Door, and amongſt his Tenants and Relations, the Informant thought it a very hard Task: and beſides all this, he was terrified from appearing there, by ſeveral People, who told the Informant, That he muſt never look to return from thence in ſafety, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the ſaid Earl had procured his own Counſel to be Judge of the Aſſize, and his own Tenants and Relations to be Tryers of the Matter of Fact, in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. So that this Informant finding himſelf in ſuch danger of his Life, choſe rather to hazard his Recogniſance, and the forfeiture of his Bond, than to run into apparent peril of his Life, which he underſtood was both eagerly and craftily ſought for. Yet for all theſe Threats, before the Tryal came on, this Informant did go to <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Aſſizes; but finding the Earl of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> and his Coſin Lieutenant <hi>Thomas Power,</hi> at Supper with Chief Juſtice <hi>Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Reynolds,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they Lodg'd and Dieted in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97012:10"/>
one Houſe, and at one Table, this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant then began to think it was in vain to expect any favour. Which, together with the Warning and Notice that was given him, this Informant, in <hi>Waterford,</hi> That if he opened his Lips againſt the Earl of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> he muſt not think to ſleep the Night following, unleſs he ſlept to Eternity, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely daunted the Courage of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant. Nor was this all; for he wanted alſo the Aſsiſtance of <hi>John Macnamarrah,</hi> his Chief Teſtimony, who by Promiſes of Rewards from the ſaid Earl, was ſecur'd from appearing in this Informants behalf; and at the ſame time alſo, neither Mr. <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> appear'd to bring in his Teſtimony, nor Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> his Aſiſtance, who I knew could both of them diſcover much of the Matter: nor had this Informant any Power from the Court to bring them in. All which were the Cauſes why this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant left the Court, and abſented himſelf, thinking it would be better to appear at the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> by which time he hoped to get ſufficient Authority to bring in the forementioned Perſons to his Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97012:10"/>
In order thereunto the Informant wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Judges then in <hi>Waterford,</hi> that the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant was not then prepared to proceed, in regard the Witneſſes were not brought in, nor any care taken to bring them in. But the Informant fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Letter ſhould not be delivered, and not daring to go to the Judges Chamber, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Earl of <hi>Tyrones</hi> being there with them, and his Friends and Servants about him, the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant was reſolved to venter into the Court. But he was no ſooner within the Door when the Chief Juſtice <hi>Keating,</hi> as the Informant believes, or if not he, ſome Body elſe, called to the Goaler to take the Informant into Cuſtody, which ſo affrighted the Informant, that he made all the haſt he could back again out of Court, and was preſently follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a Hue and Cry after him by the Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Conſtables and Bailiffs, that he was glad to ſlip privately into one Mr. <hi>Fullers Tan-Houſe,</hi> without the Gates of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and there to ſtay all that Night. In the mean time the Goaler goes where the Informants Horſe ſtood, and told the People he was ordered by the Judges to ſecure the ſaid Horſe. The next Morning by break of Day this Informant hired a Boat to Ferry him over to the Slip-houſe on the other ſide of the River in the County of <hi>Kilkenay,</hi> and went to one Mr. <hi>William Wilkinſons</hi> houſe an Inkeeper, who about 4 a Clock in the afternoon, told this Informant that it was not ſafe for him to be there, in regard there was ſuch a ſtrict enquiry made for him in <hi>Waterford.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Informant departed from thence, intending to have gon to attend his Grace the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> who was then in <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to acquaint his Grace with the Judges proceedings in <hi>Waterford.</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97012:11"/>
In the way as this Informant going a Foot, above two miles onward in the Road to <hi>Kilkenny</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, one <hi>Major Richards</hi>'s Coachman overtaking this Informant, and knowing him, rode before to an Alehouſe, and there wrote a Letter to the Earl of <hi>Jyrone</hi>'s Coachman, giving him notice that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant was going towards <hi>Kilkenny</hi> aforeſaid, and deſiring him to tell the ſame to my Lord <hi>Tyrone.</hi> The writing of this Letter being by chance diſcovered by this Informant, cauſed him to leave the Road, and to turn four miles out of the way to <hi>Kilkenny</hi> and make haſt to a place called <hi>Gurteenes,</hi> where he ſtayed four or five days, until <hi>John Macknamara,</hi> who had diſcourſed the matter with the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> ſent the Informant a Letter in which he gave this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant to underſtand, that the ſaid Earl had ſworn and damn'd himſelf to Eternity, that he owed the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant no ill will at all, praying this Informant to come to the ſaid <hi>Macknamara</hi>'s houſe. But this Informant being afraid of the Earl, and not daring to truſt him, ſent the ſaid <hi>Macknamara</hi> word, that he would not come. However this Informant writ a Letter in few days after, to the ſaid <hi>Macknamara</hi> for his Portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Lynnen and other things which were at his houſe, who ſent the Meſſenger back without the Lynnen, &amp;c. but with a Letter, wherein he mentioned, that he would meet the Informant next morning at <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford,</hi> and bring his Lynnen with him, and that he had ſeveral things to impart to the Informant concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or from the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> which he durſt not write. Thereupon the Informant did meet the ſaid <hi>Macnamara,</hi> together with his Wife and Father in Law, <hi>Teige Funnican,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Carties</hi> houſe; being met, this Informant told the ſaid <hi>Macnamara,</hi> that he was ready to take Shipping for <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> To which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97012:11"/>
the ſaid <hi>Macnamara</hi> ſaid, do not trouble your ſelf any further, for I will get you a good conſideration and liberty to ſtay at home. The aforeſaid <hi>Funni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> alſo promiſed this Informant Twenty Shillings in Money, and his ſhare of a Barrel of Bear, and his Horſe to ride upon, upon condition the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant would alter his mind and go home with them that Night. <hi>Macnamara,</hi> further ſaid, you are not in condition to Travel at preſent, meaning for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and told me it would be better to ſtay till I were better provided. And thus they flattered the Informant with them home, though he well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it was ſtill upon the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s accompt that they ſo friendly invited him. Within two days after the Informant's coming to <hi>Macnamara</hi>'s Houſe, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Macnamara,</hi> went to the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Houſe, and informed his Lordſhip, that he had the Informant at home. The ſaid <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namara,</hi> alſo told this Informant at his return from the ſaid Earl, that the ſaid Earl preſented his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him this Informant; and deſired him to give Major <hi>John Butler,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Ronane</hi> a meeting at a certain place, in order to an agreement betwixt the ſaid Earl, and this Informant. All which things this Informant imparted to Mr. <hi>Ivie,</hi> then living in the ſame Town with <hi>Macnamara.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ivie,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Informant to be very wary, for fear they ſhould entrap him. Upon which this Informant told Mr. <hi>Ivie,</hi> he would go and ſee what they would be at. In order to which reſolution, Mr. <hi>Macnamara,</hi> and this Informant went, and met Major <hi>Butler,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ronane,</hi> about four Miles from M. <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namara</hi>'s Houſe, at a publick Ale Houſe. Where, diſcourſing the matter together, the ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Butler,</hi> deſired this Informant, to deſiſt from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97012:12"/>
troubling of the Earl any more, upon which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the ſaid Earl would give this Informant a good Farm and Stock; and he ſhould have his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips favour more then ever he had ſhewed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He deſired this Informant alſo, to nominate any ſum of money that this Informant pleaſed, ſo that he did not exceed a thouſand pound, and he the ſaid <hi>Butler</hi> would be bound for the payment of it; on condition, that this Informant ſhould ſay, that Squire <hi>Villiers,</hi> Captain <hi>Nichols,</hi> Mr. <hi>May,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter Anthony,</hi> were his Promoters and Abettors in this Diſcovery and Deſign againſt the ſaid Earl. To which the Informant anſwered, that neither of the Parties mentioned, ever ſpoke a word to him in their Lives, or if they had, he would not have been prompted to do any unjuſt Action by any of them all. And this Informant told the ſaid <hi>Butler,</hi> that he never charg'd the ſaid Earl with any thing but what his Lordſhip was pleaſed to tell and ſhew him himſelf. Thus after they had kept the Informant a whole day to entice him with proffers of that kind, and ſeeing they could not prevail. Major <hi>Butler</hi> ſent Mr. <hi>Ronan</hi> home to the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and Major <hi>Butler</hi> himſelf returned along with the Informant and <hi>Macnamara,</hi> back to <hi>Macnamara</hi>'s houſe, where the ſaid <hi>Butler</hi> and the Informant lay together that night.</p>
            <p>The next day, this Informant acquainted Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> with all the Diſcourſe, at the aforeſaid Meeting, and with the proffers made to this Informant, and then again this Informant was reſolved to go for <hi>England,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> told him it was not ſafe to go before he had the Lord Lieutenants paſs: which put this Informant to another ſtand, in regard he did not know what to do for want of a conveniency to apply
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97012:12"/>
himſelf to the Lord Lieutenant, and being alſo afraid to go alone. In theſe perplexities this Informant then went to <hi>Waterford,</hi> where he met with one of the Earl of <hi>Tyrones</hi> Servants, by name <hi>John Whelane,</hi> who told him, that it was well for him, that he was ſo wiſe as to run away from the Aſſizes, for if he had ſtayed, the Judges were reſolved, at leaſt, to have cropped this Informants Ears; and further, Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon</hi> the Innkeeper aforenamed, told the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, that the Judges were reſolved to have taken him along the Circuit with them, and to have got ſome body to have ſworn ſomething againſt him that might have amounted to the taking away his Life. The Informant then wrote a Letter to the Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi> which the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deliver to the ſaid Earl, the ſaid <hi>Ivie</hi> having ſome occaſions of his own into thoſe parts; which Letter the ſaid <hi>Ivie</hi> read before it was ſealed: the Contents of which Letter were, to pray the Earl of <hi>Orrery</hi> to ſend for, and examine the aforeſaid <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who was then at <hi>Youghall</hi> near the ſaid Earls houſe, and to write to the Lord Lieutenant with a Requeſt to his Grace, to ſend for the ſaid <hi>Sampſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> and the Informant. But Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> was ſo very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in getting in his Harveſt, that he could not go ſo ſoon as he intended to the Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi> and ſo that Letter took no effect.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> finding he could not by Bribes or otherwiſe, prevail with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant to deſiſt his Proſecution, he then Petitioned the Lord Lieutenant againſt the Informant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Meſſenger was ſent to the Earl of <hi>Tyrones</hi> houſe firſt, which ſaid Meſſenger told the ſaid Earl, that he was ordered to take his directions from his Lordſhip for the ſecuring of this Informant, and that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97012:13"/>
ſo ſoon as he ſhould be taken, he was to be brought to the ſaid Earl firſt. Whereupon the ſaid Earl, to conceal his knowledg, where the Informant was, as though he were ignorant of the ſame, ſent ſeveral of his Servants to ſearch for him, though they all knew very well where this Informant was; having often ſent tome before. At length, after a long pretended ſearch, coming into the aforenamed <hi>Macnamara</hi>'s houſe (whither I was then return'd from <hi>Waterford)</hi> about Tenn or eleven a Clock at night, the ſaid Earls Servants apprehended this Informant firſt, and bound him with Cords. In which condition the Informant ſeeing the Meſſenger, asked him whether he had any Warrant ſo to do? who ſaid that he was but a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator only, and that the Earl of <hi>Tyrones</hi> people were the Officers, and Withal, the ſaid Meſſenger bad the Informant to take his laſt leave, and farewell of his Friends.</p>
            <p>Then they hurried this Informant away from Mr. <hi>Macnamara</hi>'s houſe, four miles that night; the next morning they conveigh'd him out of the <hi>direct way</hi> to <hi>Waterford,</hi> to put the Informant to greater pains and trouble, and brought him in at the <hi>Weſt-Gate</hi> of the ſaid City of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and ſo all along the Street, bound as he was, until they came to the Croſs, which is about the middle of the City, where they alighted, &amp; carried this Informant into one Mr. <hi>Guddriges</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers houſe In which place they kept the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the condition aforeſaid, until they had gathered all the Earl of <hi>Tyrones</hi> Friends, that were in that City, and all the Officers of the ſame, to ſee how they had hamper'd this Informant, and then, when they had ſatisſted the ſcorn and contempt of the Spectators, they procured a lame little Galloway without Shoos for this Informant to ride upon, and then tying this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97012:13"/>
Informants Legs under the ſaid Galloways Be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with his hands tyed behind him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they carried <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> through the Town to be ſeen in diriſion, where he had not been ſeen before, and ſo having ſhew'd this Informant from one end of the Town to the other for a ſecond paſtime to the Multitude, they then carried him a way to the Earl of <hi>Tyrone's</hi> houſe, ſo bound as before, where the Earl had gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all his Friends and Neighbours, to ſee the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant in that condition. Among the reſt, the ſaid Earls Miſtreſs, by name Mrs. <hi>Mortimeer,</hi> gave to the Meſſenger nine Cobs ſterling; that ſhe alſo might have a ſight of this Informant in his ignominious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and at the mercy of his Enemy, then the Judg of his own Cauſe and in his own houſe.</p>
            <p>After they had kept this Informant at the Earl of <hi>Tyrones,</hi> after the manner aforeſaid, to make ſport for the ſpace of two hours, then they carried him on the way to the next Garriſon, which was <hi>Carrickma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhure.</hi> One <hi>Thomas Powre,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tyrones</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who was at the apprehending of this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant and one of his Guard, riding before to a place called <hi>Crehanough,</hi> where dwelt the forementioned Major <hi>John Butler.</hi> His buſineſs was to deſire the ſaid <hi>Butler</hi> to meet this Informant in the way to <hi>Carrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſhure,</hi> which he accordingly did. When he came he asked the Informant what was the matter? As though he had not known before; who anſwered him that for his part he did not know. The ſaid Major <hi>Butler</hi> then asked the Informant, whether he could be ſpoken to in private? This Informant made anſwer, that that place was no place for this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant to talk in, being wet and durty with riding ſo far in foul ways without Boots and his Legs tyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Horſes Belly. With that the ſaid <hi>Butler</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:97012:14"/>
followed this Informant to <hi>Carrickmaſhure,</hi> and brought with him Mr. <hi>John Ronan,</hi> before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and Quartermaſter <hi>Ely.</hi> Upon their coming into this Informants Company at his Lodging in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickmaſhure</hi> aforeſaid, the ſaid Quartermaſter <hi>Ely</hi>'s firſt Complement was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That he knew the reſt of the Company, but the Informant he knew not.</hi> To which this Informant anſwered, that he knew this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant well enough too if he pleaſed; but this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant told him he was indifferent whether he did or no. Upon which he the ſaid <hi>Ely</hi> ſaid, he knew him this Inofrmant ſo well, and that one Rope was too little for him.</p>
            <p>Then Major <hi>Butler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ronan</hi> fell to their old way of tampering with this Informant by turns, to which purpoſe the ſaid Major <hi>Butler</hi> promiſed, that if the Informant would do as he the ſaid <hi>Butler</hi> would have had him do before, he would follow the Informant next Morning to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and get him quit of all his Troubles for the future; that is to ſay, if he would take their former profers, and excuſe the forementioned Gentlemen. And the ſaid Major farther told this Informant, that there were ſome People gone before him to <hi>Kilkenny</hi> that would be very glad to bring in thoſe Gentlemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid to the ſaving of the Earl of <hi>Tyrone.</hi> But this <hi>Informant</hi> refuſed and ſcorned their offers not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great ſhame and pain they put him to. Then Major <hi>Butler</hi> took this Informant by the hand and ſaid, old friend, farewell now for evermore. Then Quarter-Maſter <hi>Elie</hi> began an Health to the Proſperity of the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and to the confounding and utter ſubverſion of all his Enemies, and forced the Health to go round.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Ely</hi> is Quarter-Maſter to the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97012:14"/>
of <hi>Irelands</hi> Troop, and charged by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Mr. <hi>Macnamara</hi> in his Information, for being in the Conſpiracy with the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and one that was to have been a Major under the ſaid Earl for the French, and confeſſed he was a Papiſt heretofore.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Kilkenny</hi> this Informant was carried to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and then committed to the Meſſengers hands, under a Guard of Muſquetiers both night and day, without the Liberty of Pen, Ink or Paper, or ſo much as to ſpeak to any body, but what the Guard ſhould underſtand, and in their preſence; to wich end they watched in the Informants Room all night. Under which reſtraint, this Informant was cloſely kept for ſeveral days, until he was examined by hi good friend the Lord-Chief-Juſtice <hi>Keating.</hi> Then he Petitioned the Lord Lieutenant and Council, to ſend a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for the bringing in of Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> and Mr <hi>Ivy,</hi> &amp;c. to the end, they might give in their Evidences, which the Informant alleaged were material. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a fortnight after thoſe Gentlemen came to <hi>Dublin</hi> but none of them could be admitted to come to ſee the Infotmant, until they all had delivered their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Informations, and then this Informant had his Liberty.</p>
            <p>This Informant further faith, that he and the reſt of the Witneſſes were then bound in Recognizance to appear at <hi>Waterford</hi> Aſſizes next enſuing, which was to be held the tenth day of <hi>March</hi> laſt paſt. The Judges for that Circuit were Sir <hi>Richard Reynolds</hi> and Sir <hi>William Davis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Aſſizes came to be held, the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant and the reſt of the Witneſſes appeared, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the uſual Ceremonies of the Court, the Grand Jury was called, and then one Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> of the Earls Council, a Papiſt, ſtood up, and made a ſhort motion to this effect.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97012:15"/>
               <hi>My Lords, here is a Peer of this Nation in Queſtion for his Life,</hi> and then he prayed leave to appear for the Earl, which was granted for him, and Councellour <hi>Long,</hi> another <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Jury was called, and going to be ſworn, Mr. <hi>Long</hi> ſtood up and ſaid, I am for the party Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached; and then both the Counſel and the Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of which there were three, craved liberty to accept againſt ſome of the Jury, which exceptions were made againſt none but <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Informant he had neither Counſel nor Atturnies allowed him though often demanded the priviledge, and though the Informant and the reſt of the witneſſes excepted againſt ſome of the Jury, as being of kindred and Tennants, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt <hi>Paul Sherlack, Peirce Walch,</hi> and one <hi>Cary;</hi> yet upon their bare words denying themſelves to be kindred or Tennants, they were admitted of the Jury, notwithſtanding, that this Informant knew they were either Related to the Plotters, or concerned in the Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>After Dinner, the Informant went to the Judges Chambers, where the ſaid Judges ſwore this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant and the reſt of the Witneſſes, to attend the Grand Jury. In order whereunto, this Informant went, and after a tedious attendance at the Door of the Grand-Jury-Room, he prayed admittance, and deſired to be heard. But the Jury told this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, they had ſeen all the Informations already, and had no Orders to hear any more new thing or matter.</p>
            <p>The next morning, this Informant being in the Judges Chamber, in came Major <hi>Richards</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Grant,</hi> two of the Jury, who declared to Judg <hi>Reynolds,</hi> that the Bill againſt the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97012:15"/>
found <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Whereupon, Judg <hi>Reynolds</hi> ask'd Major <hi>Richards,</hi> whether they were all agreed to it? To which he anſwered, that ſeven were for finding the Bill, and ren againſt it, and ſo they were out-Voted. However, ſome of the Jury were pleaſed to ſay after, that they durſt not but agree with the reſt, and that the Papiſts that were there threatned them in ſuch a manner, that the Proteſtants durſt not agree to what they would have them do. And ſo the next day the Jury brought in the Bill <hi>Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon that, this Informant deſired that the Jury might be ſent for into Court, and called over one by one; &amp; that enquiry might be made concerning the perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which were of moſt Value as to the Kings Intereſt and the Proteſtant Religion, whether they that were for finding the Bill, or they that voted againſt it? Upon which, the Judges ſent for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ordered them to be called over one by one: but there were no other queſtions put to them, but only whether they were all agreed in their Verdict? To which, the foreman anſwered, they were agreed according to the way they commonly uſe in Juries, which was to put it to Votes. But whether it were true or no, that they left to the Judges: and ſo the Bill was receiv'd <hi>Ignoramus.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>This Informant further faith, that when he found that neither he nor his Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes could be heard in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he came into <hi>England,</hi> and made his Appeal to the King and Council in <hi>April</hi> laſt, together with another of the Witneſſes, Mr. <hi>John Macnamara</hi> by name. Which being done, this Informant and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Macnamara,</hi> were by Order of the King and Council, commanded back into <hi>Ireland,</hi> having firſt entered into Bond to make their appearance in <hi>Dublin,</hi> before the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Council within ſo many days after the date thereof; which we did accordingly, the laſt day of <hi>April,</hi> or very neer it. Ever ſince which time, till our ſecond return into <hi>England,</hi> this Informant and the other Witneſs were delaid and kept there in ſuch a condition, that we could not be diſcharg'd of our attendance, nor be made uſe of as we deſired. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could this Informant be allowed one Penny to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his charges and expences, though this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant had been forced to keep ſeveral of his Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for ſeveral Weeks at his own coſts. It being the Deſign of the Conſpirators to hinder this Informant
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97012:17"/>
from all neceſſary ſupply and encouragement, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that at length he might be laid in Jail for Debt, or that they might lay ſome train to accuſe him of ſomething that might amount to the taking away his life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or keeping him in perpetual impriſonment; which is the more likely, for that thoſe devices not prevailing, they thought to have done their buſineſs by Aſſaſſination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, this Informant further ſaith, that one day, as he was coming out of the Four Courts of <hi>Dublin,</hi> one <hi>John Powre,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Couſin German, and a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> being alſo one that had been an Officer in <hi>France,</hi> together with no leſs then Thirty more, fell upon this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, without the leaſt provocation given by him this Informant, or ſo much as ſpeaking to them one word, but only at the Inſtigation of the ſaid <hi>John Powre,</hi> who cry'd to the reſt, <hi>There goes that Rogue Bourk.</hi> Upon which, as upon a ſignal given; they all, or as many as could come at him, lay'd at this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant with all the fury imaginable, ſo that he was not only wounded and bruiſed in ſeveral places of his Head, but in moſt parts of his Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though this Informant cry'd often out for help, yet not one Perſon would ſtir to his Aſſiſtance, only a young man, that was with this Informant, kept off as many blows as he could, in ſo much that this Informant expected no other then Death; till at laſt eſpying a door open, he made a ſhift, as weak as he was, to retreat backward into an Entry, where he drew his Sword and kept them off till he got into the Houſe: after which they had like to have murthered the young man before mentioned in revenge. Yet, all the remedy this Informant had, was to complain to Sir <hi>Robert Booth,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, who iſſued forth his Warrant for the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97012:17"/>
ſo many as we could tell the names of. Three were taken, the foreſaid <hi>John Powre, Richard Mansfield,</hi> and <hi>John Barry,</hi> all Papiſts, (the reſt run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away and not being to be found) who were bound to anſwer the Fact, the next enſuing Term at the Court of Kings Bench, and in the mean time to be of the good Behaviour.</p>
            <p>And this Informant further ſaith, that having after a tedious and chargeable cure, at length recovered himſelf, being unwilling to expoſe himſelf any more to the malice of ſuch kind of Perſons, he Petition'd the Lord Lieutenant for a Paſs to come for <hi>England,</hi> which his Grace was pleas'd to refuſe, ſaying, That the Informant had gone into <hi>England</hi> already with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Paſs, and therefore he might go or ſtay as he pleas'd, but for his part he would give him none. So that this Informant was forced to come for <hi>England</hi> without it, for the preſervation of his life, not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtay any longer in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
