            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The iudgement of my labours relyeth

and taste, taste and disgest but with such contentment
that you may applaud the fruitfull operation. How it
will prooue I know not, but I hope pleasant in disges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
For howeuer the fruits of my toyle now rellish
after the long gathering, I dare protest the tree from
whence they were pluckt, came of a Royall stocke;
make therefore your seuerall choyces of the best, and
if you finde some more greene then others, impute it

               <l>And mak'st her know, that she is but a Worme.</l>
               <l>A Worme that hath her being from thy power,</l>
               <l>And must not dare but stoop when <hi>Ioue</hi> doth lower.</l>

And now thou frown'st, oh she doth quake for feare:</l>
               <l>Her hands are daily heaued to the skies,</l>
               <l>With impetrations, that thou would'st forbeare.</l>
               <l>See how trill teares distill from her moyst eies?</l>
               <l>How can a Mother choose, but euer weepe,</l>
               <l>When as her children loath their natiue bed?</l>
               <l>Her yong ones in her bosome will not sleepe,</l>
               <l>But to a forrayue fosterer are fled.</l>
               <l>Yet like a Mother she doth daily pray,</l>
               <l>Thou would'st not note such disobedience:</l>
               <l>But to be mercifull to them that stray,</l>
               <l>And in their losse to giue her patience.</l>
               <l>She weepes for losse of them which now are gon,</l>
               <l>Thinking thereby to shunne correction.</l>

But who knowes not thy power is euery where?</l>
               <l>In Cittie, Country, both on Land and Sea?</l>
               <l>Then do we think thou canst not touch vs there?</l>
               <l>Yes yes, tis too apparant euery day.</l>
               <l>But stay great glory of aeternitie,</l>
               <l>Wee doe confesse thy might almightie force,</l>
               <l>Be mercifull to vs in miserie,</l>
               <l>And for thy deare anoynted, take remorce.</l>
               <l>Smooth thy deepe furrowed front, shriu'led with ire:</l>
               <l>Open thine eares vnto our sad complaints:</l>
               <l>Let vs at last reioyce in our desire,</l>
               <l>And helpe weake London that now helples faints.</l>
               <l>For while thou frown'st, alas she feares to die:</l>
               <l>And but to thee she knowes not where to flie.</l>

Thou mad'st the sore; but who can giue the cure?</l>
               <l>Thou gau'st the blowe, but who can salue the wound?</l>

               <l>Thou mad'st the bruise, but who can make it sound?</l>

               <l>And breake thy rod which she hath felt too long.</l>
               <l>Then will her friends draw neere, and she shall see,</l>

For him she weepes, for IAMES his want she mornes:</l>
               <l>Want of his presence, that should guild her streetes</l>
               <l>For want of him, in passion she burnes,</l>
               <l>And from her residence all comfort fleetes.</l>
               <l>Thousands of treasure hath her bounty wasted</l>
               <l>In honour of her King to welcome him:</l>
               <l>But woe is she, that honour is not tasted,</l>
               <l>For royall IAMES on siluer <hi>Thames</hi> doth swim.</l>
               <l>The Water hath that glory, for he glides</l>

               <l>So well he knew that wofull London lou'd him.</l>
