            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N our firſt Lecture of <hi>Coſmography</hi> we
declared, what the Sphere is,</l>
            <l>What Heaven is,</l>
            <l>Of the Qualities of the Heavens,</l>
            <l>Of the Celeſtiall Region,</l>
            <l>That there are many Heavens or Orbes,</l>
            <l>Of the Firmament, or eight Heaven,</l>
            <l>Whether or no the Starres be infinite, and how the

That the Heavens are round, and that their motions
are the one within the other, from the Eaſt to the

            <p>In this Second Lecture, wee ſhall ſhew how that
there are two other Heavens, differing from the eight

               <head>That there are two other Heavens, differing from the eight
Heavens, proved in our firſt Lecture.</head>
               <p>UNtill the time of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> there were but eight
Heavens diſcovered, becauſe that then there
were but obſerved, but eight different motions in the
Celeſtiall Bodies, but when afterwards it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that the Starres had a different motion to that of
the world, it was expedient, not to give two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
motions to a ſimple Body (as the Heavens are) to
ſuppoſe a ninth Heaven, the which, as firſt moveable,
conveyed by its impetuous ſwiftneſſe all the others
with it. <hi>This was the opinion of Ptolomie; and ſince him
Thebit, Alphragan, Albategnius, and other excellent
Aſtronomers,</hi> and for the ſame reaſon (after that it
was obſerved that there were three different motions
in the Firmament) there was added a tenth Heaven,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114791:4"/>
which is the firſt moveable; it moves from Eaſt to
Weſt in 24 houres on the Poles of the World, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by its impetuous ſwiftneſſe all the other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Heavens with it, the which nevertheleſſe turnes
alwayes contrary to it, performing the courſe which is
proper, and naturall to them, from Weſt to Eaſt, on
the Poles of the Zodiaque, the which they ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
atchieve in diverſity of times. <hi>This is alſo alledged by
the learned King Alfonze, John of Lineris, George Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bachis,
John of Monte Region, and others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe ten Heavens (which have been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the diverſe motions of the Starres and Planets)
there is yet another, the higheſt and largeſt of all, the
which is unmoveable, and its in that Heaven in the
which God ſpreads the beames of his glory to his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved,
there is the eternall reſt of the happy, or as
the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Quod oculos non vidit, nec auris
audivit, nec in cor hominis aſcendit, quae preparavit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
iis qui diligunt illum,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen,
nor eare heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man,
the things which God hath prepared for them that love
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's named <hi>Coelum impereum,</hi> that is to ſay, of fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of its pureneſſe,</p>
               <p>But this Heaven being not knowne unto us, but by
divine Revelation, it behooves the Divines and not
the Aſtrologers to diſcourſe of it.</p>

               <head>The Orders of the Heavens or Orbes.</head>
               <p>IN times paſt there were divers opinions touching
the order and diſpoſition of the Heavens or Orbes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114791:5"/>
ſome placing the Sunne and the Moon above the other
Planets, as having authority over them, others as <hi>Plato,</hi>
aſſuring that the lights were the neareſt to the Earth,
that their influences might flow with more effect.
Some as <hi>Democritus,</hi> maintaining <hi>Mercury</hi> to bee the
higheſt elevated.</p>
               <p>But in this manner the order of the Heavens is by
us proved: Firſt, by the ſwiftneſſe or ſlowneſſe of the
motions, that is to ſay, that the Planet which is the
longeſt a finiſhing its courſe is of neceſſity the higheſt,
<hi>Saturne</hi> performes his in 30 yeares, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 12,
<hi>Mars</hi> in 2. the Sun in 365 dayes and 6 houres. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow, that they exceed
one another in height.</p>

father <hi>Adam,</hi> were yet alive, and that from his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

the Heavens, yet for the preſent he would not
have attained to the concavity of the eight Heaven,

diſtant the Starres are from us, That if a Cannon bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let

would it remaine more then 15 yeares before it could
arrive to the Earth.</p>
               <p>Now by the diſtance of the Heavens, as beforeſaid,
can be knowne the thickneſſe of each Orbe or Heaven,
and that by ſubſtracting the leſſer diſtance from the
greater following. As for Example, if three and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

foure halfe Diameters, the remainder will be one and
thirty halfe diameters, and of ſo many halfe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters

That the Earth is heavier then the Water, is proved
thus, That which cauſes another to yeeld in heavineſſe,
ought to be heavier then that other. But the Earth cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the water to yeeld in heavines, therfore it muſt needs
follow, that the Earth is heavier then the Water; this
is proved thus, when any Earth, or a Stone is caſt into a
Veſſell full of water, it deſcends to the bottome, and
cauſes the water to retire; and when the Earth or the
Stone, is firſt at the bottome of the veſſell, the water
being poured therein, it doth not cauſe them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
               <p>Againſt this there are oppoſed two conſiderable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;
the one is, that the water is ſeene to have
motion through the Earth, (which happens by the
Rain falling on the Earth, and its paſſing through it;)
Its Elementary place muſt needs then be under the
Earth towards which it alwaies runs, and this would
not happen, if it were not heavier then the Earth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection is, that ſeeing there are great
Gulphes of water found under the Earth (as appeares
by Wells and Fountaines) it therefore followes that
the elementary place of the water, ought to be under
the Earth; for the more water you draw out of a
Well, the more there enters into it, which would not
be (ſay they) if there were not great Gulphes of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under the ground, which are the ſourſes of
Springs.</p>
               <p>But theſe opinions being maintained by very feeble
grounds; we ſhall anſwer to the Firſt, That though the
name water is ſeene to deſcend through the Earth, it is
not becauſe its heavier, but onely that it fills the pores
and concavities thereof, which having done, we may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114791:8"/>
clearly ſee, it onely drives over the ſuperficies of the
Earth.</p>
               <p>The anſwer againſt the Second is, That the Perenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Springs doth not proceed from the great water-gulphs
under ground, foraſmuch that there hath no
ſuch thing beene knowne, but to the contrary, that all
the Fountains have their origin from the Sea, and
that the Earth is full of veines, which containe the
water ſent from the Sea, for to moiſten the Earth,
which otherwiſe could not produce its ſundry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties.
The opening of thoſe veines make a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
the Fountaines engender currents, many cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
make a River, many Rivers a Floud, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
it ſelfe in the Sea.</p>
               <p>Againſt this there is alſo objected that then the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
ought to be briniſh and Salt, as the Sea-water is;
and ſecondly, that the Springs being much higher
then the Sea, the motion ought to aſcend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is
contrary to the nature of water. The anſwer to it is,
that the ſaltneſſe of the water is purged by the long
and narrow traces which it makes within the ſtony
and ſandy places through which it paſſeth, which is
evident in the greateſt part of ſuch Fountaines as paſſe
by the Rocks, ſince they are much purer, and cleaner
then thoſe which run through fat and fenny grounds.</p>
               <p>For the Springs, it is not incongruous to ſay, that
the water aſcends from the Sea to them, becauſe its a
motion made by attraction.</p>

               <head>That the Earth is in the middle of the World.</head>
               <p>THE Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtarchus Samienus,</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Earth was not in the middle of the
World, but that the Sunne was in the middle, and
being there as unmovable, it gave light to all the
world: This Philoſophers eſteeming it to be a great
abſurdity, that the Earth which produceth an infinit
number of movable animalls, ſhould be unmovable
and that the cauſe ſhould be of a worſe condition,
then its effect: This opinion hath been ſince renewed
by <hi>Copernicus</hi> (an excellent Aſtronomer) who did ſtrive
to prove it in his revolutions.</p>
               <p>But the contrary is proved thus, The Stars (which
are in the Firmament) whether they be in the middle
of the Heaven towards the Eaſt, or towards the
Weſt, appeare alwayes of one and the ſelfe ſame big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which would not happen, if the earth were not
equally diſtant from it; for if the Earth were nearer
to the Firmament in one place then the other, it
would follow that from the part of the ſuperficies of
the Earth neareſt to the Firmament, the halfe of the
Heaven could not be ſeene, which is againſt the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> and of all the Philoſophers, who ſay,
that in what part ſoever of the Earth a man is, he
may ſee ſix ſignes of the Zodiacke to riſe, and ſix to
deſcend, ſo there be no hinderance, and thus alwayes
halfe of the Heaven is ſeene, and the other halfe
hidden.</p>
               <p>It is alſo proved thus, the further the Moone goes
from the Sunne, the more it augments its light to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114791:9"/>
our conſideration; therefore when its at the full, it is
at the furtheſt diſtance that poſſibly may be from the
Sunne; and ſo it muſt of neceſſity be on the Diameter
of the Heaven, and then the halfe of the Heaven will
be between the Sun and the Moone, when its at the
full.</p>
               <p>The ſame is proved alſo by the Ecilpſes of the
Moone; for when the Moon is eclipſed, halfe of the
Heaven is interpoſed between the Sunne and the
Moone, becauſe the Moone never eclipſes but in its
full; therefore if the earth were not interpoſed, there
would be no eclipſe, ſince by the interpoſition of the
Earth, the ſhadow is made; as alſo the Equinoxe would
not be throughout the whole world. The long Artificial
dayes would not equall the long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Artificiall nights, and
an infinite number of other abſurdities would follow;
and therefore we will conclude, that the Earth, as the
heavieſt element, hath beene placed in the lowermoſt
place, and the lowermoſt place of neceſſity muſt be
that which is the furtheſt from the Heavens, and the
place which is the furtheſt from the Heavens, cannot
but be the Center, therefore the Earth is in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
that is to ſay, in the middle of the Heavens, or of
the World.</p>

               <head>That the Earth is unmovable.</head>
               <p>THE Earth cannot have any motion, for if it
ſhould move, it muſt needs eitherbe out of its place,
or circularly on its Center: If it moves out of its place,
its motion muſt be either upwards or downwards,
downwards it cannot, becauſe its at the Center. It
cannot move upwards, becauſe its againſt the nature
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114791:10"/>
of heavy things, and then the proofs here before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
doe ſuffice; for it would elſe quit its Center,
and then the Starres would not alwayes appeare of
the ſelfe-ſame greatneſſe, which is abſurd; therefore if
it hath any motion, it muſt be circularly on its Center.</p>
               <p>Neither can its motion be circularly according to
<hi>Copernicus</hi> his opinion; becauſe that if it were ſo, it muſt
turne on the Axe of the World, or on ſome other.</p>
               <p>If it be on the Axe of the World, it muſt performe
its courſe in twenty foure houres, by reaſon of the firſt
movable, and then by ſuch a violent motion the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
would be ſhaken, the Birds, the Clouds, (and all
what is ſeene in the Aire) would alwayes incline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Weſt, as not being able to follow the ſwift
motion of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Nor can it move by any other way, be the motion
never ſo ſlow, becauſe that a Towne placed either more
or leſſe diſtant from the Pole, would then have divers
elevations, becauſe that the circumference (which the
motion of the earth would cauſe it to make about the
Pole) would not be parallell to it, which can never
happen; therefore its concluded that the earth is at the
Center without any motion.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Copernicus</hi> anſwers to theſe Reaſons, and inferres
on the motion of twenty foure houres, that though
its very ſwift; yet nevertheleſſe it hath its due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and may be reſembled to a reſt; as thoſe who
are in a Boat ſit at their eaſe, though the Boat ſwiftly
moves, which is alſo more evident in a Pale full of
water, which may be turned about in the Aire, foure
or five times without ſpilling a drop.</p>
               <p>Yet nevertheleſſe this anſwer which he holds forth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114791:10"/>
is to little purpoſe, ſince that if the earth ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
its courſe in twenty foure houres, and that
having eight thouſand leagues of circuit to accompliſh,
it muſt then make five or ſix leagues in a minute of an
houre; and if a Stone being caſt up into the Aire ſhould
remaine a minute of an houre in its aſcent or deſcent,
it would then fall five or ſix leagues beyond the place
from whence it was flung, which hath never been ſeen
nor heard of.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe he anſwers to this reaſon, and ſayes,
that the earth doth not onely turne, but the Aire alſo
with an equall ſwiftneſſe, which cauſes the earth, the
Man, the Aire, and the Stone to turne, all by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
ſwiftneſſe.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe this were; then there would happen
two inconveniencies which are againſt all experience;
The firſt is, that if a man ſhould ſhoot an arrow with
all his force towards the Eaſt, and contrary to the
motion of the Aire; and that the ſame man ſhould
ſhoot ſuch another arrow towards the Weſt (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the motion of the Aire) the arrow ſhot towards
the Weſt with the motion of the Air, will go much
ſwifter, for having the Aire to back it, then that ſhot
towards the Weſt for having the Aire againſt it, the
which contradicts to experience it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That thoſe things ſupported by the
Aire, the lighter they are, the further they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;
the heavier they are, the leſſe are they tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it muſt therefore follow, that if from the top of a
Tower, a Stone, and a Hat ſhould be flung, the Hat
would be carried a great deale further then the Stone,
which is alſo againſt experience.</p>

               <p>We will not trouble you with a further ſearch of

               <p>But in all Ages there have beene ſuch Critticks,
onely for to make themſelves famous, and to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114791:11"/>
there are ſo many diverſe opinions and beliefes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
which repugne directly againſt the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and againſt the Articles of our Faith, whereon
our Salvation is grounded.</p>
               <p>Let us conclude therefore this Lecture, with all due
acknowledgement and admiration, that God hath been
pleaſed in his infinit incomprehenſible bounty to create
for our uſe (who are but duſt and aſhes) theſe inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible
Heavens; as alſo the Sun, Moon, and Stars, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
unto them their ſeverall infallible courſes, and
admirable Order, for as he is above them all, he needs
them out. But we cannot ſubſiſt without them; our
eyes would not ſtand us in ſtead, unleſſe we doe make
uſe of them (as the two great lights of our bodies) to
contemplate and ſtudy the admirable order, motion,
and diſtance of the great lights of Heaven, which by
their marvellous operations and courſes, do manifeſt to
the good and bad (who doe equally enjoy the light of
the Sunne, Moon, and Stars) the glory, excellency,
power, and bottomleſſe riches of God, and who doe
confound thoſe wilfull blinde Atheiſts, more to be
abhorred (if poſſible could be) then the Devills, for
that Devills doe acknowledge God, though they doe
not believe in him.</p>
               <p>We know that ſome will be apt to alleadge that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
great and wiſe men have not believed that there
is a God. But thoſe were more then blinde, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved
of all their ſenſes, and far worſe then Swine,
who never looke up to the Oake whence the Akorns
fall downe to them.</p>
               <p>Certainly they were greater enemies then friends to
knowledge, being they ſtudied not to know the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114791:12"/>
of all, the Author of Immortality, and ſeeing
they denyed that point, its no wonder they denied the
Divine Providence. Neither was it an ill obſervation,
that all thoſe Philoſophers who were Atheiſts, had not
ſtudied the Art of <hi>Coſmography.</hi> But alas to what purpoſe
doth Hell, the Devills, and Furies ſerve, and againſt
whom doe they inrage, and where doe they diſcharge

to be ſuch, as that if a Canon bullet ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
two hundred leagues in one houre, it would be
more then fifteen yeares ere it could arrive to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the earth: Yet Lord, and mercifull Father,
thou haſt made all mens hearts (which by Sinne were
become hard as flint, and certainely heavier then a
Canon bullet) capable to aſcend unto thee in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114791:12"/>
by Faith; not onely ſeven and twenty millions
one hundred foure and thirty thouſand, and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
leagues as beforeſaid, but ſo much more higher,
as thou art above all thoſe Heavens.</p>
               <p>Continue this wonder of all wonders, and ſuffer
us ſo to advance in knowledge, that the more we
ſtudy and know, the more we may become capable to
be united unto thee.</p>
