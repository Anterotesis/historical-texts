            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

I ſhall onely ſpeak of that generall and horrible ſin of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and falſe accuſation.</p>
            <p>Lying was the firſt occaſion of all evill in the World, when the Devill perſwaded the Woman that they ſhould not dye. And as to mankinde, ſo it is a ſore judgement upon a Nation, when God ſuffers them to be carried away with the ſpirit of deluſion, with the making and loving of lyes. It hath been the opinion of ſome, that if lying were layd aſide but for one moneth, this Kingdoms peace (with Gods mercy) might be renewed, and if truth were once ſet forward, Peace would preſently meet and kiſſe it. And truly they do not ſpeak impertinently, for if diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be compared to a fire, then lying is that which blowes the coals, and makes up the blaze, and is the only practiſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54192:3"/>
of thoſe that thrive and grow fat by the ruine of others; that inſtead of quenching the fire, warm their hands at it, and ſay, <hi>A ha, I am warme, I have ſeene the deſired fire</hi>! Some Divines have diſtinguiſhed them into three kinds, A merry lye, an officious lye, a pernicious lye.</p>
            <p>A merry lye, is when we lye for our own or others pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime, without any other intention or harme; I can rebuke this in no better words than thoſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Abſtain from all appearance of evill</hi>; and with that of the Wiſeman, <hi>We muſt not offend, and ſay it was in ſport:</hi> And ſince God (with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut any diſtinction) hath threatned the deſtruction of all lyes, we muſt not allow our ſelves liberty in any.</p>
            <p>An officious lye, is when a man for the excuſe or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or commendation of his friends, ſhall exceed the bounds of truth. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſo curious in this point, That when he had ſpoken ſome words of his deceaſed friend, which might ſeem to be but an high expreſſion or rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call complement; he had ſaid, <hi>That his ſoul and his friends ſoul were but one ſoul, that his life was tedious to him after the death of his friend, becauſe he would not live by halfes; and yet for the ſame reaſon he feared to dye, leaſt in him his friend ſhould totally periſh.</hi> Yet afterwards in his book of Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, he recanted this ſpeech as too laviſh and affected. By this you ſee, what a lively and deligate feeling good men have of the leaſt over-laſhing in this kinde.</p>
            <p>A pernicious lye, is when a man out of malice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious intent, ſhall maintain a lye to the damage of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans honor, life, or fortune, and that ſometimes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with an oath. And as there is no ſin that ſtrikes ſo dangerouſly at God and men, and a mans own ſoul as a falſe oath in triall of truth; ſo of all ſins, it ſhould be leaſt ſuppoſed among men, no man being properly guilty of it, that did not forthwith turn into a devill; for how can he otherwiſe chuſe that adds perjury to lying, and like <hi>Judas</hi> kiſſes the holy Goſpel and betrayes it. Let all good men
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54192:3"/>
take adviſe by this, to ſet a door of ſtrength and cloſeneſſe before their lips, and let nothing but truth open them, and to be wary and circumſpect where they ſpeak every truth; for goodneſſe lies too open to treachery, becauſe as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no harm, ſo they ſuſpect none, he that loves truth, may fear falſhood, There may be falſe brethren that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Religion and diſcredit it. Amongſt many other properties of a Puritan, King <hi>James</hi> makes lying to be one, in his ſecond Booke called <hi>Baſilicon Doron,</hi> or the Kingly gift preſented and dedicated to his Son, as his laſt Will and Teſtament, in theſe words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take heed therefore my Son of theſe Puritans, the very peſts of the Church and Common-wealth, whom no deſerts can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige, neither oaths nor promiſes binde, breathing nothing but ſedition and calumnies, aſpiring without meaſure, rayling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, and making their own imaginations without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Word, the ſquare of their conſcience. I proteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great God (and ſince I am here as upon my laſt Will and Teſtament, it is no place for me to lye in) that you ſhall never finde among the Highlanders or border theeves greater ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and mor lyes and viler perjuries, than among theſe phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke ſpirits; and ſuffer not the principalls of them to brooke your land, if you liſt to ſit at reſt, except you would keep them for trying your patience, as</hi> Socrates <hi>did an evill wife.</hi> And in the Page immediately before, <hi>I was often calumniated in their popular ſermons, not for any vice or evill that was in me, but becauſe I was a King, which to them is the higheſt evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore if men would not have their Religion ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the way of truth to be evill ſpoken of, if they would be pure in heart, not pure by Art; if they would be thoſe that make godlineſſe their greateſt gaine, not that make a gaine of godlineſſe; then let them refrain lying as well as ſwearing.</p>
            <p>But if this lying ſhall reflict upon ſacred Majeſty, if they ſhall calumniate it in popular ſermons (as King
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54192:4"/>
               <hi>James</hi>) ſpeaks, and found it by experience) if they be ſo preſumptuous as to ſpeak evill of Dignities, then they may very well own the other part of St. <hi>Judes</hi> diſcription, and I farther referre them to the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. <hi>chap.</hi> 12 <hi>verſe,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though evill can have no good reaſon, yet it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whether lying be not the greateſt friend, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the beſt countenance and apology to ſwearing. If fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent lying had not begot a juſt incredulity, I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the word of an honeſt man might have paſſed for an oath. I ſpeak not this to the leaſt excuſe of ſwearing, but to the greater aggravation and damnation of lying, which yeelds to ſwearing even ſo much ſhelter and defence.</p>
            <p>To prove the malignity of this ſin to be the higher, you ſhall perceive that to promote any cauſe with lyes, argues want of faith, and confidence in God, want of civill faith and truſt in men, want of policy, and leaves a ſuſpition of guiltineſſe, and want of goodneſſe in the cauſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, want of faith in God, if they had any true affiance in the power and protection of God, if they did at all conſider that God hath wiſedom to inſtruct, and ſtrength and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to aſſiſt them, That he can turn round the counſells of men, and make <hi>Achitophel</hi> politick againſt himſelf: If they did ſeriouſly beleeve, that God can over-rule the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, and diſſipate the affections, and melt and amate the ſpirits of the ſtrongeſt oppoſers of the truth, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as pretend to it, that go to promote it by lyes and forgeries.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Next it betrayes a want of civill faith and truſt in men, if they did not ſuſpect men to be flagging from them, to be wavering and uncertain, if they were not afraid of their friends, they would never uſe ſuch unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy means to comfort and keep them up, <hi>fides fidem obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat,</hi> the way to make a man truſty, is to truſt him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men have taught others to deceive them, by being afraid to be deceived. <hi>Pavor aurilia formidat,</hi> Fear is affrighted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54192:4"/>
with her own ſupplies, and ſuſpects the very company that comes to help it: and they want the true ſtrength, that are faine to fortifie with lyes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It betrayes want of policy, for though lying for a while (like falſe ware) be better ſlee'kt, and gliſter more, yet truth wears it out.</p>
            <p>Although a lye may get ground at the firſt going out, yet truth will overtake it, even the dulleſt at laſt will find himſelfe to be deceived, and then men will think them moſt odious and deteſtable that have beguiled them.</p>
            <p>Though it may ſeem a trick of worldly policy to fetch in Proſolites, yet at length they gain this gift amongſt men to be miſtruſted when they deal plainly, and not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when they ſpeak truth, And ſo <hi>truth and honeſty prove the beſt policy.</hi> There is a great deale of ſlavery in a bad cauſe; it is a miſerable and wretched thing to lye and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thank, and crouch, and fawn upon every one, not to dare to offend any, and yet to ſuſpect all, that they will not be faithfull to them, that are themſelves unfaithfull: they fear men are falling off, and therofore they flye to this poore refuge to keep them together.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, lying leaves a ſuſpition and guiltineſſe and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the cauſe: I like the phancie of the Poet well, where he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yes, That lying and ſpreading of falſe alarums and rumors amongſt the vulgar, is a ſign of guiltineſſe.
<q>
                  <l>Criminibus terrere novis hinc ſpargere voces,</l>
                  <l>in vulgum ambiguas, &amp; quaerere conſcius arma.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>They make new treaſons, and ſpread falſe Alarums,</l>
                  <l>And when themſelves are guilty, take up Arms.</l>
               </q>
Lying argues weakneſſe in the cauſe, and in the perſon, and therefore every true ſouldier abhors it. Some give theſe two reaſons why the lye ſhould be ſo hatefull to a ſouldier. Firſt, becauſe it argues his cauſe to be ſuch as he ought not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54192:5"/>
to dare to dye in, and therefore he is fain to maintain it with lyes. Secondly, becauſe it ſhews him to be a coward, that he is afraid of men, and dares be only valiant and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous with God. Therefore let men thinke of lying as meanly as they will, let them invent it as readily, and ſet it out as plauſibly, and diſperſe it as licentiouſly as they pleaſe, yet there is a fearfull doom upon it, They ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, They ſhall be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt dogs, and murtherers, and idolaters, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. For <hi>without are dogs, and ſorcerers, whooremongers, and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lye.</hi> But if they ſhall plainly declare themſelves to have no feare of God before their eyes, and that wotldly reſpects onely move them, then let them conſider that they ſhall not be believed when they ſpeak truth: That <hi>Time</hi> is the wiſeſt of all and will diſcover them, and then they will be odious to them whom they have deluded, That falſhood may get ſtrength enough to ruine it ſelfe and others, but never long to flouriſh and eſtabliſh it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>That although lying may hold up the flagge and diſplay falſe colours for a while, yet <hi>Truth</hi> will have the victory.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Magna eſt veritas &amp; praevalebit.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>The cauſe thats prop't with lyes muſt ſurely fail,</l>
               <l>Strong is the <hi>Truth,</hi> at length it will prevail.</l>
