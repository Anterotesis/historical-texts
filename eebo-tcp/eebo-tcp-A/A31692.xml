            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHARACTER OF A Jacobite, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JAcobites</hi> in general are a ſort of Animals ſprung from the Corruption of King <hi>James</hi>'s Evil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and carry two ſhapes in one Body, like a <hi>Centaur,</hi> or the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Virgin with a Fiſh in her tail, half Proteſtant, half Papiſt. If they are of the <hi>Temporal Nobility,</hi> they believe the <hi>Glitter of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> to be only the Reflection of King <hi>James</hi>'s Favour, and that the Rays of their Grandeur cannot ſhine with that luſtre as they ought, unleſs like Glow-worms Tails they may be permitted to gliſter in the dark of Popery and Tyranny. They are the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> of Arbitrary Power and Magnificence, which Tyrants erect to be the <hi>Atlaſſes</hi> and <hi>Coloſſus</hi>'s to ſupport Exorbitant Dominion. And many times they owe their Advancement to a Serraband well danc'd, the activity of their Bodies, or the allurements of lovely Features: And ſometimes they are pickt out to combat (with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours flying) all Authority of Law and Juſtice. They love <hi>Grandeur,</hi> but little of Nobility, which would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98711:3"/>
teach 'em to aſcend to Greatneſs by other ſteps than that of their Countries Ruine. They eſpouſe the late King's Intereſt, as many men, when they grow Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, marry their <hi>Old Miſtreſſes.</hi> But the ſupport and the Intereſt being feeble alike, 'tis only to make the World believe the Conjunction at laſt to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. Or elſe they think it ill manners to deſert the late King in his <hi>Spiritual Amours</hi> with the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe they know ſo well the proneneſs of their own Inclinations to their carnal Devotions: Thô on the other ſide, 'tis ſtrange they ſhould have ſo little Eſteem for the Proteſtant Religion, becauſe the Papiſts tell 'em, it came out of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight's <hi>Cod piece.</hi> But certainly theſe <hi>Noble Jacobites</hi> are the oddeſt Courtiers in the World to worſhip a <hi>ſetting Sun</hi>; and that in his Winter Quarter too, when he can never expect to riſe again, but he muſt be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Miſts and Foggs, and Storms and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, which his warmth will ne're be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Noble Jacobites</hi> are a ſort of ſoaring Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, that ſin againſt all the Proſpects of Sence and Reaſon in the Earth. Were they not banded about the Eyes like ſo many Sons of <hi>Venus,</hi> they who ſit upon the Pinacle of the Kingdom, and have the opportunity of diſtant views, could not but with a clearer ſight behold the ſinking Eſtate of the rotten Intereſt which they labour to ſupport: But the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Jacobites</hi> are more ſublime in their Politicks than others; they can ſee into a Mill-ſtone not only as far, but farther than other Men; and their exalted and piercing Imaginations make ſuch holes in Futurity, that they can ſee through it as through a Cullender. Then taking their magnifying Glaſſes, they fancy they ſee their <hi>Idol</hi> King <hi>James</hi> far more pompous than
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98711:3"/>
ever; and conceit themſelves <hi>pearching</hi> about his Throne, full plum'd with all the Glories and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due to their pretended Merits. And thus, they that <hi>flatter'd</hi> him out of his Throne, no leſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly <hi>flatter</hi> themſelves with Felicities of their own erecting, by reſtoring him again. All this while, purſuing that abominated Maxim of the Kings Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and conſequently their own, being ſeparate from that of the Subject; they tell the World that they have nothing to do with the People, and thereby teach the People not to have any thing to do with them. The late King conferr'd Titles upon 'em, but their Titles afford 'em no Honour; for they no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are inveſted with their Honour, but they debaſe it with pick-thank Sycophantrie, and Slaviſh Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: And ſway'd by the powerful Inſtigations of a puſillanimous Ambition to be great only in ſhew, betray at once their <hi>King, Themſelves, and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi>: for inſtead of adviſing the King as they ought, they give him ſuch Counſel as they believe him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to, and determine of his <hi>Welfare by his Deſire</hi>; which is a kind of ſetting the <hi>Sun</hi> by the <hi>Dyal</hi>; ſo that the King never knows what time of day 'tis among his Subjects. Therefore it is that ſet before theſe <hi>Lordly Jacobites,</hi> the ſight of a guilt Coach and ſix Horſes, or a round Bag of <hi>Louy dors,</hi> they are eaſily perſwaded to ſacrifice the Welfare of a whole Nation to their own Eaſe and Plenty.</p>
            <p>In ſhort then, a true <hi>Jacobite Lord</hi> is a true <hi>Jeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> that is to ſay, an Abandon'd Slave to Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Tyranny; a <hi>Sejanus</hi> to his own Vices, who will humour a <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to the diſpeopling whole Provinces, rather than loſe the ſordid Advantage of inſulting over his Inferiours. <hi>A Jacobite of the firſt magnitude,</hi> is one that will take no warning by the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98711:4"/>
fatal Precipices, from which he has ſeen ſo many of his own degree fall headlong. The Deſtinies of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Strafford</hi> are ſo far cancell'd in his thoughts, that they prevail with him no more than the Fable of <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> It cannot be thought that all who were enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the late King, were of Ancient Deſcent, from Anceſtor to Anceſtor, which is the Reaſon why they cannot be altogether blam'd, if like the <hi>Statua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Cat, that would be ſtarting after Mice after ſhe was exalted to Humane Shape, they purſue thoſe baſer Ends which true <hi>Nobility</hi> ſcorns: However we are glad the Moral only can be fixed upon the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi> Race. 'Tis true, that ſome of theſe <hi>Noble Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> lay claim to Conſcience, and upon that ſcore pretend whole Ounces of Loyalty and Fidelity to King <hi>James:</hi> But 'tis a Character appropriated to theſe fort of <hi>Jacobites,</hi> that they <hi>never think</hi>; elſe they could never be ſo much miſtaken in the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Loyalty: For how can ever they be ſaid to be Loyal to a Perſon that never was true to himſelf? Nor is it leſs abſurd to believe they may be more Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to any one particular Man, than to the Body of their Countrey in General: For by this means they fall under the ſevere Character of preferring the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a ſingle Perſon before the common Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. And then their Loyalty ſoon diſcovers it ſelf to be no more than a <hi>factious Adherence</hi> to a diſcard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prince, in hopes to wreſt from the Kingdom by his Advancement, the diſappointed ſatisfaction of their Ambitious Ends, which otherwiſe they give over for loſt.</p>
            <p>But what Virtues as well as Vices will not Self-<hi>Intereſt</hi> infuſe into a Noble Mind? Of a ſudden theſe <hi>Noble Jacobites</hi> are become the moſt Charitable and Believing Perſons in the World: They believe that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98711:4"/>
King <hi>James</hi> has forgot to forfeit his <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Proteſtations</hi>; they believe that he believes it is for no By-ends of theirs, but purely out of Pity and Compaſſion that they ſeek his Return: They believe they ſhall never be <hi>Cloſetted</hi> more, but that Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Antipathy, the <hi>Maſs</hi> and <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> will kiſs each other upon his coming back, in two Chappels under the ſame Roof: They believe that his <hi>Italian</hi> Wife will Forgive 'em, his Prieſts will Pardon 'em, and that He himſelf will acquit, exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, and diſcharge 'em for aſſiſting to lift him out of his Kingdom: They believe that young <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi> was truly begot, and truly born at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and that he is lawful Heir to the Crown: They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>French</hi> King, like a Moſt Chriſtian Prince, will foregoe all his private Contracts, and never ſue neither him nor them with Fire and Sword for all the vaſt Summs he has lent upon the Mortgage of of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Dominions. All this, and more than this, too long to be enumerated, the <hi>Noble Jacobites</hi> believe, to that degree, that if their Faith were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways employ'd, there would not be an unruly Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, this is their unhappy Misfortune, that all this extraordinary <hi>Belief</hi> of theirs ſerves only to betray their Weakneſs, if it may not rather be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a kind of Frenzy; as if their living formerly ſo near the Rays of a Crown had tann'd and <hi>Blacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor'd</hi> their very Underſtandings; for it is not ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to think theſe <hi>Exalted Jacobites</hi> believe theſe Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, as being in a Station to know better things by woful Experience; but it ſhews them how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever given over to a fond or wilful Credulity, <hi>which is a Vice of Judgment,</hi> a feebleneſs like that of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, to be twice deluded; ſo far from the Prudence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98711:5"/>
of <hi>True Nobility,</hi> that we ſeldom find an <hi>Irrational Mouſe</hi> that having once ſcap'd the Bait, will come near the Trap a ſecond time. But there is this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between true <hi>Engliſh Nobility</hi> and Jacobite <hi>Frenchify'd Nobility,</hi> that the one ſtudies the Welfare, the other the Ruine of the People; one loves his Countrey, the other hates it; the one walks by the Rules of Honour and Juſtice, the other values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Quirks of Policy; the one would be deem'd Wiſe, the other Crafty; the one would be eſteem'd a good Common-wealths Man, the other a Cunning Politician; the one aſſerts the Nations an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Freedom, the other would be a eringing <hi>French Baſhaw</hi> rather than a <hi>Peer of England</hi>; the one would <hi>redeem,</hi> the other <hi>ſell</hi> the Kingdom. This ſort of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobite</hi> Grandees, are the <hi>Hedge-Sparrows</hi> that hatch <hi>King Lewis</hi>'s Cockatrice Eggs, in hopes that when <hi>England</hi> is become tributary to <hi>France,</hi> they ſhall be rewarded with whole <hi>Heſperian Gardens,</hi> full of Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Pippins</hi>: Not conſidering that Princes moſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arbitrary Power, deteſt however a low-ſpirited Propenſity to Slavery, and that all the Reward which the Senate received for their ſervile Submiſſion to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> was only to be derided by that ſcornful Tyrant with the frequently repeated Sarcaſm, of <hi>O ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines ad ſervitutem Paratos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, ſuch <hi>Noble-men</hi> as theſe are like <hi>Barren Mountains,</hi> that bear neither Plants nor Graſs for Publick Uſe; they touch the Skie, but are unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Earth, and when they come to add the Unjuſtice of their Actions to the Worthleſneſs of their Perſons, their Exaltation becomes the Curſe of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98711:5"/>To come now to the <hi>Jacobite Clergy,</hi> (for may all thoſe of the true <hi>Sacred Order</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> long enjoy the Honour and Veneration due to their Function!) I ſay then, to come to the <hi>Jacobite Clergy,</hi> they are ſuch a <hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> ſo envenom'd with the poyſonous Pamphlets of the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> that you would ſwear they made it their buſineſs to ſwallow thoſe weekly Paſquills; and that the ſayings of that ſame Charming Author being digeſted in their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, has turn'd to real Nouriſhment: They are a numerous Gang, and haunt <hi>S</hi>—'s <hi>Coffee-Houſe</hi> in ſhoals, where they ſit <hi>Croaking</hi> like Froggs in <hi>March</hi> againſt the Government. If they are of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> the only Reaſon to be given for it is this, that they are ſo butcherly inveterate againſt the <hi>Sichemite</hi> Whiggs, upon pretence that they have raviſhed their Siſter <hi>Dina,</hi> the Church. They cannot Study for hearkening after News; and in Parliament time the Court of <hi>Requeſts</hi> is ſo crouded with 'em, as if the <hi>Popes Conſiſtory</hi> ſate in the <hi>Painted Chamber.</hi> If they can but get to be a <hi>Lords Chaplain,</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently whip on a <hi>long Scarf</hi>; and then <hi>Lucifer</hi> was not prouder when he exalted himſelf upon the Mount of the Congregation in <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> And yet theſe Scarfs are eaſily come by; for a Man that ſhowed the Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet-Play of the <hi>Creation of the World</hi> but t'other day, may lay Title to one, if he can but ſlubber over a few Prayers in a Ladies Family. They are a ſort of <hi>meer Divinity</hi> Meteors, that run whiſking up and down to miſguide the wandring People, and vent their undigeſted Conceits, as the winde of their airy Fancies agitates 'em. You cannot perceive 'em to be Cripples, and yet there is not one of 'em but halts moſt conſpicuouſly between God and <hi>Baal.</hi> They
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98711:6"/>
pretend to be Proteſtants, but with an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Inclination to Popery, that they may have two Strings to their Bow, and be ready upon the Return of their Idol, to fall down, and worſhip his Will and Pleaſure. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe the ſeverity of her Pennances, her work were done; for thô they are paſſionately for whipping of others, they do not much care to whip themſelves. They are the <hi>Pompeys</hi> and <hi>Caeſars</hi> of Divinity, that can endure neither Equals nor Superiours, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> ſhould get a Living among them, if it were in their Power, they would ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice him to <hi>Molock</hi>; for they look upon the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as <hi>Forraigners</hi> that would eat the Bread out of their Mouths. They ſay that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well to throw the three Diſſenting Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fiery Furnace, becauſe they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Church of <hi>Babilon</hi> by <hi>Law eſtabliſh'd.</hi> Had they liv'd in the time of the Ten Perſecutions, what clean work would they have made with thoſe <hi>Nonconforming Chriſtians!</hi> Or if any thing had ſav'd a Remnant, it would have been their Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience.</hi> They idolize King <hi>James</hi> as the Heathen did their falſe Gods, firſt make the Idol, and then worſhip it. Tyranny's the <hi>Moloch</hi> to which they would offer their own Poſterity; and their own Native Countrey the Place which they would make their Valley <hi>Gehinnon.</hi> They pretend to be true <hi>Sons of the Church,</hi> but uſe her no better than a Step Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to offer the Price of her Preſervation for the Redemption of her profeſs'd Enemy. And ſo doing, while they pretend to avoid their being Traytors to a pretended Prince, they betray not only the People which they miſlead, but themſelves; as if the Church
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98711:6"/>
would ever be able to give them ſuck, when they have aſſiſted her Capital Foe to cut off her Nipples. Whence it is apparent, that they were never well read either in Scripture or <hi>Matchiavel,</hi> thô it ſhews as truly, that their Inclinations are more for the worſt of Politicks than the <hi>beſt of Divinity.</hi> All this while, how they ſhould be ſo charitable to the misfortunes of King <hi>James,</hi> is a wonder, having ſo little Charity one for another, there being nothing more frequent among them than Envy, Paſſion, Repining, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting of each other: And yet they are ſo inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to believe that their King <hi>James</hi> does not ſee through them, (unleſs becauſe they have made him their Idol, they think he has Eyes and ſees not,) and that he knows he muſt ſatisfie the particular ends and aims of every individual Perſon, or elſe there will never be peace in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

            <p>They would be the beſt Marks-men in the World, if they could but bring a <hi>great Gun</hi> as well as a <hi>little Text</hi> to bear upon any Subject whatever they aim at. To prove Epiſcopacy, they baulk all other Texts, and take this, <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſav'd?</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Greek word, <hi>Sirs,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Lords,</hi> therefore they were Biſhops that were ſpoken to.

A third to diſprove <hi>Non-Reſidence,</hi> finds out <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Abraham begat Iſaac</hi>: For that if <hi>Abraham</hi> had not reſided with <hi>Sarah,</hi> he had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Another undertakes to prove the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> from <hi>Job</hi> ch. 36. <hi>v.</hi> 21.

               <hi>It is not lawful to do evil, that good may come of it.</hi> Another to prove the Excellency of Monarchy, picks out <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>In thoſe days there was no King in Iſrael:</hi> for had there been a King in <hi>Iſrael, Micah</hi> had never made a Graven Image, nor had the <hi>Levites</hi> Concubine ever been raviſhe'd. And thus their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are a ſort of Lampoons upon Scripture, while they make uſe of it only to put their <hi>Shamins</hi> and <hi>Tricks</hi> upon the People, and expoſe it dreſs'd up in wreſted Interpretation, to the Diverſion of the worſt of <hi>Libertines.</hi> They pray to Heaven as if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there were no God; or ſought at leaſt to make him the Author of their miſchievous Contrivances. They pray for King <hi>James,</hi> ſpend all their moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Ejaculations in their Cups, and over their Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, for King <hi>James,</hi> as if they thought that God were a Favourer of Popery, Tyranny, Oppreſſion and Slavery; and yet would have us think they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be the God of Mercy, Truth and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. But whatever they would have us believe, 'tis but an ill ſign of the good Opinion they have of it, to invoke <hi>Divine Favour</hi> upon the <hi>Enemy</hi> of their Religion, their Laws, and Liberties.</p>
            <p>While they had the Power, the Hook of recalling the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſt</hi> would not take; but now they would recall the diſappointed Angler, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther throw themſelves into a precarious Toleration of a Popiſh Tyrant, than abandon Dominion over their Proteſtant Brethren. And thus they ſet up King <hi>James</hi> like the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> thinking to be ſafe by looking upon him, when ſtung to inevltable Death by the <hi>fiery Serpents</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Look into their Converſations, and you ſhall find 'em Wine bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

to exceſs, and frequently remov'd from the Coffee-houſe to the Tavern, to carry on the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sheriffs and Parliament-men. And 'tis a ſhrewd ſign they are no leſs addicted to the Smicket, becauſe they love ſo much as they do to ſee Religion with her Heels upward. When they get into their Pulpits, they make 'em roar like ſo many <hi>Matraſſes</hi> of <hi>Aurum Fulminans,</hi> under the Guard of an ignorant Chymiſt; you'd think they had been learning of the Fire-chawing Mountebanks to carry burning Coals betwixt their Teeth, their Breath is ſo hot: They fling about their Bombs and their Granado's againſt the Phanaticks, as if they were <hi>ſtorming a Conventicle</hi>; every word is a <hi>Snap-dragon</hi> or a Flaſh of Lightning, enough to ſinge all the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiggs in the Congregation. Strange, that ſuch fiery men as theſe ſhould be for <hi>Paſſive Obedience!</hi> But that's a Virtue which they only Preach to others, never practice themſelves: They make uſe of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> as Houſe breakers do of the little Engines called <hi>Betties,</hi> to force open the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all that will not bow to their <hi>Baal,</hi> and rob 'em of their Underſtandings. They are ſo far from <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> themſelves, that never was any Hornets Neſt in ſuch an uproar as were they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when their warm Livings were in danger. The Scripture ſays, <hi>Obedience</hi> is better than <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but they cry <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is better than <hi>Obedience</hi>; for if all their Oppoſers were ſacrific'd, there would be no need of Obedience: Touch but their Coppy-holds, and then inſtead of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> they cry <hi>'Tis better to Obey God than Man</hi>; and let their King <hi>de Jure</hi> make uſe of all his Right and Title to Command 'em, he ſhall as ſoon Command a

            </p>
            <p>They believe all the reſt of the Nation but themſelves to be Crows, and come with their <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Garden</hi> Divinity to prove the difference between a King <hi>de Jure</hi> and a King <hi>de Facto</hi>; as a King <hi>de Jure</hi> that has forfeited his Right by Breach of Law, Breach of Faith, Breach of Oaths, Breach of all things by which a Sovereign claims his Sovereignty, were any more than a vain Terror of their own erecting. Heaven pull'd him down, and they would heave him up again. Now whether the <hi>Ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> or theſe <hi>Jacobite Levites</hi> were the wiſeſt, muſt be left to Judgment; for the one truſted to a <hi>Gooſe</hi> to preſerve their Copitol, the other to a <hi>Cock-match</hi> for the Reſtoration of their Exile: Indeed the Cock is the more Martial Bird<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Gooſe was the more Fortunate: But they thought to have been Crowing again upon their own Dung-hills, and therefore they preferr'd a <hi>Cock-Match Plot</hi> before any other <hi>Plot.</hi> They had cry'd down the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and the <hi>Preſbyterian Plot</hi> was of King <hi>James</hi>'s own making, and fell with himſelf; but they thought
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98711:8"/>
might be <hi>Ten</hi> to <hi>One</hi> laid upon the Succeſs of a <hi>Cock-Match Plot.</hi> However it were, by this you may diſcover the right Genius of a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> and a true <hi>Jacobite,</hi> the one was for Diſpeopling the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the other for making a Cock-Pit of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>I would fain exempt 'em from having any hand in the <hi>Miſcarriage of our Fleet,</hi> a fatal Blow to the Ancient Honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, which all <hi>Europe</hi> but their Confederate the <hi>French</hi> King ſtill laments: Since they that would betray their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and their <hi>Deliverer,</hi> would betray their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; for <hi>Judas</hi> might perhaps not know how great a Perſonage our Saviour was, but no Man can be exempted from not believing in his Countrey.</p>
            <p>The other ſort of <hi>Levitical Jacobites,</hi> as they are more highly dignify'd, and farther ſtricken in Years, carry themſelves with more Reſervedneſs, and as they have gain'd a greater Reputation, ſo they are more dangerous to the Government; yet they walk upon the ſame grounds, and move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame the Principles with the <hi>Inferiour Crew,</hi> who receive their Inſtructions from them; and when they are <hi>fully Leſſon'd,</hi> like the little Spaniels that fall a <hi>yelping</hi> when the great Maſtiff opens, follow the ſcent with a full Cry.</p>
            <p>Theſe Men being generally of <hi>low Extraction,</hi> cannot forgoe thoſe mean and narrow Notions which their ſordid Education infus'd into their <hi>Boyiſh Years,</hi> which makes them admire Advancement as poor Folks adore <hi>gaudy Cloaths</hi>; and having once
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98711:9"/>
taſted the ſweets of Preferment, they ſo abhor their former Condition, that they place all their Felicity in this World. They ſtudy the Humour of the Court more than Women do the Faſhions, and if they can but gain the <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Favour,</hi> they deal by the <hi>King</hi> as the <hi>Filou</hi> did by the Countrey-Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in <hi>Bartholomew-Fair,</hi> that tickl'd his Ears 'till he pick'd his Pocket: Only it ſhews ſomewhat ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhould rejoyce at the Miſsfortune of our Fleet, and that King <hi>William</hi>'s Victories in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould ſadden their Hearts.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Sermons</hi> are all Calculated for the Court Meridian, the continual Infuſiory of Servitude and Wretchedneſs into all their Hearers: You might have known what a Clock 'twas at <hi>White-Hall</hi> by the Chiming of their Pulpits. They took their Text from the Minutes of the <hi>Private Cabal,</hi> and then fiting a Scripture ſhooe to it, ſent it abroad Apparel'd in <hi>A Sermon Preach'd before the KING,</hi> By the Reverend ſuch a One, <hi>D.D.</hi> If the King wanted one to tell the People, <hi>That though he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what was contrary to the Law of God and Nature, the Subject was nevertheleſs bound to Obey with an abſolute Paſſive Obedience</hi>; there was a <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> ready to bawl it out in his Pulpit. If the King wanted another to prove by Scripture, <hi>That he was not bound to Obſerve the Laws of the Realm concerning the Subjects Liberties and Rights, but that his Royal Will and Command in impoſing Loans and Taxes without Conſent in Parliament, oblig'd the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Conſcience upon Pain of Eternal Damnation; Manwaring,</hi> in his way to the two Fat Livings of <hi>St. Giles in the Fields</hi> and <hi>Stamford Rivers</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98711:9"/>
does it to a Hair. Theſe ſort of <hi>dignify'd Jacobites</hi> deriv'd their Appellation from <hi>Jacobus Primus,</hi> who afraid of his Engliſh <hi>Nobility,</hi> caw'd the moſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his dignify'd Clergy, with his new invented Maxim of <hi>No Biſhop, No King,</hi> for which they gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd him with the Title of a <hi>ſecond Solomon</hi>; could they have found a hole in the Scripture to have made that Golden Maxim Canonical, they had done it; but the Scripture had been ſo often Tranſlated before, that they durſt not attempt it: However, they went ſo far, as to make Epiſcopacy <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi> which was the ſame thing as to range it coequal with Kingſhip: And they were ſo much his Slaves, that they did all they could to make out the Truth of his Apothegm, and their gratitude for his Invention, by making all along the Scripture the Common Voucher and Aſſerter of Worldly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks.</p>
            <p>When theſe ſort of <hi>Dignify'd Jacobites</hi> come to be advanc'd near the Perſon of a Prince, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make uſe of their Dignity to Correct him when he goes aſtray, nor to tell him of his Faults, but to ſooth him up in his extravagant Courſes: They tell him, <hi>That Kings breath not the ſame Breath with other Men</hi>; that they are not of the Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> but the Sons of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> &amp;c. deſcended from Heaven, Booted and Spurr'd, to ride their Vaſſals the People. Moreover, That they are no more oblig'd by any Coronation-Oaths, than Lovers by their Vows to their Miſtreſſes, but may diſpenſe with the Eſtabliſh'd Conſtitutions of the Kingdom at their own Will and Pleaſure, and that they are accountable to none but God. For theſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98711:10"/>
good Services, and many more of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they prevail with the Prince to enlarge their Encroachments upon the Civil Juriſdiction, and having gotten an Unjuſtifiable Power into their Hands, they call it the <hi>Church,</hi> no leſs Sacred than the <hi>Ark,</hi> have a care how you touch it: if the Lord do not ſmite the bold Adventurer, they will. A Popiſh Prince may do any thing but abridge them of this Power of theirs; if he does that, he is an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> he has invaded their Properties, and muſt be turn'd out of the Temple with a wither'd Arm; and then — 'tis lawful to ſend for a Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to help 'em, 'tis lawful to devolve the Government into his Hands, and humbly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore him to take <hi>Care</hi> of their <hi>Ark.</hi> But no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are their Properties ſafe, and King <hi>William</hi> by the General Conſent of the Nation advanc'd, in his <hi>own Right</hi> to a Vacant Throne, but they are offended at his Proteſtant Zeal, tell him they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſent for him to make him their Sovereign, but their <hi>Journey-man</hi> only; call him King <hi>de Facto,</hi> ſlight his Protection, and rather than acknowledge their Deliverer, would put on their <hi>Philiſtine</hi> Yoak again.</p>
            <p>Theſe are a moody ſullen ſort of <hi>Jacobites,</hi> that would make all the World believe there are but ſo many knowing, Pious Men in the Nation; and by an affected Oſtentation of Conſcience, would riggle themſelves into the Honour of having all the Nation dance after their Pipes. They know the ill Conſequences of their Example to the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and yet perſevere in it; but they imagine the Humour will take, and therefore they preſume
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98711:10"/>
upon it. Nor can they be inſenſible, that King <hi>James</hi> takes his Opportunity, and makes his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their Bigottry. And yet ſo highly are theſe <hi>Dignify'd Jacobites</hi> conceited of themſelves, that though the Righteouſneſs of ten Men would have ſav'd <hi>Sodom,</hi> they believe the ſtreight-lac'd <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> of half the number enough to ruine <hi>England:</hi> At leaſt they would have the Publick Good and Safety depend upon the overweening Reaſon of a few Obſtinate Men.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſort of <hi>Jacobites</hi> cannot but know the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of great Examples,</p>

            </q>
            <p>From whence we muſt conclude they are buoy'd up, and encourag'd by the more Politick <hi>Jacobites,</hi> on purpoſe to promote their Darling, King <hi>James</hi>'s Intereſt. Thus with the Sorcereſs <hi>Circe,</hi> theſe dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſee better things, but follow the worſe — Not out of any Love to King <hi>James,</hi> for that's impoſſible, but out of a Picque to King <hi>William:</hi> Otherwiſe 'tis certain, that never any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity taught them to pretend a Reluctancy of Conſcience that threatens the Fate of a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Nor can Piety grounded upon Error excuſe any Man for deſigning Miſchief to his Countrey: Or ſuppoſing a Man's Piety were ſeemingly well intended, neither will the Goodneſs of a Mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98711:11"/>
excuſe the Scandal and Contagion of his Example.</p>
            <p>Others there are who are more Plyable and Complaiſam, who being unwilling to come within the Laſh of Acts of Parliament, think it their ſafeſt way to take the Oaths both to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> But theſe Men have a Trick to ſave themſelves, they are <hi>Sharpers</hi> at Equivocation, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known among Proteſtants before, and are able to teach the Jeſuites themſelves to ſing a Note above <hi>Ela:</hi> Thus the Chancellor of a certain Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in this Kingdom, being ask'd how he could take the Oaths to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and act for King <hi>James? Oh!</hi> cry'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He, <hi>though I took the Oaths, I never ſwallow'd 'em.</hi> And thus you ſee how near to a Reconciliation the <hi>Jacobites</hi> and <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are, they are link'd together againſt King <hi>William,</hi> like the wicked againſt <hi>David:</hi> But the <hi>Jacobites</hi> are ſo ſhort-ſighted, as not to ſee that were the t'others ends accompliſh'd, 'tis a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſo ill order'd, it would never hold together; their Darling's good Fortune would ſoon unlooſe the Knot, and then they muſt come over the Stick for the Pope, or elſe not a bit of the Cruſt.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of theſe <hi>Jacobite</hi> Dons were of King <hi>James</hi>'s Promotion, or by his Intereſt when Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and fearing therefore to be laid aſide, they would make the World believe that the <hi>Church of</hi> England will fall, ſhould they be diſcarded; when others more Dignify'd, more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious, more Religious, more Fore-ſeeing, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend no ſuch Danger. They would make the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98711:11"/>
World believe, the Reformation of the Clergy to be the Downfall of the Church.</p>
            <p>Hence ſuch a Buſtle, ſuch a Clutter, ſuch a Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; hence ſo much Canvaſſing at Elections, ſuch bauling out <hi>St. George for the Church,</hi> as if all lay at ſtake when nothing is in danger. Some of theſe great <hi>Jacobites</hi> conform on purpoſe to do Miſchief, and they are the moſt dangerous; for they are able to give bad Counſel unſuſpected, and their Friendſhip betrays, like Fire that embraces to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume. Some of theſe there are who are eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to ſend about their <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Letters to their Inferiour Clergy, upon their Filial Obedience to give their Voices for ſuch a One, as being pitch'd upon by the Grand Cabal of the County for his Affection and Fidelity to the <hi>Church.</hi> And many times the ſame Pretence deludes others that mean better, with the ſame Hazard of their Reputation: As if it could be any Honour to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to imitate the paltry Shifts and wicked Politicks of <hi>Brent</hi> and <hi>Graham.</hi> But a true <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Some Sober, ſome more Looſe, ſome moſt Extravagant. The Sober part are wheedl'd in by the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the <hi>Churches Danger:</hi> Men otherwiſe of Honeſt Morals, but <hi>Credulous Bigotts,</hi> that pin their Faith without Examination upon their <hi>Inſtructors Sleeve,</hi> and believe that all they ſay is <hi>Goſpel,</hi> thô they ſhould tell 'em that <hi>High-gate</hi> Hill was made of March-pane.

Others Ambitious of a Seat in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or a Magiſtracy in the County, though they ſee through 'em, and have perhaps as little Religion as themſelves; however they cloſe with 'em, and applaud their Zeal for the <hi>Church,</hi> to ſave the Expences of Canvaſſing, or Feaſting the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But having ſtudied well neither the Laws of God nor their Countrey, they render themſelves ſo obnoxious to a more happy Revolution, that nothing can ſave 'em but an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Oblivion.</hi>

Serving-man; and their <hi>Loyalty</hi> is like a Woman's Affection, generally too much or too little. And for their particular <hi>Loyalty</hi> to King <hi>James,</hi> 'tis like an <hi>Ill Habit,</hi> which when a Man has once got, he can never leave it: However it ſerves 'em to make a noiſe with at a Tavern, for want of other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; or elſe like a cold Neats-Tongue, or a Diſh of Anchovies to reliſh a Glaſs of Wine.</p>
            <p>They have a pretended Kindneſs indeed for the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> and the Liturgy <hi>of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; but they are more for <hi>ſet forms</hi> of Oaths than <hi>ſet forms</hi> of Prayer, and preferr a brisk <hi>God damm 'em,</hi> before a ſneaking <hi>Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> They know ſo little the true value of the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Land, that they were ready at any time to part with thoſe <hi>Jewels</hi> for the <hi>Barley-Corns</hi> of <hi>Court-Favour.</hi> Tyranny therefore huggs 'em, and makes the ſame uſe of 'em as <hi>Tamerlane</hi> did of his Captive <hi>Bajazet,</hi> to get up and ride the People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>looſer ſort</hi> are Perſons wholly addicted to their Pleaſure, that meaſure their Felicity by their <hi>Paſſions.</hi> Theſe are Men that live moſt at eaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Oppreſſions of Arbitrary Power, like thoſe ſort of Animals call'd <hi>Hog-lice,</hi> that breed and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply under the weight of great Timber-loggs. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtrictneſs of Government they are like Fiſh out of the Water; in the looſeneſs of abſolute Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, they are as merry as Summer Swallows in a Chimney. Having therefore experienc'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsneſs of King <hi>Jame</hi>'s Reign, like Ivy to a Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they cling to his Miſgovernment, as being that which allow'd 'em the full ſwinge of their Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98711:13"/>
and rather chooſe with Swine to <hi>wallow in the Mire</hi> of Voluptuous and Libertine Bondage, than breath the <hi>Air of Freedom,</hi> within the limited Impalements of the Law. They live like Brutes, by Sence and Appetite, not Reaſon; and having no more Underſtanding than Dorr-flies, buzz about the Dazle of a forfeited Crown, to their own Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>They talk of Religion, as they that never <hi>travel'd</hi> talk of Forreign Countries. However, if you ask em of what Religion they are, they will tell you they are <hi>Proteſtants of the Church of England</hi>; if you miſdoubt the Truth of it, they preſently confirm it with a <hi>God Damm 'em but they are.</hi> Ask 'em why then they ſide with King <hi>James</hi> who is a Papiſt: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> quo' they, <hi>the Papiſts are better than the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians:</hi> — Ask em how ſo, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> cry they, <hi>the Presbyterians are worſe than the Papiſts.</hi> Knock with your middle finger knuckle againſt the middle of their Foreheads, and you may hear the Concavity ſound like an empty Cask. If it were ſearch'd into, there would be nothing found in it but the Lees of <hi>Forty One Clamour</hi> half dryed up to nothing.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, <hi>what they think is Vanity, what they ſpeak is Falſe, whatever they approve is Bad, and whatever they diſapprove is Good.</hi>

            <p>All theſe are of the Society of <hi>Jacobites,</hi> that long for King <hi>James,</hi> as Women with Child long for Coals and foul Tobacco-Pipes. Theſe were the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> and <hi>Free-holders</hi> of all the Towns and Counties in <hi>England,</hi> that had as many Chriſtian and Sirnames as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> has Titles, to clap to a <hi>Loyal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs</hi>; and then the <hi>quaint Piece</hi> of <hi>Eloquence</hi> was carry'd to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> with a Label of Subſcriptions that look'd like a Cluſter of Bees before the Mouth of a Hive. And thus the Cheaters cheated themſelves: They were Rampant then, they are now Couchant, and therefore they Pray for the loſt Protector of their Vices; as Women Mourn at Funerals for the Dead, 'till they make themſelves Drunk for Sorrow: When all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides rejects 'em, they think King <hi>James</hi> will receive 'em to his Mercy; as if he needed more Curſes than he has already to blaſt his Proſperity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98711:14"/>Popery indeed is a Common-ſewer for any Vicious Excrements; but theſe ſcoundrel <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites</hi> are ſo very wicked, that the Prieſts are afraid to let 'em dy <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>In ſhort, they are the Dreggs and <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of Humane Society, fit for nothing but to be thrown upon the Dung hill: Or if they may be ſaid to ſerve for any thing, 'tis only to provoke the Anger of Heaven, and to be the Combuſtiole Stuff to kindle the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conflagration.</p>
            <p>As for the Females, not to ſay any thing of the Modeſt and the Vertuous, who, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, the weakneſs of their Sex, may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily led away by their <hi>Jacobite</hi> Confeſſors, the Torrents of whoſe thundring Eloquence they are not able to withſtand; the wonder is, how theſe <hi>Jacobite</hi> Infuſions come to operate ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally upon the Common Harlots and Miſſes of the Town, ſince it cannot be preſum'd that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98711:14"/>
they have any ſuch familiar Converſe with the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Order. But ſo it is, that all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burb <hi>Rahabs,</hi> and <hi>Daughters of Joy</hi> within the Walls, have univerſally eſpous'd the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Intereſt. 'Tis true, there was a Lady ſaid, That ſhe had rather be Miſtris to a King, than Wife to the beſt Noble Man in <hi>England.</hi> And perhaps the ſame Ambition poſſeſſes our Engliſh <hi>Lais's,</hi> that ſince they cannot all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to embrace the Royal Perſon, they will hugg his Intereſt. They know that King <hi>James</hi>'s Cauſe is the Whore of <hi>Babel</hi>'s Cauſe; and then the Whore of <hi>Babel</hi>'s Cause muſt needs be the Cauſe of all the Whores in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They know Idolatry to be a kind of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fornication; and therefore 'tis no wonder that Carnal Harlots ſhould adhere to Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Whore-mongers. Beſides, they are for a General Toleration; and for that Reaſon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thoſe by whoſe means at length they hope to have the Penal Laws and Statutes taken off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98711:15"/>Others there are who think it a great piece of Ingratitude to forſake a Religion which has been ſo kind as to Canonize ſo many of their Sex, and gives 'em ſo eaſie an Abſolution from their pleaſing Tranſgreſſions. For a Female <hi>Jacobite,</hi> cares not that her Conſcience ſhould be heavier than her Fan; and therefore chooſes that Profeſſion that layes the leaſt weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p>Yet ſome there are who think theſe Gyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies to be miſtaken in their Politicks, for that thô the Roman Curtiſans had ſome Reaſon for what they did, in ſtickling and caballing as they did to keep the <hi>Sodomite</hi> Cardinals from ſitting in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair; yet our Strumpets are the greateſt Fools in Nature, for ſtriving to bring in the <hi>Italian</hi> Abby-Lubbers into <hi>England</hi> to ſpoil their Vocation: They little dream what terrible Rates will be ſet upon Night-Walkers and what an Exceſſive Exciſe will be put upon Chamber-practice.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98711:15"/>Nevertheleſs, There are ſome who pretend to have a deep inſight into ſucceeding Times, comfort themſelves in the Hopes they have in their little <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> who was <hi>what d'ye call'd it into the World</hi> at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; that when he comes to reign over 'em, he will advance 'em into a Corporation of themſelves, make Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues and Speeches to 'em, and dignifie 'em with the Title of his <hi>Commilitones,</hi> and Fellow Subjects, and be no leſs kind to them than that famous Emperour was endearing to the Curteſans of <hi>Rome.</hi> Expectations of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and grounds ſufficient for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trulls and Miſſes to plead ſo hard for an Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate. But ſuch Female Advocates as theſe for the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Cauſe do it more harm than good; ſuch <hi>Syrens</hi> as they being lookt upon to be no leſs clapt in their Underſtandings than their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. There is no fear of ſuch <hi>Amazon</hi>'s as theſe, notwithſtanding their Attire for the Head, ſo like the Helmets of <hi>Tomyris</hi> and <hi>Pentheſilea</hi>; and therefore we leave 'em to their ſeveral Cures, and their Dyet Drinks of Sarſaperill and Guaiacum.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98711:16"/>However, By ſuch a ſeparation as this of the Goats from the Sheep, it may be eaſie to give a true Judgment of the <hi>Jacobite Cauſe</hi> by the Favourers of it, and to ſee what ſort of Perſons they are that ſeek for ſhelter under the Wings of Tyranny and Popery.
