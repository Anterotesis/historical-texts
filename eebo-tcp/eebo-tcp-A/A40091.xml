            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THat the Religion of which our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is the Founder, is most admirably fitted for the making Mankind as happy as they are capable of being in <hi>this</hi> world, as well as in the world <hi>to come,</hi> is a no less certainly <hi>true</hi> than <hi>common</hi> observation: As also that it tends as much to the happiness of <hi>Societies</hi> and <hi>Bodies Politick,</hi> as of <hi>single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> And were I to give a Demonstration of <hi>this,</hi> I should need to do more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to your consideration, this one short Verse, <hi>Honour all Men, Love the Brotherhood, Fear God, Honour the King.</hi> If Christians <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally</hi> practised the four duties, which our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95578:4"/>
Blessed Lord, by his Apostle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> here enjoyneth; if they gave all Men the respect due to <hi>Human Nature,</hi> to the <hi>Relations they stand in to each other,</hi> and the <hi>Rank and Circumstances God hath placed them in;</hi> if they <hi>loved one another as Brethren,</hi> the Children of the same Father, indued with one common Nature, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by one Saviour; if they <hi>Revered the Divine Majesty,</hi> and dreaded the wilful Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of any one of his Laws; and <hi>under</hi> God <hi>Honoured their Kings,</hi> as his immediate Representatives and Vicegerents: If (I say) Christians were generally as willing to put <hi>these</hi> Duties in <hi>Practice,</hi> as they are to <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> their Obligation to them, I need not tell you, that to live in <hi>Christendom,</hi> would be, to live in a <hi>Heaven upon Earth;</hi> and in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in a short time, the <hi>whole World</hi> would be taken into <hi>Christendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of <hi>this Text,</hi> I shall <hi>begin</hi> with the duties of <hi>Fearing God</hi> and <hi>Honouring the King;</hi> and spend the <hi>rest of my Discourse</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Loving the Brotherhood:</hi> each of which three Arguments doth well suit with the occasion of <hi>this Meeting,</hi> but more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95578:4"/>
In the Prosecution of these <hi>Words, Fear God' Honour the King,</hi> I will endeavour to shew these <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> What it is to <hi>Fear God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What to <hi>Honour the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there is a <hi>necessary Connexion</hi> between <hi>these two, Fearing God,</hi> and <hi>Honouring the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We will shew (and that very <hi>brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)</hi> what is implyed in <hi>this</hi> Precept, <hi>Fear God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>Fear God</hi> is to be possessed with an holy <hi>Awe and Reverence of his Infinite Majesty, of his Glorions Attributes and Perfections.</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of His irresistible Boundless <hi>Power,</hi> of his Absolute <hi>Dominion</hi> over <hi>us,</hi> and the <hi>whole World,</hi> of His infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledg,</hi> of His unspotted <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> of His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted <hi>Justice,</hi> and His inexhaustible <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> The <hi>Fear of God</hi> doth <hi>presuppose</hi> an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty belief and acknowledgment, that all these Perfections are in the Divine Nature, and implyeth in the <hi>first</hi> Place, the being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Awe and Reverence towards God, upon the <hi>account</hi> of all these. He who <hi>understandingly</hi> believes the Existence of God, must necessarily believe Him to be a Being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95578:5"/>
Absolutely Perfect, and Consequently must believe that He hath all <hi>these</hi> Perfections: Of <hi>this</hi> Natural Light assures men, no less than Divine Revelation. And therefore the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,</hi> who were hearty Asserters of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which the <hi>Epicuraeans</hi> were <hi>not,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, and with great reason affirms) have abundantly Preached <hi>this</hi> Doctrine, as well as the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> concerning <hi>God.</hi> And <hi>he,</hi> I say, that <hi>Fears God,</hi> doth <hi>so</hi> believe <hi>this</hi> Doctrine, hath so lively and vigorous a Sense of the Truth thereof, as to have an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Awe and Dread of the Divine Majesty upon his Spirit, upon the <hi>account</hi> of the foresaid Perfections of His Nature: Each of which <hi>singly</hi> and much more <hi>altogether,</hi> do make Him an Object of the Greatest Reverence, Awe and Fear; and each of them doth <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> attract Fear from him who <hi>Considers</hi> it.</p>
            <p>You may Object, that the <hi>last</hi> of these Perfections, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine <hi>Goodness,</hi> doth not seem to be attractive of <hi>Fear,</hi> but of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, That it is no <hi>less</hi> attractive of <hi>Fear,</hi> than of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude:</hi> Not of a <hi>Slavish</hi> but of a <hi>Fillial</hi> Fear, which is <hi>founded</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95578:5"/>
on Love and Gratitude, and necessarily <hi>results</hi> from them. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea. ch. 3. 5.</hi> praedicts concerning the <hi>Children of Israel,</hi> that <hi>They shall fear the Lord, and his</hi> Goodness, <hi>in the latter days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Fear of God</hi> implyeth also the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing</hi> of this <hi>inward</hi> Fear and Reverence in our <hi>Outward Conversations,</hi> in all the <hi>Actions of our Lives.</hi> And it is impossible, where there is an holy Awe of God in the <hi>Heart,</hi> but it must express it self in the <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, This is, in the <hi>general,</hi> the true Character of the man that <hi>Feareth God;</hi> He is one <hi>who escheweth Evil.</hi> It was part of <hi>Job's</hi> Character, that <hi>He feared God, and eschewed Evil;</hi> which are two Phrases to express the same thing; and so are <hi>departing from evil</hi> and <hi>fearing God,</hi> Prov. 3. 7. <hi>Fear the Lord and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that <hi>Fearetb God</hi> is one, that though he <hi>may</hi> happen to <hi>transgress</hi> a Law of God before he is <hi>aware,</hi> and <hi>may</hi> be <hi>surprized</hi> into a sin, yet dares not sin <hi>deliberately,</hi> nor <hi>allow</hi> himself in the <hi>doing</hi> of any thing which God hath <hi>forbidden,</hi> nor in the <hi>neglecting</hi> of any thing God hath <hi>commanded.</hi> And therefore he endeavours sincerely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint himself with his <hi>whole Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95578:6"/>
He is one who dreads more to offend the <hi>great God,</hi> than to provoke the <hi>greatest of Men:</hi> As knowing that these have done their <hi>worst,</hi> when they have killed the <hi>Body;</hi> whereas <hi>Almighty God</hi> is able to <hi>destroy both Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Hell.</hi> Which is our <hi>Saviours</hi> Motive to the making of God the object of our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Fear. <hi>Mat</hi> 10. 28. The Man that <hi>feareth God</hi> is so affected with <hi>those words,</hi> as to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably</hi> most afraid of the evil of <hi>Sin.</hi>

            <p>And, no longer to insist upon <hi>this</hi> Mans Character, He who <hi>Fears God doth exercise himself</hi> (with the Blessed Apostle) <hi>to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Conscience void of Offence, both towards God and towards Men:</hi> And <hi>this is his rejoycing, the Testimony of his Conscience, that in simplici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y and Godly sincerity, not by fleshly Wisdom, but by the grace of God, he hath his Conversation in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I proceed to shew what it is to <hi>Honour the King. This</hi> implieth these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Revering of Him as <hi>Gods Vicegerent,</hi> as His <hi>immediate Representative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Kings are called <hi>the Ministers of God. He is the Minister of God to thee for good.</hi> Rom. 13. 4.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95578:6"/>
The <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> in the same Chapter, are said to be <hi>ordained of God. v. 1. 2. There is no Power but of God, the Powers that be are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God: whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God;</hi> for which reason (as it follows) <hi>They that resist, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to themselves Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Kings are said to <hi>Reign by God,</hi> or by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Commission they receive from <hi>Him: By me Kings Reign, and Princes decree Justice; by me Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Earth.</hi> Prov. 8. 15. That is, by God <hi>immediately Kings</hi> Reign, and <hi>Inferiour Magistrates</hi> by God <hi>mediately,</hi> as receiving their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions immediately from <hi>the King,</hi> who is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by God to give them.</p>
            <p>Again Kings are called the <hi>Anotnted of God;</hi> even <hi>Cyrus,</hi> though a <hi>Heathen Prince,</hi> is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Thus saith the Lord to</hi> Cyrus <hi>his Anointed,</hi> Isaiah 45. 1.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, God hath put his <hi>own Name</hi> upon them: <hi>I have said ye are Gods. Thou shalt not revile the Gods, nor Curse.</hi> (or speak evil of) <hi>the Ruler of thy People.</hi> Exod. 22. 28.</p>
            <p>Now this being so, in the <hi>Honouring of the King,</hi> is manifestly implied, the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95578:7"/>
Him as <hi>Gods Vicegerent</hi> and <hi>Representative,</hi> as the Person whom he hath Commissionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Rule under Him. <hi>This</hi> is to <hi>Honour the King,</hi> which a Man may be <hi>short</hi> of doing, and yet have <hi>Reverence</hi> for his <hi>Person:</hi> For <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Reverence</hi> is due to <hi>all</hi> Men. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour all Men,</hi> saith the Apostle before my <hi>Text;</hi> But to Reverence the <hi>King,</hi> under the notion of <hi>Gods Minister, Gods Deputy</hi> and <hi>Vicegerent, this</hi> (I say) is to <hi>Honour the King.</hi> This is to Honour Him <hi>as</hi> a King; and therefore <hi>he</hi> who honours him <hi>not</hi> under <hi>this</hi> notion, though he may honour that Person <hi>who is the</hi> King, he doth not honour the <hi>King:</hi> or (which is the same thing) he gives him not <hi>that Honour</hi> that is due to the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In <hi>Honouring the King</hi> is implyed, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing</hi> the Reverence we bear to him, as God's Vicegerent, by yielding Obedience to his Laws, from a Principle of <hi>Conscience.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Honour we express to his <hi>Person,</hi> that is not accompanied with the <hi>Observance of his Laws</hi> is insignificant; Nay 'tis a perfect <hi>Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery</hi> of him. And <hi>our</hi> King may say what <hi>our</hi> and <hi>His</hi> Great Master did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 46. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say;</hi> This is shameful Hypocrisy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95578:7"/>
And as without <hi>Obedience,</hi> so without Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from a Principle of <hi>Conscience</hi> too, our <hi>Honouring the King</hi> will fall far short of our Duty, and be far from speaking us <hi>truly Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To obey the Kings Laws, merely for fear of the <hi>Penalties</hi> annexed to them, is not Loyalty: 'Tis neither <hi>Christian,</hi> nor <hi>true</hi> Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty. This is not <hi>Christian</hi> Loyalty: For the Apostle hath told us, that <hi>We must needs be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</hi> Rom. 13. 5. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of Man,</hi> or to every Ordinance of <hi>Man,</hi> which doth not contradict any Ordinance of <hi>God:</hi> And, God be thanked, no People in the World have <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Laws and Ordinances, than those of <hi>our</hi> King are. But now, <hi>How</hi> doth the Apostle say, we must <hi>submit to every Ordinance of Man?</hi> it follows, <hi>for the Lords sake; whether it be to the King as Supreme; or unto Governours as unto them that are sent by him,</hi> &amp;c. Now to submit for the <hi>Lords sake,</hi> and to submit for <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake,</hi> are the self <hi>same</hi> thing; for the <hi>Lord alone</hi> can <hi>immediately</hi> bind the Conscience, and the <hi>King</hi> binds the Conscience by his Laws, as 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95578:8"/>
the Great God hath obliged us, upon pain of damnation, to observe them. That is, all <hi>such</hi> Laws (as I now said) as are not contrary to his <hi>own:</hi> For as to all such as <hi>are</hi> contrary to them, we must reply as the <hi>same</hi> Apostle did, <hi>VVhether it be righteous in the sight of God, to hearken unto men more than unto God, judg ye.</hi> Acts 4. 19. But, God be praised, <hi>VVe</hi> have not any occasion to use <hi>these</hi> words to <hi>our</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we are <hi>so</hi> to obey the King, as not only <hi>not to disobey</hi> God in Obeying <hi>him,</hi> but likewise <hi>so</hi> as to <hi>Obey</hi> God in obeying <hi>him.</hi> And <hi>he</hi> obeyeth <hi>God</hi> in obeying the <hi>King,</hi> who obeyeth him, as God<hi>'s immediate Representative:</hi> And <hi>thus</hi> to do (as hath been shewed) is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him <hi>as</hi> a King. And therefore <hi>not</hi> so to do, as it is inconsistent with <hi>Christian,</hi> so also with <hi>true</hi> Loyalty. But to obey him from mere <hi>Fear of Punishment,</hi> is, to give the King such <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> as the poor <hi>Indians</hi> give to the Devil <hi>Worship;</hi> It is to obey him only as one who hath gotten us under his <hi>Power,</hi> and who will have <hi>his Will</hi> upon us, whether <hi>we</hi> will or no. Thus we would obey the <hi>Great Turk,</hi> were we his Vassals, or any <hi>Usurping Tyrant;</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95578:8"/>
consequently, to be subject to our Lawful King, from the mere Principle of <hi>Fear,</hi> is no <hi>Loyalty at all.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The like is to be said of Obeying him merely for our own <hi>temporal Interest,</hi> for the making our selves <hi>Rich</hi> and Great under him, or for the bettering of our Fortunes. All Kings have ever had too many <hi>such</hi> Loyal Subjects, who, whilst Loyalty serves <hi>their</hi> turns, set up for Mighty Royalists, but when nothing more is to be gotten by it, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when any considerable <hi>danger</hi> attends it, <hi>shake hands</hi> with their Loyalty, and will by no means be <hi>held</hi> to their Allegeance, by the mere Sense of their <hi>Duty;</hi> nor by the most Sacred <hi>Oaths,</hi> again and again repeated. That Blessed Martyr King <hi>Charles the First,</hi> had wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience of <hi>such</hi> Loyal Subjects, and so hath our <hi>Present</hi> Gracious Soveraign had too. When a King is in prosperous Circumstances, and able to reward plentifully whatsoever Services are done him, there needs nothing but an eager <hi>desire</hi> of Wealth, or Honour, or <hi>both,</hi> to excite to the making a Mighty Shew of Loyalty. But if he chance to be so Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, as that <hi>more</hi> is to be hoped for by 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95578:9"/>
               <hi>deserting</hi> his Interest than <hi>cleaving</hi> to it, <hi>there</hi> is the Tryal of true Loyalty. But, if this Tryal happen (as God grant it may <hi>never</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>us</hi> again) that Subject who is indued with <hi>this</hi> Principle, will be stript stark Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of <hi>all his Enjoyments,</hi> and part with <hi>his Heart-Blood</hi> to boot, rather than <hi>forsake</hi> or <hi>prove false</hi> to <hi>his Prince.</hi> And Abundance of Brave Instances of <hi>such</hi> a Loyalty, God be thanked, <hi>We</hi> have known.</p>
            <p>But he who will be Loyal no longer than he hath a Motive from <hi>Worldly Interest</hi> so to be, is far from being Obedient to the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in our <hi>Text,</hi> of <hi>Honouring the King:</hi> And consequently, is a mere <hi>Pretender</hi> to Loyalty, let him seem to value himself never so much upon it. He may be rewarded by the <hi>King,</hi> who knows not <hi>breats,</hi> or <hi>inward</hi> Principles, as a Loyal Subject, but he must expect no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the <hi>King of Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I come to shew, that there is a <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Connexion</hi> between these Two, <hi>Fearing God</hi> and <hi>Honouring the King.</hi> We find <hi>else where</hi> likewise <hi>these two</hi> joyned together, <hi>viz.</hi> by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 24. 21. <hi>My Son fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95578:9"/>
               <hi>given to change;</hi> And it follows; <hi>For their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity shall rise suddainly, and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</hi> Or what ruin attends them, both from God and the King. And what hath (by the way) been more observed, than the fulfilling of this Threatning upon Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious People, and Traiterous Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors?</p>
            <p>Now there is very great reason, why these two Precepts should go hand in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> Because there is a <hi>necessary Connexion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duties enjoyned in them, and <hi>that</hi> a <hi>Mutual Connexion</hi> too. So that he cannot <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the King</hi> that <hi>Fears not</hi> God; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, he cannot <hi>Fear God,</hi> who <hi>Honours not the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He who <hi>Fears not God</hi> cannot <hi>Honour the King.</hi> I have shewn that to Honour the King as <hi>such,</hi> is to Honour him as God's Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative; But how can <hi>he</hi> Honour the <hi>King</hi> as Representating <hi>God</hi> in his Kingdom, who hath no due Reverence for <hi>God Himself?</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain you heard, that to <hi>Honour the King,</hi> is to express our Reverence by submitting to his Government, and observing his Laws from a Principle of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and for <hi>God's sake.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95578:10"/>
But how can he who <hi>Fears not God</hi> thus sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and be obedient to the <hi>King?</hi> Who can expect, <hi>that he</hi> should obey the <hi>Kings</hi> Laws, because <hi>God'</hi> hath commanded him, who makes no Conscience of living in disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Gods own</hi> Laws? A man that is so void of the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> as to live in the plain Breach of his Holy Commandments, will make no bones, of breaking the <hi>Kings</hi> Laws, when he thinks he may do it <hi>safely,</hi> and it makes for his <hi>Interest.</hi> This is so evident as to need no more words.</p>
            <p>He again that <hi>Honours not the King</hi> cannot be said to <hi>Fear God.</hi> For as the Apostle faith, <hi>He that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him. And, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f we love not our Brother whom we have seen, how can we love God, whom we have not seen?</hi> so he who <hi>Honoureth not the King</hi> who Reigneth <hi>by God,</hi> and hath his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>from</hi> Him, doth not Honour or Fear <hi>Him</hi> by whom he Reigneth, and who hath given him his Authority. He who revereth not the Divine Authority which displayeth it self in Gods <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> will not revere it in <hi>God Himself.</hi> And the like is to be said, as to <hi>Obedience to the Kings Laws,</hi> he who makes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95578:10"/>
not Conscience of obeying <hi>these,</hi> supposing them not contrary to the Laws of God, will not be obedient to <hi>Gods own</hi> Laws; Because it is a great Law of <hi>God,</hi> that we should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey <hi>such</hi> Laws of our Kings.</p>
            <p>To make a short Application of <hi>this past</hi> Discourse; As we would have our Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Loyalty believed to be syncere, let us give the World a demonstration thereof, by our <hi>Fearing of God.</hi> If we be Prophane and Wicked, though we may do some <hi>Externally</hi> Loyal Actions, and may be in <hi>some</hi> Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces what the <hi>World</hi> calls Loyal, yet 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest from what hath been said, that we are devoid of the <hi>true</hi> Principle of Loyalty, and may no more be called <hi>Loyal</hi> Men, than, in regard of our doing some Externally <hi>pious</hi> Actions, we may be called <hi>Godly</hi> men.</p>
            <p>Besides can People who live in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Transgression of the <hi>Kings</hi> Laws, be said to be Loyal men? But if we are Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and Wicked, if we stick not at profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Name of the Great God by <hi>Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> or can give our selves leave to be <hi>Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Drinkers,</hi> or to commit <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> or the <hi>like,</hi> we break our <hi>Kings</hi> Laws, as well as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95578:11"/>
               <hi>Gods.</hi> Even <hi>nine</hi> Commandments of the <hi>ten</hi> are incorporated into the Laws of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and so, no doubt, would the <hi>tenth</hi> have been too, but that the Sin of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sin of the <hi>heart,</hi> falls not within the reach of Human Cognizance. Pretend we therefore to <hi>Honour the King</hi> as much as we please, if we live not <hi>Sober, Righteous and Godly Lives,</hi> we are insyncere in such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. The Loyalty we brag of lyes but in a <hi>few</hi> Instances, and in <hi>these</hi> (I need not mind you again) we are not <hi>truly</hi> Loyal, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so from the <hi>true Principle:</hi> And therefore our Loyalty is by no means <hi>such</hi> as his <hi>Majesty</hi> can securely <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>confide</hi> in. King <hi>David</hi> was very sensible, that those who <hi>Fear not God,</hi> are <hi>not</hi> to be trusted as Faithful Subjects: For he saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 5. &amp;c. <hi>A froward heart shall depart from me, I will not know a wicked Person. Who so privily slandereth his Neighbour, bim will I cut off; Him that hath a high look and a proud heart, will not I suffer. Mine Eyes shall be upon the Faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me. He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me,</hi> &amp;c. For God's sake, what Security can we give of our faithful Adherence to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95578:11"/>
               <hi>God's Vicegerent</hi> in all his Circumstances, if we are false and perfidious towards <hi>God</hi> Himself, and live in the Breach of that Solemn Vow, we made in Baptism, and renew from time to time in the Lord's Supper? <hi>viz. To for sake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this wicked World, with all the Sinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the Flesh, so as not to follow, or be led by them.</hi> What Security can <hi>he</hi> give, that the Oath of Allegeance shall bind him fast, who makes nothing of breaking so much stronger a Cord?</p>
            <p>And therefore, as we would have all to conclude, that we <hi>Honour the King,</hi> let all be satisfyed by our Lives and Conversations, that we <hi>Fear God:</hi> And let us Abominate such Shameful Hypocrisy, as to pretend to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the King,</hi> whilst we don't <hi>Fear God;</hi> or to <hi>Fear God,</hi> whilst we <hi>Honour not the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so much for these <hi>two</hi> Precepts, <hi>Fear God, Honour the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now go back to <hi>that</hi> which <hi>praecedes</hi> these, <hi>viz. Love the Brotherhood;</hi> or <hi>Love the Brethrem.</hi> Now Men are our <hi>Brethren,</hi> either in a more <hi>large</hi> or <hi>strict</hi> Sense. In the <hi>most</hi> large Sense
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95578:12"/>
of <hi>all,</hi> Men of all <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> even <hi>Turks, Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> are our <hi>Brethren.</hi> That is, as we have all one God for our Father. <hi>Have we not all one Father, hath not one God Created us?</hi> saith the Prophet. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 10. And all Men are Brethren, as <hi>they</hi> proceed from one Stock, and have one <hi>Common-Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a more <hi>strict</hi> sence, all <hi>Christians</hi> are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: All that prosess Faith in Christ; and are Members of the Catholick Church, <hi>These</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> calls <hi>the Brethren.</hi> And all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a <hi>Particular</hi> Church, are Brethren in a stricter sense than <hi>that;</hi> and in a stricter sense than <hi>this</hi> (to descend no lower) those Christians are called Brethren, whose places of <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Habitation</hi> are so near together, as to stand in need of one anothers more <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> Assistance; and to be combined in <hi>all</hi> the <hi>same</hi> interests. For instance, those of the same <hi>Town, City</hi> or <hi>County.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, though by the <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> which in <hi>this</hi> place we are required to <hi>Love,</hi> beonly to be understood <hi>Christians;</hi> because <hi>Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> is here distinguisht from <hi>all Men; Honour all Men, Love the Brotherhood:</hi> Yet nothing is more evident from the Praecepts of our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95578:12"/>
Saviour and His Holy Apostles, than that 'tis our duty to <hi>love,</hi> that is, to be <hi>concerned for the Welfare and Happiness</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception: And 'tis <hi>as</hi> evident, that we are obliged to love our <hi>Fellow-Christians</hi> in an higher degree than the rest of the World; and that, according as Christians are more or less <hi>like to Christ,</hi> as also according to the more or fewer <hi>Relations</hi> they stand in to us, 'tis no <hi>less</hi> evident, they ought to be sharers in the <hi>degrees</hi> of our <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>what</hi> Duty is so often inculcated, so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously urged, so passionately pressed, by our Blessed Lord and his Apostles, as <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Loving each other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Lord</hi> hath told us, That <hi>a new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath given us, That we love one another, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as He hath loved us:</hi> That is, at <hi>least,</hi> that we love all <hi>Universally,</hi> as <hi>He</hi> did, and that in such a <hi>degree</hi> as to <hi>tast Death,</hi> the most ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious and torturing <hi>Death, for every Man.</hi> And he makes <hi>this</hi> the great Mark and Character of His true <hi>Disciples. By this shall all Men know that ye are my Disciples, if you have love one to another.</hi> And so desirous was He, that they should not be defective in his Grace
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95578:13"/>
of <hi>Love,</hi> that, among all the excellent Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions He put up for them, when He was upon leaving the World, <hi>John 17th. this</hi> is the only Grace He <hi>particularly</hi> prays for in their behalf. <hi>v. 21st.</hi> He prays, <hi>That they may be one, even as He and his Father are one. That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee:</hi> That they may be United in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> have <hi>one Heart</hi> and <hi>one Soul.</hi> And the reason for which he desires <hi>this,</hi> doth mightily recommend <hi>this</hi> Grace, <hi>That they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so may be one in us, that the World may believe that thou hast sent me.</hi> In which words is implied, that <hi>Christians loving one another,</hi> would be a great Conviction to the World, of the truth and excellency of the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>And so it was in the <hi>first Ages</hi> of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; when as <hi>Tertullian</hi> reporteth, <hi>it</hi> was a common saying among the <hi>Pagans, Ecce quam se diligunt Christiani! Behold how these Christians love one another!</hi> Though almost <hi>ever since</hi> the <hi>three</hi> first Centuries, to our horrible reproach be it <hi>spoken,</hi> we have given them cause to cry out, <hi>Ecce quàm se odio prosequuntur Christiani! Behold how these Christians hate one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

But to proceed, our Lord<hi>'s Beloved Disciple</hi> thought he could never speak highly enough, of this Grace of <hi>Love:</hi> For he makes it the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>God himself.</hi> He tells us, <hi>That Love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. And we know,</hi> saith he, <hi>that we are passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren.</hi> And that, <hi>He that loveth not his Brother abideth in Death;</hi> Or, he is a <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wretch,</hi> and that, <hi>He who hateth his Brother is a Murtherer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is St. <hi>Paul</hi> wanting in pressing this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Love. Owe,</hi> saith he, <hi>no Man any thing but to love one another: For he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the Law:</hi> Or, this is that <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the Law which Christ requires. And he shews in the <hi>following</hi> words, that the whole <hi>second Table</hi> is herein implyed. And (in short) the same Apostle preferreth <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to all Accomplishments and Endowments whatsoever: To the <hi>speaking with the Tongues of Men and Angels:</hi> To gifts of <hi>Prophecy</hi> and Understanding all <hi>Mysteries:</hi> To all <hi>Faith,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Faith of <hi>Miracles,</hi> nay to the greatest <hi>Zeal,</hi> such a <hi>Zeal</hi> as will carry a Man, evcn to the <hi>Stake.</hi> And he sheweth that <hi>Charity</hi> is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95578:14"/>
so much to be esteemed above all <hi>these,</hi> that they are none of them worth any thing, or will avail in the least, without <hi>Charity. 1 Cor. 13th. Chap.</hi> Much more might be added, to shew what mighty weight is laid upon this duty <hi>of loving one another:</hi> But it sufficiently appears by this <hi>little</hi> that hath been said.</p>
            <p>I have told you what our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> (the stupendious example and pattern of <hi>love)</hi> and what <hi>two</hi> of His <hi>Apostles,</hi> say of it. I might add, that there is no one thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Mankind</hi> do more Universally agree, than in the beneficialness of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Friendship,</hi> both to <hi>single Persons</hi> and <hi>Communities.</hi> That excellent Heathen <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his <hi>Laelius</hi> tells us, That <hi>although many do contemn Vertue it self, and others despise Riches and Honours, yet,</hi> de Amicitia omnes ad unum idem sentiunt; <hi>the whole World to a Man, hath the self same opinion of Love and Friendship,</hi> That is, of the <hi>excellency</hi> and the <hi>necessity</hi> thereof, to the happiness of Mankind. And before <hi>these</hi> words, he saith, That <hi>they seem to pluck the Sun out of the Firmament, who rob humane Life of Love and Friendship; than which we receive nothing from the Immortal Gods, that's more excellent or more pleasant.</hi> And he makes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95578:14"/>
it in the <hi>same</hi> Book, his request to his Friends, That <hi>they would prefer Friendship before all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things:</hi> So that, <hi>what</hi> ought to be so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted, so earnestly pursued? I say, <hi>so</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly pursued, for this <hi>Love of each other,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Love of <hi>God,</hi> is that which mainly constitutes the <hi>Heavenly State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All that we know</hi> (saith the Poet) <hi>the Blessed do above, Is that they Sing, and that they Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (it being an old Maxim, <hi>Contraria jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta se posita mag is elucescunt)</hi> I cannot more <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear</hi> Love and Friendship to you, than by presenting you with some of the most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Effects and Consequents of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Vices, ill Will and Malice, Strife</hi> and <hi>Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I will mind you of some of those, by which the <hi>Community</hi> must needs greatly Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
            <p>One is, <hi>Wicked Partiality.</hi> What <hi>Moses</hi> saith of a <hi>Gift</hi> or <hi>Bribe,</hi> is every whit as true of <hi>ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, emulation,</hi> &amp;c. viz. <hi>It blindeth the Eyes of the Wise, and perverteth the Judgment of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:95578:15"/>
Nothing is more natural to men, that are at variance and strife, than to <hi>Saint</hi> all on their <hi>own side,</hi> and to <hi>Reprobate</hi> their <hi>Adversaries;</hi> and when they have so done, no wonder if <hi>they see no Sin</hi> in <hi>those,</hi> and deal with <hi>these</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World, as they wickedly presume, God Almighty will deal with them in the <hi>other.</hi> And whatsoever Furious People will <hi>Own,</hi> 'tis too likely that most of them <hi>think,</hi> that God is a Being like <hi>themselves,</hi> and saves and damns men, not by fixed and standing Laws, but by mere Will and Power.</p>
            <p>Again, This <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>ill Will,</hi> &amp;c. destroys all the Comfort and Pleasure of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And that as they engage the Company in <hi>Siding</hi> against one another, and in wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful disputing, when they meet together for mutual Enjoyment; And also as they cause <hi>Fear,</hi> and jealous <hi>Mistrust,</hi> and so destroy all <hi>Freedom</hi> in Converse.</p>
            <p>Again, when this <hi>ill Will, Emulation</hi> and <hi>Strife,</hi> &amp;c. come to be between <hi>great</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they have a most mischievous Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the <hi>Government.</hi> Nothing makes men <hi>so ungovernable.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Traiterous, Heady</hi> and <hi>High-minded,</hi> do well follow, <hi>False</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95578:15"/>
               <hi>Accusers, Incontinent, Fierce, 2 Tim. 3. 3.</hi> It is not possible that the Government should carry it, with such an <hi>Even</hi> and <hi>Steady</hi> hand, as not to favour <hi>one</hi> side more than the <hi>other:</hi> nor is it indeed <hi>fit</hi> it should; because it hardly ever so happens that <hi>one</hi> part hath no more right on it's side, than the <hi>Opposite:</hi> And it would be Strange too, if <hi>both</hi> should be equally guilty of <hi>Injustice</hi> and <hi>Transgressing the Laws.</hi> Now nothing is more natural, than for men of Wrath and Fury, to take high offence at those, who are in the least favourable towards their Adversaries; especially if they perceive them, to be one jot <hi>more</hi> in their favour than <hi>themselves.</hi> And I think they are far more apt to take this heighnously at their <hi>Governours</hi> hands, than at their <hi>fellow-Snbjects:</hi> Because they always on each side pretend, to be <hi>most faithful</hi> to the interest of the Government. Now when once offence is taken at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whilst People are so generally acted by <hi>Interest,</hi> much more than by Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> I need not say that the Government can be no longer secure from open Violence, or private Conspiracies, than till the offended Party grows strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,

 to hope for Success. Oh how sad a <hi>Felling,</hi> have we of <hi>this</hi> Nation had, of the Truth of <hi>this!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover this evil Spirit, when 'tis gotten into <hi>Societies,</hi> tendeth mightily to the <hi>Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> of them. This it doth, as it takes men off, from following the Business of their <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;</hi> as it makes them <hi>Idle</hi> and <hi>Gadders</hi> about. The Heads of those who are engaged in Strife and Contention, are too much <hi>heated,</hi> to mind, as they should do, Serious Business. And therefore they commonly employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did, <hi>who spent their time in nothing else, than to tell or to hear, some new thing.</hi> VVhen they should be in their <hi>Shops,</hi> and about their <hi>necessary</hi> Affairs, you may find them in the <hi>Coffee-Houses,</hi> or in the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,</hi> Caballing together: And as in the <hi>one</hi> they spend many pretious hours, <hi>one while</hi> in <hi>vain prating,</hi> and <hi>another while</hi> in <hi>Seditious</hi> Talking, or Unchristian <hi>Censuring, Railing</hi> and <hi>Reviling;</hi> So in the <hi>other,</hi> in adding to <hi>these</hi> and the <hi>like Immoralities, Excessive Drinking;</hi> which I need not tell you, draweth after it <hi>other</hi> vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and leud Practices. I add also, that by <hi>this</hi> means they become great Sufferers in their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95578:16"/>
               <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and Abundance <hi>Break</hi> and <hi>run-out</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> and bring themselves and Families, to a Morsel of Bread. VVhat a number of sad Instances of the Truth of <hi>this,</hi> have we of late years had in <hi>this City!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, Strife and Variance, if not <hi>timely</hi> abandoned, brings upon that <hi>Kingdom, City</hi> or <hi>other</hi> Society, utter <hi>Ruin</hi> and <hi>Desolation.</hi> This our <hi>Lord Himself</hi> hath told us, Mat. 12. 25. <hi>Every Kingdom divided against it self, is brought to dosolation; and every House divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it self, cannot stand.</hi> And he intimates to us in the following words, that the <hi>Devils</hi> are so wise, as to be aware of <hi>this;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will <hi>agree</hi> together, as <hi>natural</hi> as Malice and Contention are to them, and as great pleasure as they take, in imbittering <hi>Mens</hi> Spirits towards one another. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable instances of the truth of that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Blessed Lord; and the Experience of <hi>those</hi> to whom He spake it, found it Verifyed, within about half an Age after, with a Vengeance. The horrible Feuds that were in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> did the <hi>Romans</hi> business to their hands, and brought them under a Fatal Necessity, of a total Destruction and Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

2. As the <hi>Community</hi> must needs Suffer <hi>thus</hi> by the means of those Vices that are Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to <hi>Love,</hi> so are they the heaviest <hi>Plague</hi> to those <hi>Particular</hi> Persons, in whom they reign, that can befal them. But the time will suffer me, to say but a very <hi>little</hi> to <hi>this</hi> Argument. In <hi>short</hi> therefore <hi>thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Malice, Revenge and Fury, &amp;c. are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>Uneasy</hi> and <hi>Restless</hi> Vices: they are a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Hell</hi> to <hi>him</hi> in whom they dwell. They give not so much trouble and vexation to <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> but that they give <hi>more</hi> to those men themselves, who entertain and gratify <hi>these</hi> Lusts. All corrupt Appetites whatsoever are of a <hi>Tormenting</hi> nature, but 'tis most especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true of <hi>them</hi> in whom the Spirit of <hi>ill will</hi> is found, that <hi>They are like the troubled Sea which cannot rest, whose waters cast up Mire and Dirt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi> farthermore, is the true Spirit, and Temper of the <hi>Devil.</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>If ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your hearts, Glory not and Lye not against the Truth; this Wisdom descendeth not from above, but is Earthy, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, Devillish.</hi> The <hi>Pharisees</hi> who were act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Spirit, our Saviour calls the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Children. Ye are,</hi> saith he, <hi>of your Father</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95578:17"/>
               <hi>the Devil, and the Works of your Father, ye will do; he was a Murtherer from the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In this,</hi> saith S. <hi>John, the Children of God are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, and the Children of the Devil; he that doth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his Brother.</hi> Or the man who is guilty of <hi>this</hi> instance of Unrighteousness, <hi>Hating his Brother,</hi> is in a more <hi>especial</hi> manner the <hi>Child of the Devil.</hi> No man doth Resemble him so exactly, as doth <hi>this</hi> man. And Envious and Malicious <hi>Kain</hi> is said by the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, to be <hi>of that wicked one,</hi> of his Spirit and Temper, as if he were his <hi>Natural Off-spring,</hi> and <hi>Begotten of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consequently, This Spirit and Temper sets us at the <hi>greatest distance imaginable from God;</hi> who is a most <hi>Kind, Gratious</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign</hi> Being: <hi>whose tender mercies are over all his works.</hi> Who is a Being most <hi>Placable</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable</hi> towards Repenting Sinners: A Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wonderful <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Long-Suffering, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance. A Being that considers our Frame, and remembers that we are dust;</hi> and is Compassionate in <hi>all</hi> Cases that are Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:95578:18"/>
And, <hi>Lastly,</hi> 'Tis apparent from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Account, that this Spirit of <hi>Malice</hi> and Revenge, &amp;c. puts men into the <hi>Hellish</hi> State, and <hi>completely</hi> qualifies them, for the <hi>Place</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Company</hi> thereof, and for the <hi>worst</hi> of Company <hi>there,</hi> the <hi>Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> for whom <hi>Hell</hi> was originally prepared. A Soul destitute of Love, and fraught with the <hi>Contrary</hi> Qualities, when it goes out of <hi>this</hi> Body, will be prest down by them into the bottomless Pit: 'Twill as <hi>naturally</hi> sink down <hi>thither,</hi> as the <hi>Stone,</hi> or any <hi>Heavy</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, falls to the Ground. <hi>Hell</hi> is the very <hi>Center</hi> of all such Souls.</p>
            <p>And therefore what remains, but that we <hi>Hate</hi> this Malign Spirit, as we Hate the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> and that we <hi>Shun</hi> it, as we would do <hi>Hell</hi> it self. As also that we make it the Chief Business of our Lives, to get our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely possessed, of the Godlike Spirit of <hi>Love; of that Wisdom which is from above, which is first Pure, then Peaceable, Gentle and Easy to be Entreated, sull of Mercy and Good Fruits, without Partiality, and without Hypocrisy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95578:18"/>
But it may be Objected, are we obliged to be United in Love and Friendship, with those who are <hi>Enemies to all Unity;</hi> who do <hi>all</hi> they can to Encourage Faction and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>State,</hi> and Schism in the <hi>Church;</hi> and are Enemies both to our <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Government?</p>
            <p>Hereto I Answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we could all be perswaded to <hi>love one another,</hi> we should have no such Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as <hi>these</hi> among us. All true Love and Unity hath its foundation (as I shewed true <hi>Loyalty</hi> hath) in the <hi>Fear of God:</hi> And where <hi>that</hi> is (as I shewed too) there <hi>will</hi> be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Higher Powers. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of <hi>Traiterous, Factious</hi> and <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Persons (and indeed of <hi>all wicked Men</hi> whatsoever) is, as the <hi>Father</hi> saith, <hi>Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio non Unit as, A Conspiracy not an Unity.</hi> But because we cannot expect in this <hi>Depraved</hi> State of Mankind, that so much as the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> part should be induced with the Principle of <hi>Love,</hi> I answer,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95578:19"/>
2. That there is a <hi>twofold</hi> Love, a Love of <hi>Complacency,</hi> and of <hi>mere Good-will.</hi> Now as to the love of <hi>Complacency, that</hi> cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Persons of <hi>unlike</hi> Spirits and Tempers; they <hi>cannot</hi> take <hi>delight</hi> in one another. A Man of <hi>Loyal</hi> Principle and Practices, can take no delight in a Man of <hi>Disloyal</hi> ones; nor can any <hi>good</hi> Man take delight in a <hi>wicked</hi> Man, nor <hi>ought</hi> he so to do, if he <hi>could.</hi> But <hi>then</hi> we ought still to retain the love of <hi>good-will</hi> for <hi>such;</hi> we ought in <hi>this</hi> sense to <hi>love</hi> their <hi>Persons,</hi> whilst we <hi>hate</hi> their <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices.</hi> And we ought to <hi>express</hi> our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to their <hi>Persons</hi> by <hi>pitying</hi> them, and <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for them, and using <hi>all endeavours</hi> to reclaim them. We ought (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle adviseth) <hi>with meekness to instruct those that oppose themselves, if God per adventure will give them Repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth.</hi> And when there is a necessity of exercising <hi>Severity,</hi> it should <hi>never</hi> proceed from a Principle of <hi>Revenge;</hi> but the design thereof ought <hi>always</hi> to be, the <hi>Preservation of the Government,</hi> and the <hi>Reformation</hi> too of the <hi>Offenders,</hi> when their punishment is not <hi>Capital.</hi> So that <hi>in no case whatsoever Malice</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95578:19"/>
and <hi>Revenge, Wrath</hi> and <hi>Fury</hi> may take place among us. And <hi>all</hi> Men <hi>whatsoever</hi> should be Objects, either of our Love of <hi>Delight,</hi> or of <hi>Good-will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, my Honoured and Dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, God Almighty grant, that this our happy Meeting, may contribute towards the promoting and encrease of <hi>Love</hi> among us: And fully answer the Designs thereof expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the <hi>Tickets,</hi> viz. <hi>Mutual Society and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And it is my humble request to you, that this our <hi>first Feast,</hi> after a long disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> Ever since the <hi>Burning of London.</hi>
               </note> may give a noble Example to all <hi>succeedings</hi> ones, of forwardness to this great work of Charity, <hi>The putting out to Apprentice poor Children of our Country;</hi> or <hi>otherwise</hi> releiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>most</hi> Necessitous of our Brethren.</p>
            <p>And farther, God Almighty grant, that no <hi>other</hi> strife, no <hi>other</hi> Emulation, may ever be discerned in <hi>Our Brotherhood,</hi> than <hi>these</hi> most highly Praise-worthy ones, <hi>viz.</hi> Who of us shall give the <hi>best</hi> demonstration to the world, of his <hi>Fearing God</hi> and <hi>Honouring our King</hi> (or of <hi>Honouring our King,</hi> from the true principle of <hi>Fearing God)</hi> and of <hi>sincere Zeal for the interest of the Government.</hi> Who of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95578:20"/>
us shall be <hi>most concerned for the Religion of our truly Apostolick Church,</hi> in opposition to <hi>both</hi> its Adversaries, <hi>Popery</hi> on the <hi>one</hi> Hand, and <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> under all forms, on the <hi>other.</hi> And who of us <hi>shall most hate medling with either of those Extremes, who would fain change our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether Civil or Ecclesiastical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A word or two more, and I will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Trespass upon your Patience. We have a Country, I think, take it altogether, not inferiour (to speak modestly) to <hi>any one</hi> in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> both for <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Pleasure;</hi> and a Country that is Honoured with Inhabitants of <hi>Great worth</hi> and <hi>Great Quality, equally</hi> with <hi>most</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> She hath indeed but a <hi>few</hi> of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> but, among <hi>these,</hi> She can boast of <hi>one</hi> Family of the very <hi>Highest</hi> 
               <note place="margin">His Grace the Duke of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's.</hi>
               </note> Rank of Nobles.</p>
            <p>And I can't but take notice <hi>farther,</hi> of the Honour which some would have to be done our Country, by an Antient <hi>Proverb,</hi> the like to which, no other place I ever heard of can lay claim to, except <hi>Heaven</hi> it self: Namely <hi>this, As sure as God is in Gloucester-shire.</hi> Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's so abounding heretofore with <hi>Religious Houses,</hi> hath been thought (as Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95578:20"/>
               <hi>others</hi> say) to be the occasion of this <hi>Proverb.</hi> But though <hi>those Houses</hi> have been long <hi>gone</hi> (which we have no cause to be sorry for, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their <hi>Religion</hi> were better than it was) I could be content we might never lose our <hi>Proverb;</hi> on condition that it may never for the future be <hi>prophanely</hi> used, as alass now it is; and that <hi>this,</hi> for the time to come, may be the ground of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Gloucester-shire</hi> abounds, above all <hi>other</hi> Countries, with Love and Friendship. Then there may be a defence made for such a <hi>Proverb</hi> as <hi>this:</hi> For though God be <hi>every where,</hi> yet is He most <hi>especially,</hi> and <hi>peculiarly,</hi> present <hi>there</hi> where <hi>Love</hi> reigneth: For <hi>God is Love, and those that dwell in Love, dwell in God, and God in them:</hi> As St. <hi>John</hi> assures us. I say, upon so Blessed an Account as <hi>this,</hi> Let this <hi>Proverb</hi> (so it be never, as I said, for the <hi>future, prophanely</hi> or <hi>irreverendly</hi> used) to all Generations be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
