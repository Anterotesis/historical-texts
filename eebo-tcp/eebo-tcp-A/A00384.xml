         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>POLIE IT MAYE BE
thought in me to haue spent
tyme in englisshyng of this
boke, entitled <hi>the praise of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
wheras the name it selfe
semeth to set foorth no wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or matter of grauitee:
vnlesse perhappes <hi>Erasmus,</hi>
the autour therof, delited to
mocke men, in callyng it one
thyng, and meanyng an other. To this I answeare,
that Folie in all poinctꝭ is not (as I take it) so strange
vnto vs, but that hir name maie well be abidden, aslong
as will we or nill we, she will be sure to beare a stroke
in most of our dooyngꝭ: how so euer a certaine secte
of faulte finders condemne all thingꝭ, that fully square
not with theyr owne rules, yea twyse blinde in this,
that amongꝭ the commen errours and infyrmitees of
mortall men, they will beare nothyng with their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne,
as who saieth, they were demigoddꝭ, and not
more than one or two waies lynked in Folies bandꝭ.</p>
            <p>I haue therfore bestowed an englisshe liuerey vpon this
latine boke, as well as I coulde: not so muche to please
all men, as rather to shew how euin this Foly toucheth
all men. Wherin I woulde not be noted as a carper of
any man particulerly (for what more vnsittyng than in
bokes or plaies to touche men by name?) nor that herein
I seke to haue any kinde of men noted for theyr trade of
lyfe, otherwyse than the abuse thereof deserueth, but
<pb facs="tcp:1818:3"/>
onely my meanyng is suche, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> in this booke
shall expresse for vs bothe. He of his modestee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to set no great face vpon it, nor woulde be noted to
haue spent great labour in makyng therof: sauyng as
in pastime to haue essaied, whether ought might be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in praise of Folie, wheras wysedome the vertue
can praise it selfe. And therfore he imagineth, that
Folie shoulde be a Goddesse, who before all kyndes of
men assembled as to a sermon, shoulde declare how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
benefites they receiue at hir handꝭ: and how with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hir accesse, nothyng in this life is delectable, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
or tollerable vnto vs, no not our owne life.</p>
            <p>This braue bost myght well come from Folie: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
that wyser men are wont to take in woorth what
is saied by a foole, therfore is <hi>Erasmus</hi> also the bolder
to put that tale in Folies mouth, whiche vnder an other
person he woulde haue made more curtesie to haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
So what excuse he maketh the same I requyre
maie serue for me: that thyngꝭ spoken foolisshely, by
Folie, maie be euin so taken, and not wrested to any bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sence or ernest applicacion. For surely if the crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedst
men that be, are wont to take a fooles woordꝭ as
in sporte, for feare lest others myght recken they would
not wynche without a galled backe: Than how muche
more is a domme booke written generally to be borne
withall? namely where the title pretendeth no graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
but rather a toye to stirre laughter, without offence
in the boke, if the reader bringe none offence with hym.
For than truely he maie chaunce to see his owne image
more liuely described than in any peincted table.</p>
            <p>But if that waies he mislike the deformitee of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaicte,
<pb facs="tcp:1818:3"/>
let hym muche more mislyke to be suche one
in deede. And seeyng the vices of our daies are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
as can not enough be spoken against, what knowe
we, if <hi>Erasmus</hi> in this booke thought good betweene
game and ernest to rebuke the same? And chiefely to
persuade (if it myght be) a certaine contentacion in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
man, to holde hym agreed with suche lotte and
state of liuyng, as ariseth to hym. For whiche pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
was I also soonest moued to englisshe it, to the end
that meane men of baser wittes and condicion, myght
haue a maner coumfort and satisfaction in theim selfes.
In as muche as the hie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>en some to rule, and more to
serue. Wherat so muche lacketh that the inferiours
shoulde repine, as rather set in the meaner degree, they
should thanke god the more: without aspyryng to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
aboue theyr reache, whiche should draw more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and perilles, than if they absteigned therfro, and
gaue place to others, who had greater giftes of God,
and were called by auctoritee of theyr prince or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to welde the same. For surely, if a man of the
poorer sorte, whose eies is dased in beholdyng the fayre
glosse of wealth and felicitee, whiche the state of a great
lorde or counsailour in a commen wealth dooeth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
represent, did inwardly marke the trauailes,
cares, and anxietees, whiche suche one is driuen to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steigne
(doyng as he ought to dooe) in seruyng his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and countrey, wherby he is nothyng lesse than his
owne man: now I beleue he would not muche enuie his
state, nor chose to chaunge condicions of life with hym.
But this were euin the chiefest poincte of wysedome,
<pb facs="tcp:1818:4"/>
though fooles (as Folie calleth theim) that is to saie
vulgare folke, are those, that vnwittyng of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
dooe in deede enioie this sweete quietnesse, and
greatest good tourne. And waiyng this foolishe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oke,
after this sence, I wene a profite also maie arise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through
to the readers, besides the delectacion, beyng so
pithilie pleasaunt as it is. For as <hi>Erasmus</hi> in all his
woorkes sauoureth of a liuelie quicknesse, and spareth
not sometyme in graue mattiers to sprincle his style,
where he maie suache oportunitee with meerie concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
sentences: so in this booke, treatyng of suche a
<hi>Theme,</hi> and vnder suche a person, he openeth all his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owget: So farfoorth as by the iudgement of many
learned men, he neuer shewed more arte, nor witte, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the grauest boke he wrote, than in this his praise of
Folie. Whiche the reader hauyng any considerance,
shall soone espie, how in euery mattier, yea almost eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
clause, is hidden besides the myrth, some deaper sence
and purpose. In deede I againe saie not, but he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Folie to speake at randon, without sparyng of any
estate of men: but yet indifferent eares will heare their
faultes paciently, as long as they maie chose, whether
they will take the faulte vppon theim or not: or be a
knowne to be those, whom Folie noteth. But euin
this frankenesse of Folies taunting I haue presumed in
some poinctes to ytche to the beste: namely in two or
thre places, whiche the learned reader comparyng with
the latine boke, maie easely perceiue, how either I haue
slipped ouer a line or two, or eased the sowre sence of
the latine with some manerlier englishe worde. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I chose rather to be counted a skante true interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
<pb facs="tcp:1818:4"/>
than otherwise to touche thynges, whiche were
better vnsaied, as long as it hurted not the grace of the
boke though they were omitted. Likewise in all my
translacion I haue not peined my selfe to render worde
for woorde, nor prouerbe for prouerbe, wherof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be greke, such as haue no grace in our tounge:
but rather markyng the sence. I applied it
to the phrase of our englishe. And
where the prouerbes woulde take
no englishe, I aduentured to put
englisshe prouerbes of like
waight in their placꝭ,
Whiche maie be
thought by
some
cunnyng translatours a deadly sinne. But
I sticke not for all that, in this foolishe
booke to vse mine owne foolishe
caste. And if it be misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
I passe not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
though I lose
the praise of
my Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>

tournyng, to succour men readie to perisshe, so I also
(that in me lyeth) dooe reuoke suche aged men as are

Consider now (I praie you) how muche more <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

Furthermore, he shutte vp <hi>Reason</hi> within the narowe

muche as to man, borne to gouerne, and rule, <hi>Iupiter</hi>
thought it meate to distribute <hi>Reason</hi> somewhat in a

and thickenesse of theyr beardes, beyng a verie repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentacion
of oldnesse, sauyng of the excesse, or rather
disease of wisedome? wheras women with their smoth
chekes, small voices, and fiue skinnes, dooe euer shew

life that women sooner coueite, than to be belyked of

what greatter priuilege haue women ouer men, than
their foolisshenesse? For what is it, that men permitte
not as leafull, or at least to be borne with, in women?
but vnder what other title, than of delectacion? But
how dooe they delite men, sauyng with their Folie?
This to be true, can not be denied, who so will consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of sodeinly, beyng all to laught to scorne. How be
it this <hi>Socrates,</hi> as in one poinct (me semeth) was not

of a wyseman, but rather ascribed the same vnto god
onely, and thought it best for a wyseman not to busie

onely that his excellent, that his goodly qualitee

yet who hath the grace to do so vnlesse I Folie do arme

<hi>euin the greattest miserie of all, to be blinded so with Folie, to

that is it to be a man. And yet I see not why thei shuld
call you miserable therfore, in as muche as ye be borne
so, ye be ordeigned so, and made so, and such is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

flie as burdes dooe, nor goe on all foure as other bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

But than by lyke argument, why call they not a faire
horse miserable: because he neuer learned grammer? or
eateth no rostmeate? or els a buile vnhappie, because
he is not shapen to throw the barre? Ergo, as an horse,
who can not his grammer, is not wretched, no more a

<pb facs="tcp:1818:32"/>
but let vs proue yet, by the <hi>Muses</hi> leaue, how we can
refelle this <hi>Syllogisme</hi> of theyrs, whiche (in deede)
thei haue subtilly knit togethers, but as in <hi>Plato, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
teacheth vs, <hi>to deuide one venus into two, and one
Cupide, into two Cupides.</hi> So lykewise these Logiciens,
if they had dooen right, shulde haue deuided or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
one kinde of madnesse from an other. In as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
as euery madnesse,<note place="margin">Euery er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the mynde is not mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> is not straight therfore misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For than Horace wolde not haue saied, <hi>Is it not a
swete, and pleasaunt madnesse that deceiueth me? Nor Plato
likewyse woulde haue put the rauyng of poetes, prophetes, and
louers, amonges the principall weales, and benefites of this life.
Nor yet the prophetesse in Virgise woulde haue called the longe
wandryng, and peregrinacion of Aeneas, a madde labour.</hi> But
ye must vnderstande, that there be two kyndes of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.<note place="margin">Two kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>
One is that rage, whiche the <hi>Furies</hi> of hell,
beyng punisshers of the wicked, doe bringe with them,
as often as thei graffe, and fasten in the mindꝭ of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
men, either feruente desyre of an vniust reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or vnsaciate couetousnesse of golde, or cursed and
vnleefull loue, or parent slaughter, or treason, with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
other plages sent by the iust iudgement of the gods,
for the punisshyng of misdooers. Or whan those <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
do trouble, and vexe the giltie conscience of a man,
with the pricke of dredefull furiousnesse. But there
is an other kynde of madnesse, farre vnlike the former,
whiche procedeth from me wholy, and most is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.
As often as a certaine pleasant rauing, or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the mynde, deliuereth the herte of that man,
whom it possesseth, from all wonted carefulnesse, &amp; ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
it dyuers waies, muche recreated with new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectacion.
<pb facs="tcp:1818:33"/>
Now this saied <hi>Errour</hi> of the mynde, as
a speciall iewel, and benefite of the goddꝭ, was wisshed
after, euin of <hi>Cicero hym selfe,</hi> in a certaine epistle he
wrote to <hi>Atticus, to the ende he might haue no sense, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandyng

that whole daies togethers he woulde sitte alone
in the <hi>Theatre</hi> (a place where the commen plaies were

muche to hym selfe, because hym seemed veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that some excellent <hi>Tragedies</hi> were in plaiyng there,
wheras in deede he sawe nothyng at all. Whan yet
for all that as to other respectꝭ, he behaued hym selfe
wysely enough, beyng welbeloued of his friendꝭ, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
to his wyfe, and easie to his seruantꝭ, without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
in any rage with theim, whan he founde a backe
faulset set in his wyne vessell. Now whan his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes
procurement, geuyng hym medecines therfore,
had healed his disease, and restored hym to his former
wittes, marke ye, how he fell out with theim, in bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
their thanklesse and double diligence. <hi>Ye haue
slaine, and not saued me; ô my friendes (quod he) in wrestyng
my pleasure from me in this sort, and by force bereuyn gme suche
a most delectable errour of my mynde.</hi> And well mought

theim, who toke in hand to driue and expell out of the,
so pleasaunt, and happie a madnesse, in stede of a great
disease, as thei toke it. How be it, I am in doubte
yet, whether euery <hi>Errour</hi> of the mynde and senses,

out of his right mynde. As if some man so often as he

that perceiue it to be in others, hauyng theim selues no

ceremonies they vse about the same. Euery poore man

<pb facs="tcp:1818:34"/>
dooe them selfes also degenerate into wilde and saluage
propretees, ye maie see yet, how through this errour of

With whom in a maner hir syster <hi>Adulacion</hi> may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare.
For <hi>Self loue</hi> is naught els, but whan a man
fauneth on hym selfe. Whiche if thou dooest to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than is it <hi>Adulacion,</hi> or flaterie. But now a

with the thyng it selfe. They thinke how faieth, may
euill ioygne with flaterie, whiche to be otherwyse, we
maie learne through the exemple of brute beastes. For
what can be more faunyng, and flattryng to a man,
than a dogge? but than againe, what is more faiethful?
What is fuller of daliance than a squyrell? but than
againe what is lesse hurtfull? Unlesse perchaunce ye

draweth muche nearer to a vertue, than dooeth hir con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
that is to saie, a <hi>roughe plainesse, or vnmanerly crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bednesse,

maie well be taken for the chiefest membre of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citee.
And what can be more faunyng, than whan one
man praiseth an other? <hi>lyke moyles clawyng eche others

all theyr <hi>Sectes.</hi> Or if that ought maie be
knowen, the same yet not seeldome disauaileth to the
gladsomenesse and pleasure of the lyfe. Lastly, so is
mans mynde framed, as muche more it deliteth in thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to the shew, than in suche as are in deede. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
who so list to haue a liuely prouffe, let hym no more
but goe to a sermon, wherin if ought be saied grauely,
and to the mattier, he shall see straight all the audience,
other slepe, or gaspe, or be vrkesome. But and if the
skreker (the preacher I woulde haue saied) falleth out
of his purpose, as commenly their vsage is, into some
<pb facs="tcp:1818:40"/>
tale of <hi>Gesta Romanoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or suche lyke, than by and by
they lift vp their headꝭ, they stande vp, and geue good

saint Christophre, or sainct Barbara, the same yet
shall ye see more deuoutly woorshipped, and vowed to

            <p>Consider you therfore, how muche lesse costeth the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirey
of this felicitee, whiche dependeth on the sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
and opinion of a thyng, as if it were had, than
that other of the thyng selfe, beyng had in deede, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
be it of neuer so small value and estimacion, as
<hi>Grammer,</hi> yet you see how longe a man must sweate
ere he gette it, wheras the semblaunce of the same ye
maie easelie conceiue, and come by, through your owne
perswasion: and yet shall that conceipte as muche, or
more auaile you towardꝭ felicitee. For admitte that
one eateth stinkyng saltfisshe, wherof some other could
scant byde the smelle, and yet to his mouthe it tasteth
sweeter than a partrich, now (I praie you) what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is there, as touchyng the felicitee he taketh
therin? Or an other abhorred to eate of a Carpe, or
some other delicate kynde of fisshe, did that any thyng
hyndre the blisfull state of his life? If a man hath a
wyfe as vglie as maie be, who yet in his conceipt maie
compare in beautie with <hi>Venus,</hi> is it not all one now
vnto hym, as if she were fayre in deede? If he that
beholdeth a table daubed with a little durt and redde
Okre, did perswade hym selfe it were a pece of <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
or <hi>Hans Holbyns</hi> peinctyng, is he not happier (trow
<pb facs="tcp:1818:40"/>
ye) than some other, who at great price haue bought
some of those woorkmens woorkꝭ? and peraduenture
take lesse pleasure in regardyng of the same, than he
dooeth of his? I know a gentilman, that presented
his new wedded wife with certaine counterfeict stones
set in ringꝭ, perswadyng hir (as he could dooe finely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)
that not onely they were true, and orient, but
also of great value. Now I praie you, what skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that to hir? Seyng she contented bothe hir eies
and fantesie with those counterfeictꝭ, kepyng them for
a great treasure, wheras the housbande in the meane
season bothe spared cost, and toke pleasure at his wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
errour, who natheles conned him as great thanke,
as if they had been right iewels. <hi>Is there any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
(trow ye) <hi>betweene suche as Plato feigneth sittyng in a
caue vnder the grounde, to see nothyng but shadowes and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentacions
of thynges, so that they dooe coueite naught els, and
content theim selues therwith, and that wyseman, he imagineth
shoulde come out of the caue, and so see verie thynges as they are

had euermore dreamed that his golden &amp; riche dreame,
than neded he not to haue wisshed for any other felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee.
Conclude therfore, that no difference is betwene
a thyng it selfe, and the opinion or semblaunce of the
same: or if there be, than are my fooles yet in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
trade. Fyrst because theyr felicitee costeth theim
as little as can be, as onely an easy perswasion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefe

And loke not yet to be praide vnto, nor am not angrie,

suche is the morositee and ceremoniousnesse, as in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

the trouth I fynde no want therof at all. For why
shoulde I requyre, <hi>either frankensence, or leuained meale, or
a gote, or a hogge</hi> for my sacrifice? Wheras all mortall
men, in euerie region, doe yelde me that woorshippyng,
whiche euin by these scripture doctours is wonte to be
moste approued? Unlesse perchaunce I shoulde enuie
<hi>Diana,</hi> because hir altars ar besprent with mans bloud.
Naie, I thinke my selfe to be than moste amplie, and

Wheras all the worlde vniuersally offreth me daie by

And yet these men, who in deede know nothing, wil take

not theim selues, nor see not oftentymes a pitte, or a

The apostles <hi>Baptized</hi> euery where, and yet thei neuer

How be it they can so muche theyr good, that where in

in suche a sort, as none but fumblers as thei, may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
theim, yet dooe they call it a certaine grace and
finesse, whiche euerie body can not attaine vnto. For
(saie they) it is not for the dignitee of holie writte, our

grammer rules: whiche surely (so beyng) is a great
maiestee of these <hi>Duns doctours,</hi> if to theim onely it
be lawfull to speake false latine. notwithstanding that
many coblers and clowters can doe that as well as thei.
Lastly now, they take theim selues in a maner for Gods
peres, whan they are saluted solemnely by the name of
maister doctours, or <hi>Magister noster:</hi> wherin thei wene

and if ye tourne the woordꝭ, saiyng <hi>noster Magister,</hi> in

this kynde of men be commenly so abhorred, as euin to
mete with theim at vnwares, or next a bodies risyng,
it is taken for a signe of euill lucke all the daie after: yet
(lorde) how they make theim selues to be more than
<hi>Cherubyns.</hi> For fyrst they hold it a great holinesse,
to medle so little with bookes, and learnyng, as scarce
they know how to read theyr owne names. And whan
they rore foorth (lyke a meny of asses) in theyr mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
a noumbre of psalmes not vnderstanded, than
they wene verily to fede sainctes eares with a meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

            <p>Yet vnder confidence of these trifles, they not onely set
laie men as light as butterflies, but euin amongꝭ theim

sticke to fall together by the eares, either for a gurdell
of a contrary facion, or a garment somewhat of a brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

as outwardly they weare naught but sacke clothe, and
inwardly no better than fine holland. Some others
againe dare as soone touche poyson as money, neuer
the more forbearyng from wyne, nor contrectacion of

whilom plainly, and by no shadow of parables, I promised my

but rather to the woorkes of charitee: not I know none suche, as
to muche know their owne good woorkes. These men woulde
be coumpted holier than my selfe: let them dwell therfore if thei

one of theim beholde an other? Natheles in the meane
tyme they are happie in theyr owne hope, not without

of the audience now meruailyng, and saiyng to theim

to this passe, that <hi>he shewed the figure of the whole trinitee
to be so exactly described and expressed in the rules of grammer,
as no geometricien myght plainlier draw it with his finger in the

<pb facs="tcp:1818:56"/>
whole eyght monthes together so ernestly had sweatte

And no meruaile, seyng he drew vp all the sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his eie sight, to the poinct of his engin: but for
all that he nothyng forthinketh his blindnesse, rather
takyng the same for to chepe a price of suche a glorie as
he wanne therby. Lykewise, not longe agone I
was present at the sermon of an other famous doctour,
beyng almost .80. yeres old, and therto so doctourlike,
as if <hi>Duns</hi> were new arisen in hym, who entendyng to
disclose the misterie of the name of <hi>Iesu,</hi> with great sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltee
shewed, how euin in <hi>the verie letters was as muche

is declinable but in three cases, as <hi>Iesus, Iesum, Iesu,</hi>
that (saied he) <hi>was a manifest representacion of the Trinitee.</hi>
Than because the fyrst terminacion of <hi>Iesus</hi> endeth in
<hi>S,</hi> the secounde in <hi>M,</hi> the thyrde in <hi>V,</hi> thereby
laie a right secrete misterie, in as muche (quod he) as
<hi>the verie letters dooe declare that Iesus, is Summus, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
and Vltimus,</hi> (that is) the fyrste, the middest, and
the last. An other mistery he alleged farre more strange
than these, diuidyng this woorde Iesus as it were by
<hi>geometrie</hi> into two egall partꝭ, leuyng <hi>S,</hi> in maner
of a stickler in the middle: whiche letter in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews

synne</hi> (quod he) <hi>in englisshe is as muche to saie as a deadly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

or mediatour, that toke on hym the synnes of this worlde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This so strange and farre fetched a beginnyng, all men

but (O the will of god) how full of grace be the

<hi>as if an asse were set to plaie on a gyttarne.</hi> Sometymes

dooe ticle, than pynche depelier. But neuer dooe thei
flatter more kyndly, than whan thei pretende to speake
most frely, and without respecte. Finally all theyr
cast in preachyng is suche, as a man wolde sweare thei
had gone to schole with these <hi>Ceretans,</hi> suche as in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie</hi>
are wont in markette places standyng on stalles, or
where thei maie be seen best, to preache vnto the people
in commendacion of some pardone, feigned medecines,
or suche lyke toyes of theyr owne inuencion, to gette
money withall, and bleare the simples eies. Whiche
<hi>Ceretans</hi> natheles doe farre passe theim in theyr grace:
All be it (to speake indifferently) the one of theim is so
lyke the other, as none will doubt, but either they haue
learned at those, or those at these againe. But what
nede these my frier preachers to passe theron? seeyng
through my procurement thei neuer misse of suche, as in
hearyng theim, beleue verily they heare <hi>Demosthenes,</hi>
and <hi>Cireros</hi> matches:<note place="margin">Merchanꝰtes and wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men.</note> of whiche opinion chiefely be
merchauntꝭ, and good wiues, whose eares and likyng,
friers dooe wholy studie to satisfie. For merchauntes
in case they be handsomely glosed, are wonte to geue
theim in <hi>Commendum</hi> some porcion of theyr misgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

<pb facs="tcp:1818:58"/>
are specially enclined to theim, for that they are
wont to poure into theyr bosomes what euer euill will
they beare in theyr hertes against theyr husbandꝭ.</p>
            <p>Thus, ye consider (I trow) how muche this race of
<hi>Religious men,</hi> is endebted vnto me, whan now with
theyr <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and fonde fantesies of theyr owne,
now with theyr baulyng and criyng out in pulpites,
they dooe exercise a maner tyrannie amongꝭ men, and
woulde be coumpted for more than <hi>Paules,</hi> or <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi>
But seeyng they be suche iuglers, as can no lesse
vnkyndely dissemble, and seeme not to acknowlage my
benefites employed on theim, than they are otherwise
craftilie counterfetctours of holinesse, I holde it best
to speake no more of theim. For I longe sore a little
now to treate of kynges and princes liues,<note place="margin">Kynges &amp; Princis.</note> who most

me. Wheras if thei considred well what belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to theyr estates, now I see not what life might be
more carefull than theyrs, nor lesse to be desyred. For
suche shall neuer thinke that a kyngdome shoulde either
by vsurpacion, or any other wrongfull title be sought
for, as dooe waie with theim selues, what a charge he
susteigneth on his shoulders, that rightly will execute
the office of a prince: who takyng vpon him the rule of
thyngꝭ dooeth now administer not his owne, but rather
the affaires of many, wherby he shulde thinke of naught
els but the commen weale: obseruyng iustly the lawes,
wherof he is bothe founder, and ouerseer, to the ende
his vprightnesse, and integritee maie be a president to
his vnderrulers and officers, whan either beyng iuste
and vertuous, like a blisfull sterre of lucky aspecte he
<pb facs="tcp:1818:58"/>
maie bringe bothe health and coumfort to all his subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes,
or otherwyse, lyke a pestilent <hi>Comete,</hi> be theyr

But a prince is set in that place, whereas if he wrie him
selfe neuer so little from that becometh hym, straight
waies the infection of the exemple crepeth contagious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to many men. Besydes that, how muche more the
height of a princꝭ fortune maie be a meanes to peruert
hym from the right trade, either through pleasure, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertee,
adulacion, or delicatenesse, so muche the ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
shoulde he resist theim, watchyng diligently, lest at
any tyme beyng seduced, he dooe swerue from his dui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee.
And lastly (omittyng treasons, hatredꝭ, and other
perillꝭ or dreades, wherwith a prince is infested) if he
remembre how the dome also of the heighest, and most
rightfull kyng of all, hangeth ouer his head, who soone
after will call hym to accoumpte for the least faulte he
hath doen, yea and that the narowlier, the greater state
he had committed to hym: These thyngꝭ (I saie)
and many like hereto, if a prince do perpende wel, (and
perpende theim he must nedes if he hath wisedome) I
beleue surely he shoulde take his slepe and fode, with
lesse gladnesse, than a farre meaner person dooeth.</p>
            <p>But now, how many princꝭ haue you, whiche through

be ashamed to weare it, fearyng lest some fine expositor
myght tourne all his pompe and solemuesse of royall

            <p>Now lykewyse what saie you to <hi>Courtiers?</hi>

doe take it for a sufficient furniture of their roomes, as

not how rasshely, whiche (on my faith) I wonder what

dooe almost neither heare, nor wote what they saie,
whan onely with theyr lippes thei make a certaine bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zyng,
no whitte procedyng from the hert. How be
it (to saie the trouthe) it is a commen tatche naturally
geuin to all men as well as priestꝭ, to watche well for
theyr owne lucre: for none is so vnskilfull, that in this
poinct can not skanne the lawes to the vttermost. But
in case there be any waight or charge thereon depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng,
that the clergie hath politikely learned to cast on
others shoulders. For like as princes are wont to
ordeine vnder theim many <hi>Deputies</hi> and officers, who
likewyse dooe substitute <hi>Subdeputies</hi> in theyr steedes,
so dooeth the <hi>Clergie</hi> of theyr goodnesse and singuler

Than againe priestꝭ that are named <hi>Seculers,</hi> as dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

commende the same to those of a straighter rule. But
all with one assent dooe can theyr charge on <hi>Friers nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,</hi>

same to <hi>monkes of the charterhouse,</hi> in whiche onely order,
holinesse as in hir graue lyeth hydden, yea and so hyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
as scant at any tyme she can be seen. Likewise
holy fathers of Rome in tendre consideracion of the
daiely businesse, wherwith thei are occupied about their
money haruest, are faine to put bishops in trust with all
other too too <hi>Apostolike</hi> labours. But bishops disdeigne

my hert</hi> (saieth he) <hi>to know wysedome and learnyng,
and lykewyse to know errours and folie:</hi> wherin ye must note
this well, how it maketh muche for my dignitee, that he
putteth folie in the latter place, namely seyng the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiaste,</hi>
or churche preacher wrote it, and pardie ye
know how the church ordre willeth, that who so is first
in dignitee, shall goe last in place, to the ende, that how
euer in other poinctes, yet herein at lest he dooe obserue
the precepte of the gospell. But folie to be farre more
noble and excellent than wisedome, I wene I can proue
you by witnesse of the <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> who so euer was
autour of that boke in the .xliiii. chapitre of the same:
whose text surely I holde it not best to recite vnto you,
before ye somewhat shall haue ayded the <hi>induction</hi> of
myne argument, with aunswearyng handsomely vnto
me, lyke as <hi>Plato</hi> introduceth those that dispute with
<hi>Socrates</hi> to dooe. So fyrst I demaunde of you, what
thyngꝭ to your iudgement ought soonest to be kept close
and hydden, other those that are precious and rare to be
gotten, or other that are vile &amp; dogchepe in euery place?
dooe you holde your peace? Now surely how euer ye
woulde dissemble, yet shall this olde greke prouerbe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
for you: <hi>the waterpotte is sette behynde euerie dore:</hi>
the auctoritee of whiche prouerbe let none of you be so

and in sadnesse I can not thynke, that any of you all is
so madde, to leue golde or precious stones in the hiegh
waie: naie rather ye laie theim vp in your most secrete
closettꝭ, and yet, that snot uffisyng, ye double locke them
in the strongest coffers ye haue, wheras durt ye leue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
still on the dunghill. Ergo, if that be hydden,
that is more precious, and the other vile thyngꝭ are left
abrode as vntended to, is it not manifest now, that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
whiche he forbyddeth to be hydden, is farre more
vile than folie, whiche muste accordyng to his rede be
locked vp and kept as close as maie be? And now I am
content to reherce you his owne woordꝭ, (whiche are)
<hi>Better is the man that hydeth his folie, than he who hydeth his
wysedome.</hi> But what saie you to this that scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth
to fooles a certaine benignitee, and gentill
whitenesse of nature, condemnyng wysemen for proude
and despisours of all others saue theim selues? For so
dooe I plainely take the meanyng of the <hi>Ecclesiaste</hi> in
the .x. chapitre. <hi>But a foole (saieth he) that walketh in
the strete, beyng hym selfe vnwise, supposeth all men to be fooles
as he.</hi> Now is it not (I praie you) a signe of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedyng
gentilnesse in hym to make euery body his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
and felow? that wheras none so base wil not meane<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
stande yet in selfe reputacion, his curtesie is suche to
dele euery man a fleese of his praise. Therfore <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
beyng so great a kynge, was naught ashamed of
my name whan he saied in his .xxx. chapitre, <hi>I am most
foole of all men:</hi> Nor <hi>Paule doctour of the gentiles</hi> thought
scorne therof, when writing to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> he said:
<hi>I speake it as vnwise, that I more than others. &amp;c.</hi> as who
<pb facs="tcp:1818:69"/>
saieth it were a great dishonour for him to be ouercome
in folie. But here (loe) me thynkꝭ I heare how I am
hissed at by some of these greke professours, who study
scripture in that tounge, and make as though other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
at these daies saw nothyng, nomore than crowes

they saie)? <hi>and how mete a witnesse for dame Folie to bringe

dreameth it to be: for in these woordes he wolde not be taken for
more foole than other, but whan he had saied, They are ministers
of Christ, and so am I also, to the ende yet he shuld not be holden
for a vainglorious vaunter in that he made him selfe coequall with
the other, he added as by correction, I more than other, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
therby, how not onely he was matche to the other apostles,
but somewhat also their superiour: whiche althoughe he woulde
shoulde be taken for verie trueth, yet lest the arrogant auowyng

<pb facs="tcp:1818:70"/>
thought good to bringe in for a prouffe and corroboraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

nothyng makyng for the mattier, they bee so

tell me, what thyng maie be to harde for these doctours

(I had almost blabbed foorth his name againe,
but I feare me I tell you of the <hi>greke adage</hi>) coulde
draw out of Lukes woordes, the construction of a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
nomore agreable vnto Christes meanyng therin,
than fyre is with water? For Christe whan the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

it becometh good seruauntꝭ most constantly to take
theyr maisters part, and defende hym to theyr powers,
<pb facs="tcp:1818:70"/>
as confederates in league dooe one for an other, to the
ende yet he myght driue all confidence in suche maner
defence out of his <hi>Apostles</hi> hertꝭ, axed of theim, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thei wanted ought, what tyme he sent theim foorth so bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without any maner prouision, not geuyng theim so muche as
shoes to saue their feete from thornes and stones, nor yet a wallet
to put their meate in? wherunto whan thei had aunswerd, that
thei lacked nothyng: But now</hi> (quod he) <hi>who so of you hath
a wallette, let him self it, and his bagge also, yea and who so hath
not, make he sale at lest of his cote, to bie him a swoorde.</hi> Now
wheras it is manifest enough, that all Christes doctrine
pretendeth naught but mekenesse, pacience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte
of this mortall lyfe, whiche of you perceiueth
not, what he ment in this place? For I take it plainely
that he saied thus, to geue his <hi>Ambassadours</hi> the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
the better courage, to the ende that they not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shoulde set no store by shoes, nor by vitailyng bagges,
but should cast awaie theyr cotes also, the nemblier and
more deliuerly to goe about theyr charge and commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the gospell preachyng, prouidyng theim selues
of naught els but onely a sworde, not that sworde that
theues and murderers dooe occupie, but the swoorde of
the sprite, beyng whetted all on <hi>Charitee,</hi> whose poinct
perseth into the inwarde partꝭ of mans hert, and cutteth
all flesshely affections thence, so clene, as naught re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
sauyng pietie, and ardent loue towardes god.
But marke ye now (of felowship) how warlyke this
famous doctour wresteth the plaine &amp; clere sence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<hi>For by the swoorde</hi> (saieth he) <hi>is ment defence against
persecucion: and by the wallette is vnderstode competent proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
we shoulde make of thynges necessarie to liue withall.</hi> As
<pb facs="tcp:1818:71"/>
who saieth, Christes mynde were chaunged, because
hym seemed that he sent foorth his <hi>Ambassadours</hi> not
halfe royally furnisshed, and therfore did recant here,
and call backe his fyrst <hi>Instructions</hi> geuin theim. Or
as if he had here forgotten those woordes, whiche afore
he spake vnto theim with suche a vehemencie, <hi>ye shal be
blissed whan ye be persecuted withall kynde of oultrage and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but make ye no resistence against those euisses ye shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer:
for blissed be the meke in sprite, not those that are fierce, and
stubb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that in other places he likeneth them <hi>to spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
and lilies,</hi> as touching the small care that thei shuld
take for theyr liuyng. Now, so muche lacked that he
would haue theim goe weponlesse, as rather thei shulde
sell theyr cotes from theyr backes to bie the same: and
sooner goe naked, than without a swoorde by theyr side.
Moreouer lyke as vnder the name of <hi>Swoorde</hi> (as he
expoundeth it) <hi>all maner of defence is conteigned, that maie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
iniurie, and violence, so vnder the name of bagge, is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
what euer prouision is made to liue withall.</hi> And thus
(loe) this depe expositour of Gods will and meanyng
setteth foorth the apostles complete armed, with iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,
bowes and arowes, slinges, and haulfe hakes, to
preache the gospell, and Christes crosse. Ladyng them
moreouer with great males, and paniers well stuffed
with vitailes, lest els perchaunce they might sometyme
departe from theyr innes vndyned. No not so muche
as this, myght any thyng moue this gaie learned man,
that Christ hym selfe shortly after rebukyng Peter <hi>bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the swoorde shoulde be put vp againe,</hi> whiche afore he
commaunded so ernestly to be bought: and that it neuer
<pb facs="tcp:1818:71"/>
was hearbe how the apostles did at any tyme occupie
sworde and buckler, to resist theyr aduersaries violence,
whiche nathelesse they woulde not haue sticked to dooe,
in case that Christes meanyng in these aforesaied woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
had been suche, as he expoundeth it to be.</p>
            <p>There is an other doctour likewyse of no lesse reputaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

An other auncient father, that satte by hym, beyng so

to tell you infinite suche exemples, so to knitte vp
shortly, I saie in my conceite, that <hi>Christian Religion</hi>

wysedome. But if ye axe me, as how? than doe no
more but consider how children, old folkes, women, and
fooles, are those amongꝭ others that shew theim selues
deuoutest, and most enclined to churche seruice, and holy
thyngꝭ, reioysyng to be present therat, in sort that euer
at Masse tyme ye shall see theim approche nerest vnto
the altars, euin through a certaine instinction of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
selinesse prouokyng theim to god. Thinke also
how the verie fyrst autours and founders of <hi>Christen
Religion</hi> were as sharpe aduersaries of all <hi>Science,</hi> and
men trustyng to theyr owne cunnyng, as otherwyse
frendly embrasorus of simplicitee and plainesse. Lastly
perpende ye thus, how no maner fooles are in apparence
more ideotelike, than suche as are totally rauisshed, and
enflamed with the ardent zeale of <hi>Christian charitee. So
loueshly thei deale their goodes abrode, forgette all iniuries doen

betwene friendes and foes, abhorre all pleasures and delites of the

woordes I would not ye should grate on, nor take them
at the woorst, but rather note the thyng in deede as it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
For fyrst ye must thinke, how <hi>Christians</hi> in this
poinct dooe fully agree with the opinion of <hi>Platos Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatours,
how the soule of man beyng drowned and entangled
in the fleshely bandes of the bodie, can not as being dusked with
the grosenesse of the same, beholde and take fruicion of the fight
of verie thynges as thei are in deede.</hi> Wherupon Plato
defineth <hi>Philosophie to bee a meditacion or remembraunce of
death,</hi> in as muche as it plucketh and retyreth the mind
of man from visible and corporall thyngꝭ, to those that
are inuisible and ghostly. Whiche effect is in death al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Therfore so longe as the soule within man doeth
rightly and in due wyse peruse the <hi>Organs</hi> of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
so longe is that man called sounde, and of good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screcion:

<pb facs="tcp:1818:76"/>
deteigned therwith, dooe in all theyr deedes, and liuyng
repine, and disagree from the whole bande of other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

<hi>Plato</hi> feigneth, <hi>that one of those prisoners was, that satte
bounden in a darke denne vnder grounde (as before I recited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

prisoner escaped out of the denne, and so commyng abrode into
this worlde, saw verie thinges as thei were in deede, returning
of good will to his felowes, to aduertise theim of the errour thei
were in, he was no whitte beleeued of theim, but rather laught
to scorne: For wheras he like a man of wisedome and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
seemed to pitie their madnesse and great blindnesse in mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng

it by the vulgar sorte of men, who commenly haue
those thyngꝭ in greatest price and admiracion,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene worldly &amp; goldly men.</note> that are
most sensuall and bodily, as whiche thei take to be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

as they are holy rauisshed aud geuin to the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion

there is no soule, because they can not see it at the

warre, but the vulgars not onely dooe not eschew,
but rather embrace theim,<note place="margin">Diuersitee of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> as supposyng they can not
liue without them. Than againe, some other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are entredeux and indifferent to bothe partes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
we maie name <hi>Naturall, as the reuerence a man beareth

the loue he oweth to his kinnesfolkes and friendes,</hi> with
suche lyke. Whiche saied <hi>Middle</hi> affections are had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in some degree and price amonges commen people,
though not so muche as the other. But holy men will
struggle to race theim also out of theyr hertꝭ, sauyng as
farfoorth as they be ghostly, and make rather towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
the hieghest part of man, whiche is the <hi>Sprite,</hi> than
any other flesshely appetites: by whiche conueighance
they maie loue theyr parentꝭ not as theyr parentꝭ, (for
what els begate thei sauyng theyr bodies? yet euin that
also ought to be referred to god the maker of all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges)
but loue theim rather as good folkes, in whom
the image of the sprite of god resplendissheth. Whiche
saied ressemblance they call verie felicitee, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
good that maie he had, yea suche (thei saie) as one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and none other, shulde be beloued, required, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
after. And so by this saied rule, dooe thei measure
lykewyse all the other partes and duities of this life:
wherby it cometh to passe, that what euer thyng is seen
here presently at the eie, if so be thei doe not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the same, yet sure they sette muche lesse therby,
than by other thynges, whiche maie not outwardly be
seen. Yea thei saie also, that euin in the churche sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
<pb facs="tcp:1818:78"/>
and woorkes of charitee there maie be tried out
bothe a <hi>ghostlinesse and a bodilinesse:</hi> As for exemple, <hi>In
fastyng thei holde it not sufficient for a man to absteine from ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of flesshe, whiche vulgar folke suppose to be the entiere and
perfect faste, vnlesse that he rebate somewhat also from his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
in geuyng lesse raines than before to his anger, or in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
his prides combeshorter, or in lightnyng him selfe of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
peize, to the ende his sprite maie the nemblier climbe vp to
the gripe and fruicion of heauenly thinges. Likewise in how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and receiuyng of the sacrament, albeit (saie thei) the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and circumstaunces vsed about the same, ought not to be
neglected, yet must we take them of them selfe alone to be little
auailable, or rather hartfull, vnlesse the other part, whiche is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
be added also therunto: that is to saie, the thyng it selfe,
whiche by those outwarde signes is represented. For represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
is the death of Christ therby, whiche death all Christen men
are bounde to folow and expresse, bothe in dauntyng, fordooyng,
and buriyng of all bodily affections, to the end thei maie rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
beyng restored to a new life, as vnited therby vnto Christ,
and made all one amonges theim selues.</hi> These misteries
are by godly and spiritual meaners scanned in this sort:
but leude folke commenly do take the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sse sacrifice</hi> to
be of none other effect, than as it were a certaine church
seruice, wherin they fully did their duities, aslonge as
they be present at it, standyng as nere the altare as thei
maie, to here the woordꝭ of the priest, or chauntyng of
the quyre, with other lyke ceremonies and obseruauncꝭ
vsed about the same. Now, not onely in these two poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes,
whiche for exemples sake I haue set to fore you,

rapte and drawen vp to the other, that are ghostly
and inuisible. Insomuche therfore as there is suche
diuersitee and discencion in all poinctes betwene these

(in my conceipte) that name maie rightlier be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
vnto holy men, than vulgar people: whiche ye
shall plainlier perceiue why, as soone as I haue briefly
(accordyng to my promyse) declared vnto you, <hi>how the
finall mede and gwerdone, that Christen men dooe loke after, is
naught els than a certaine sweete rauyng, and simple alienacion
of the minde:</hi> wherin eftesoones I requyre you, not to
be ouer scrupulous graters at the bare woordꝭ without
takyng the sense withall. Fyrst therfore ye must thinke,
that <hi>Plato</hi> didde euin than dreame of suche a thyng,
whan he wrote, <hi>that the passion and extreme rage of feruent
louers was to be desired and embrased, as a thing aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
most blisfull:</hi> because that a vehement louer liueth
not now in hym selfe, but rather in that that he loueth,
so that the further &amp; further a louers hert is distraught
from him selfe, to dwell with the beloued, the more and
more he reioyseth. And whan the minde seketh to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the body, nor occupieth the powers of the same
in the due vse, who will call this otherwyse than plaine
madnesse? For els why dooe you vse commenly this
phrase of speche? <hi>he is out of him selfe, and retourne man to
thy selfe, and he is come againe to him selfe.</hi> It foloweth
therfore, how muche more perfect, and the depelier su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
loue is impressed, that so muche the greatter, and
the blisfuller is the rage also. Whiche so beyng that
soulꝭ yet pinned within these bodily foldꝭ maie smacke
<pb facs="tcp:1818:79"/>
a little of suche a felicitee, consider ye than what a life
the sainctꝭ soules leade in heauen? whervnto the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of godly persons dooe with suche feruencie aspyre?
Seeyng there the sprite as vanquissher, and farre more
puissaunt, shall wholy drawe vp, and conuert the body
into hir owne nature: Whiche she maie dooe the easili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macion of the body in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the sprite</note>
seeyng euin in this life here, she had clensed and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the same through fastynges and other deuout me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditacions, to be the meter and more apte to receiue su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
a ghostly transformacion. And than againe, the
sprite selfe shalbe meruailously rauisshed and soked vp
by the farre more stronge and attractiue power of the
hieghest sprite of all, whiche is God. So that now
those holy men shalbe altogether transformed and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
by none other meanes yet to so hiegh a degree in
felicitee, sauyng onely because they as wholy beyng is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
out of theim selues, shall enioy and be participant
of that vnspeakeable heauenly sweetenesse, procedyng
from a pure and tight perfecte pleasure, throughe the
myght of god, the greatest good of all, that rauissheth
and attyreth all thyngꝭ to it selfe. Now albeit this
saied felicitee is than moste amply and absolutely enioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whan the soules at the resurrection daie beyng re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored

is naught els than a continuall meditacion or certaine
shadow as it were of that life to come, it chanceth, that
they yet liuyng, haue for theyr coumforte permission at
sometymes to discerne a taste or sauour of that hieghest
rewarde behight vnto theim: Whiche saied smacke or
sente, be it but a little droppe in respecte of that large
<pb facs="tcp:1818:79"/>
flowyng well of eternall felicitee, yet surely it surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and incomparablie excedeth all other bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
yea although all the delices of all men were who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ioigned and put in one. So muche (loe) are spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
thynges to be preferred before flesshely thinges, and
the inuisible before the other visible. For this vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
is euin the very gwerdone that the <hi>Prophete</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myseth,
Saiyng, <hi>was neuer mans eie sawe, nor eare heard,
not thought of hert yet compassed, what, and how great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
god hath prepared vnto suche as dooe loue him.</hi> And this
is <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> porcion, whiche by chaunge of
life shall not be plucked awaie, but rather be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitely
confyrmed. Who so euer therefore haue suche
grace (whiche sure is geuin to few) by theyr life tyme
to tast of this saied felicitee, they are subiecte to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
passion muche lyke vnto madnesse or witrauyng,
whan rauisshed so in the sprite, or beyng in a traunce,
thei dooe speake certaine thyngꝭ not hangyng one with
an other, nor after any earthly facion, but rather dooe
put foorth a voyce they wote neuer what, muche lesse to
be vnderstode of others: and sodeinely without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
cause why, dooe chaunge the state of theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunces.
For now shall ye see theim of glad chere,
now of as sadde againe, now thei wepe, now thei laugh,
now they sighe, for briefe, it is certaine that they are
wholy distraught and rapte out of theim selues. In sort
that whan a little after thei come againe to their former

either what they heard, saw, saied, or did than, sauyng

as it were through a cloude, or by a dreame: but this
thei know certainely, that whiles their mindes so roued
and wandred, thei were most happie and blisfull, so that
they lament and wepe at theyr retourne vnto theyr for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
