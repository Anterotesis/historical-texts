            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Ye are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led priestes, elders, shepheardes, feders, ouerseers, apostles, prophetes, salt, lyght, workmen, preachers, labourers, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, byshops, planters, waterers, fathers, angelles, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, Gods labourers, buylders, ministers of Christ, stewardes of the secretes of God, schoolemasters, sowers of spirituall thynges, Gospell preachers, ministers of the newe testament, seruantes of the faithfull, preachers of the attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Christes messangers, Christes seruantes, Catechistes, doctors or teachers, Euangelistes, Christes witnesses, souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of Iesus Christ, husbandmen, laboures, distributers of the worde of truth, informers of them that resyst the truthe, watchers for the health of mens soules. &amp;c. If your trauayles, doyngs, lyfe, and conuersation agree with these titles and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, so are ye faithfull and wise seruantes, and great is your reward in heauen. But contrarywyse, if ye vainly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute cause vsurpe these names, so that ye are not the same in dede, that ye are called in name and worde: what other thing are ye, then painted sepulchres, &amp; white daubed walles, whose portion is in that lake that burneth with fyre and brymstone.</p>

As it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the writynges of the Prophetes, when they preache so magnificently of the kyngdom of Christ to come. And these promises were amongest the people. But they were greatly hindered by false prophets and teachers,<note place="margin">Of the kyng Christ and of his kyngdom.</note> whiche dyd so expounde these Promises, as though this kyng after the worldly maner shold come into his kyngdom, with great magnificence &amp; pompe, and should aduaunce the people to hygh dignitie and power, that all of them might be made lordes and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Prouinces.

                     <hi>Zacharie.</hi> 9.</note> And this act of Christ was not done in a priuie and solitarie place, but he came in the lyght daye tyme vnto his people, as a begger, ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng on an other mans asse, which was nothyng pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared or redy to this purpose: in so muche that his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were fayn to helpe their poore kyng by casting on their clothes, that this pompe myght be somwhat likely. Wherfore the Iewes can excuse themselues no ways. For the prophecie is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ shall come into his kyngdome at Ierusalem, he shall not come after the maner of other kyngs, with a gret shewe of horses and armie, but as the Gospell saieth, meke: and after the Prophet, poore. As though the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phete spake it to admonysh them on this wise: Marke diligently the asse, and knowe that he is very Christe that sitteth thereon. Wherfore be wyse, and looke for no scepter, diademe, or kynges robes. For Christ shall come poore, meke, and humble, shewynge foorth hym selfe on an asse. This shall be all his magnificence and glorie whiche he shall shewe before the worlde, in the pompe of his commyng to Ierusalem.</p>
               <p>And this is the cause, why Christe vsed thys pompe before he suffred: and the matter is done also with great circumspection, as Christ declareth hereby sufficiently, where as he committeth all thynges to be done with such diligence: and where as he commeth not in the night, or priuily, but openly in the daye, and entreth into Ierusalem, not alone, but with a greate multitude of people, which goeth both before him and
<pb facs="tcp:1416:22"/>
after him, and aduanceth him with praises, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sonne of Dauid. And they wishe that this his king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome might be prosperous: And the matter is done so openly, that it must nedes be knowen in all the citie of his commyng. Let them behold the asse, the poore kynge, of the whiche Zacharie prophecied, and gaue warning to the Iewes, that they should not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the poore shew, humble and lowly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ, but should rather condemne their own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations: where as they thought, that Christ shoulde come gloriously in the sight of the worlde. He shalbe a kyng (saieth the Prophet) but yet with pouertie &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, &amp; without al princely reputation, if the matter be consydered after the custom of the world, &amp; of princes.</p>
               <p>This Prophete also speaketh of an other power of this kyng:<note place="margin">What is the power of this kyng and his righteousnes, and how it is ioyned wyth pouertie.</note> For he calleth hym righteous, and a saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and not riche, fortunate, or a glorious kyng before the worlde, but righteous and a sauior: whiche bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with hym iustice and saluation, and destroyeth synne and death, the enemie of synne and death, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che shall delyuer all from synne and death that beleue in hym, and take hym for theyr kyng, and are not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with the borowed asse. They that do this, haue geuen vnto them, remission of synne, and remedye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst deathe, to the attainement of euerlastyng lyfe. And althoughe their body dye, and be buried, yet is it not to be called death, but rather a slepe. And this it is that Zacharie wyll teache vs of Christ, when he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him these two names, that is, of a righteous and Sauior, whiche may be the deathe of deathe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the power of the deuyll, and by this meanes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs that beleue in hym, from sinne and death, and transpose vs into the kingdom of angels, wher is life and saluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1416:22"/>He left for the kynges of the worlde their glorie, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse, towers, palaces. Let them lyue in glorie neuer so muche, buyld they neuer so gorgeously,<note place="margin">The kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the worlde is no suche power as Christs is</note> be theyr ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell neuer so costely: yet haue they not this power, whiche this poore kyng had. For there is no emperor, kyng, or pope so mighty, with all hys power, that can delyuer vs from the least synne that is, and that can heale a small disease with all the richesse that he hath. And what shall I say than, that they haue muche lesse any power agaynst euerlastyng deathe and hell. But this poore kyng onely helpeth therin: and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against one synne, but against al sinne: and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agaynst my synnes, but agaynst the synnes of the whole worlde. He came not onely to take awaye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, but also death: and not onely death, but also the deathe of all the world. Tell this (sayth the prophet) to the daughter of Syon, that she be not offended for his lowe behauiour, but that she shut vp her eies, and open her eares, and let her not consyder howe poore this kyng is in syght, but what the word doth teache of this kyng: The pouertie is open, forasmuche as he commeth on an asse, without ridyng apparell. But in that he forgeueth synne, deliuereth from death, geueth saluation and euerlastyng life to them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that is not sene: wherfore the word therof is only to be herd, and to be beleued. So saith Zacharie: Tel the daughter of Sion, that she may knowe, and not be moued nor offended, that he commeth so pore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people, and dyeth so shamefull a deathe. For all these thynges be doone for thy sake, that thou by thys Sauior mightest be saued against the deuyl &amp; death: his purpose is to sanctifie thee, and to delyuer the fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> synne. All endeuours are in vayne, when we regarde
<pb facs="tcp:1416:23"/>
not the sence of the eares, but loke to haue it allowed by the eies. For this kyng differeth very muche from other kyngs. What so euer they do, they do it in great magnificence and pompe. But in Christe it is not so, which fyrst in Baptisme gaue vs this strength, wher by we ar deliuered from sinne, &amp; from death. Here the eies se nothing but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is included in the word and pronunciation therof.<note place="margin">The ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes &amp; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of Christ in bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisme, in the supper of the Lorde, and in the Gospell.</note> Here the eies see nothing then the breath of a man: but this we must be ware that we folowe not the iudgement of the eyes. The eies ar to be shut vp, and the eares to be opened, and the worde to be heard, Whiche teacheth that our Lord Iesu Christ shed his bloode for the remission of synnes and euerlastyng lyfe. These gyftes are founde for a suretie in the holye Baptisme, in the Supper of the Lorde, in the preachynge of the Gospell. This is true. But because of the simplicitie therof, they ar not thought to haue so great efficacie by the lauer of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; supper of the Lorde. But beware thy eies bring the not to this straite. It semeth an absurde thyng in the eies of the people, that he that came on a vile asse, and after was crucified, shoulde be thought to haue power agaynst synne, death and hell. No mans sight was so clere as to see that. But the prophet saith it. Therfore in this matter there is no nede of eies, but of Faithe and eares. Wherfore sayth the Euangelist: Tell the daughter of Syon. And the Prophete sayth: Reioyce Syon, be glad, daunce, and leape for ioye, O Ierusalem, beholde, thy kyng commeth. What maner of kyng? A righteous kyng and a sauior, which shall sanctifie thee, and saue thee. For he wyl communicate his righteousnes and saluation with thee, that thou myghtest be free from synne: and he wyl dye for thee,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1416:23"/>
that thou by his death mayst be delyuered frome eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death. Wherfore let not the great pouertie that is in hym offend thee, thy lyfe and saluation lyeth hydde in hym. Geue thankes for the benefyte, and vse it to thy comforte. For all these thynges are doone for thy saluation. Wherfore this is our kyng Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">The lyfe and saluation of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lyeth hid in the pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christ.</note> &amp; this is his kingdome and office. He handleth no taxes and tributes, he careth for no towers, nor for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnificence. But when we are now come to the marke of deathe, so that we can lyue here no longer: Then is it the office of this kyng, that we by his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and death may walke into Paradise, and say on this maner: I am sanctified through my kyng Iesus Christe, whiche for that cause came after a vile forme, and would be crucified, that he myghte sanctifie me, and that in me he might slea synne and death. He that beleueth this on this wise, as he heareth, and is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Gospell, shalbe sure of saluation. For ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was Baptisme ordeined of Christe, that by it he might put his iustice on the, and that his holynes and innocencie may become thyne by right. For al we are miserable synners. But in Baptisme Christ doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs, and saith: Geue me thy synnes, and take thou my rightousnes and holynes: Let thy death be taken from thee, and my lyfe put on thee.</p>
               <p>Wherfore this doctrine ought gladly to be receiued and the godlynes therof,<note place="margin">The worlde is vnkynd for this lyght.</note> then also it ought to be decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red in our lyfe, that God myght not seme to haue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen this lyght in vayne vnto the earthe. But it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth contrarywise, and the world is made oftentimes the worse for this doctrine. And here is the very diuel reigning with al his kingdom in the vnkynd worldly man, for all this greate grace of God. The matter is
<pb facs="tcp:1416:24"/>
playne, that there is nowe more auarice, couetousnes, crueltie, impudent lechery, aduoutrie and wickednes, then was before vnder the popedome. What is the cause? Uerily no other thing, then that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do not glad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly receiue this doctrin, as it behoueth them to do, but all set naught by it: They care more for golde and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, then this incomparable treasure, which <hi>Christ</hi> the sonne of <hi>GOD</hi> brought downe to vs from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

For this is the nature of this doctrine, to make men more ful of modestie and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, of obedience and chastitie. But they that cast it from them, becom seuen tymes worse then they were when they were without this doctrine, as examples doo testifie euery where. Wherfore take ye hede: truly the tyme will come, it will come without doubt, when God shall reuenge this vnkyndnes: and then shall it be sene what the world hath deserued by this vnkynd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes.<note place="margin">To vs is this spoken of the kyngdome of Christe.</note> Wherfore marke wel the hystorie of this gospel For seyng that the Iewes woulde not here the voyce

And when this is taught, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it gladly and louingely, and geue God thankes: least after that ye be fayne to receiue the deuyll, with howling, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. To the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thyng we are adhorted also by the example of the Apostles, and of other,<note place="margin">The example of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apostles.</note> which were in the trayn of this kyng.

And this is then done when accordyng to our abilitie, we helpe the ministery of the worde, that there may be plentie of teachers &amp; good men, which both by teachyng and lyuyng, maye be gouerners of the congregation. And also that they that nowe are ministers, may so be handled, that they may see to their duetie, and geue them selfe to studye, and not to fall away from their ministration for lack of lyuyng, or to be busied with other thyngs, that they can not haue leasure to doo theyr duetie.

These in that daye shall knowe with the Iewes, that they haue despised the righteous kyng and Sauiour, and therfore shall suffer the wrathe of God for euer. Wheras contrary, they that haue receaued hym, and confessed hym, and hath become parteners with him in all that they haue, shall obteine by hym iustice and euerlasting lyfe. The whiche thyng as our truste and wishe is, might chance vnto vs, through our Lorde Iesu Christe and Sauiour. Amen.</p>

he led them dry foote through the red sea, &amp; drowned their enemies, and giueth <hi>Manna,</hi> and suche lyke thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. This was a token that God would worke some new practise with this people, that it shold be a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and common wealthe. This was it also when he woulde punishe the Iewes, and ordeyne a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. For when Christe honge vpon the Crosse, the graues wer opened, and the dead came out, and went into Ierusalem, a strange Eclipse of the Moone chan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced, the vayle of the temple was rent. All this dydde signifie some straunge thynge to come, and an aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the old, as experience proued after that, wher as the seruice of the Iewes vanyshed away, &amp; Christe sette vp a newe kyngdome. This had the Iewes ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned often to their owne peryll. Wherfore the Apostles here come to Christe with a question: What sygnes should come before the destruction of Ierusalem, and the ende of the worlde, before the onely and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall kyngdome of Christ commeth?<note place="margin">The apostles asketh of the destruction of Ierusalem, &amp; also of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the world.</note> Christ answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as concernynge the destruction of Ierusalem: When ye shall see (sayth he) Ierusalem be sieged wyth an host, then know ye, that her desolation is not farre of. And therefore he counsaileth them to flee vnto the mountains, for gods wrathe can not then be pacified. After lyke maner he teacheth also as concernynge the last day: When ye shal se signes in the sonne and moon in the starres, and in the sea, in the fluddes, in men, and in heauen: when these thynges (saythe he) begynne to come to passe (for we must not deferre it, vntyll men thynke that all is paste, or make lyght of it, as though suche thynges hath chaunced before) then take good hede, and thynk that there is no time to iest and laugh at these signes.

But this oughte not to bee demaunded. For Christ sayth hym selfe: When this begynneth to come to passe, than must ye looke vp. And therfore I beleue that certayn thyngs, and perchance the most part, shal then come to passe, when that day beginneth to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Wherfore this is sufficient that Christe teacheth, where these signes must be marked and looked for,<note place="margin">Where the signes muste be marked.</note> in heauen, in the sonne, moone, and starres, in men, and in the sea. When some of them shalbe sene, ye must not loke, that all shall come to passe. But we muste make vs redy in season, that we maye be prepared to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauyng of this day.<note place="margin">Signes in the Sonne &amp; Moone.</note> Two maner of signes are sette foorth and shewed in the Sonne and Moone. Fyrste when they haue Eclipse. And although this be of a na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall motion (for by art may it wel be knowen before the signe chance.) yet it is a signe, as it is playnely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in Mathew. But likewise also may there be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes in the sonne that could not be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, but chaunceth sodeynly before they were perceyued of the prognosticators, or any thing thought vpon. As the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time when Christ was on the crosse. For the reason of the art is this, that the Eclipse of the Son is at the coniunction, or at the beginnyng of the Moone. But when it is in the opposition, as it was then, or in an other day of the moneth now it is not naturall. wherfore that eclipse was a great signe. And although we haue sene no such, yet it may chance sodenly before we loke for it. We also these .xx. yeares haue sene many strange things, which all ar counted strange &amp; seldom As that a bough did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe about the sonne of a great bignesse, that the sonne semed so to come downe, that

there were more sonnes then one, yet it is very lyke, that some such thing is signified hereby, which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer proued, nor saw before. Wherfore we haue sygnes sufficient in the sonne, that we nede not to be carelesse, but to looke for the true and healthfull comming of our Lorde.</p>
               <p>The other signes that Christ speaketh of,<note place="margin">The signes in the sea and waters.</note> are great rorynges and noises of the sea: wheras these thinges neuer chance co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly but with great destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

All these thynges are tokens that he must leaue this lyfe: so the world also, shal (as a man wold say) waxe sick, so that heauen, the sonne, the Moone, the starres, men, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all thinges maye signify and geue warning by a notable infirmitie and sickenes, and by miserable affliction, before it vtterly perishe. As touching the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in men,<note place="margin">The sygnes in men.</note> I thynke that they are fully declared in our tyme, that the most detestable pope, with his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine hath promoted and set forwarde these signes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the fearefull consciences haue bene much vexed, for as muche as they taughte this, that it was a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous synne, not to go to Confession, not to pray, fast, and here Masse. &amp;c. But in suche vexation, no manne coulde learne howe to rydde hym selfe out therof. For the trewe comforte (that is) the remyssion of synnes throughe Christe, was abolyshed. And there at laste was sette vp a very place of tourment, nowe by thys Satisfaction, now by that. So that I may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that was the chiefest myserye in the earthe. As in deede I sawe manye, the whyche coulde not byde this tremblyng and dreade, and dydde for very feare
<pb facs="tcp:1416:28"/>
and pensiuenes despaire, because they mystrusted that they wer not able to susteyn gods iudgement. For the popes doctrin brought vs to this opinion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we feared Christ as an horrible iudge. And many haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that case, that they thought there was no hope of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be loked for of Christ for them. And for that cause they prayed to the virgin Mary, that she would bee theyr patronesse, and make intercession for theym to suche a iudge. For no man knew any other thyng, but that Christ was cleane loste. Wherfore there was no other thyng looked for, but that we dyd tremble and quake, when we thought of this Iudge.</p>
               <p>Wherfore thynk this, that the greatest part of this signe is past. And I iudge likewise of the celestiall si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes, that the lest part of them remaineth.

But neuer the lesse we must be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng slacke in caryng therfore, that we may be redy to mete at that day, As Christ hereafter dothe exhort vs so to do.

For this punyshement is not for you, but pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uided for them, on whome ye made complaynte. Wherfore take this comynge, as the comyng of youre saluation. For I come not to condemne you to helle, but to delyuer you out of this wycked, frowarde, and corrupte worlde, and to separate you from the dyuell and his garde: and to put you amongest the angels, where ye shall suffer no euyll, but haue the fruition of euerlastyng lyfe.</p>

no other thynge foloweth hereof: but that the trees bryng foorthe buddes, and after that spreade abroade theyr leaues. Then it is the common saying: Wynter is gone, and goodlye Sommer draweth nyghe: We gladly let wynter depart, and imbrace pleasant Som<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer at hys commyng.</p>
               <p>Therfore in his similitude of the trees, may we haue euident resons, declaring after what maner we ought to loke for this last day. For as after leaues commeth sommer: so when the earth shalbe moued, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens shall tremble, and when the sonne and Moone shall appere mourneful: let these thyngs seme no more dreadfull vnto vs, then when the tender leaues crepe forth of the trees, when sommer begynneth to come in.

But thei that feare God wil take hede therof. And because they proue by dayly exaumples howe soone they that stande, fall: they are weake hearted, and soone ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen. For they thynke it vncertayne, what shall become of them to morowe. Perchance the houre wil come, when thou shalt be most vnready, and dydst not see it before: orels thou shalt be entangled with this or that sinne. Then art thou vndone, and this ioyfull day shalbe chaunged into mourninge.</p>
               <p>In this doubt Christ leaueth vs not comfortlesse,<note place="margin">What is to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not sodayn vnto vs?</note> but teacheth christen men, howe they shall bee rydde from this pensifenes, and sayth: See that your heart be not ouerladen with surfet &amp; dronkennes, and with the cares of this lyfe, least this daye oppresse you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.

neither as the Pope dothe, commandeth to cast away all thynges, to lyue oute of the worldes trouble.

               <p>But in this place it is to be noted, that God can not well be prayde vnto, neyther can the prayer bee true, when a man careth not to leaue certayn vices, and to amende his lyfe.

For that was plainly spoken of before in the Prophetes, That Christe should haue no corporall kyngdom, but that he should be a prophet lyke vnto Moses, and yet should come with an other kynde of doctrine, then Moyses dyd. This deede the Iewes wel know. Wherfore when this chanced by &amp; by after the bandes of Iohn, and Christe preached of eternall lyfe, and of the kyngdome of God: it seemed good to Iohn to sende hys disciples vnto hym.</p>

This was a very torment to the Iewes The Phariseys dyd fast, payd tithes, and endeuoured with all their study to represent the lawe: and thought that they had no nede of any gospel, of any Christ, but that all other thynges were without peryll: and that god coulde not but receaue them into heauen, for their fastes, prayers, almes. &amp;c. These be riche and perfect sprited men, which haue no nede of god and his grace, and this is very true, that this doctrine of Moyses is necessarie, and that men ought to be indued with this discipline and instruction: euen as in an Empire or kyngdome there must nedes be had somners, &amp; hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to execute corporall punyshement on theim, that wyll not obey the lawe, that steale, that commytte ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutrie and slaughter.

And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Disciples asked of hym, why he was so greately troubled? he answered: I feare death.

(sayeth he) I haue kept gods preceptes very straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet I can not be without the feare of death:<note place="margin">Workes can not quiete the conscience of a synner.</note> for I knowe that gods iudgement is not lyke vnto mans.

               <p>Thus saith also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet Esaias of Christ, as Christ saith here also, the lord hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me a learned toung, that is, God hath put this word in my tongue, that I may at due season speake with the weary, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dreadfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.

And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the lawe, but only by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel. This is a chereful &amp; happy tidinges that Christ hath satisfied for oure synnes. This belongeth to the poore, saith Christ: this is myne entent. For with the righteouse I haue no place, which wil not be rebuked as synners, which persecute the gospel, &amp; condemne it as heresi, saying, that good workes are forbid therby, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these words are blasphemous against Moses, &amp; the lawe. Wherfore Christ saith after: blessed is he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not offended by me: ye truly blessed.

that he condemneth the righteous, and suffreth them not to be in his kingdom, that he is redy to geue heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sinners. What kind of doctrine is this (say they?) wherin is no respect of good workes, and wherin the wicked haue such an easy way to heauen. Christ could not be scotfree from this sclander amongest his owne neither can we be, where as we are so bacbited of our aduersaries, that we teache agaynste good workes, &amp; make the way of saluation to easy. But in thys place is a sentence: Blessed is he that is not offended in me. For if thou consider Christes doctrine well, thou shalt perceaue, that this doctrine is not against good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, as the Papisticall dothe falsely report this by vs. This we teache, that these thynges are necessary, and earnestly to be cared for, that nothing may be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the word and conscience. Wherfore the gospell dothe not disanull the Ciuile power, it dothe not abro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gate the offices of the Maiestrates. Why then doth it offende thee? and why doest thou imagine that it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byddeth good woorkes? The Gospell dothe not disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe neyther forbydde good workes:<note place="margin">The doctrine of the Gospel forbyddeth not good wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes, but the trust in them.</note> But it forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thys, that when wee muste nowe dye and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte into an other lyfe, and when we are broughte to our straightes, that then we put no trust in oure own rightuousnes &amp; workes, &amp; that we haue no more succour remaynynge, but onely in Christe, and muste stycke to his merite and satisfaction only, that by him we obtayne grace and euerlasting lyfe.</p>
               <p>For God geueth suche a body vnto vs to this ende, that we should not be idle as long as we liue, that we walke on our fete, put our handes to worke, that we speake with the mouthe, and see with our eies. &amp;c. And for this hath he put forthe his worde, the tenne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1416:36"/>
that we might compare all our workes with them, and not do contrary to his glory, and the profyte of our neighbour. This gospell doth not onely permyt, but also commaunde vs to doo it diligently. But now when a man is alone, and voyd of all these thynges, and gothe out of the world to the iudgement seate of God: then dothe the gospel teache the, to go an other ways about: wherfore if thou haste done that is godly in thy life, thou couldest not maintayne other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the name of godlynesse in this life, thou muste thanke God for that gifte. But in death, beware that thou put no truste in this godlinesse, as though thou hadst deserued heauen therby: but yeld thy self wholly to this king Iesus Christ: whose office it is (as saith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Euangelist) to help y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blind, lame, lepres, the deafe, and dead, to preach to the poore, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to comfort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> troubled consciences. For he is sent from God the father, not to punishe vs for our sinnes, but to profite vs, to susteyn and comfort vs. They that wil not vse hym after this sort, but are offended rather with him, and despise him as the Iewes and the hipocrites doo yet to this day: Those shall he represse at his tyme. And this is one of the offences that ar to be auoyded. Then also is Christ an offence, when men dare not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse hym for fear of the crosse, and fall from hym in temptation. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more it is called an offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, when we haue more respect to our hart and conscience, &amp; what is their entent than to the gospel: That is, when the sorow of our worke &amp; syn is greater, then comfort for Christes mercies sake. This is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon offence, wherby al christen men at vexed.<note place="margin">Christ an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceful prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</note> So is Christ euery wher in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world an offence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful teacher, as he wil shew more plainly after this gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that men by this doctrine are offended, &amp; begin to
<pb facs="tcp:1416:37"/>
despise and persecute it. And that the worlde shall be iudged for this, the sermon of the three cities, Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum, Corazim, &amp; Bethsaida dothe declare. Likewyse the greuous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plainte of Christ against the Iewes, is this, where he declareth Iohn that rigorouse teacher of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, dyd eat only hony and locustes, dronke water, &amp; liued a hard life. But what preuailed he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? ye said, that he had a diuell. But I, saith he, eate, drink, &amp; shewe my self moste full of humanitie to all men, &amp; they call me a drinker of wyne. The adders are so froward that no man can satisfie them. Yf a man lyue at libertie, he is blamed: yf he lyueth straightly, he can not please them. What shall we do then, to please the froward worlde? It wold be pleased very well, yf all that it doth were allowed, where as neuer the lesse it dothe nothing that good is. Suche offences must be paciently suffred.</p>
               <p>For if it wer in such a hard case, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ taught him self,<note place="margin">wicked world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lings can not abyde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nor the preachers therof.</note> &amp; al things were full of his miracles, that the blinde dyd see, the lame go, the dead rise, &amp; it yet could nothing preuayle herby, but that the word was des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised: Yea rather Christe the auctor of this doctrine, was moste shamefully crucified, the Apostles driuen out of Iurie, &amp; no where safe in al the worlde for this words sake: what maruell is it then, if the worlde ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the gospell without mercy, &amp; resiste it, &amp; handle it moste vilainously? Such was the fortune of Christ &amp; his apostles at that tyme, so that it may seme more maruelous in them, because they did not only preach, but also wrought many notable &amp; famous miracles. Wherfore we must endeuoure oure self to beare this miserie of the worlde, and to take this rudenes wel a worth. For the fortune of the gospell shall neuer be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1416:37"/>
otherwyse. It is a doctrine, wherewith men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes offended: and thei be not of the common sorte, but men very holy, righteous, wise, and mightie in the worlde as experience teacheth. Blessed are they, that knowledge, that this is the word of God, they are in good case, and haue both confort and helpe against these offences. But they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knowe it not, are inflamed for their good workes sake, they fall from this word to their owne righteousnes, and thinke that this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is full of offence and sedition. And this yt is to stumble and be offended, and yet it chaunceth to them, whiche before the worlde are counted moste holy.</p>
               <p>Wherfore we haue a iuste cause to complaine with Christ of the obstinate blindnesse of the worlde: We haue songe vnto you, and ye wold not daunce, and at oure lamentable songes ye wold not lament. For neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of the lawe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 11.</note> neither of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, further and moue men, either to lament, either to reioyce, that is, neither, will they suffer theyr sinnes to be rebuked, neither geue place to confort against their synnes, They will neither be blind nor yet see: As the examples of oure aduersaries the Papistes, are at hand to proue this. And now muste we learne the other thing also out of his gospell, that the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is suche a doctrine as is so vnkindly, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly despised in the worlde: that all men be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at it, seing kinges, Princes, Pope, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, Bishops, Priests, Monkes, citizens and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stikes, that is, all the mighty and excellentest in the worlde do not only not receaue it, but also scorne
<pb facs="tcp:1416:38"/>
and persecute it. Suche was the fortune of Christe for all his miracles. For what cause had he els to say Blessed is he that is not offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with me? if it cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced so to thee O Christ, wheras thou mightest haue stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped all mens mouthes with diuine miracles, we maye wel refrayn from complainyng, when we are despised for the Gospels sake, and laughed to scorne, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. This doctrine of offences is very necessary, and specially in this our tyme, wherin this offence is most greuous. The fyrst doctrine is also necessary. For ther in consysteth our saluation and euerlastyng lyfe, that we knowe howe Crist is the Kynge of comfort, which is gladde to shewe his bounteousnesse towarde oure troubled consciences, and to comforte them in synne, and healpe vs to euerlastyng lyfe. For althoughe that the strayghte kyngedome of the worlde is hys also, yet it is not his principall kyngdom, seyng it shall not euer endure. This is the chief and euerlastyng kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christe, when we falle acquaynted with hys worde, which must be preached to the poore, that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we dye, we may say: I beleue in Iesus Christ my lord whiche can restore and geue syght to the blynd, whole lymmes to the lame, clensyng to the leapre, to the do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be the vse of speache, to the dead lyfe. He wyll be my hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he wyll not see me forsaken at my moste nede. For this is the cause, that he became man, and descended into the earthe vnto me. He that beleueth this truely, departeth from this myserable lyfe, to the celestial and euerlastyng ioys. The which thing that it may chance to vs, our Lord Iesu Christ myght graunt. Amen.</p>

But here they do all dispaire of their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes, and toke hold by that sede with a firme faith that shold breake the serpentes head. But the Iewes wil not walke in this way, they could not beleue,<note place="margin">

Wherfore when the Iewes sende Legates, and demaunde whether he be Christ? Elias, or any Prophete? He aunswereth, I am not. When they are instant, sayenge: Who arte thou then, and what recorde geuest thou of thy selfe?

Wherfore be attente to my worde: for he shall come after me incontinently, whiche was before me, and shall baptise you with the holy ghost, where as I do baptise but with water, as a minister. He standeth in the myddest of you, and ye know hym not. Wherfore this is my duetie, to be the voyce of a crier in wyldernes: that when ye heare the sound of my trumpet, ye may vnderstande that he is come.

<pb facs="tcp:1416:40"/>
and this is my word. Wherfore be attent, he is nowe amongest you, but ye know hym not. And this is my office, to bryng you into acquaintance with hym, that ye may receyue hym. For the next prophete that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth after me, is euen he hym selfe. As for me I am but one sent before: and this office doo I now execute and fulfyll my duetie prophesyed of before. He as yet is priuate and vnknowen, but by and by after me shal he come abrode with his prophetical office of teaching. Wherefore take ye good heede, least ye be deceaued in markyng of hym, and haue him in hygh estimation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you. Neither was there truely any other end of this matter, then as Iohn prophecied before. For inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently after Baptisme, Christe began to work myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in Galilee. He sent twelue apostles, and seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, to preache that the kyngedome of God was at hande: that is, that Christ was come. Here he is (sayth Iohn) Ioyne your selfe to hym, receyue hym, and ye shall not be deceaued. He came after me, but he was before me. For Iohn was elder than Christ six whole moneths, and yet he saieth, he was before me. This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the Iewes had ben a blasphemous worde, if they had at that tyme vnderstande it: as it is playne in Iohns Gospell, where as he saith: Before Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, I am. And this is as much to say, as this man before he was borne in the earthe, he was in heauen. But yet the Iewes dyd not vnderstand it: neuer the lesse this saying of Iohn is trewe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.</note> and dothe notifie to vs a person of the Godhed. As he declareth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereby, when he saith: I am not worthy to lose the lachet of his shoes. Here should the Iewes haue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently consydered, what maner of man this was, in comparison of whom Iohn denieth and abaseth hym
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1416:40"/>
self so muche, and saith him self vnworthy to serue hym in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaste thyng that is. The testimonie of Iohn cometh frely from his hart, that he is not worthy: Although (saith he) I be neuer so much sett by of you, yet in comparison of this man, I am nothing. He is wel content to lay asyde all his glorie, &amp; saith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he will take yt for a great renoume, yf he might be thought necessarie to this man in the moste bassest office of wiping his shoes.</p>
               <p>Wherfore leaste the Iewes should surmyse that he humbled him self to muche, wheras Iohn the author of baptisme executed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministerie of a prophet: he doth expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the trew meaninge of his baptisme, saying: I haue a signe also, as hathe the other prophetes. Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie did weare a chaine of woode: Esai walked naked and barefooted,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esa.</hi> 20.</note> when he prophesied to the Aegiptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; Ethiopes, that they shold be a pray to ther enemies, &amp; be spoyled of all they had. I am the auctor of a new word, and of a new signe.<note place="margin">Iohn decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> I preache that ye prepare the way for the lorde. Ye had no nede of this worde, yf the way were prepared now alredie. After that I washe you for a signe, that ye are vnpure and filthie: and I am the beginner of this lauer. But he that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth me, wil prouide a better baptisme, and baptise you with the holy spirit. All this was spoken, that they might not cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Christe vnworthy of their sighte, but should haue for a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance the words of Iohn: that because he had borne recorde of him, which should come foorthe so magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, with teaching &amp; signes, thei might not doubt in an euident matter. But what do they? thei hear Iohn, but they thinke not his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie sufficient. For as they beheaded Iohn: so they cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cified Christe, as touching whome, Iohns witnesse
<pb facs="tcp:1416:41"/>
was so faithfull. Suche regard of godlines had they, that they only despised not the word of God, but for that also killed the Prophetes, and nayled on the crosse,<note place="margin">The Iewes regarde not Iohns doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</note> the Lord of all Prophetes. And so goeth the matter now also. For Christ is condemned to the crosse: not only at his beyng here in earth, but nowe also in his members. We labour all that we can with Iohn, to bringe men into this way: for as muche as without Christe, ther is no remission of synnes, or lyfe euerlasting. But the more we go about to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe mens trust from their oune workes as vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to righteousnes in the sight of God,<note place="margin">Papistes can not abyde the word of God.</note> and to leade them to Christe: so much the more greuously are we condemned as heretykes of our aduersaries. For that is not agreable with their doctrine, as all do knowe. They sette foorth the Mounkes rules and masses with ostentation, they offer vp masses for the dead, they ordeyne seruice, they go a pilgrimage, they bye pardons. But what other thing is this, then to caste away Christe, and searche out new ways to heauen. And we can alow this by no meanes: and therfore can they not abstayne from rayling and slaundering of vs. The Bishops and highe Priests wold deale lykewyse with vs, as they did with the Iewes, yf they coulde. Only this is lacking vnto them, that they can not abuse vs at their pleasure. But what is the cause they are so greuously offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with vs? surely no other, but that we teache with Iohn to geue the glory to God, and to humble them selues before Christ, and iudge them selues vnworthy with all their seruice and good workes, to wipe such a great mannes shoes. For they can not chose but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1416:41"/>
graunt this, that Iohn was more holy then all they can be: and yet he saith, I will caste away all this holynes, yf I might but be receaued only into the felowshippe of his grace, to haue the ouersight of his shoes, I wold thynke my selfe an honorable man. This do we therfore testifie and proteste before the worlde, the Pope, the Bishoppes, Priests, and Mounkes, that be their righteousnes and holynes neuer so much: yet in this poynte they are nothyng to be compared with Iohn. Wherfore if ye do all that ye can by fastyng, and saying your prayers, only do this also: see that these things be caste at Christes feete, and lett them not looke to be iustified and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therby. But say this humbly: I do not refuse to be to lowly and humble. This do we teache, that they suffer Christ to be holy only, but they can not be persuaded so to doo. They crie out vpon vs lyke madde men, saying:</p>
               <p>Not only faith is sufficient, but we muste do good workes. And so they make not the holynes of Christ their ground and piller, as Iohn dydde, which is gladde to forgo his owne holynes, and count it not so much worthy, as the cloutes wherwith durty shoes are made cleane. He testifieth plainly, that his holynes is not so muche worth as a vyle cloute, and how much lesse worthy dothe he iudge it to wipe <hi>CHRISTES</hi> nose,<note place="margin">Papistes seke saluation by theyr owne workes.</note> and to do any higher office. This doth the Pope and his Churche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to doo. They extolle them self highly with their workes, and that they haue euerlastyng lyfe for them. And can not abyde that their workes and holynes should be counted as vyle cloutes.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:42"/>
Yea rather they doubt, whether they may iudge Christe worthie to haue this holines geuen in steade of almes and sacrifice. This heard the Iewes, but thei despised and persecuted it: and vnto this tyme is not this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt and persecution lefte. But as this mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes chaunced to the Iewes destruction, so shall it by Gods grace chaunce to the Papistes. Wherefore we muste diligently marke this example, where as Iohn that moste holieste man, which (as Christ saith) hathe none lyke him amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest all that are borne of women,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 116</note> which passed all mounkes and priests farre: yet dothe he so demitte and humble him self, and saith that he w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all his holines and workes is not worthy to be as a clout to wipe shooes. Truly this example is worthye to be folowed. Good workes muste be doone, and that with great diligence.<note place="margin">Good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> For so hath God comman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded in the ten preceptes. But when we come to that pointe, that we muste entreat of this man, as Iohn doth: all is to be caste downe at his feete, &amp; we muste confesse hartely with Iohn, that it is not worthy to doo him the leste seruice that is. Before ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hereof is had chief respecte, that thou art no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouterer, no thefe, no robber, that thou geuest almes, that thou seruest well in thy vocation. These thynges are boasted of amongest men, and had in highe esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>But when the matter is tried in the sight and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of God, be not lothe to say this: O Lorde I know that before thee, the excellentest thinges in me are nothing worthe. Wherfore iudge me not accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to my workes, I am willinge to byde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> losse of them. And can wishe no better thinge, yf so be I might haue my desier therin, I may thinke my self well blessed.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1416:42"/>
So doth Paule also to the Philippi. I am (saith he) an Israelite,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.</note> after the profession of the lawe a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risei, and as touchyng righteousnes vnblameable, so that no man can reproue me. It is not much sene, that one should stande so in these thyngs, against the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of men. Yet he saith: I thinke all this but chyppes, and all my trust and confort resteth herein, that I may be found not hauing my owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which is of the lawe, but the righteousnes which is by fayth in <hi>CHRISTE,</hi> whiche righteousnes belongeth to faith, as God saith. Wherfore that I might take fruite of this man, I caste away all my owne righteousnes as chips. The saying of Paule is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumelious against good workes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iohns. For he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to suffer them to be estemed cloutes, but Paule nameth them very chips, paryngs, or scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyngs. Paule the Apostle nothing feareth the reproch of vnciuilitie, wheras he vseth suche vnpure words. Suche examples are very necessary to maintayn the study of honesty and sobernes before the worlde, that men might not haue any cause to reproue vs. This righteousnes is belonging to this lyfe, and hath his ende with this lyfe, as it is knowen. Good men are put into the graue as well as the euill, the matrones as well as the harlots. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou wilt make thee a way to euerlasting lyfe, say this: Christ is my refuge, and his righteousnes, which he promiseth and geueth in Baptisme by his worde, and in the supper by his body and bloud.<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the righteousnes of faith and good workes.</note> At last I shall stand by hym as a poore worme. That so by this meanes there may be put a difference betwene oure righteousnes, whiche consisteth in the functions of this common lyfe, and
<pb facs="tcp:1416:43"/>
betwene the righteousnes whiche is before God. The Ethnykes also hath shewed honesty and sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in theyr lyuinge, and donne and suffered many thyngs for their natiue countreye, for the which they haue their due renoume. But when death commeth, nothyng therof will steppe foorth to take their part. For by suche righteousnes and good workes, we can not attayne to the remission of synnes. But whyther must we then go for righteousnes and such holynes, that is accepted before <hi>GOD,</hi> and alowed in the euerlasting lyfe? There then is this holy anker to be caste, this muste be oure refuge, that we come hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly after the precept of Iohn, and thynke vyle of oure self, or as Paule saith, shamefully. In the eyes of the worlde, this maye perchaunce seme excellent, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, it is but a cloute to wipe the shoes of the sonne of <hi>GOD.</hi> Whose righteousnes I wold gladly haue to be geuen to me, by the helpe wherof, I might be certayn of saluation, wheras for my owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes I ought not to refuse damnation in hell. And this is the cause that we say surely, that Mounkes, Priests, cooles, and all things of this sort, is destinate to damnation. For they applie not their works, to the obedience of God, to honest lyuing, to the auoyding of offence: but that they might hereby obtayne salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherfore they sell these thyngs also to other, and this it is to denie <hi>CHRIST,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Papistes sell theyr words.</note> and to mocke and despise him, as the Iewes mocked and despised hym. Lett vs beware of such abomination, and here let vs learne, how to aunswer suche Iuglers. Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou wretched ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be so mighty with thy workes and righteousnes, that thou mightest purchase me
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1416:43"/>
saluation therby? The vertue of Iohn, Peter, nor of any other, was euer of suche power. If it had ben otherwyse,<note place="margin">Monasteries.</note> they would neuer haue thought so lightly of it, as their words shewe. If the vse of the Abbeis, were turned to the instruction of youth, &amp; to the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp of them in scriptures, no man could reproue it, because it was done with great reason. But they can not be brought from their wicked order: They referre all to the obtayning of saluation.</p>
               <p>Wherfore yt were better, that suche Abbeis were cleane put downe, than that men shoulde fall into offence thereby, and straye from <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and lose both body and sowle. Learne therfore of this Gospell to lyue godly, righteously, and chastly,<note place="margin">Good works ought dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be done.</note> and to be diligent in good workes. For suche obedience doth God require by his lawe, and wold haue vs to do it. And when we do it not, let vs know that punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is redy for vs: and if he seeth vs not to amende by bodyly paynes, he will punishe vs euerlastyng. These things are to be done before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but yet before God say on this wyse: Lord, for as much as belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to my works and righteousnes, I haue no hope, only this I desier, that I may haue some lowe seruice about <hi>CHRISTES</hi> feete. For as muche as belongeth to my liuing, I haue deserued to be cast in to hell, but I call vpon his holynes, that he will sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie me with a better and eternall lyfe, then shall I be sure to haue euerlastyng lyfe. But the Popes and Bishops heare not this. For yf they woulde, Priests, Colleges, Mounkeries, Masses, and suche other ceremonies and seruice, wold sone be ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. Whiche things all they defende so stubbornely,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:44"/>
because they truste to haue saluation therby. So doth not Iohn, nor Paule, which renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their owne righteousnes. And a Christian man ought to say this with Paule: My righteousnes &amp; iustice, is but rubble and rubbyshe. And also with Iohn: My holynes is an vnprofitable cloute, when I compare it with the workes and holynes of Christe. But the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not abyde that such iudgement shold be geuen of their masses, vowes, fastings, prayers: thei murder vs, because we folow this doctrine, and teach not as they do, but shew men a better way of saluation. An euill mynd, an euill heart, neither can there euer be any hope of amendment in them. They seke euill, they shall fynde euill. Lett vs haue an eye to Iohns fynger, wherwith he poynteth vs whether to looke, leaste oure Lord and sauiour Iesus <hi>CHRIST,</hi> that most necessary capitayn passe by vs vnseen and vnknowen, and so we wander and stray from him to oure destruction. And because it should not be so, Iohn is sent to leade vs and shewe vs the way, that we might be saued. The which thing <hi>GOD</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graunt vs through his sonne Iesus Christe. AMEN.</p>

Who would not curse Bethleem for the lytle humanity therof, which in such comberance of straungers, fyndeth them not meane thyngs. The fyrst swathyng clothes are the mothers lappe, after that the, oxe stalle. With these delicates is thys babe cherished. The mother in her trauell, if she feared cold, had no other vesture but her clothes that she wore. Here was no man here to lend any thing to their necessitie. For what pourpose did the
<pb facs="tcp:1416:46"/>
Euangelist describe so diligently the great pouertie of this byrthe?</p>
               <p>Leaste thou shouldest forgett it at any tyme, and that these thynges myght make the sober, and amend thy naturall fearcenes, and that when thou haste heard yt done for thy self, thou mightest take confort therof, and geue thanks to <hi>GOD.</hi> And it was a long iorney from Nazareth of Galile vnto this toune Bethleem. They went further then it is from Saxon to <hi>Franconie.</hi> And herof a man may easely gather, that they caried not much stuffe with them, and that their swathelyng clothes and suche other things wer not very costely, so that he put on her smocke on the child and laid it in the maunger. For she could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hold yt in her lappe, she must warme the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, and dresse their couche, and do such other things, that wer requisite for an infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And in the meane tyme must the babe reste in the oxe stalle. Neither could Ioseph be lackyng to this necessary busynes. And it is lyke that he went about to some of the maydens of the house to gett water, and to do such other busines. But this is not written, that any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came to proffer seruice vnto them in this trauaill. They regarded it not, whan it was tolde them, that the mayde was deliuered of a chylde in the stable. Wherfore this towne is worthy to be hated with his great bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barousnes. For although Mary because of her pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was not thought so much worth, and yf she had bene vnhoneste, yet at this tyme had it ben the part of a man to shewe humanitie. But no man is gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therewith. The childe muste suffer paciently this great extreme pouertye, and looke for no better.

This is the historie. Whiche is set forthe to vs, to the entent, that we should graue this picture of Christes byrthe faste in oure hart: with how great miserie the Lord Iesus was borne in this wordle, that we might learne to geue God thankes for this so great benefit.

For on this day were we made one fleshe and bloud with the sonne of God, and he that made heauen and earth of nothing, is borne a man lyke vnto vs: only this thing excepted, that with this child all things are without synne. Wherfore we may boste magnificently, that God is become oure brother, oure fleshe, and bloude. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noum is not geuen to the angells, or diuels, but to vs men. Wherfore although the angells are more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t creatures then we, yet God geueth more renoume to vs, then to all the angells. For he was not made an angell but a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore yf we men could thinke and beleue this. as the greatnes therof requirethe: our mynde wold be moste redie to sett moste by God, to thanke him, and to obey his will gladly. When the Popes religion reigned, there was suche an histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie read vnto vs: That vpon a time the diuell came into the Churche to masse: And when these wordes, (and he was made man) were songe, and men made no obbeisance by bowinge of their knees, he gaue one of them a great blow, and rebukinge him said: Thou monsterous beaste, art not ashamed to be so litle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? why fallest thou not downe on thy face for ioy? yf the sonne of God had ben made oure brother, as he
<pb facs="tcp:1416:47"/>
was youres, surely we wold haue no measure in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing. And although this matter be not true, yet it semeth to be fayned of a good man,<note place="margin">The incarna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of Christ</note> which well dyd perceaue, the great renoume geuen vnto vs, when the sonne of God became man, and that not after the maner of Adam and Eue, which was made of the grounde, but he was made more conioyned vnto vs. For he was borne of the fleshe and bloud of the virgin Mary, as other men were, excepte this, that Mary the virgin was sole and alone, and he was conceaued without synne, by the holy Ghoste. Excepte this, that he is worthely named the naturall sonne of a woman. Adam and Eue were not borne but made. For God made man out of the earth, and a woman of his ribbe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2.</note> But how much nigher is Christ to vs then Eue to Adam, because he is oure bloud and flesh. We ought to esteme this renoume highly, and to haue great meditation thervpon, in that the sonne of God is made oure fleshe, and that there is no difference betwene his flesh and ours, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only synne. For he was conceaued of the holy Goste,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.</note> and God replenished bothe the body and sowle of the virgin with the holy Ghoste, because she was without synne, when she conceaued Christe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wared great with child by hym. And this is the only difference: in all other things he is lyke other men, in that he vsed meate and drynke, felt hunger, thyrst and colde as other dyd.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.</note> He was subiect to all suche naturall infirmities, as Paule sayth: in shape he was found lyke a man, he eate, he drounke, he was sorowfull and gladde.<note place="margin">The humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Christ.</note> This is truely a profound humilitie and subiection. For he myght haue vsed an other sorte, when he became man, after what
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1416:47"/>
sort he is nowe in heauen, where as he hath flesh and bloud as we haue. But yet he is not subiecte to naturall actions. He might haue done this at the begynning, but he wold not, that he might declare his singular loue toward vs, that we might haue therby sure confort and ioy, when we knowe that we haue a brother nowe in heauen, whose sure helpe we may stycke vnto, &amp; are bound so to doo. For cursed is euery man that doth not receaue him, and conceaue stedfast hope for his sake. And therfore is this history rehersed euery yere, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tender myndes might haue meditation theron, and geue God thanks, and say: My matter is in good takynge, I haue a brother, and he is made lyke me. But why he was made so, I do not yet tell (for this was the cause,<note place="margin">1. That this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuite might be confortable to vs.</note> that he might helpe me agaynst syn and eternall death.) But nowe I speake of the renoume of all mankynde, wherof we boaste and reioyce, that the sonne of God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man. Of this renoume may euery man boaste. But Christian men somwhat more then all other: for because this renoume shallbe to their endlesse profyte. And this is firste to be learned of the history.<note place="margin">2. And also that he myght ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vs humble and meke.</note> Secondarily marke also this great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Where as Christe the sonne of God dothe so humble him self, and communicate all his glory with fleshe, and wheras his hyghe maiestie, before whome the Angells tremble, dothe so demitte hym self, and goeth after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lykenes of a man. In heauen the Angels worship him, in the earth he serueth vs, and is subiect to our beggery. Seing then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of God doth this, this matter is not lightly to be sett by. Lett vs caste our selues away for his glory &amp; honours sake. And yf
<pb facs="tcp:1416:48"/>
aduersitie be to be suffered we muste not refuse it. For Christe him self hathe suffered likewise, frost, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, miseries and troubles, &amp; not only these: For whan he was borne into the wordle, he was poore in all things, he had neither place, neither bed clothes, neither stuffe for houshold, A maunger and oxe stable was his refuge. What should I desier any better state, seing my kinsman, ye rather my brother, kinge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is founde so poore in all things before oure eyes? Why should I refuse hardnes, seing the kinge of glorie refuseth not to take on him all things for my sake. Who am I? a sinner not worthie to lie amonge sharpe cutting flagges, and yet I lie softer than my prince, which suffered to lye in hay, and abhorred not the maunger. And yet after this, the case is so vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, that we stockes and blockes, are so nice and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that we can suffer no payne, and yet we se before oure eyes the example of Christe, what paynes he toke for oure sake. But it is not vnknowen, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we shall haue for oure foolishnes: And yet if we had any wit, we wold beware.</p>
               <p>Now therfore lett vs briefly reherse bothe these doctrines and lessons:<note place="margin">1. The honor of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> The firste is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we regarde our owne honoure, in that that Christe is made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This honour and renoume is so great, that if a man were an angell in state, he myght worthely and well wish him self a man, that he might be counted amongest them, which glorie and boste: my fleshe and blud is pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced aboue the angells: so blessed is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creature of man.

                  <hi>Prouerb.</hi>
               </note> A hyd treasure is no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. For all men passeth ouer it as they do durt, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not for it. So is it also with this moste ioyfull byrth, if the Angels had not brought tydings therof, and had not opened this treasure to men, no man
<pb facs="tcp:1416:49"/>
could haue taken the fruition therof. The cause why, is common. A man setteth not his affection on that he knoweth not. Neither doth this thyng delight or displease: but it is, as though it were not, and neuer shalbe. Wherfore it is one of the especiallest things in this Gospell, that the Angel by his sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth speake openly of this byrth, and sheweth vs this treasure, that we passe not ouer it, and that we be not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the presence therof, but come and take part of the confort therof. Wherfore he saith:
<q>I declare vnto you great ioy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THESE</hi> words are weightie. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shepheards were greatly astonyed at this meruailous light, and celestial shyninge, as at an vnwonted thyng, because there was sodeinly both in heauen and earth suche great light, as though all the earth had bene on fyer. To this hath the Angell respect, and applieth his words therto, saying: Feare ye not, as if he shold say: ther is no cause to feare. But your feare sheweth that ye knowe not what is in doing. For if ye did, ye wold put away feare, and reioyce at your owne felicitie. And I am come, to bring you tydings of great ioy, of a great work and miracle:<note place="margin">Gods messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers conforte the fearefull.</note> whiche thyng if ye wold well consyder, ye wold much reioyce. This is therfore the entent of this Angels tydings, to make men to regard it earnestly, and not to let it passe without effecte. Wherfore he speaketh of no common ioye, but of a great ioye, and of a thing moste necessary. For the diuell by synne hath brought vs to naught, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed all that belongeth vnto vs, so that we do not only sustayne originall synne, and therby eternall deth, but also that al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue are in his danger, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1416:49"/>
almoste we maye at euery moment, looke for his dartes in body, lyfe, and goodes. For all these things are in a thousande perils and casualtyes. Yea the Gospell testifieth, that the dyuell possesseth men, and dryueth them to madnes, so that it may be worthely said, that such a man is the fylthy puddle and syncke of the dyuell.<note place="margin">Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thorow sinne reigneth in men.</note> Suche corruption is engendred in vs by synne, that we haue no sure helpe in any thing in the worlde. I will not speake of the greatest misery of all, that they muste abyde the wrothe of <hi>GOD</hi> and eternall damnation. What is, if this be not the moste horrible and violent kyngdome of the diuell. And when we consider well, and compare both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, this myserie in the kyngdome of the dyuell can not be compared with this glorie and reward, with this great ioy, wherof the Angell preacheth he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re, that there is a sauiour borne for vs. Wherfore the Angell entendeth chiefely to remoue this myse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie out of oure sight? and to geue vs this chyld to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And let him know that he hath done the office of a good preacher, if he brynge vs to the true beholding of this sauiour, and to the knowledge of oure owne flesh and bloud. And doughtles if this were prynted in vs, all the plague wherwith the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell vexeth vs, should seme light, be it neuer so payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pernicious.</p>
            <p>But now let vs come to the moste requisite and necessary knowledge of this diuine worke of God.<note place="margin">Christ only ouercommeth Satan.</note> For the dyuell with all his poyson can be ouercome by no other meanes then by this godly power, of the which the Angel speaketh to vs in this place, when he saith: A sauior is borne for you. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s minde attai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth to this knowledge, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> synner oute of perill.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:50"/>
For than is the matter more depely consydered after this sorte: I haue bene defiled of the dyuel and wholy opprest, and ouerthrowen headlong into Gods wrathe and eternall damnation: but my myschance is not so great, but that I haue greater helpe geuen me from <hi>GOD</hi> agaynst it. That is, that God posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not mankynd after that sorte as the diuell doth, but he him self is made man, that of God &amp; mannes nature might be made one person. The diuell can not ioyne him self so nighe to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But God is made man, and yet he remayneth a man. And by this meanes he set him self more depely in mannes fleshe, than the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell can, which may enter into mannes body and vexe it, but he can not be made man, that the diuell and man might become one person.</p>
            <p>Betwene these two natures is ther alway remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a difference of persones, not only in substance, but also in person. But in <hi>CHRIST</hi> that is borne, these things be one. For the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God is made one flesh and one bloud, borne of the virgyn Mary; after the course of nature as all be,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 1. <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.</note> excepte that he was not conceaued of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but of the holy Ghost, and hath escaped the fylthy mark of the dyuell, and was borne with very pure flesh and bloud, wheras oures is full of synne. In all other things he is lyke vs, which was subiecte to all naturall actions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.</note> in all poyntes as other men. As sayth Paule: He was found in beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour as a man, so that all that sawe hym or heard hym, dyd affirme that he muste nedes be a true and naturall man, &amp; not any phantasme or appearing only, for he had all the properties, that belonge to this lyfe. And this is the ioy, as touching the which speaketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angel. I speake only of the glorie &amp; not of the fruite.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1416:50"/>
For therof is it wont to be declared in the history of the passion and resurrection. Now do we speake only of the glory, that <hi>GOD</hi> is so nighe ioyned vnto vs, that he is of my flesh bloud and soule, very man as we be. With this so great and meruailous glory hath he begon this matter, and aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced mankind therby to high renoume. And the Angell setteth this forth vnto men, and sayth: I shew you great ioy, which shall be to the whole people. The word sheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his mynde was rauished with some great ioy: He telleth it boldly to the shepheards. He wold that all men with hym shold know of this great honour, wherby mannes nature is come to such dignitie, that <hi>GOD</hi> whiche made all things, is become oure flesh and bloud.</p>
            <p>And if we wold ponder this well, although we had no other profite therby:<note place="margin">The byrth of Christ ought to moue vs, vnto mutuall charitie and loue.</note> yet wolde it make toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongest vs a great flame of charitie and loue. I speake not yet as I said before, of the profyt &amp; vse, but only of the glory therof. If we were moued ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly therwith, yt wold suffer no malice to remayne amongest vs. The reason is: Who is there that wold hate this kinde or hurt it, which is euen as oure God in body and sowle? shall we not for this glories sake, wher with God hath garnished vs, loue all men? do the best that we can for all men? The Angels are more excellent creatures, then we men are. But this glory is not geuen them. God was not made an Angell, neither an Angell was made God. Furthermore, the Angels are innocent and holy, which condicion was more agreable with Gods maiestye. But it semeth otherwyse to him, he choseth the viler creature, which was subiect to syn, which is hold captiue vnder the kyngdom of the diuell, and the tyrannye of death.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:51"/>
Whom the dyuel vexeth and troubleth extremely. He could not humble him self any lower. But should not we be stirred hereby to loue and charitie, to esteme one an other, and not to neglecte, but to proue mastries who can do other moste good?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note>Certayn of the fathers, and amongest them, (as it now cometh to mynde) Bernarde, thought that the diuell whan he was in heauen, did se before, that the sonne of God should become man, and for that cause enuied at man, and began to hate God, because he had not chosen rather to become an Angell, than a man, and that for this enuie and pride he was caste out of heauen. Whether this were fayned, or done in dede: yet wold the holy fathers signifie hereby, howe great is oure renoume in that that God became man, and tooke the very same mannes nature, which belongeth to vs all, whiche haue ben in the dyuels daunger, and captiue to synne and death. In what wretched case then are they, whiche are ignorante of this renoume. But yet are they much more wretched, which, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels or Apostles shew such things, that God hath visited mans nature, and tooke it on him, and made it Lord ouer al creatures: yet do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce? O how wretched are they that are not moued with this tidings? If one amongest many bretherne should come to be a ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, how wold al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other reioyce? how bolde would they waxe? As Iosephs bretherne may be an example of this. And this is a naturall zeale. But how cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth it that we reioyce not in such a great matter? that we are not moued? neither do geue thanks to <hi>GOD,</hi> that oure God hath taken oure flesh and bloud, and now sitteth at the right hand of God, Lord ouer all creatures?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1416:51"/>He therfore that wold esteme this, as it is in dede, wold loue all flesh and bloud in the worlde, for this flesh and blouds sake, and wold hate no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The only gloriouse sight and contemplation of the humanitie of Christ oure God, wold so chere vs &amp; replenishe vs with ioy, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we should neuer be angry with any man? Yea, and he that beholdeth this image continually, that the sonne of God is made man, wold not loke for any wrathful displeasure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christe, but hope for all goodnes at his hand. For no man is angry with him self, or hurteth him self. Now is Christ one of vs and a man. How could he hate him self, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say vs, which are his flesh &amp; bloud. And if this sight were well prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vs, it wold sone put away all exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of Gods wrathe out of oure myndes, as is Noes floud, the pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nishement of Sodom and Gomor. All that wold va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe away at such a contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if I wold muse of this only man, which is God, &amp; hath estemed mannes nature so greatly, that he became man. But be these things neuer so inestimable: yet some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are so mad, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they care not, they caste away this treasure, and set their mynd on other things, to heape vp riches, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase &amp; get, whereto mens myndes are wont wholy to be stirred. And this is the cause that we fele no ioy rise in vs at the tydinges of the Angell.</p>
            <p>Wherfore this thing may wel make vs ioyful and proude, that we are preferred before all creatures in this renoume, yea before Angels, and may boaste, and say: My flesh my bloud sitteth on the right hand of God, and hath the rule of all. No Angell or creature hath suche renoume, but my flesh and my bloud. This fier ought to melt as it were in one all mens hartes, and to inflame men with suche mutuall loue,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:52"/>
that we should embrace one an other with al oure har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes. But this is the continuall working of the diuell, to make vs forget at home, that that we lerned in the Churche. This enemy doth corrupte oure ioy with other cares, so that we neuer regarde this sight as we ought. If we had nothyng els but this renoume therof: yet wer it a thynge worthy to be reioyced at. But now besydes this glorie, this great ouerplus ther is also, that this man is <hi>IESVS</hi> &amp; a sauiour. And this in dede is the true cause, of this ioy that the Angell sheweth. And here I say agayn, that they are in a miserable case, which do neither heare, nor know these thyngs: but they are much more miserable that here and know, &amp; yet regard it not. For these words wold melte heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earth, and make vs not to care for death. For who is it that can thynke this suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, that a sauiour is borne for vs? This treasure doth not the Angel shew to the mother Mary the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but to you (saith he) to you is this sauiour borne, which is <hi>CHRIST</hi> the Lord.</p>
            <p>He speaketh with the shepheardes, whiche were Iewes,<note place="margin">What Christ is.</note> and were well acquainted with this word, knowing that Christ dyd signify a kynge and Lord. But a great parte of the people were deceaued in that they thought he should be a corporal king.<note place="margin">Christ is no corporal thing</note> But it was not so. For the Angell hath a higher respect, and saith almoste this: hytherto haue ye ben captiue vnder the dyuell, which hath persecuted you with water, fier, and moreyn. And who can comprise al his myschefe? Under his moste cruel tyranny are yow misers. He seduceth your myndes with errours, which hurte the sowle a thousand tymes more, than any moreyn can hurt the body. To yow (I say) to yow whiche
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1416:52"/>
with body and sowle are vnder this slanderous and hurtfull spirite, to yow is borne a sauiour. For with whom doth he speake?<note place="margin">Christ is the sauiour of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Not with the stones &amp; brute beastes, but with you men, and not with one or two, buth with the whole people.</p>
            <p>Why dare we than be so bold as to reproue the voyce of this Angell, when we take Peter and Paul for oure sauiour? But do we flee from hym, because we be sinners? For if thou say this: I haue nothing to do with hym, then will I demand of thee whose he shalbe? Was he borne for the beastes? For thou muste haue respecte to this, who he is: for if he wold haue ben the sauiour of anye other creature, he wold haue taken on hym the forme &amp; shape of that creature. But he is become the sonne of man. Who art thou? who am I? are we not men? yes truely. To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than doth this chyld belong more then to men? The Aungels haue no nede of him, the dyuels despise him. But we haue nede of hym, &amp; for vs is he made man. Wherfore we must count hym ours, that we may loke surely for helpe of him. As the Angell sayth: He is borne for you. And aboue: This ioy shall be great to all people.</p>
            <p>But is not this an honorable thyng, that an Angell from heauen bryngeth this tydings to men, and after that so many Angells come with gratulations and melodious verses, that we men should reioyce and receaue so great grace with tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes geuing. Wherfore this saying is vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable, that we heare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to vs is borne a Sauiour. For what other thyng doth he say than this? this byrth is not belonging to me, I can requier no part therof, I reioyse for your sake. But it is yours that are, that are myserable, corrupte, and damnable men. He is the sauiour of suche. Wherfore
<pb facs="tcp:1416:53"/>
embrace him: for you haue nede of such a sauiour, that thynk how ye might escape y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dungeon of syn &amp; death.</p>
            <p>The glory wherof I spake before, in that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God is made man is very great, but this passeth it farre, for that that he is a sauiour in things that be eternall and spirituall. He that knew this and beleued it, and had the fruition of a whole ioy, wold peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture die for ioy. But as longe as we are in this lyfe, we shall neuer receaue and know this ioye. For this lyfe is narow and straight, and we are weake. For if it were possible, that mannes mynde could truely esteme it, it wold not be able to hold it self for ioye. But for as much as this can not wholly be performed, let vs yet at least learne so muche hereby, that we may shewe mutuall loue, and cease from slaundering, deceauing, and other vices, by this maruelous example, that God is made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But here is perceaued a great infirmitie, this ioy can not perce so farre as it shold, &amp; we forgett both, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of the Angel &amp; also this sauiour, &amp; geue our self to customable vices, to couetousnes &amp; such like And this is a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we beleue this word veri litle. For if we dyd beleue it in dede, there wold be excedi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g great ioy inwardly in vs, because this sauiour is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs. In time of syckenes &amp; plague, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold haue a good hope, if he knew some remedie. And this hope should be open &amp; sensible. But here, wheras we haue put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs a sure remedy, against sin &amp; death, no man is made chereful therby. Wherfor we testifie of our self, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we heare this good tidings as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be a slepe, &amp; herby we declare our great frowardnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wheras we haue this great treasure before vs, yet we are nothing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by it.

            <p>This is the fyrst sermon, that was made after the byrth of Christ, as touchi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g this childe, which endureth after that for euer, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende of the worlde. Wherfore euery man ought dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to haue his mynd theron. For hereby is this mistery opened, how the angels are become oure frends, and brought vs ioyful tydings, commanding vs to put asyde al feare, for as much as this child is borne for vs, which is oure sauiour. This is an hygh, true &amp; most excellent confort in the which the mercy of <hi>GOD</hi> may be perceaued and felte very sensibly and conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that God for oure sake hath humbled him self so lowe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gaue vs his sonne, after a moste bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teouse sorte by a mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He layeth him in her lappe, and sendeth vs word and tydings, that he is oure sauiour. Let vs seke helpe of him in oure nede, let vs trust surely to hym for succoure: that all wrothe betwene God and vs may after this depart for euer, &amp; that we may vse all kynd of humanitie &amp; gentlenes one to an other.

God is to be blamed of vnrighteousnes, sith that suche thyngs are declared vnto men, and they regard it not, but despise their owne saluation, euen as the mad Papistes do, that thynke that this sauiour is not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, setting vp other besydes, to whome they may truste. But the sermon of the Angell is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure as touchyng this only chyld to be oure sauiour, that he as the very grounde of oure saluation, may confort vs, and replenishe oure hartes with ioy. And this man only is he that tourneth bothe the Angell, and also Gods eyes on hym self. He putteth not only this treasure in the mothers bosome, but also he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth hym vnto vs as oure owne, and all that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto hym, both in heauen and in earth.

Wherein the Angel wold vs to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> a sauiour is geuen vs against syn death and the dyuel. For these are the words of the sermon: Feare ye not, this day is borne for you a sauiour, which is Christ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. These are no mannes words, neither haue they their beginning of mannes hart. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wisest that be, know nothing of this. But these words are put out with a godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation. And we, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks be to God, are chosen to this felowshippe. For it is al one, whether thou readest or hearest these words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angell, as though thou hadst heard them presently of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angell. For the shepheardes sawe not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels, only they dyd see a light &amp; bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, they heard the words of the Angels, whiche yet are rehersed in sermons, and read in bookes, if we had the grace to learne them, &amp; put them in practyse.</p>
            <p>Now if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare this word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> angel, with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> word of Moses, which he heard of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> angels in mount Sinay, he shal fynd great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For this it was there: Al things wer applied there to terrifie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, almost both body and lyfe was in daunger by thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, lyghtning &amp; such other things. But here do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels preach to banishe feare, to make men cherfull, to put away dread, and to truste for saluation, and to begin to looke for better, and that they might be of a good courage, specially for this childes sake, which is called oure sauiour, &amp; is so named of the Angell, and entitled Christ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. For whatsoeuer ther is write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is, that we should always hope &amp; wayte for him, that is called Christe. For the law could do no thing against syn &amp; death, works, and euery mans righteousnes preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not. All the saluation was sett in Christ, that he might be trusted vnto in trouble. This doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> angels beholde, and testifie that it is he, in whom dependeth all hope of saluation and remission of synnes.</p>

If all them that are without Christ are damned, what helpeth the Mounkes rule or the Priests Masse to saluation? All things are subiect to damnation.

domb with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore when they reherse, reade, or otherwyse vse them, they neither vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ceremonies. Al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they regarded not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by it men might be certified of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meaning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words, that are dayly vsed in hearing, reading &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. But he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not wel stirre vp other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is a slepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The preacher must be earnest &amp; vigila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For if he be cold, he will make his audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wearie be they neuer so atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te: as we may se this true by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, for he was dalying in al kind of Idlenes &amp; pastance. Wherfore he cold not take hede to this sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And although he set it forth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> versicles &amp; lessons as we do, yet they know nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of it, nor vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it. And bi this meanes both these things are amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the papistes. They reade in the Gospel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a sauiour is borne, they singe it in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if this child had not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could be saued, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this saluation is for al men. Yet neuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lesse they cal on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> virgin Mary, they faste, they worship saints, they go on pilgrimage to their relikes, they hire &amp; bye masses. What is this then to make an other sauiour, &amp; not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> testimonie of this sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to set vp Mary &amp; other sayntes, yea and the beggerly works of men, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rome of this sauiour &amp; borne child.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Good prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers helpe much.</note>Wherfore we haue no small cause to pray to God, for couragious &amp; earnest preachers, to enke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light of this doctrin, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we not only heare &amp; reade, but also vnderstande: wher suche preachers be not, ther is no other hope, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we falle therby in peril, as it is now. What good can a nutt do, if thou can not come by the kernel? what profiteth a treasure, if we haue no power to bryng it abrode? The sermon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angel is euident inough: To you is borne a sauiour. Yet it is not so pythye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an old papistical doctor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perceaue it. For if
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1416:57"/>
he did perceaue it, he wold not councel men to moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie, to pray vnto sayntes, to purchase the merites of men, &amp; to seke other sauiours. But wher God sendeth a diligent &amp; wittie preacher, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can stirre vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vehemen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie of such words in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mynds of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearers, he geueth a great power by this doctrine, to iudge of all false doctrines &amp; deceytfull spirits. Neither is it possible,<note place="margin">By the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels doctrine are al false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to be iudged.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the dyuell tourneth him self in to all sorts, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he must nedes be perceaued, and reproued with his craftes &amp; deceytes. For not as much as the spirituall wickednes in heauenly things can lie hyd from him. As Paul doth boste of this also 2. Corinth. 2. that he knoweth the mynde and the thought of the dyuell. And here is nede of no other wayse then to compare this doctryne with this chyld, whether they do agree.</p>
            <p>The Papacie extolle them selues hyghely for their gorgiouse ceremonies &amp; rites. But who may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al is idolatrie, in that they beleue to merite sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation therby: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, men put their truste in them to be saued therby, and that they be pleasant to God as his due seruice: wher as yet it is plainly declared in this place, as touching this chyld, that he must be oure sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. Wherfore the Pope and the Bishops may be worthely accused for their false doctrine and wicked seruice. For al theirs agreeth nothing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this doctrine of the Angell. He that hath this sauiour as a rule, is neuer ouerseen, is neuer deceaued, whatsoeuer he take vpon hym to Iudge.</p>
            <p>Wherfore this thing is most worthie to be prayed for, that the light of this childe may neuer go out of oure syght, which openeth vnto vs all the wycked prankes of the dyuell, and of the worlde: that we may be sure agaynst all things, and soone confounde
<pb facs="tcp:1416:58"/>
with oure iudgementes whatsoeuer is set vp against this childe, for the doctrine of oure saluation. This matter hath not nede of farre compassinge and many words, the meaning is playne, It is not so in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the Angell. Wherfore do not thou contrarie this counceller sent from <hi>GOD,</hi> which teacheth me on this sorte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to me a sauiour is borne, whose name is <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and not Peter, Paule, or the rule of Augustin, or of Frances, not masses, pylgrimages, to saintes, or pardons. The proper office of this sauiour is,<note place="margin">The office of Christ.</note> to minister vnto me al things necessary for oure sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Go not about to take this doctrine from me, I wil not suffer my eyes to be bleared with any other. This sermon of the Angell is passing all comparison, at the whiche a great multitude of Angels mustereth together, and setteth vppe quiers of Musike. And the syngular order and processe of their verse is as much to be marueyled at, as the sermon it selfe. For they singe such a <hi>Genethliacon</hi> and byrth verse as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of before in the worlde. And the words therof are these:
<q>Glorie be to God on hyghe, and in earthe peace, good will towards men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIS</hi> hymne consysteth of three partes. The fyrst parte is not only so to be taken, as thoughe the Churches office were thereby appoynted, what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for it to do: But it is also as a Prophecye what effect should herof ensue, and that <hi>GODS</hi> great glory should ryse herof. And the meaning of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Angels sermon is no other, but that it was farre other wyse before this childe was borne, and that ther was blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy and Idolatry at that tyme in the worlde.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1416:58"/>
For whatsoeuer is without Christ, be it neuer so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and glystrynge,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> yet can it bee counted no other thing then blaspheming of God. Ther can be no wais to worshyp and glorifie God, but by this chyld. For in Christ only may the tru bounteousnes, mercy, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie of God be knowen, where as he spared not his onely begotten sonne, but sent hym into the fleshe for our sake. The greatnes of this benefite causeth the herts to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue true loue trust &amp; hope toward God, &amp; to geue him largely thanks. This fruit song y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Angels to be to come.

            <p>Yea, and this was aboue all other, a most damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idolatrie, where as their good entent was to God and to hym they did sacrifice, fast, vexe their bodies, &amp; spared not lyfe it selfe: yet all was diuellyshe, and of their owne imaginations. In these thyngs was gods glory bestowed. This is the shame &amp; blasphemy, wher with God is dishonored throughout all the erth, wher as Christ is not knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">God is diuers<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly dishonored in the world.</note> Of this therfore doth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels reioyce in the behalfe of all thyngs, that this blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie is now at an end. There is moreouer an other
<pb facs="tcp:1416:59"/>
dishonoryng of God, which is lesse fine and more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible then the former, when men worship Mammon and suche lyke. All thynges of the worlde are full of this idolatrie. All men both great and small, worshyp this grosse imagerie, and in it put al their trust in time of nede. Wherfore on all parts God is dishonored and blasphemed, both of them that make an Idoll of their owne rightuousnes, &amp; also of such as worshyp Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. But now the Angels syng, that it shalbe other wyse at the appearyng of this light. Men shall put no longer trust in their owne rightuousnes, they shal not care for their parentes, nor for those thyngs that other striue for. They shall onely imbrace this sauiour, and trust in hym. And this shalbe the beginnynge of gods true glorie: so shall he be truly knowen, glorified, and worshypped. Such glorie lost Adam in Paradise. For so are all mens wittes corrupted by nature, that they had rather haue the glorie them selues:<note place="margin">Originall syn broughte in ambition.</note> take for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample the Pope and byshops. They are very riche, yet can they not be brought in mind to promote the word of <hi>GOD.</hi> And howe can they but greatly esteme it, seyng the basest persones that be, loue to be glorified? Seynge therefore that it is so in the lowest persones, that none would be without glorie, how muche more must it so come to passe with them, that hath such high matters in hande, suche holynesse, rightuousnes, good workes, ciuile honestie, and behauioure? These wyll not well be contente that <hi>GOD</hi> shoulde haue his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. They will not suffer their owne honoure to be dimynished therby.</p>
            <p>Suche ambition besieged men, when the fyrste of mankynde in Paradise, were brought of the diuell to that point, that they would be like vnto God, and we

Wherfore al men for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gyfts of God, as science, riches, imperie, and diuers vertues &amp;c. seketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues glorie: yea in very trifles this vice cannot be escaped. But the angels mean, that through the light of this chylde it shal come otherwise to passe, and that nowe Gods glorie shall be surrendred vnto him again: and therfore they reioyce and syng, both for Gods and mans behalf for the true difference of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

wherefore she prynteth it in her mynde, she ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, and bestoweth great studie in so great a matter, howe it could come to passe, that she should be called the mother of this chylde, whom the Angels called Lord, and as concerning whom they preache so magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. And after this sort did these thoughts caste so depe rootes in her heart, that if all the worlde had afterward spoken agaynst this matter, yet she could not be persuaded to thinke otherwyse. But she was very certainly assured herof, that her sonne was the sonne of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the sauiour of the worlde.

of Bethleem, they retourne to their flockes, they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and prayse <hi>GOD.</hi> For the Angels gaue them this commandement, in their verse. This doctrine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore besyde all other, is to be taken as most worthy to be remembred, that the shepheardes after they had gotten the great light and knowledge of Christ, they go not to the desert, they take not vp their lodgyng in a monasterie or abbey, after the maner of Mounkes and Nonnes. But they see to their vocation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe them selues to serue and helpe their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure. For they that leaue this kynde of lyuinge in this body, and take on them to lyue after an other sorte, be neuer made such by faith: As the Mounkes were of this opinion, that they could not be saued, excepte in the ende, they shewed them selues to be vnlyke other men.</p>
            <p>For excepte they wore other apparell, and dyd eat after an other sorte, and also watche. &amp;c. they thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues also to be prophane &amp; vnreligious as other. Wherfore they inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted out an vnused trade of liuing peculiar to them selues, for their apparel, meate, tyme, &amp; place. This did they count Christianitie, naming it religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in dede it was religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but yet of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuell. For he also hath his religious. But Christ came not, to change externall things,<note place="margin">Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to change exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall thyngs.</note> and to subuert his creatures and make new. Wherfore the body may be appareled, fed, and constrayned to labour as nede and necessitie requireth. For the creature is to be vsed by Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance without any chaunging. He came not to chaunge any thing therof. It is permitted to mannes free will to chaunge apparell and meate, when the matter require it. And as for this chaunge, it may be done in beastes also. This chaunge is a thing of no
<pb facs="tcp:1416:65"/>
great estimation, neither was it is necessary for <hi>CHRIST</hi> to set it foorth. How much more is it against reason, that such mutation and change should be estemed for Gods seruice and for a religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation?</p>
            <p>But herein consisteth the true mutation, for the which came Christ,<note place="margin">Christ chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the heart</note> that men should be chaunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in their heartes. Before this openinge of the Gospell at oure tyme, I thought that God had no regard of me, and that the gouernance of my saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> consisted in my self. I knew nothing herof, how synne or death ought to be ordered. And therfore many fell vnto Mounkerie. But there is not so great vertue in a cowle, apparell, eating and faste. &amp;c. death is not slayne herby, syn is not put asyde by this. For both they remayne vnder a cowle as well, as vnder other garmentes. But this thing is here gone about, that the heart it self may purchase a new light, and a new token of remembrance as it was said before, that it may be surely persuaded, that <hi>GOD</hi> hath respecte vnto it, and regardeth it. For he sent his sonne into the flesh, that I by hym myght ouercome death, and obtayn euerlasting lyfe. This is the true change. For before my heart knew not, but now it knoweth. And this chaunge is now brought by <hi>CHRIST,</hi> that the heart and mynd may be renewed, and that an other vnderstanding, will, and affection might rise therin. For where as before there was great loue of mony and riches, now after that Christ is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not these things only, but also body and lyfe, and all other things, are rather to be put in perill, than that Christ should be forsaken and his word. Before thou
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1416:65"/>
woldest not bye Christs fauour for an half peny, now there is nothyng so hygh of pryce, that thou woldest set more by than Christ. Before thou thoughtest that thy saluation consisted in a fryers wede, now thou hatest it worse than a madde dogge or an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Before we counted it a great synne, if we hade eaten fleshe on frydaye, nowe doo we abhorre and execrate their wickednes, whiche made it dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly synne to doo it. This is an inwarde chaunge whiche belongeth to the heart, whereas is an other will and affection of the heart than was before, and yet it forsaketh not his vocation, but kepeth his old kynd of lyfe, as the example of the shepheardes tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to do.</p>
            <p>At the fyrst the shepheards neuer thought that a sauiour was borne.<note place="margin">The example of the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards.</note> But after that they knew it by the Angels, they make haste to the towne, and seke the chylde. And when they had seen hym, and declared the prayse that was geuen of hym, and rendred thankes for his great benefite, they retourne to their heardes, and chaunge no part of their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. They remayne shepheardes as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they kepe their accustomed kynde of lyfe. And this is a very Christian doctrine and lyfe.<note place="margin">The chaunge of creatures in the last day.</note> For Christ cam not to chaunge these creatures, vntill the laste day. When the sowle shall be perfecte and renewed, (whiche thing is begonne in this lyfe) then shall the body be chaunged, and all mannes vnperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taken awaye. We shall go vp and downe in the ayer lyke Angells, and be as bright as the starre. And there, because oure body shal be spirituall, we shall nede no helpe to oure naturall necessitie.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:66"/>
Then shall the externall things be channged. Before that come to passe, nothyng is to be innouate of oure customably lyfe. But all Gods ordinances are to be obserued, and vertue is to be exercised in them. For they are no hinderance to Christes religion. Neither doth <hi>CHRIST</hi> regard of what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition and state thou art of. For in hym is neither man nor woman, Lord nor seruant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.</note> neither superior, neither inferior, neither circuncision neither vncircuncision, but a new creature. And whan that is gotten, as touching other things that thou hast, he changeth nothing. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the in that kynd of lyfe to shewe obedience to God, and to care diligently for it.</p>
            <p>Wherfore there are no more things set forth in the hystory of the shepheards, than that they praysed and glorified <hi>GOD.</hi> They cast no new additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Gods religion, to institute after that new ceremonies in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie places, and to lyue a strange lyfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the common example, worshipping God with contempla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions. For this is not Gods seruice nor true religion, but it is as much as to despise obedience due to God, and to delight them selues in their owne inuentions and phantasies. Wheras this is the true worshipping of God, to execute diligently that kynde of lyuing as God gaue them, to be content with thy state, &amp; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre no more. Thynke for a suertie that it is thy duetie to beautifie &amp; order that person that is geuen to the of God and nature, that euery man in his degree may know God and glorifie hym. This seruice is pleasant and acceptable to God if it be done. God requireth not a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of heare, neither fasting, neither a coule: But that thou shouldest obey his word, &amp; glorifie his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. He is pleased with this seruice, and with no other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1416:66"/>The Prophetes describe the great wrathe of God,<note place="margin">The prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes do alwais require the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward change</note> when they rebuke the hypocrites on this wyse: Why offer ye so many sacrifices vnto me? take to your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues your burnt offringes, with your offered beastes, If I hunger I will not tell you.

This dothe God require especially by his word. And as for the residue, it causeth no change or mutation in our kyndes and vocations of lyfe.

Besydes this, there be dyuers other lessons, which we purpose to runne lightly ouer, as it were by the waye. This hystorie befell, when the chylde <hi>IESVS</hi> was a moneth and a half olde, and
<pb facs="tcp:1416:68"/>
brought into the temple after the maner of the Iewes and redemed of the Lord by an offring, as the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten wer wont to be: As it is wont to be taught in the day whan Christ is offred in the temple. Then cam Simeon into the temple by the holy ghost, and began to preache of this chylde, that he shoulde become a sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and lyght, not only to the Iewes in one place but to all the Gentiles in the whole world. The Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist saith, that Simeon caused the father and mother to meruaile greately at his Sermon that he made as touchyng the chyld. He called Ioseph Christes father, speakynge after the common sorte of other men. But the Euangelist was circumspect and warie inough be fore: wher as he wrote, testifying that Christ was con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued by the holy ghost, and born of the virgin Mary. Wherfore that is to be noted,<note place="margin">Luke calleth Ioseph the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther of Christ</note> that no man take hereof an occasion of erroure, in that Luke in this place, and the scripture in an other place dothe vse the very same wordes as the other doth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 1.</note> in declaring the matter. For this was the priuie working of God: That the virgin Mary wared great with chylde? whiche thing it was Iosephs dutie to beleue, after that the Angel opened it vnto him in his slepe. And in that that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old man Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon commeth, whose eyes were dimme for age, and preached so magnificentely of this chylde: doubtlesse there were many that iudged, that his wordes came not of a right mynde, &amp; that it was no meruaile, that an old dotysh man spake so dotyshly. But the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Euangeliste sheweth the contrarie. Suche was his sermon (saith he) that the father and mother were taken with great meruail. For as touchyng this matter, they were not so well instructed of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels as they are in this place of Simeon, that is, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1416:68"/>
he should be a lyghte to the Gentiles. Wherfore there can be no place for that exposition here, which sheweth that this meruailynge signifieth doubte, but it is more rather a token of a greate faithe. For this is the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of faythe: the greater it is,<note place="margin">This meruai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyng ryseth of faythe.</note> the more admiration and meruaile it causeth, and the more vncredible ioye it bryngeth. But where as is no fayth, all thyngs are colde, without affection, withoute all motions. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may take this for an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple: we haue heard now a fewe days of Christes natiuitie and byrth, that this chylde is made our fleshe and bloud, that he myght be our sauiour, to delyuer vs from synne, death, and the kyngdome of the diuell, And if thou haste true beliefe: this faith can not bee withoute admiration. Neither can the eye be satisfied by seyng, neither the hearte by thynkynge of this chylde. Wherefore, this is a prayse bothe of the fathers and mothers faythe. The mother was excedyng glad, that this chylde was put foorthe as a lyght to lyghten the Gentiles, in comparison of whome, all other kynges and princes shoulde be but very darknesse and nyght, which hath no store of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Wherfore this faith muste nedes be very colde, and scarcely half alyue. For they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue truely, are not only glad, but also are prowd with gladnesse.

In the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedome say they, all things were quiet, there was no trouble, neither by heresies, neither by dissention. But by and by at the springing of this doctrine sprong vp also all trouble, so that very litle good or nothing at al is come therby. To suche reprouers such an aunswere mayste thou geue: That the Gospell of <hi>CHRIST</hi> shall neuer be preached earnestly, but with the fall and ouerthrowe of many, which afterward do become the begynners of great turmoylings. But yet neuer the lesse, we muste not leaue this commoditie vnspoken of, in that certaine do embrace, and recouer their falle. And these be consciences that be in myserie and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in their feare receaue confort by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospell. This thing will not oure aduersaries consyder, they behold only the falle and offence, which could by no meanes be escaped, not for the fault of the doctryn, which is good, syncere and perfecte, but by the fault of men, which will not applie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to this doctryn, neither obey it. But here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the matter vprightly: whether it were not muche better, that the Papistes should be offended by oure example, than that the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell should rule in all places without offence in quiet possession by Idolatrie and false doctrin, and the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men driuen to perdition by whole flockes?

in the Popedome was corrupt doctrine, without any knowledge of God, without any true seruice. We haue proued this &amp; tried in many generall Councels, how this doctrine might be applied to all men, &amp; offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no man. But the matter is euident, that if thou take away this offence, Christ can not remayne. For at the sight of this man, forthwith riseth trouble, ruine, and falling. And vnto vs also, at the laste is Christ come by his Gospell, and that whilest we do thinke litle theron, euen as he came also to the Iewes. Whiche thyng we ought to repute for a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume, and to geue great thanks therfore, for that that we are thought worthy of so vnspeakable grace and goodnes of God. The Pope and the Bishops be angry, because God called not them fyrst to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in this matter, that the reformation of the Church myght be set vpon by their assent. And because God vsed not this order in so doyng, there riseth offence euery where. Christ after his maner preacheth freely: the Pope and the Bishops will not suffer that.

                     <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> As Christ saith in an other place: There muste be sectes and heresies. The doctrine is not without persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet remaineth Christ in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middest of their furies and madnes, and some men rise in him, and be saued: Other do falle and perishe, that wold faine haue Christ to be after an other sorte, than he is sent of God the Father, that he should be a blocke to helpe, that he should lyfte vp and make men rise. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the madnes of many is suche, that they will not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1416:71"/>
crepe humbly to this blocke, but stryue against hym with a styffe necke, &amp; so by their owne desire put them self in perill of falling: Here is no fault in Christ but in these mad men, which thorough their pryde make Christ, which is put forth for a sygne to rise by, a signe of falling and ruine.</p>
               <p>Wherfore the Gospell is falsly slaundered to be a troblesome and a seditious doctrine,<note place="margin">The Gospell is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of trouble but mens stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bournes.</note> as the Pope and Byshops say it is, as though no euill rose by them in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, and as though they dyd not stirre vppe all kynd of myserie and plagues by their synnes and Idolatries. If they wold geue place to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, &amp; caste no stoppe against it, there should be no dissention nor any other euill. But where as they set them selfs stubburnely against it, and thinke not them self mete to geue place, what marueil is it, if God doth not alway after their desyers? Ye the Iewes also were offended in Christ. Ther was no fault in Christ, which wold rather haue them saued, and came for the same purpose, that men should beleue in hym, and obtayn saluation by hym. But where as they will not, there is no faulte in Christ. For it were mete that they should lyue after the maner of <hi>CHRIST</hi> whiche is their Lord, and not Christ after theirs. And the Gospell is for no other cause. And we ought to haue respecte therto. But he that is loth to do so, can blame nothing but his owne stubburnnes and damnable wickednes, and not the Gospell, which is without faulte. And this is the fyrste parte of this prophecye.</p>
               <p>But where as Simeon turneth his speach to the mother, with these words: And the sworde shall perce through thy heart, that the thoughtes of many
<pb facs="tcp:1416:72"/>
hartes may be open. That semeth litle to agree with the words of the Euangelist, wher he said: Simeon blessed her. For what blessing or wishing of any good thing can there be, wheras he prophecieth so to come to passe, that her heart shall be perced with a sworde? This is not only written for Christ or Maries sake, but for our learning is it written, that haue nede of it, that we may fashion oure iudgement therby. For what man is there,<note place="margin">The Gospell openeth the heartes.</note> not only I but of the chiefe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that wold haue suspected, that the malice of the world wold haue ben so great, except the Gospell had geuen vs a reuelation herof before. For there were many good men before this reuelation, whiche lyued very soberly and godly. There were many wyse, for whose honestie a man might well pronounce with an othe. And this is no litle renoume of the worlde, without the Gospel, to haue such science, wisdom, and honestie. &amp;c. But it is also a greater thing in religion, that the worlde hath inuented and ordayned these religiouse orders. The Popedom is an example. For what man, when he beholdeth it, wil not conceaue a great opinion of godlynes? This is it in the worlde, if the Gospell be not, there shyneth wyse men, honest, sober, and vpright men. And all this is by the reason of ciuill vertues, and partly by iugling ceremonies: that excepte the goodnes of God helped, all should be cast headlong into destruction, with this pretence, that they were iuste, holy, wyse, and pure from synne. But when the Gospell is opened, and the child Iesus preached,<note place="margin">The Gospell plucketh of the visards of the world, and openeth the heartes.</note> there is it almoste proued to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sences, &amp; decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red with pictures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these saynctes are moste synners, and these wyse, most foles, and these sober men, moste cruell tyrantes. Neither hath the Gospell any enemies
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1416:72"/>
more spitefull, than these men, that are great, wyse, prudent, vpright in lyuing, good and holy. And the more they excell with these vertues, so much the more they behaue them selues enuiously against the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as we proue by experience. The more religion the Mounkes shewe in praying, fasting, and other chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, the more furiously do they behaue them selues against the Gospell. And this it is, that Simeon spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, in this place. What a great shew (saith he) maketh the worlde in both administrations, as well ciuill as religiouse? They lyue honestly and holyly with great sparing and defrauding them self of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and they may soone be taken for Angels, and the sonnes of God, for their great wisdom and holynes. Who could beleue that there might lie hyd suche cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption vnder such a fayer shew? And here is no art so full of knowledge, out of the which, this might be iudged and perceaued, excepte this only texte, wheras he saith, that the Gospell shall vtter this poyson.</p>
               <p>Wherfore when this is opened, it moueth to wrath these so great &amp; so holy men, so that they muste nedes betray them selfes, and shew before all men, that all that they do, is but hypocrisie.<note place="margin">The Gospell openeth the heartes.</note> For there are other exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples besyde this, caste against this: There are very wyse Princes, that are earnestly moued with the care of sauing their subiectes: they are not couetouse, no dronkards, no gluttons: they be diligent in doing the busines of their realme, to defend men from wronge, they are chast husbandes: &amp; to be short, if a king should be prayed for, and wished, they wold be thought moste mete for theyr vertues, prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, goodnes, holynes. &amp;c. But wilt thou know how the matter goeth? For scarsly at the publyshing of the Gospell may a man
<pb facs="tcp:1416:73"/>
perceaue this vncredible hypocrisie, and this bloud thyrstye hearte, which gapeth for the shedding of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes bloud, whiche myngleth all things with great deceites, and letteth passe no kynde of subtiltyes, to oppresse the Gospell, and to ryd it out of the way, so that yet by this occasion, that is made open, whiche before no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold beleue, that so great synnes should lye hyd vnder such an holy apperance. It chanceth by the launcing or cutting of no thing, that this pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent poyson, gusheth out, but only by the Gospell. My reason is this:<note place="margin">The holyest hateth the Gospel moste.</note> that if the Gospell should with mans co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent be taught, that they should be the fyrst alowers therof, that do of set purpose professe religion. But who so euer thou art, aunswer me this: Is not the Pope, the Bishops, the Priests, the Mounkes, the vniuersities with their Doctours, the most spitefull enemies of it that be? Which thing Simeon meaneth here, and saith to Mary: This thy child shal be author of so great a tumult, and shall bewray them, that myght sone haue lyen hyd from al men, ye that wold scarsly know them selues, he shall open their heartes, that they that were counted for moste holy, may be knowen to be blaspheme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, full of gyle, deceit, periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, hate, enuie, and all malice. Suche fylthynes shall be opened in them by hym, whiche neuer the lesse for their dyuers vertues, wisdome, innocencie, vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and holynes might be counted worthye to rule all the worlde, ye and heauen also. This opening of the heart is administred by this chylde.</p>
               <p>At the fyrst, whan the Gospell came abrode, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought that the worlde wold be so madde. I Iudged all men after my self, whereas I thought this, that all men wold triumphe for ioy, that they are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1416:73"/>
deliuered earnestly. From the tyranny of the Pope, and by Christ made partakers of all that good thing, the whiche before they studied with great coste and payn to purchase, and yet all in vayne. And I thought that these things wold specially please the scoles and Byshops, if it wold please any. But how are we handled? For this doctrine are we intreated without all mercye. And no man hate vs more than the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouse men. We muste accustome our selues to suffer this iniquitie, and must not caste of the Gospell, for this wickednes of the worlde: But set forth the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine therof the more earnestly. For it is such that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth the dyuell and his members, how great an enemy of God is the world with all his giftes and vertues. For I could neuer know by my self, that so great wickednes and contempt was in mans heart. But the Gospell teacheth vs, to knowe well what is the Pope, the Bishops, the Princes, the Nobles, the Citizens, the Rustykes: euen that they be vexed as dyuels, for as much as they doo not only refuse this holsome doctryne, but persecute it also with all spite, and despise it very prowdlie.<note place="margin">This opening pertayneth to Iudgement.</note> I perceaued not this before that I learned the Gospell but thought that the holy Ghoste had reigned in their doyng. And this is the pith of this saying, whereas Simeon saith, that Christ shall open the thoughtes of mennes heartes. But why doth he open them? Truely for oure instruction &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte. To instructe vs after this sorte, that we be not offended and troubled, when the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishenes of such men betrayeth it selfe. For this matter can not be without admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when these goodly and wise princes, &amp; other good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> procede to such madnes, that they can not suffer the word of God, but do curse
<pb facs="tcp:1416:74"/>
it moste wickedlye. For this thing the Gospell geueth succoure, and openeth this mysterie. Before tyme the thoughtes of the hearts were secret, but now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth he forth that both is in dede, &amp; also called the opener of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heartes. He doth so open the secretes, that it may appeare, what mennes thoughtes be, whiche neither they them selues, neither any other knew before, and yet were they to be opened: for they were no better before than now, but they were ouer couered with a colour, that they could not be seen, and the thoughtes of the heartes lay hyd. But now after that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is set foorth, it appeareth as playne as the sonne, what was hyd before, euen a very pit of al myschefe. And there is no state of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin it goeth not after this sorte, ye as well amongest the hye Lords, as the low loordaynes. And look how much the better and holyer they be in both partes: so much the more they hate the Gospell, and are full of poyson and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of God. And that <hi>Momus</hi> thought to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the perfecte making of man, that is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by the Gospell, euen an open place to se in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart and breast, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priuities of the heartes may be seen, and that nothing, according to the saying of Simeon may be hyd.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The opening pertayneth to confort.</note>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>darily, this opening of the heartes is for oure confort, seing the world can be brought by no meanes to allow Gods word, and yet it sheweth outwardly a great pretence of holynes, that we should not feare it, but thinke this surely: that whatsoeuer apperance of righteousnes ther be, yet for as much as it is found giltie in this vyce,<note place="margin">The greatest vice is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te the word of God, &amp; to despise it.</note> euen that it can not abyde Gods word, but persecute it, that it is condemned with the dyuell, and with all that thereto belongeth, and that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1416:74"/>
all his holines and workes are but counterfaited. For if things be considered by their proper nature,<note place="margin">The greateste vice is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the worde of god and to despise let.</note> it is no euill thynge, to be indued with wisdome, rightousnes and sobernes. But this is euill when excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues be vsed for clokyng of most greuous synnes, that is, of cursing God and persecutynge his worde. Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie is muche craked of, as it is in dede a rare and great gifte. But what commendation woldest thou leaue for that Uirgin, that woulde commit murder. The commendation of this gyfte shoulde not seme so great, seing it is ioyned wit suche a great crime, that it myghte be thought worthie of lyfe.</p>
               <p>Lykewyse also goeth the matter in this case, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to the sayinge of Simeon speakynge this vnto Marye. Thy sonne shall conuicte the worlde of greate crimes, of thefte, of man slaughter, of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derynge of fathers, and that euen them that are nowe almost counted for gods. He shall so open them and their heartes, that they shall declare eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlye themselues to be the extreme enemies of god. This hypocrisie is now to be suffered wherin the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde apperaunce hydeth greate offences, but this will not continewe longe. Let <hi>CHRIST</hi> onely come abrode with his gospell, and it shalbe euident, that all the worlde is full of leude persons, of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, of theues, and robbers. They can not pacientlye suffer themselues this to be named: yet before GOD they can not purge themselues of these crimes. For althoughe the outwarde lyuynge be vpright, yet is there this faulte, that there is so greate vngodlines in them, that they can not suffer gods worde, whiche can make good that this name
<pb facs="tcp:1416:75"/>
is most agreable to men. For the tounge and handes are with a lytle thynge, and by a smale occasion driuen to slaughter, wheras the hearte before is ful of slaughter. This vice is opened by the Gospell, whiche otherwise no man could knowe, and no man also beleue.</p>
               <p>Wherfore Simeon addeth nowe furthermore in his spech to Mary: A sworde (saieth he) shal perse thy soule. For she was faine to behold and fele this ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragiousnes of the world, and not only she, but all the vniuersall churche. Nowe it is vnpossible for a man to see all this without sorowe and greate trouble of minde. As Peter sayeth by Loth. That he dwelled amongest them being a righteous man both in seing and hearyng,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> &amp; from day to day vexed his righteous soule with their vnrighteous workes. This is then the sworde, that perseth the hearte, (that is to saye) the hearte is tormented for that the wickednes of the worlde is so greate,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and so full of dissimulation, and worketh in the meane tyme all kynd of iniuries and infamies against God and his saintes.</p>
               <p>And this is one of the crosses of Christian men, euen the sorow of the hearte, whiche passeth all other thynges that greue them, and causeth them beinge so vexed to groue for payne. Whiche when they haue, doubtles the paynes of the wicked tarrieth not longe after. And this is spoken as touchyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophecie of Simeon. With this prophecie of Simeon, is ioyned the hystory of Anne the Prophetesse, which testifieth &amp; preacheth also herselfe through the holy ghost, of christ. Of her this reporteth the Euangeliste: How she ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God daye and nyght in prayer and fastynge. This
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1416:75"/>
do our aduersaries the Papistes caste in our teth, as thought it made for them.<note place="margin">Faste and prayer are the seruice of god.</note> Wheras yet we neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that God must be serued with fastynge &amp; prayer.

But we denie that precisely, and answere with the angel, that that is don only by the child Iesu, which is called Iesus and a Sauiour, that he maye saue his people from their synnes. But here let vs make an end, and cal to god for his grace, that he will be mercifull vnto vs, &amp; defende vs against al offences, and geue vs so muche power, that we maye rise in Christ, and neuer stumble with offence at his doctrine, the which thinge Christ our Lord vouchsalf to graunt vs. Amen.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His daye are they wont to preache of two matters. First of Circumcision, Then of the name Iesu. The which thynge the Euangelist doth especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notifie, for that it was prophecied of, before that the childe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in his mothers wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And for asmuche as we intende to make the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of circuncision plaine, this difference is in especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to be marked, that it consisteth not in the thing, but in the persons. For if we consider the thynge, there is great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cision of the Iewes and of Christ. And that because the person of Christ is fare vnlyke the person of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>The beginninge of circumcision is declared in the bible in the firste booke of Moyses,<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</note> it hath also an appointed ende, to the whiche it shall endure, that is euen vnto <hi>CHRIST.</hi> Abraham is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ground of all the matter, to whome GOD gaue commandement to circumcise hymselfe, and all that were in his housholde: And also whatsoeuer of the male kynde was borne, it shoulde be circumcised the eyght daye after theyr byrth. They therfore that came with suche a signe in theyr bodye, had God their protectour and Sauiour as GOD promised he woulde be.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1416:76"/>
Circumcision, that not onelye the Iewes myghte boste them selfe to be the people of GOD. For he receaueth the seruaunts of Abraham, whiche were Gentiles, to be of his people and sonnes, and to haue righte of inheritaunce whiche was appointed to Abraham and to his seede. And these dyd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne it before Isaac, to the whiche neuerthelesse afterwarde the promesse was ioyned, where as yet these bought seruauntes were of the Gentyles. Wherfore the Iewes haue not the cheife occasion to boste of this. For although they extolle circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion very muche, yet this they can not denye, that GOD hath called vnto it the Gentyls, whiche are not the sonnes of Abraham,<note place="margin">Circumcision abrogat.</note> but boughte ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes. As touchinge this Circumcision, there is nothynge els lefte for vs but the type and fygure of fayth. As it is also as touchynge the other hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories paste, whiche onelye profyte vs in this, that we maye take therof examples of fayth and true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes. We are not bounde to ceremonies, yet haue we nede of suche obedience and suche fayth as theirs was than, whiche lyued vnder suche ceremonies. Wherefore the doctrine of Circumcision is not put foorth to the intent, that we should be Circumcised. (For thys ceremonie is disanulled) but that we by the rehersall therof, shoulde remember to shewe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to GOD, as Abraham shewed.</p>
               <p>Yf <hi>CHRIST</hi> hade not come, Circumcision shoulde haue ben necessarie euen at this tyme for vs, if so be we woulde be of the people of God. For the condition is straight and without exception, he that is not circumcised, his soule must be exempt out
<pb facs="tcp:1416:77"/>
of the people of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the example, that we take of the olde Circumcision, is this. That GOD in this Image declareth vnto vs, how contrarie to reason he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and commandeth, if a man vse the iudgement of reason. For amongest the proud Gentyls it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a thynge to be laughed at, that GOD which is so wise, shoulde set foorth suche a mad precepte, wherof is made mention in preachynge contrary to the lawe of shamfastnes, honestie, and chastitie, and especiallye when they be aged that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded so to do. For Abraham at that tyme was fowre score and nintyne yeres olde. And herof ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth contumelious names,<note place="margin">The wisdom of the worlde is offended.</note> so that the Iewes were named <hi>Recutiti,</hi> and <hi>Appelles</hi> among the Gentyls, that is to saye, men whose skynne is growen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or men without skynne. But this is the true cause therof, as it was sayde in the Gospell nexte before: whatsoeuer is of GOD put foorth: it is done with such a fashion, that all men laughthe it to scorne, no man aloweth it, but all testeth vpon it, as though it were olde wyues fables. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, looke whatsoeuer he commandeth not, but is of our owne imagination, this do we require to be acceptable vnto hym. This woulde we haue obserued for an euerlastynge lawe. But this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be alowed of GOD.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> And herof springeth the cause of a greate offence. As Paule saith: After that in the wisedome of GOD, the worlde knewe not God by wisedom, it pleased God to saue them that beleue by folishnes of preachynge. What maye be more against reason then that bread the body of Christ

This thynketh reason, neyther can it thynke anye other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. But GOD therfore purposeth not to change this. Yf reason doth not beleue nor alow it, gods cause is neuer the worse for that.<note place="margin">Baptisme is agaynste rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> Lykewise also goeth it in baptisme. Howe shoulde this seme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable to reason, that if the child be washed with a lytle water, that therby he is purged from his sinnes, and translated out of the kyngdome of the deuil into the kyngdome of God. In dede it might stand wel with reason that synne shold be washed awaye with water, if sinne were a spote: but for asmuche as sin is fastened in the minde, bones, and in the inermost parte of the body, it is not agreable to reason that water shoulde perse so far and washe it awaye. But nowe consider well Circumcision.<note place="margin">Cercumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agaynste rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone.</note> Mighte not Abraham by lyke reason alleage for himselfe to refuse it? What doth this profit me to saluation, that I am Circumcised in mine age? what good doth this to a child? or what profit at all doth a man take by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision? If God would haue the bodye changed, he mighte haue made it so at the beginnynge that it shold nede nothing to be cut fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. If reason had ben taken to councell at that time, it wold haue sayd euen so, neither doth it thinke any otherwise now a dayes, when it proueth her wisedom. But it is to be learned in this place,<note place="margin">Reason ought not to make search of gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> that whensoeuer question is moued why god shold geue such commandement, the deuill hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpper hand. As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Eue in paradise doth shew.

<pb facs="tcp:1416:78"/>
and hard the deuill reasonynge, why God made suche a lawe, she fell downe hedlonge, and was caste into suche disobedience, that all we vnto this time suffer the blame and penaltie therof.</p>
               <p>Wherefore lette this be a lawe for the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When GOD geueth a commandement thynke it to be thy duetie, to honour it with all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and make no further searche. Yf he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande, obey, if he speake, be attent, and disalowe nothyng that he doth. For out of this most certain principle doth God diriue and set all the other of his doinges, that all men are fooles, lyers and euyll and of so greate madnes, that they neuer oughte, nor maye be able to vnderstande his worde and his workynge. As Ieremie sayth, leud and vnsear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheable is the hearte of man.</p>
               <p>Seinge therfore oure leudnes and vice is so great, we shoulde of our owne accorde correct oure iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thynke this as to uchynge Gods workes and commandementes: If this seme contrarie to my reason, trulye it is for no other cause, than that I haue suche a corrupt vnderstandynge, and dul knowledge. And nothynge hindreth me in iudgyng gods wisedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but myn owne natural folishnes. Wherfore Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is an example of fayth and of singuler obedience: Wheras Abraham &amp; his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes were nothing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this commandement, but obeied it without reasoning, &amp; thought not thus: that Circumcision is a folish thing for them that are aged. This is peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Gods meanynge, what if he thought otherwise, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sin of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh shold be restrained &amp; as a man wold so cut of: this is doubtles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cision, why shold
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1416:78"/>
God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand such a thing that is contrarie to reason? that the body should be circumcised? for what entent is that done? But these men thought not so, but were obedient to the commandement, and this persuaded them selues: Syth God doth requier that, seme this neuer so much against reason, yet shall I be saued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I obey his precepte. Wherfore this is an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of stedfast faith, wherwith Abraham and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes were endued. And it is put forth to vs, that we should folow them, and not geue oure selues to oure owne wisdom and reason to be deceaued.</p>
               <p>And this haue we spoken as touching the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Why childern are circoncised the eyght day.</note> whiche hath no longer power then the law it selfe, (that is) vnto the comminge of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> as it is signified in that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> childern were circumcised vpon the eight day. For this order was in the law: after six days is the Sabboth, and that day that foloweth the Sabboth, is the eight day, euen the beginning of the weke folowing. For Christ by circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, began to fulfil the sayings that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of hym: euen to be a sauiour, and a light to lighten the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, which should haue his kyngdome not only limited by the borders of the Iewes, but should by his Gospel extend his kingdom throughout all the world. And herof is that now the begynning.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, as I said before, we must put a great distance and difference betwene the circumcision of the Iewes and of Christ. For the persons are vnlyke,<note place="margin">A difference betwene the circoncision of Christ and of the Iewes.</note> although the thing that they do is not vnlyke. Circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cision was geuen to them, whiche were synners, and condemned to euerlasting death. But Christ is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out synne, and the Lord of the law, vpon whome the law hath no stroke: for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> law is only against synners,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:79"/>
but he is no synner. But for as much as he is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised after the law, as other chyldern that are syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the law is ouerseen and doth hym wronge. And for this cause is the law compelled to make him a recompence, and therfore, his power is disanulled and abrogate. If it had pleased Christ, he might abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and abrogated the law by power. For he is the Lord ouer the law, with whom the law haue naught to do, for because he is without synne. But he wold do nothing presumptuously after rigour, but order hym self humbly after the equall triall of the law. And all this is done for oure sake, that we might take confort therof in oure doyngs.<note place="margin">Christ hath no nede of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.</note> For in his owne behalf <hi>CHRIST</hi> had no nede to obey his mother, or to be crucified. But he doth it for oure sakes. For we had nede of such a man, that was without synne, and that should fulfill the law for vs, and so turne away the wrathe of <hi>GOD.</hi> For this cause was he made subiecte vnto the law, and afterward geueth vs that victorie, whiche he had of the law, that we might so be helped by hym, that the law should haue no more power ouer vs than it had ouer hym, least it should accuse and condemne vs. For he that embraceth <hi>CHRIST</hi> with a true faith, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth by hym deliuerance from the law and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation therof.</p>
               <p>Wherfore remember well this difference, for all the matter restethe therein. Abraham is subiecte to the lawe and to circumcision, because he is a synner, and the lawe hath power on hym for synne. But Christ is no synner, and therfore he is not constrayned vnder the law, yet doth he submit hymself to the law: that all that receaue hym by faith, may be free from the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1416:79"/>
curse of the lawe. Wherfore this history of Christs circumcision geueth no smalle conforte, in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance wherof thankes are worthely geuen to God, that although we are in daunger of the lawe by syn, yet this is not to the perill of oure saluation, but by Christ we haue deliuerance from the curse of the law,<note place="margin">

And that it was necessarye on this wyse, that we should be delyuered from the lawe, it is the saying of Paule to the Romains, where he sayth:<note place="margin">The sentence of Paul to the Rom. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.</note> Circumcision preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nothyng, but the keping of <hi>GODS</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. It is a confident kynde of speache. For it is as much as to say: No man circumcised and fulfilled the law of God, or kepte the law of <hi>GOD.</hi> What other thing is this, than that the circumcised, are not circumcised? For Gods commandement is euer ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this prescripte: Thou shalt loue the Lorde thy God with all thy heart, with all thy sowle, with all thy mynde. Now let one be brought forth of al the men that be, that may boste that he hath done or can do this. The law commandeth: Thou shalt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syer: Shew me one that can boste,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.</note> that he hath done it, or can do it. To be shorte, chose out whatsoeuer commandement thou wilt amongest them all, &amp; thou causte not denye but that thou haste not kepte it at all tymes. But what sentence is geuen agaynst them that kepe it not?<note place="margin">The conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the law is vnpossible.</note> Ueryly no other than is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced of Paule: Cursed are all that are vnder the lawe, for they can not do it. For if we coulde do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there were no perill. But sith we can not do it, this is certayn, and sure, that the law accuseth vs; killeth and deliuereth vs to the dyuell, and condemneth to hell.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:80"/>
Wherfore we haue nede of a more highe and profound doctrine, whiche may do more to vs than the lawe: which doth nothing but commande vs to loue God with all oure heart, and oure neighbours as oure self, yea and that when he hurteth vs also, and when we wold desier to be reuenged. But the law preuayleth nothing by her controllinge. Nedes muste there be in oure nature, anger, variance, vnpacientnes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, enuie, pride, &amp; such lyke, there is no other remedie. Wherfore ther is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that can obey this doctrine. Neither can this any thing preuayle in the iudgement of God, if we fulfill the law as much as we can.</p>
               <p>And this is the cause, why a greater, euen Christe the sonne of God commeth into the worlde, which by great moderation submitteth him self to the lawe, to take it wholly away. For he it is, that may pleade with the law on this wyse: Thou doste not as men looke thou shouldest doe, thou makest them not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouse, thou doste not purifie their hartes, as we proue by experience. For els what cause should Dauid haue had to say:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.</note> Who can comprise his faultes? Purge me Lord from my secrete synnes. Lykewyse in the 143. Psalme:<note place="margin">

And such lyke sentences do testifie, that no man can say: Lorde we haue done this worke euen as thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandedst, there is no doubt of that. For as much then as the law hath vs bound vnto it on this wyse, and dryueth vs from the sight of God,<note place="margin">Lawe.</note> yea &amp; beateth downe oure confidence and faith which we ought to haue in God, we must of necessitie graunt, that we
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1416:80"/>
haue nede of a more perfecte doctryne, that we may come into Gods sight. This is the doctryne of the Gospell,<note place="margin">Gospell.</note> whiche Christ procureth to be preached to vs and to the Iewes after this sentence: that we are damned for oure synne. And it profiteth the Iewes nothing, that they are circumcised. For this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deliuereth them not from synne. As the Prophet saith: Although they haue the flesh of their foreskyne circumcised, yet their heart is vncircumcised and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure. But this deliuereth, in that the Gospell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth on this wyse, that oure Lord Iesus Christ, whiche ought nothing to the lawe, because he was without synne, made hym self subiect to the lawe, and wold be circumcised that he might haue to do with the lawe: for as much as he, wher as he was Lord of the lawe, yet was challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged as a bondman to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe: now againe abydeth the controling and dominion of Christ. And this power that Christ hath ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe, doth he make common to vs all,<note place="margin">Christs actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law.</note> he benummeth the lawe of his power, whiche it had against vs synners, and deliuereth vs from it, not to the entent, that we should nothing regard it, or geue ouer oure self to lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, but this: that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue done that we should not, it might be forgeuen vs, and not be layde to oure charge, neither turne away oure saluation.</p>
               <p>Wherfore they that beleue in Christ hath no nede of circuncision.<note place="margin">How Christ deliuereth vs from the law.</note> For they are not only free from these and suche lyke burdens of the lawe, but they haue also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their synnes, and promesse of euerlasting lyfe by Christ. This doth profit me that I beleue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Christ was circumcised. For this was done for my sake, that he might be a suerty for me, whatsoeuer action y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law haue against me. Wherfore I wil truste to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
<pb facs="tcp:1416:81"/>
of hym, &amp; that shalbe my confort: that although for a tyme the lawe as Lord in heauen (for it accused vs men before God, and we had no safegarde against it, neither could we complayne of any wrong, because oure syn was ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) yet now is the matter otherwyse. For by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circumcision of Christ we are deliuered from the curse of the lawe. We can not put so great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in oure circumcision, and loue towarde God, and obedience toward oure neighboure. We can not truste and stycke to these things. All oure truste is in this, that Christ is obedient, innocent and holy. This trust shall not deceaue vs, for it is certain. Before that this was opened vnto vs, we thought that we must nedes fulfill the lawe, or be damned. But now we knowledge that it is impossible for all men to do, and that we can not beare that burden. But Christ hath taken it from vs, &amp; put it on hym self, and began the matter by circumcision, &amp; fulfilled the lawe. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is oure truste. We oughte not truely to be carelesse in taming of the flesh, and in instructing it, that it may obey <hi>GOD,</hi> leaste I be founde vtterly disobedient. Whatsoeuer I am not able to do, I remit it to this safegard. For whatsoeuer I haue not done, that dyd Christ for my sake. For we shall neuer be in such good takynge, that we may do all that we ought to doo. As Paule sayth:<note place="margin">The saying of Paul <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> I am delighted with the lawe of God after the inwarde man, but I finde an other lawe in my members repyninge against the lawe of my mynde, and subduynge it to the lawe of syn, which is in my members. Whiche is as muche as to say: I must of compulsion obey the flesh, but after fayth I do not so, it greueth me, and I abyde this bondage against my will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1416:81"/>After this sorte Christian righteousnes is made perfecte, when I acknowledge my synne,<note place="margin">Christian righteousness.</note> that I can neuer fulfill the lawe of God, and yet I despaire not therefore. For in this example I knowledge, that <hi>CHRIST</hi> regardeth me, and for my sake made hym self subiecte to the lawe and fulfilled it. Hereof after that ensueth a new zeale, and a new affection,<note place="margin">Christ fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the lawe.</note> euen loue toward God, bycause he loued vs fyrst, that we may be obedient to his will, with all diligence. Herof according to the Psalme riseth a willing people, whiche beginneth to loue <hi>GOD,</hi> and to do after his lawe. And althoughe such doing is slacke and vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte by the means of the flesh, yet is it alowed of God for the fayth in Christ.<note place="margin">Note well.</note> For whatsoeuer is vnpure and vnperfecte in it, it fleeth to remission of synne as to the only meane lefte to escape by.</p>
               <p>And this haue we now spoken of the two sortes of circumcision. The first was commanded by God, And the Iewes haue obeyd vnto it hitherto as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lawe, and yet they obtayned not saluation therby. For no man could fulfill the lawe. Wherfore although they had the lawe, yet neuerthelesse the lawe accused and condemned them before <hi>GOD.</hi> But saluation and holynes is obtayned hereby, in that that Christ subdued hym self to the lawe, and bore the curse therof. Wherfore the Iewes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued this, and had their saluation consisting in the promised sede, to them was circumcision outwardly a seale to assure them that they were righteouse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, not for circumcision, but for their saith in Christ. Whiche thing sith it is so, the hystory of the circumcision of Christ is worthely estemed to be full of confort. In the whiche this doctryne is set foorth:
<pb facs="tcp:1416:82"/>
That if we desyer the way that leade vs to God, it may not be obtayned by the lawe, whiche comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.</note> Thou shalt loue thy Lord thy <hi>GOD</hi> with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy selfe. For we do neuer so, nor can not do if we wold. But this is oure only safegard, to the whiche we make oure refuge, euen <hi>CHRIST</hi> Iesus the sonne of God and oure Lorde.</p>
               <p>He hath satisfied the will of God, and made hym self subiecte as a synner to the lawe (for if it had not bene for that, he should neuer haue bene circumcised as other chyldern be vpon the eight day.) This was done for all mennes synnes, that all men may haue trust in hym. For it was no nede for hym selfe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this pertayneth vnto vs, and we doo well put oure truste in hym, that we may be saued for his righteousnes and holynes. And that I may briefly in one word note this matter: we must only sticke to the righteousnes and iustification of Christ before God. This is a moste certayne and aproued way, and it hath moste suer ayde and succoure against synne and death. The whiche thing God graunt vs through oure Lord Iesus <hi>CHRIST.</hi> Amen.</p>

He promiseth vs an other lyfe: and that he may seme to haue great respecte to this lyfe, this chylde Iesus is set foorth to be a sauiour for vs. And when he geueth vs this saluation, no other thynge is greatly to be required of hym, although other things in this lyfe go not as we wold, and although we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no great signes of Gods helpe in oure matters. For his saluation is euerlasting saluation. Let this be sufficient for vs, be the difficulties and encombran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this lyfe neuer so great.</p>
               <p>We see that the Pope, Cardinals, Bishops,<note place="margin">God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not this lyfe specially.</note> and all that persecute the word, do lyue in great securitie, and that they are vnshamfastly bent agaynst the word and all Christians. God seeth this and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, and maketh as though he saw it not, in so muche, that he may seme to haue shewed more care for the Gentiles than for his people. But if thou be a Christian, let not this moue thee. For euen for this very cause, that God hath promised vs sure saluation to euerlasting lyfe: he suffereth vs in this lyfe to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as men destitute and without the helpe of God: that we may know this by fayth, that the chylde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is such a Sauiour, whiche neuerthelesse saueth vs, although in all things besyde there can be no help gotten, that is, when syn shall either accuse vs, or hath now alredy condemned vs to eternall death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:84"/>Excepte this tyme, it appeareth that we haue no nede of this sauiour, neither do we much regard him. For he that is in helth, &amp; hath plentie of goodes, hath no nede of Christ, for if he muste redeme the matter by pryce, he hath mony enough to do that. And this is it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other corporall gyftes, wit, wisdome &amp; power. For in them is their store of helpe and saluation, as farre as God hath appoynted them to be to oure sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. The mother bryngeth foorth chyldern. The physition helpeth the sycke. The lawyer by the exacte lawe defendeth against the wrongfull doers. But when this lyfe is at an ende, neither can the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science hyde her synnes before Gods iudgement, then is there place made for this sauiour Iesu. For then is there no store of helpe in any thing besyde. All things do fayle, no power is so great or wil so redy, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d against the euill of the conscience, and of death. In this case if thou demand, from whence thou moste looke for helpe? haue respecte only to this chylde. For that cause is he named Iesus, that he might be present, and saue all that knowledge him, &amp; looke for saluation of hym. But in this resteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole matter, that thou suffer no other name to be geuen to this chylde. And then that thou graunt not that this name that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to this chylde should be transposed to other,<note place="margin">This name Iesus muste be made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For all this is abhominable: And a good cause whi: there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no other sauiour be inuented against synne. Wherfore he that wold haue an other sauiour, whether it be the rule of the Carthusians, or any other thing, he goeth cleane without saluation. Therfore he that could name this child by his true name, and could inculcat, Christ into
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1416:84"/>
hymself, were blessed. For in this name are al things, wherfore store of saluation is there to be looked for and no wher els. But now the dyuels endeuour lyeth all in this, that this chyld might haue an other name made, that men should perceaue hym to be a iudge, and chose them other sauiours and helpers against Gods wrothe. But the matter is certaine,<note place="margin">The dyuell goeth abough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iesus hath not his name, that he should healpe the with corporall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites. As touching this matter, the disposition and order is certainly ordeyned <hi>Gene.</hi> 2. where God saith: Beare rule ouer the fishes of the sea, the byrdes of the ayer, and the beastes of the earth. But he is called Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, bycause he is a sauiour: &amp; then sheweth saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when al things do fayle and are voyd of helpe, whan we muste now depart into an other lyfe.</p>
               <p>Wherfore this name casteth of all things, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer without Christ is caste before vs for the remission of synnes. For when the Mounke thinketh, my rule is able to make God mercifull:<note place="margin">Iesus and no other sauiour.</note> It is nothing els to say in dede than: My rule is with the name Iesus. And whereas the Pope and all teachers of that secte, holdeth, that only faith iustifieth not, but workes also be necessarie to saluation: It is no other thing than: Good workes are with the name Iesus. But it is abhominable sacrilege, that my worke should be with the name Iesus. This name belongeth only to this chyld. The Pope, the Byshops, and Mounks, &amp;c. doth not so. Neither do we also at all, when we geue place in oure conscience to feare for oure synnes sake, than to confort for Christs sake, neither when we thinke this: If I had lyued on this wyse, if I had done this or the worke, I should haue an easier case before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:85"/>The holy Ghost can not abyde this, but indeuoreth with all might, that this chyld may haue his name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning whole, and that no other may be receaued into the felowship therof. That when we haue nede of saluation against syn and eternall death, we put no trust in oure workes or in the merites of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saintes, but that we stycke vnto this child only by faith, which hath this name and is called Iesus. Neither can it be taken from hym without sacrilege. But they that go about to take it from hym, as the Pope, Turke, and Mounkes do presume, they shal perceaue in dede that they haue committed such sacrilege, that shall neuer be remitted. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarily, if there be but two or three of vs, that trust in this name of the chyld, all the might and power of hell is not able to caste vs from saluation. I will not speake how the world should somwhat feare, for hindering of this saluation. For the Angell brought this name from heauen, and named the child <hi>IESVS,</hi> before he was conceaued in his mothers wombe. Wherfore when they that persecute this name, and sette vp other sauiours, shall go against Gabriel the Angell, or shal reproue him of a lye, he him self shall appeale to God and say: Lord thou hast ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me this commaundement, that I should geue this chylde this name. And then shall it be knowen, what the persecuters do preuayle against this name, they haue remayning for them self neither God, neither Iesus. And they shall dye and perishe for euer in their synnes. This shall be the ende of this matter with their moste greuouse destruction.</p>
               <p>Wherfore let vs neuer forget this name, but let vs surely beare this away, that this chyld is the only Sauiour agaynst death, syn, and the dyuell. If the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1416:85"/>
world shall hate vs therfore, surely it can not doo it with good lucke and prosperitie. If it will not knowledge this chylde for a Sauiour, we can not constrayne it. But let it consyder, from whence it shall receaue saluation, when death shall fall on his head, whether there be any defence agaynst it in mennes workes, in faste, prayer, almes, masses, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of sayntes. &amp;c. Let this be the stablishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all oure matters, to know for a suertye, this name to be geuen from God to this chylde, that it should be called Iesus or a Sauiour. For we shall know and fele this oure Sauiour without coac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, we shall haue a suer truste in hym, when the dreadfull senses of synne and death shall be caste agaynst vs, that there is prepared in hym for vs moste sure saluation. We knowe that this hope and fayth is greatly alowed of God, &amp; that it recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth great renoume. Where as contraryly, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the great indignation of God, whiche doth either seeke other sauiours, or els will not know this sauiour at all.</p>
               <p>Now therfore, compare the name of the chyld and the thyng that was done when the name was geuen.<note place="margin">The name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this is done bycause his name is <hi>IESVS,</hi> that he may be a Sauiour, agaynst synne, and an euill consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, agaynst death and all euill that commeth of synne. For he is circumcised, that he might be vnder the lawe, and let none of al things vndone,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:86"/>
that were enioyned of God at any tyme to men for to do. That when we see oure vncircumcised heartes, and oure vncredible disobedience, we might not des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire therfore, and so caste oure selfe on Christ, and say: I am a synner, who denieth it? neither dyd I euer fulfill the will of God: Christ hath done this for me. Doughtles the lawe can not condemne hym, that he hath lefte the least pointe of righteousnes vndone. Wherfore I haue nothing to do with the lawe, that it should accuse me, or condemne me. For I am not alone, but Christ is with me: Hym do I embrace: his righteousnes lay I before God for me and my synnes: let the dyuell and the lawe therfore do the worst that they can to trouble me for my synnes.</p>
               <p>This muste we vse circumcision and the name of Christ. And he that hath leasure may gather longe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons full of confort as touching Christ and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: After what maner, he shall remit synne, iustifie, and geue euerlasting lyfe. For the Angell doth breifly comprise these long sermons in one word: that Christ shall be a sauiour, and haue the name of Iesus. And to this belongeth especially the singular prophecye of <hi>Esa.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esa.</hi> 9.</note> Where as the Prophet nameth Christ with sixe names, A meruailouse one, a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celler, vertue, stronge, the Father of the worlde to come, the Prince of peace. For all these names belonge to this only, that we by hym may obtayn saluation against synne and death, and after that, righteousnes and euerlasting lyfe. And here it behoueth Antichrist to geue acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of his doings with all his rable of sophisters, whiche taketh this name from Christ, and then describeth hym to men as a cruell and an angry Iudge, to whom no man may come, but by the intercession of sayntes, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1416:86"/>
good works. And here they offend two ways. Fyrste in that, that Christ is spoyled of his name, that he may not be Iesus and a Sauiour. Then in that that this name is geuen to sayntes yea and rather to oure workes, as though that <hi>CHRIST</hi> refused to be a Sauiour, and were delighted with oure destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>These great deceites of the dyuell are not to be vnknowen, when he defyleth oure heartes with thoughtes, that <hi>GOD</hi> is angry, and casteth vs awaye, and hath no respecte vnto vs in temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But I pray the howe do these thoughtes agree with this name, that the Angell by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>GOD</hi> nameth this chyld <hi>IESVS</hi>? If this name then be true, it is not Gods will, that we should perishe, but this is rather his will, that we should be recouered from euill. Therfore let vs lay vppe this name in oure armary, that we may in oure temptations trust vnto the safegard therof, in that that the sonne of God, <hi>CHRIST</hi> oure Lord is called <hi>IESVS.</hi> As it was in paradyse declared as touching hyme,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS</hi> is the day of the Epiphanie. For this they say, that there befell three reuelations in one day, but yet not in one yeare: when Christ opened hym self to the wyse men, that cam from the east by a starre, when he was baptized of Iohn in the floud of Iordaen, and when he dyd the fyrst miracle in the mariage. But whether this chaunced in one day,<note place="margin">The feast of Epiphanie.</note> we make no great matter of it: But this is specially to be consydered, that all these hystories bee, to describe a speciall doctryne, as is that hystorie of this daye as touching the wyse men. For Christ wold haue hym self to be knowen, not only amonge the Iewes, but also amonge the Gentiles. Leaste the Iewes should lay for their excuse, that he had kept hym self so close, that no man could know hym.</p>
               <p>For where as this was confirmed by prophecies, that he should be borne of the Iewes,<note place="margin">This opening was necessary</note> not as a gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouse and magnificent kyng, but so poore, that he could scarsly finde a place to be borne in: it could no otherwyse be, but there muste nedes rise a great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. And the Iewes were not a litle offended therby. Wherfore very necessitie required to make suche an open reuelation of hym self amongest the Gentiles, that although great poouertye was with this kynge, yet that there might be euident commendations of hym. For it is not to be counted a smalle matter, whereas the wyse men came from the easte, and brynge tydings of this chyld to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem. Euen as Simeon also in the temple and Anna
<pb facs="tcp:1416:88"/>
doth commende hyme, and the Angels in the ayer, and the shepheards in Bethleem. All are occupyed in this chylde, they extoll and commend this chylde. There lacke no gloriouse commendations for this chylde, to bringe hyme to light amonge the Iewes, and to make hym knowen of them. But this reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is moste famouse, where as the wyse men comme from the farre costes to Ierusalem, and doo open the matter only there as touching the byrth of the kyng of Iewes, so that Herode and all the Citie of Ierusalem with hym were troubled and moued, wherfore the Iewes can not make any excuse of their ignorance, as though they knew not that this kyng was borne. For they were troubled by the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges of the wyse men, yea and for a greater witnes also, they declare to Herode and to the wyse men the place wher Christ should be borne. Wherfore they are conuicted both by their owne record, and also by the record of the wyse men, that this kings byrth was not vnknowen vnto them.</p>
               <p>The doctrine therfore of this example is put forth to vs, that we should looke for no other ways. No man can come vnto this chyld or fynd hym, but he that foloweth the word as a leader, and neuer goeth from it the bredeth of a nayle. For if we let passe the word,<note place="margin">The word only leadeth to Christ.</note> we stumble euery where. This chyld is to lytle regarded and to muche despised. Wherfore it is not possible, but the reason muste nedes stumble and be offended euerye where, when it considereth with how great pouertye this chyld was borne into the worlde. For what other thyng is all his lyfe els but very pouertye, myserie, affliction, calamitie, contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te &amp; reproche? He therfore that setteth a syde the word,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1416:88"/>
and careth not what he heareth, or what be preached of this chylde, but will onely take his eies for his iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in this matter, can be no more ioyned with Christ than the Iewes were.</p>
               <p>And this thinge is most perillous,<note place="margin">Without the word nothing is done.</note> when it is done in the conscience. As the example of the papistes doth testifie, whiche omitte the worde, &amp; applie their mynd to suche Imaginations, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they phantasie Christe to be such a one, as they conceaue of their wit and reason. They allowe not this in hym, that he onlye sholde be their sauior, wherfore they patche therto their workes, and looke for saluation as well by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as by Christe. They praye vnto Marie also, that she maye reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile her sonne to them. And in suche prayer they holde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that she is a Sauiour, where as it is not so in dede, but a very false imagination. For what soeuer is bestowed in the serche of Christ without the word, all that goeth to the dyuell (whiche afterwarde cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth men to thynke this, that Christ is a iudge, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynteth moste cruell punyshementes for men:) but he that wolde not be confounded in his presence, must be well defenced with the intercessions of Sainctes &amp; of Mary. Wherfore this was a maner in the pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to put more trust in theyr supplications, then in Christe hym selfe. And it can neuer come to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poynte, where as the worde is caste asyde. And verily the dyuell, because he vnderstandeth, that hys chief safegard of al his matters consisteth therin, he la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boreth all that he can to make men forsake the worde, and to folow their own imaginations. For he percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that by this means he shalbe sure to haue the vic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>torie ouer vs. Wherfore nothynge is more necessarye then to hold fast by the word, &amp; to haue no other trust
<pb facs="tcp:1416:89"/>
as touchyng matters that belong vnto godlynes and holynes, than as the worde it selfe prescribeth: but this is not so easye for men to beleue and to persuade them selues.</p>
               <p>There be many that can not be entreated to beleue the wordes of the Lordes Supper:<note place="margin">Christ ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be founde at Ierusalem.</note> They will beleue no more, then their reson and sence can perceaue. Thei beholde the worke it selfe without the word, and they see no other thyng than bread and wyne. But this is nothyng els then to behold the outward shale, and to let passe the thyng which is in Christes wordes.</p>
               <p>The wise men also had first high cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng Christ, when it was opened vnto them by God euen that a kyng of the Iewes was borne. They take their iorney forthwith to Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thinkyng that they shold fynd this king there in his noble court,<note place="margin">It semeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christe should not be founde at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</note> and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious palaice. For what other thing could reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue in suche matters? But when these thoughts are without the word, they come soone to nought: neyther do they find the child at Ierusalem, which neuertheles was the holy citie and habitation of God. They must nedes haue the word to bryng them to Christ. This is the true starre and sonne, which leadeth to this chyld. Wherfore this example of the wise men is to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a singular &amp; an excellent thyng, where as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue out of their eies and hearts all their thoughtes. which they and other men had, and folow the worde, which was put forth to them out of Micheas the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete. For they ar abashed and offended when they be sent into an other place, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ierusalem, where the true seruice of God was, and where God abode hymself, &amp; from God himselfe and his temple, vnto Bethleem, a vile town, wheras neuertheles they cam not to salute
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1416:89"/>
any person of lowe degree, or any workeman, but the kyng of Iewes. They folow the word streight way, and care nothyng for any other thoughtes. They haue onely respect to this, what Micheas sayth, they sticke sure to that. This faithe is a thyng of no common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. For if I had ben in this case, I wold not haue departed from the Temple. For where is it more like, that the kyng of Iewes should be found, which is so famous, than where God hath his habitation, where the priesthode and all the religion hath his fundation? But it goeth otherwyse with this kyng. He alloweth it not, that his place should be amonge the priestes at Ierusalem, as he is neither at this tyme founde with the Pope and his congregation. But he gothe about rather to abrogate and take away both the priesthode and the kyngdome, where as they had so great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in these thynges, in that they were the Priestes Leuites, and people of God, and had his temple. This dothe Christe thynke that it ought not to be suffered. For suche a defilyng of the Temple, priesthode, and of all the seruice myght not be suffered, or if they would stubbornely procede in suspendynge it, Moyses, and all the seruice was to be disanulled for that prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defylynge. As at laste it came to passe. But the obedience of the wise men commeth of true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and therefore they haue theyr dooynges confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>GOD,</hi> soo that theyr waye is shewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them frome Ierusalem vnto Bethleem, and to the house where the chylde was, by a Starre. And they hadde no lyttell neede, this to be confirmed, least they shold be offended by that strange sight. Pouertie was euidente euery where. Ioseph and Marye were not at theyr owne home. The Chylde was layde in
<pb facs="tcp:1416:90"/>
a maunger. There were there no thynges necessarye. How shold this be with suche a great kyng? It might rather be counted a thynge woorthy to be laughed at. But the good wyse men bee not offended with suche thynges, but regard rather the saying of the Prophet, and the signe of the Starre. Wherfore how soeuer the matter gothe, they geue and perfourme that honoure due vnto the kynge, they fall downe before the chylde and worshyp hym: they open theyr treasure, and take foorth a kyngly present.</p>
               <p>And this is the hystorie. In the whiche this is the chiefest poynte,<note place="margin">i. Christ careth not onely for the Iewes, but also for the Gentiles.</note> that <hi>GOD</hi> calleth the Gentils also to his kyngdom, and maketh them his people, although they were not circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cised, neither subiect to the law, as the Iewes were, This is a great benefite, neyther is it mete, that any christian men should be vnkynde for it. For it is a sure euidence for vs Gentiles, that wee may not despayre, as though we had no part in Christ but that wee maye thynke surely, that Christe pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to vs, as well as to the Iewes, although we are not his people, as the Iewes are. For ther is no doubt of this, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wise men were Gentiles, whych had neyther priesthode, neither seruyce, nor word of God, nor circumcision: and yet notwithstandynge all this, they come, although they were strangers, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commendation or settyng foorthe of them selues, to the felowshyp of Christs lyght, and acknowledge him And he acknowledgeth them also, he alloweth theym for theyr worshippyng and reuerence done to hymself.

into the whiche, wee, that were not his people, are receaued, not of merite and deserte, but of mere grace. Then must we learn in this historie also,<note place="margin">ii. What is our duetie to doo towarde the chylde.</note> what is our duetie to doo to Christ agayn, euen to resist manfully all offences as these wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did, and to confesse Christ before the worlde as they dyd, to seeke hym, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hym as our Sauiour. And because his kyngdom for the weake and simple syght therof, is opprest with many and great difficulties, to bestowe oure goodes and substaunce gladly to the maintaynynge thereof. And we haue store enough to open oure treasures, as the wise men dyd vnto Christe, and to offer presentes vnto hym. For this is it written: That ye doo to the least of myne, ye doo it to me.<note place="margin">

Wherfore the prouidence of God by those wyse men prepared wayfarynge victuall for the chylde &amp; his parentes in their iorney. It is very like by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the Euangelist, that it was no small gyft, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che sayth, that they opened theyr treasures. But seyng it is euident, how great the good wyl of the wise men was towarde the chyld, who can doubt but that their magnificence and liberalitie was great?

               <p>We must ioyne also with this hystorie, that that is put forth in the prophecy of Micheas, wherin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined an euident description of Christ, with a syngu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar doctrine and lesson by it selfe. Whose wordes are these.</p>

               <p>In this sentence, as the Iewes testifie themselues. God gaue a playn and euident prophecie, that Christe should be loked for at Bethleem, and that there should be the first swathling bands of his apperyng in mans nature.<note place="margin">Bethleem, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle towne by Christs birth hath great re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noune.</note> This is that chief renoume, which setteth forth this litle town of Bethleem more magnificently, then is the most noble &amp; excellent citie Ierusalem. And this is the cause, why the Euangelist semeth to change the woordes of the Prophete: The Prophete calleth it small. The Euangelist wyll not haue it counted smal. For the Euangelist beholdeth not the outward syght, as the Prophete dyd, but the spirituall glorie, Because the Sonne of <hi>GOD</hi> is borne there. To the whiche honor there is none of all the honours that euer was geuen to any Citie, to be compared. Wherfore they are magnificent and glorious woordes, wyth the whiche the Euangeliste commendeth Bethleem: Out of thee (sayth he) shall there come foorthe a Capitayn for me, which shall fede my people Israell. And this is a most sweete Prophecye, whiche describeth Christe vnto vs
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1416:91"/>
on suche wyse, that although before the world he be a man despised for his pouertie, and borne in an obscure and an vnknowen place, yet is he that captayne and prince of Israel, that is ouer the people of God. But what maner of kyngdome this is to be taken for I declared before in the sermon of the Angell,<note place="margin">Christ the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitayne.</note> whiche hym self also calleth Christ the Lord. Not suche a one, as is a tyrant, and that wyll vexe men wyth his cruel imperye. For euen for that cause (sayth the Prophete) Bethleem that arte smalle. As though he shoulde say: If thys Lorde woulde haue hadde imperiall maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, that he myghte seme terrible vnto other, he might haue chosen an other place for his byrthe. But here is no princely prouision, no armour, no riches, no waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng men, no appointyng of offices. And that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fyrst principles myght foorthewith declare, what a kyngdome this was to come, he chose not Ierusalem as the moste holyest, nor Rome as the most mightiest but he was content with a poore towne, that it might foorthwith be declared therby, that he should becom a lord not after the common facion,<note place="margin">What maner of lord Christ should be.</note> but poore and nedy in the sight of the world, how<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eit riche in spirit, and in all spirituall giftes. For this is his title, to be a Lord &amp; a Prince. But yet all the sight, when he is borne, and when he is born in Bethleem, and what soeuer thyng is apparaunt to the senses, as touchynge hym, was lyke no princely pompe. Wherfore sith he is a Lord and Prince, and yet not glorious before the worlde, but poore and nedye: what other glorie can it bee, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as hee is myserable in respecte of worldlye Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, so contraryly he is myghtye and greate, in those thynges, wherein the worlde is founde to bee nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and a starke begger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:92"/>And here of it is, that he is excellente in rightuousnes, where as the world is oppressed with sinnes: that he is eternall, wheras the worlde is casuall: he is the lorde of the dyuell, where as the dyuell hath the worlde yoked vnder his moste cruell bondage. He is good, whereas the worlde is all naught: he hath God mercifull vnto hym, where as the worlde struggleth with the wrath of God: He is the lorde of euerlastynge lyfe, where as the worlde is appointed to hell.</p>
               <p>This is the imperie of this chylde, and for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and state doth the fruite redound vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He wyll geue no bodyly saluation, but as farre as the soules helth and his glorie requireth: for he is poore and nedy. Wherfore let no man come to the kyngdom of Christ, to the entent that he may enlarge his goods and encrease his substance. Ye may loke for this of the Pope, and of men of that sorte. He aduanceth his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to imperie, he getteth them riches, parteth amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them all Prouinces, as Daniell prophecied. But the princely power of this childe, is to be felte only in this, that thy synnes may be forgyuen, that he maye iustifye and saue thee, that he may geue his holye spirite, and transpose thee out of the kyngdome of the worlde and of death, into the kyngdome of God. And to this now is Faith requisite, and as I sayd before, that thou kepe sure the worde of God. For he that letteth passe Gods woorde, and foloweth his owne thoughtes, shall lose Christ, neither shall he knowe hym for a king, but for a Iudge, he shall be in hatred and feare, as the dyuell is. For they are wont to feare hym also, when they feele them selues gyltie for their synne, least he shoulde take them to be punyshed: wheras Christ in the meane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son confesseth hym selfe to be the lord and prince of his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1416:92"/>
people, to delyuer theim from synne, and to transpose them into the kyngdom of grace. For his people are no other, but myserable synners, which tremble at the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of theyr synne, and are afrayde, and would fayne be in Gods fauour. So that herby may the playn des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the Prophet be perceyued. Fyrst, that he shal be no bodyly prince, nor yet exercise spirituall punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes agaynst wyckednes, but to geue saluation to all men, that beleue in hym. agaynst synne, the deuyll death, and hell. For of suche a prince, there is sure hope of Saluation.</p>
               <p>And thus farre doo the Scribes recite the saying of the Prophete, and no farther. They feare peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture lest this be to muche: For they perceaue well, that this is Herodes entent to seeke some way howe to slea and to take this kyng of the Iewes out of the way. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they reherse not the whole sentence before Herode, and they do almost professe by worde, that at this time they acknowledge no other kyng of the Iewes, besyde Herode. And yet is it in the Prophete, that a Prince of the Iewes shoulde come, and shoulde procede oute of Bethleem. Therfore they leaue this vnperfect, neither dare they to pronounce any farther. But the Prophete although he was not lyuyng at that tyme, yet dothe he procede and describe what maner of captayn or kynge this should be: whiche belongeth also to his persone in these wordes: <hi>Et egressus eius ab initio a diebus aeterni tatis.</hi> And his out going hath ben from the beginning,<note place="margin">

selfe be a captaine ouer all Israell, it is not obscurelye spoken, and there is a sure signe, that he shalbe a man. But wheras the Prophet sayth furthermore: His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedyng is from the begynnyng, and from the dayes of eternitie: It signifieth that he is the eternal and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng God, whiche had not his beginnyng in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem: Of a trouth he was born in Bethleem, and this is one maner of procedyng. But there is an other also beside this: Which is sayd to be from the beginnnyng and from the days of eternitie. The wordes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phete are not to be changed.<note place="margin">From whens Christ should be borne.</note> Fyrst he sayth: Out of the shall procede. Here do the priestes and scribes testify, that to procede &amp; to be borne, signifieth all one. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same word afterward must nedes signifie the same thyng, when he saith: Whose procedyng is from the old dayes, and from eternitie, that is before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyme that dais and houres were. Wherefore if thou wilte know, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce this child is borne, mark this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: He is born (saith he) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bethlee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But what more? hath he no other birthe then this? the prophet saith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore: yes, he was rather borne before al creatures heauen, earth, the sonne and moone. But that may be determined by no wordes, and it is nothyng els, then that he was borne without begynnyng eternally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any tyme or dais. This did neither He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode, neither the Iewes vnderstand, neither wer they worthy to vnderstand it. And this is the prince &amp; king which was born at Bethleem, a very man, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse hath this name also, Procedyng from the old dayes, which proceded and was born before the world, that is,<note place="margin">Christ is god</note> which is a true and eternal god, and also a true &amp; a naturall man. And this is the cause of so great stir rynges &amp; motions in the worlde. For it can not vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1416:93"/>
this to be procedyngs and birthes without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, that this child also should haue his procedyng before there was sonne or moone. The Iewes could not abyde this, and afterward there sprang vp many heresies, whiche spake agaynst it. But this matter is left to be consydered of the, which hast gods word put foorth vnto the. Out of whome then was he borne, if he was borne before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world? Uerily of no other, but of God only. This must reason nedes confesse, if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that God made heauen and earth. For what other thyng could be before heauen and earth, than God? If this childe then proceded, &amp; was borne, before heauen and erth was made, it must nedes folow that he was borne of God, and is very God. For besydes God and his creatures was there nothyng.</p>
               <p>And this is surely a sentence,<note place="margin">For that that Christ is god he dothe the workes belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to God.</note> which conteyneth the ground &amp; foundation of all things. For if Christ were onely a pure man, death wold haue confounded hym with all other mortall men. For in that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was born of a virgin, it hath not so great strength against death. But this is a greatter miracle, where as God made Eue of a ribbe, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that that a virgin brought forth a chyld. For a virgin is of that sexe and kynd, whiche is borne to bryng foorth children. Wherfore that thing coulde not represse the dyuell nor deathe, because he was borne of the Uirgin Marye. But all the healpe consysteth herein, that the virgin Mary, is not onely great wyth chylde, but also with suche a chyld, which was borne before the worlde. Wherefore the dyuell, deathe, and all the kyngdom of the dyuell is ouercom in that they proue maistrie with suche a manne, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hadde hys procedynge or begynnynge beefore the worlde.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:94"/>If it were not for this, and if he had his procedynge out of Bethleem only,<note place="margin">Christe dyeth as a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as he is God he can not die.</note> he coulde haue the vpper hande ouer death no more than we all: he should be in danger therof aswel as his mother Mary, and Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tist, and other excellent sainctes. But his procedyng is named to be from the old days. Wherfore death could not shewe suche strength in this chylde, wherwith hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he kylled all men. For wher as he was God, he coulde not synne, neither bee made gyltie by the lawe, neither be killed of deth, neither damned of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel. And yet for all that, forasmuche as he had his procedynge in tyme out of Bethleem, and was borne into the worlde as other chyldren were, he coulde not but dye. Hereof it is, that death and the dyuell layeth snares for theym selues, which consyder no more then the procedyng out of Bethleem. And after this procedyng, the chyld is in daunger of death. But when he was now in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, he trieth his righte by these woordes: I was borne before the world, and so by the diuine and godly power, he breaketh the bandes of death, of synne, and of the diuel, that they can take no hold vpon him at all.</p>
               <p>Suche a memoriall would this Prophete set foorth as touchyng this kynge, that we shoulde not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his two maner of procedynges, or as we saye, of two maner of byrths. For he is such a person, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is bothe a true <hi>GOD,</hi> and also a very man, but yet on suche wyse, that he is not two persons, but one. So that he confesseth, that <hi>CHRIST</hi> is the sonne of Mary, whiche sucked at her brestes, and encreased in the body as other men dyd. But yet neuerthelesse he was borne before the worlde, without beginnynge, so that nowe these two seuerall substances of manhoode and godhead, be withoute separation vnited togyther,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1416:94"/>
in one persone, and ioyned togyther. This dyd not the hygh priestes tell Herode, neyther was he worthye to knowe so greate mysterie. This byrthe is excedynge meruaylous, whiche if we desyre to knowe,<note place="margin">The proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng out of Bethleem, ought fyrst to be learned.</note> we muste take our begynnyng of our discipline and meditation out of his procedyng in Bethleem. As this also is the order of the Prophete, as soon as he reherseth the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall byrthe. Yea and hee maketh more large menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as touchyng this, than as concernyng that byrthe that is eternalle. For hee that wylle meddle wyth matters belongyng to God without peryll, muste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn at the lowest: and first of all learne, what thynge he doothe in the earthe, and howe hee reueleth and openeth hym self to men. Then shal he go foorth with out stumblyng, as the order of the Prophetes descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, appoynteth, and shall know that this chyld was borne from euerlastyng. Then shall it not bee terrible, but pleasant &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable.<note place="margin">The though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination.</note> But the ouerthwart nature of men marreth &amp; confoundethe all thynges, because that all begyn their discipline at predestination.

But if thou wilt go the right waye to the knowledge of God, take thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng at Christes swathing bands. As the prophet setteth foorth this order, that a man should fyrst go to Bethleem, and afterward clymbe vp into heauen, and to eternitie. As Christ hym selfe teacheth, where as he sayth: Philyp, I am the waye, he that seeth me,<note place="margin">

And so the matter shall be without perill. For when thou canst truly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende this man Christ, thou shalt know God also.

               <p>Wherfore herein is now set forth a confortable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample vnto vs,<note place="margin">Christ hath no nede of baptisme.</note> wheras the sonne of God offered him self to be baptised, which neuerthelesse synned not, and doth that that he was not bounde to doe, wheras we do not that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to do. And it is farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke, that we should do more than oure duetie, when we through oure wickednes are very farre from that that we shoulde do.</p>
               <p>Wherfore this ought especially to be marked in this place, that Christ the sonne of God,<note place="margin">Christ came to baptisme.

For why doste thou, and thy childern refuse baptisme, seing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of God receaued it? what great madnes or what great furie is this in the, that thou shouldest denye suche a great worke?

                  </note>But this matter is not without oure profyte. For what good it doth vnto vs, it appeareth in this, wher as God by this baptisme sheweth foorth hym selfe wholye. For as the Euangelist beareth witnes, Iohn sawe the heauens open. Whiche is a signe that God is delighted with baptisme, whiche Christ hym selfe the Sonne of God sanctifieth with his body. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heauen is opened which was shut vp before, and now aboue the baptisme of Christ is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of heauen made wyde open: so that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is no distance betwene vs and God, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>GOD</hi> is now fallen downe vnto Iordane. What is a reuelation then, if this be none? Wherfore if the feast of Epiphanie (that is) of reueling and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, be requisite, why is not this constitute and appointed, wheras so playne a manifestation and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holye Ghost is sette foorth?<note place="margin">The reueling of the holy Ghost.</note> For the holy Ghost procedeth here after a moste gentle sight, as a symple doue, whiche amongest all byrdes is moste tame, and is affirmed to be voyde of all wrathe. To the entent that we might conceaue hereby a sure token, that the holy Ghost will declare no crueltye towarde vs, but bestowe that on vs thorough Christ, wherby we may be iustified and saued. And for this cause is Christ also opened after suche a gentle sorte to be the Sonne of God:<note place="margin">The sonne of God.</note> and wher as he had no nede of baptisme for his owne behalf, he is present therat, and receaueth bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, not only for an example, but also for a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that his baptisme might profite vs also, &amp; may cause

               <p>Besyde this, wheras y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father openeth hym self by a voyce: This is my dearly beloued sonne, in whom I am delighted. This is an other maner of voyce, then was shewed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mount Sinay, when the earth and hylles dyd shake, &amp; the men that hearde it thought them self to be in danger of their lyfe. He sheweth not now such a cruell voyce. All things are full of swetnes &amp; huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. And God doth almost pronounce w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this, saying on this wyse: To you mortall men, is this man put forth in baptisme. If ye desyre to know him, it is my dearely beloued sonne, in whome is my chief and only pleasure. Neither is there any cause why ye shoulde feare him.

For what spice of crueltye may here be? The sonne of God, which is innocent &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out synne, standeth in Iordane &amp; receaueth baptisme. The holy Ghost commeth with the meeke forme of a doue. Besides this God sheweth forth a very humane and gentle voyce, declaringe that he sendeth vnto vs no Apostle, no Prophet, no Angell, but his Sonne, in whome he may greatly delyght.</p>

sonnes sake, all his must nede be accepted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father. Wherfore let all men regard diligently this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that they heare him, &amp; obey his precept. For he had no nede of circumcision and baptisme, bycause he was voyd of synne. But the baptisme of Iohn was made of God for sinne, that al that acknowlegde their synnes, &amp; be sory for them, &amp; desyer that they might be pardoned, should go to baptisme, &amp; thinke for a suerty, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God is merciful vnto them. But why is Christ bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, which neuerthelesse is without synne? Not for his owne behalf but for ours, which are synners. For he taketh oure synnes vpon hym, and deliuereth vs from them. And for this cause he cometh to baptisme, as the Euangelist sheweth very properly, wheras he saith: Christ forbidden of Iohn, aunswereth: Suffer me, for this is it mete to fulfill all righteousnes. Which is as much as to say: In his baptisme is conteyned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteousnes of al the world. For wheras al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlds synnes are put on me, if the recouer of the worlde be sought for, I muste do that that God commanded synners to do, (that is) that they should be baptised of the. Do not thou forbyd it, but rather further it, that euen as I do gladly take vpon me baptisme for syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes sake: so do thou gladly procure baptisme for me, that the wrath of God may be pacified, and remission of synnes ordeyned. To this meaning sendeth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this voyce out of heauen: This is my dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sonne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 3.</note> in whom I am well pleased. He speaketh these words at that tyme, when Christ is baptised, that we may vnderstande, that this is oure baptisme, and thinke surely that the wrathe of God is pacified, and oure synnes purged by this baptisme, and that God wil receaue vs again into fauour for his sonnes sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:1416:98"/>No difficultie or combrance be it neuer so great, should take the sound of this voyce, and so magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a reuelation out of oure sight and mynde, wheras the Lord oure <hi>GOD</hi> openeth the heauens, and sendeth doune the holy Ghost in the forme of a doue, &amp; wher as God the Father hym self sendeth forth such a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant voyce saying: Beholde, here is for you my sonne, whome I loue and esteme aboue all things, yea and my self also wholy for you.

He that wold earnestly ponder with hym selfe, what a blasphemy this is, to dishonour and disgrace Gods goodnes and humanitie with such pryde, wold thynk it better to dye then to lyue, leaste he should fede on

Then was heauen shut vppe. Then were we fayne to hear and beleue Mounkes dreames as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng purgatorie, and terrible spirits, and soules, and suche other lyes. But now other things are taught, and only it remayneth that men learne. But for as muche as we preuayle nothing with the worlde as touching this, at leaste wyse let vs remember oure duetye, and geue <hi>GOD</hi> thankes for this benefite, for that he reueleth his mynde vnto vs on this daye, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto vs a thing of inestimable pryce, euen the holye Ghost, in the lykenes of a doue, his owne sonne at Iordane in baptisme, and hym self in a voyce full of maiestie and confort. Who woulde not therfore condemne hym worthely, whiche geueth not thanks, which reioyceth not, which receaueth not the sonne of God with a feruent desyer, whiche standeth here in Iordane, receueth baptisme as a synner. Upon whom commeth the holy Ghost in the sight of a doue, where the Fathers voyce is so nighe, that it can be no nigher? There is no doubt but that the angels of God were present. For where as is the Father, the sonne, and the holy Ghoste, there muste nedes be a great multitude of Angels. Wherfore see that ye esteme this hystory hyghly. In dede it is a reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher as <hi>CHRIST</hi> openeth hym self to the wyse men by a starre. But this reuelation passeth that very farre. For these are three especiall kynges, God the Father, God the sonne, and God the holy Ghost, whiche are al present together, when Christ is baptised. If it had
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1416:99"/>
so pleased hym, this reuelation might haue ben done as well either in the wildernes, or in the temple of Ierusalem: But it was shewed euen at baptisme of the set purpose of God, that we might learne religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and reuerently to esteme baptisme: And bycause we also are baptised, let vs esteme oure selues no other wyse, then fresh and new made sayntes.</p>
               <p>The pratynge of the Anabaptistes is very great, where as they say now,<note place="margin">Baptisme is not water only.</note> that baptisme is nothyng els than water. But with what word myght a man sufficientlye curse these execrable heddye persons? This is the Iudgement of brute beastes, and not of Christians. For there is not only water, but also the worde of <hi>GOD</hi> as it is seen at <hi>CHRITES</hi> Baptisme. For God the Father, the Sonne, and the holye Ghost is present. Wherfore it is no more water of the Element, but suche water as in the which the Sonne of God is washed, vpon the which the holy Ghost is caried, God the Father preacheth, that this water might not be counted symple water, but sanctified, whereat God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost is present.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 23.</note> As Christ also for that cause appoynteth the forme of baptisme, that it should be geuen in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Wherfore when a chylde is now baptised, the Sonne of <hi>GOD</hi> is present at this baptisme, whiche with his body, The holy Ghoste, whiche with his presence, God the Father whiche with his voyce hath consecrated and halowed baptisme. Wherfore it can not be said, that it is but water. For all the Godhead is present. And for this cause we iudge baptisme no
<pb facs="tcp:1416:100"/>
mans worke. For although a man baptiseth, yet he baptiseth not in his name but in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the sonne, and of the holy Ghost, whiche come and are present at the worke of their owne accorde. Or els that wold neuer folow at baptisme that ought to folow. Now who is he, that wold count this vile and of no valew, that God the father, the sonne, &amp; the holy Ghost, is present? who will be so bold as to calle it very water? Is it not euident, what God of his owne addeth to the water? If water be mingled, now it loseth her name.<note place="margin">Baptisme is no work of man.</note> Why then doe we in this place seue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the word from the water, and pronounce it to be water only, as though the word of God, or as though God hym self were not in this water? But it is not so, for the Father, the sonne, &amp; the holy Ghoste are present, and be in this water. As in Iordane, when Christ stode in the water, the holy Ghost was caried aboue it, and God preached by it.</p>
               <p>Wherfore baptisme is suche water, that taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way syn, death, and all euill, and geueth saluation and euerlasting lyfe. So great price is now added to this water, in the which God demitteth hym selfe. But God is the God of lyfe. And sith he is in this water, it muste nedes be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water of lyfe,<note place="margin">Baptisme ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away syn &amp; death.</note> which taketh away death and damnation, and geueth lyfe euerlastinge. This ought baptisme truely to be knowen and highly estemed. For he is not baptised in the name of any Angell or man, but in the name of the Father, of the sonne, &amp; of the holy Ghost. Or as it is in the actes of the Apostles,<note place="margin">To baptise in the name of Iesu.</note> in the name of Iesu, which is as much. For he that confesseth Iesus Christ truely, with the same confession compriseth the Father and the holy Ghost. For Christ saith, that he commeth from the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1416:100"/>
Father, and that he sendeth the holy Ghost. He then that confesseth truely Iesus Christ, can not dyminish the authoritie of his word, but shall beleue that the sonne is not alone, but that the Father, the sonne, and the holy Ghost, be there together, although the Father and the holy Ghost be not named.</p>
               <p>Wherfore let vs not lightly esteme this, let vs not separate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy baptisme or water, wher with he is baptised, but let vs confesse,<note place="margin">What is the vse of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> that this is therfore appointed of God to purifie vs from oure syn for Christs sake, through the holy Ghost. For if it were not for this, what should the Father, the sonne, and the holy Ghost, haue to do ther? Wherfore if thou beleuest that a new borne chyld is synfull, dippe hym into bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, that God may worke his work in hym, as his word commandeth, and doth promise a new byrth by the water and the holy Ghost, and also this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 16.</note> that he that beleueth and is baptised, might be saued. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse if thou confesse that he is in death, dippe hym in this baptisme and lauer after the commandement of Christ, and then shall death be swalowed vp.</p>
               <p>Neither muste thou, that art baptised, thinke any otherwyse, than that baptisme is a seale and pledge of assurance, that God hath forgeuen thee thy synnes, and hath promised lyfe euerlasting for Christs sake. For baptisme hath a godly power, to take away death and synne. For therfore are we baptised. And although synnes be committed after that, and the works of godlynes not perfectly done, yet they that repente agayn, do not forfeit their couenant of baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and the promise therof. For this can by no meanes agree, that a man should desyer remission of syn, and also geue vp hym self wholy to synne. But this is in
<pb facs="tcp:1416:101"/>
all poyntes necessarie to repent, and to consyder with hym self vprightly and truely, that God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vs his grace and fauour. When he cam to the baptisme of his Sonne, and that we should retourne to that grace, and beleue surely, that oure synnes are forgeuen, not for vs or for any creatures sake, but for <hi>CHRIST</hi> oure Lord, whiche hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this baptisme, and was baptised hym self also as a synner.</p>
               <p>Wherfore this reuelation passeth not a litle the other, whiche was shewed to the wyse men by a starre. For out of this the frute redoundeth to all Chrystian men, where as in that reuelation of the wise men, a few Gentiles only cam to the knowledge of the kynge of the Iewes. Wherfore it were not without a good cause, if this were called the day of the Baptisme of Christ, and in the whiche Christ was baptised. Then should we haue a iuste cause geuen, to pleade the matter of Baptisme agaynst the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes and the dyuell, whiche may soner be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of vs for any matter, then that we should consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the busynes of oure saluation. For ther he setteth agaynst vs with tooth and nayle, that we may not come to the sight of oure inheritance. As the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Popedome doth yet admonishe vs, vnder the whiche litle or nothing was set foorth in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as touching this reuelation at Iordane. Wherfore thynke this to be a thing most worthye to be remembred, where as God this daye, with a moste euident sermon as touching his Sonne, opened hym self, euen that all matters that are betwene Christ and vs do highly please God the Father. For he that obeyeth the sonne and kepeth his word, he is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1416:101"/>
to God, and receaueth the holy Ghost. Whiche openeth hym self at this Baptisme in a very amiable and pleasant sight. And herevnto also it agreeth, that the Father sendeth foorth a verye bounteous voyce, when he sayth: Behold, here is for you, not an Angell, nor a Prophet, nor an Apostle, but my sonne, and my owne self also. What reuelation can be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? And what seruice can we do that is more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to hym, than that we obey his decree and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE</hi> Father and mother of Iesus went to Ierusalem after the custome of the feast day. And when they hadde fulfilled the dayes, as they returned home, the chylde Iesus abode styll in Ierusalem, and his Father and mother knewe not of it: but they supposing him to haue ben in the companye, came a dayes iourney and sought hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge theyr kinsfolke and acquayntaunce. And when they founde hym not, they went backe agayne to Ierusalem, and sought hym. And it fortuned that after three dayes, they founde him in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, sitting in the middest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctours,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:102"/>
hearing them, and posing them. And all that hearde hym were astonyed at his vnderstanding and aunswers. And when they sawe hym, they meruayled, and his mother sayd vnto him: Sonne, why hast thou thus dealt with vs? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, thy father and I haue sought thee sorowing. And he sayd vnto them: Howe happened that ye sought me? wyst ye not that I muste go about my fathers busynes? And they vnderstode not that saying, which he spake vnto them. And he went downe with them, and came to Nazareth, and was obedient vnto them. But his mother kept all these sayinges together in her heart. And Iesus prospered in wysdome and age, and in fauour with God and men.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS</hi> Gospel hath a very depe &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, and it is a hard thing to attempt the interpretation therof. It is conteyned in this hysto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, how the matter goeth, when the chyld Iesus is loste out of the heart. But we for this tyme will let passe this hyghe mysterie, and will deferre it vnto an other tyme. And will now take that vpon vs to expounde, which is moste playne and euident. As touching the last feaste, this haue we sayd, that it is named the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanie or appearing of Christ. Which thing was done to the entent that this chylde new borne should not be kepte priuie, but be opened to al men. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse should we haue no vse of this chylde, if we had not gotten the knowledge of hym. And for this cause other hystories are put foorth, out of the whiche it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, howe Christ hath reueled and opened hym self: As when Iohn baptised hym in Iordane, and he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1416:102"/>
opened his glorie by a signe in the mariage of Canaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen that he is suche a Lord, that hath full power of the creature. And that he should not only be knowen amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest men, but also be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted famouse for a power farre passing the power of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And because he is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to be such a lord, whose power is most hyghest &amp; almightie: we ought to take hym for oure Sauiour, vnto whome we should haue refuge in all difficultie &amp; aduersitie, &amp; looke for helpe of him. And to this thing doth this present Gospell belonge. For this is also a reuelation, by the whiche <hi>CHRIST</hi> doth declare, that he is a child not after the common sorte, but after a peculier manner and trade, whereas he commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way hym self pryuily from his mother, he regardeth not obedience, whiche otherwyse all other chyldern owe to their parents after Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement.<note place="margin">How Christ was loste at Ierusalem.</note> This matter chanced by such an occasion. The parents, as other Iewes, were bound euery yeare to kepe the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>souer. They came to the temple of the Lord to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem. And wheras they had brought the child Iesus with them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the feast was done, the child folowed not the companie of his parents, but taried in the temple. At the begynninge the mother was not so sorowful for him, peraduenture because he was wont in tymes paste to go to his kynsefolke. For Christ fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed nothing in the fyrst yeares but after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon capacitie of that age, he was not grym and sadde, otherwyse than it was agreable to a chylde. In runninge and playe he shewed not hym self vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke to other chyldern, excepte that that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not suche sedes of vyce in hym. And hereof it is that Ioseph and Marie were sone persuaded that he was with his kynsfolke, and are not carefull
<pb facs="tcp:1416:103"/>
for hym. But when they had iorneied one daye, at euening they inquire in the Inne for the chylde: And when they found hym not amongest their kynsfolke, they were greatly moued. For this chylde was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted peculiarly to the mother. And Ioseph also hadde no litle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, to see diligently to this chylde. But yet was Mary the only mother. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she toke this matter moste greuously, and feared very greatly, for that she found hym not where she sought hym. And it is easie to iudge that it was no smalle feare. Doubtlesse they returned by night the nigheste way, but they finde not the chyld. What they thought in this case and what heart they hadde, iudge thou of thy owne felinge, although it be not lyke? For one day was passed ouer without care, in the whiche he was loste, vpon the second they make inquisition, in the thyrde daye at length they fynde hym. And as for two nyghtes together they slepte not, but passed it ouer with carefull thoughtes. And doubtelesse the mothers mynde was greuously wounded with suche moste bytter suspitions, reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this with here self: God hath taken away thy Sonne from the, he will not suffer thee to take anye longer ioye of this gifte, bycause thou haste kepte hym so negligently. Ioseph toke it for a punishement of Gods wrathe, bycause he tooke no better hede to this only chylde.</p>
               <p>This therfore is most worthye to be marked, that Christ wolde declare his priuiledge,<note place="margin">Why Christ wold hyde hym self.</note> that he is not bound with lyke force as other chyldern be, to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to the parents. But that whatsoeuer he dyd, he dyd it for an example of a free will, and not constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the rigour of the lawe: For he was not only
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1416:103"/>
the sonne of his mother, but also her God and Lorde. Wherfore he is not here subiecte to his mother, as we shall heare nexte, where as he sayth: Woman, what haue I to doo with the? So doth he here also, and declareth that he is not a pure man, whiche can be constrayned by necessitie to obey his parents. But this doth he openly professe, that he hath a hygher parent, to whome he is more bound then to Mary &amp; Ioseph. How is it (sayth he) that ye sought me: Knew ye not, that it behoued me to be about those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to my Father? As though he should say: I am youre sonne, but yet on suche wyse, that I am more bounde to obey the heauenly Father.</p>
               <p>Wherfore he is made open and manifeste for oure behalf, that we might wel know hym, and repose and lay vp within vs the true example of hym, that he is not only man, but also God. Wherfore assone as his mother said vnto him: So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, why dyddest thou deale thus with vs? He aunswereth, I am not disobedient vnto you, I haue not despised you as ye thought. Wherfore he defendeth his right against his mother, and bycause of his parents sorow and great vexation of their mynde, their case semeth so muche the worse. For they might haue called to mynde the words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels and shepheards, as touching this chylde, and might know, that although this chylde folowed not them, yet he ought not to be blamed as disobedient, but it was their part to thinke of a greater obedience whiche ought to be shewed to the heauenly Father.<note place="margin">Christs exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple tendeth to this purpose to know that God muste be more obeyed then man.</note> And for a necessarie cause was this example to be put forth of Christ against oure reason &amp; ouerthwart ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which doo alwayes iudge that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seruice inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by man is better than the seruice appoynted by God.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:104"/>
Wherfore this rule is here to be learned, that when the matter commeth to this point, that we muste either denye God of his seruice, or els oure parents and magistrates, we muste aledge <hi>CHRISTES</hi> worde for oure defence, and say: I muste rather be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these thinges that belonge to my Father, whiche is in heauen? Besyde this case, I will gladly do all that I can to fulfill my duetie towarde my Father and mother, toward the powers, and satisfie the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie and maister. But in this state I muste declare that I haue an other Father, whiche ought more to be obeyde. This thing had <hi>CHRISTS</hi> parents forgotten in this place, wherfore Christ calleth them agayn into the way, and admonisheth them as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their duetye.</p>
               <p>Wherfore Christ putteth foorth an example for reason.<note place="margin">We muste obey God mor then man.</note> Whiche, when it ought to obey and serue God, excuseth it self by this pretence, that God hath commanded obedience also to be done to parents and magistrates. Euen as the persecuters of the Gospell do now at this tyme. They haue learned of vs to haue the magistrates in hygh reuerence, and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll very muche the obedience to magistrates. We know (say they) that this is true and accordyng to scripture, that both kyndes of the Sacrament ought to be receaued: But we are bound to be obedient to the magistrates. Oure parentes are agaynst it, oure kyng is agaynst it, whiche forbiddeth it, wherfore I may not doo so. If thou doste magnifie the power, whiche is appointed vnto the by <hi>GOD</hi>: verily God whiche is the geuer of all power, is more to be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, whiche before his decree, wherby he gaue this power, speaketh on suche wyse of the greater obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1416:104"/>
which is due vnto hym selfe. I am the Lorde thy God. Ought not this then to seme a iuste cause, that thou sholdest do what soeuer he byd thee to do, yea at that tyme also when thy gouerner commaunde thee the contrary, and that thou shouldest also say and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to all thy instant aduersaries? I must go about these thynges that belong vnto my father.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and charge ought to be more estemed then all thinges that be. If that be fulfilled, then afterwarde thou must fulfil also other ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the emperors, parentes, magistrates, that the commonalties be not disturbed therby.</p>
               <p>The vtteryng of this hystorie of Christe, belongeth not onely to faith,<note place="margin">Christ vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him selfe to be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample.</note> as dothe the reuelations made by the starre, &amp; opened in Iordan, and in the mariage: but it pertaineth also to geuing an ensa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, that as touchi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; things pertaining to the obeying of God, we shold haue respect to no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nor prince. For in this we ar bound by obligation to a more higher lord, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to god: whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t must nedes be don, &amp; him must we only serue. If thou hast performed this obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then maist thou not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that obedience y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is due to inferior gouerners, but yet on suche wise, that they be not a lette to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of the greater obedience, whose seruice must be done before all others. As touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high temptation wherin Christ is lost out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart, I will not speake, I will only haue in mynde the vttering of this chyld wherin he declareth himself to be such a one, that hath a greater right then other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that that he casteth, of the yoke of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which was made without po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, &amp; waiteth not vpon his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but causeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to com back vnto him again, to thintent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<pb facs="tcp:1416:105"/>
that they hearde spoken of the angel: And he shal be called the sonne of the most highest. And that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this saying might be had in remembrance, and not forgotten, it was expedient that it should be rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by this dede. So that this reuelation dothe very well agree with the other. For here is it made euident that Christ is the chiefest man as the shepards, &amp; Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon did testifie of hym. Wherfore he thinketh sure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his cause &amp; state is chief aboue al other childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, howbe it he had not yet forsaken the felowship &amp; pastime of his play felowes. But that Christes busines was in the temple, the Euangelist doth sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declare. For his reasonyng was not as touchyng the dearth of vic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuals,<note place="margin">What busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Christe had in the Temple.</note> or of suche trifling matters, but he conferred and disputed with the scribes, as touchyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of god. First he knew of them, how they vnderstode &amp; expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded scriptures, &amp; then he reproued their errors, but yet on such wise as did agre to his age.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 5.</note> And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g this for an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple out of Mathew, where as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> scribes disputed of the fift co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, &amp; so expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it, as though y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> murder with the hand wer only forbyd ther by. He himself cometh forth with a more perfecter mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning &amp; sence therof, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al railings, false accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, cursyngs, hatred, braulyngs of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> angry, ar to be taken to be against this Precept. For the pythe of the precept is to exclude priuate reuengyng, &amp; all thyngs that geue occasion &amp; inticement thervnto, that there myght be a mercyfull affection and gentylnesse toward al men.</p>
               <p>After thys sorte dydde the chylde at that tyme teach to make inquisition for the moste weyghtye and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte thynges in the lawe. He hym selfe also demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of these thynges, that this reason and meanynge that was newe and neuer hearde of amongest the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1416:105"/>
Scribes, myghte gette admiration and wondrynge. Howe maye it bee, that a chylde shoulde haue so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte Iudgemente of so greate matters? For thys is doubtelesse, that hee thoughte, that the vyces and faultes of the teachers, and the errours of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters were not to be ouerpassed of hym.</p>
               <p>And thys is a thynge verye lykely, that he dyd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre wyth the Doctoures, as touchynge <hi>Messias,</hi> where he shoulde bee borne, and what his office shold be. Yet dyd hee all thynges wyth such moderation &amp; with such a meanyng, as though he had lerned these thyngs of the discipline of his mother, that they might not iudge this child to be <hi>Messias,</hi> but yet to be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshed wyth the holy ghost, and wyth the towardnes of the chiefest vertue &amp; power. For what hope of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and godly towardnesse there is in a chylde, may well be perceyued by certayne tokens at that age.</p>
               <p>And this is the hystorie,<note place="margin">Christ is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> example.</note> howe the chyld Christ ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hym selfe towarde his mother and Ioseph, and howe that he is aboue the common capacitie of chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, because he wyl not wholly be vnder the control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of his parentes, neyther doth he suffer his office to be blamed in this. Thys hystorie dothe the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist conclude, when he sayth: He came downe with them, and was subiecte vnto them. This chylde vsed here hys priuiledge, when the matter requyred, that hee myght rather obeye hys celestiall Father. But here hee suffereth hym selfe to bee broughte in order agayne, and submytteth hym selfe to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente of his parentes, althoughe hee were bounde therevnto by no lawe. As Luke sygnifiethe this, whenne hee sayeth: And he was obediente to them. As thoughe hee shoulde saye, he obeyed them
<pb facs="tcp:1416:106"/>
of his owne free will, &amp; not of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pulsion. But in that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he was subiect vnto them, he did it not for his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts sake, but for an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, that as touchyng his seruice in the houshold, we should not doubt, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was very obedient to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of his parentes, that he was ready to healpe his father in his worke, and that he dyd other thinges belonging to that age, in helping the familie, and that he thought not him selfe to good to doo it.</p>
               <p>This example is put forth to be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if the Lord, which is the God of vs all, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to do this, and behaued him self vnwillyng in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he was byd to do of his parents, although it were not all without drudgerie, but many thinges therof were full of seruilitie: verily children ought not to be lothe to shew obedience and modestie to their pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rentes. For this pleaseth God, and as the fyrst precepte sheweth, he requireth that of all people, that they obey their parentes with all their heartes.</p>
               <p>To this very tyme do I remember, that there was in tyme paste a question: Of what sort was Christes chyldhode? And the Monkes fayned a boke of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> And there is tolde a fable of a certayne byshoppe, that he would haue knowen this. And for that cause he had a dreame, in the whiche he sawe a carpenter, preparynge wodde to buylde, and by hym a lyttell chylde, caryeng the chyppes of wood, vntyll at laste a vyrgine in graye clothynge, hauynge in her hande a cauldron, came vnto them, and called bothe the manne and the chylde. And here the byshop in his dreame, semed to folowe them, and to hyde hym selfe within behynde their gates, that hee myghte knowe what meate it was, that they dydde eate.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1416:106"/>
And that when the mother had set meate before the chyld by him self alone, the chylde asked what this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behynd the gates wold haue, and that the byshop was cast in suche a feare by these wordes, that he was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of his slepe. But if thou wylt haue true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as touchyng the chyldhod of Christ, haue respect in this place to the wordes of the Euangelist, whiche are these.</p>
               <q>And he was subiect to them.</q>
               <p>That is to say: He was obedient to their comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and thought nothyng to base for hym to doo.<note place="margin">The childh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of Christ.</note> And this ought to make all children &amp; seruantes asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when they heare this hystorie of the chylde Iesu. For they obeye neither maisters, neither parentes in the familie. For this do men pretend both by thought and worde, that they woulde gladly folowe Christ, if they knewe how. As the Franciscan friers wyll haue them selues knowen by this, in that they folow sainct Francis in vesture, watchynges, and suche lyke. But forasmuche (saye they) as no man hath knowledge of Christes chyldhode, the matter is without example. They say not true in this, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath knowlege therof. For here is put forth an ernest testimonie of it. And he was subiect vnto them. By these fewe words the Euangelist compriseth all the chyldhode of Christ, and all the tyme of his adolescencie and youth, yea rather al this whole space vnto the thirtieth yere. But what is the meanyng of this? And he was subiect vnto them: Uerily nothyng els but that he looked in the first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as in a glasse of all his doynges. Now this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement sheweth what chyldren and seruauntes are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the familie to do to their parents for their seruice, in setting things necessarie, in procuryng them
<pb facs="tcp:1416:107"/>
in the houshold, and in the fulfyllyng their commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, And the childe Iesus thought, that this was belonging to his duetie. And here nowe ought al chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to vnderstand their renoume and honor, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue Christ the author of all their woorkes, where as they folow Christes steppes, and do their taskes that are appointed them of their parentes, if so be they only delight in doyng their duetie, as they see that the child Iesus especially endeuoured hym selfe to doo.</p>
               <p>There is no neede to haue longe commentaries or gloses as touching the actes of Iesu in his chyldhod, if we consyder but onely this, what taskes and works parents do require of their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in families. For they haue an euident testimonie in this place, that he went not into any wyldernes or cloister. But he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to Nazareth: He highly estemeth the ciuile felowship: he obeyeth his parents, and as other children are, so is he subiect to discipline. The vnsauery and foolyshe flocke of monkes maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion of the chyld Christ in their writings, that he made lytle byrdes and small beasts. But these are not works of obedience, neither was he commaunded so to doo of his parentes.</p>
               <p>For the obedience of a chylde is of an other sorte, and in other thynges, that is, to make prouysion for the famylye, and that the gouernance thereof may not be neglected, not in the smallest matters that there be. The Euangeliste maketh mencion hereof, and wyth one woorde of obedience declareth the wholle duetie towarde the parentes, that the meanyng thereof may be certayne, and withoute doubte. Neyther lette any manne thynke otherwyse, but that this whole obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the fyfthe precepte is sanctified and consecrate
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1416:107"/>
by the chylde <hi>IESVS,</hi> So that it oughte to seeme vnto vs a thynge moste to bee regarded, that wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte not voyde of this mooste perfecte vertue. But the worlde hathe no eares, it hearethe no good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle. Wherefore menne dydde laye asyde trewe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and regarded onely mounkerie, and the rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of sainctes: they vysited them with great labour and coste.

               <p>Wherfore we ought to thynke nothyng more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, more precious than this hystorie, and hyghly to esteme this our felicitie when we shewe suche obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

For the monkes haue not Christ for their capitayne, whiche (as the Euangeliste affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) went not into a cloyster, but he went with his parentes home, and was obediente there vnto them.</p>
               <p>But thys is the summe of the Gospell, <hi>CHRIST</hi> the Lorde is aboue all, and yet he humbleth hym selfe for an exaumple to vs. He dothe obeye his parentes, that wee myghte haue full knowledge of bothe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyces.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first miracle, that our Lorde Iesus Christ wrought, wherewith as Iohn saith, his wyl was to open his glorie vnto his disciples,<note place="margin">Christ decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hymselfe to be God.</note> that by such a signe and myracle, they might knowe hym, and beleue for a suretie, that he is the sonne of God, and the true Messias: Forasmuche as he can doo that that no other man coulde do: that is, to change a creature and to make wyne of water. These thynges are onely in Gods power to doo, whiche is the lorde of all creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. They are not in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s power. Wherfore this signe and miracle is to be referred and applied to this ende, that we truly learn to know Christ, and that we may flee vnto hym with a sure trust, when we see oure sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in pouertie, and in any straight combrance, to aske helpe and succour of hym, whiche we shall perceaue at due tyme. This is the chiefest part of this Gospell.</p>
               <p>But forasmuch as this is a common doctrine in all sygnes and miracles which Christ wrought, we wyll take this matter nowe specially to bee entreated, that Christ wrought this signe especially at a mariage, that the doctrin as touching matrimonie myght not grow out of vse in the congregation. For it is a thyng most necessary. All men know in how great contempt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony was had in the Popedome,<note place="margin">The popedom alloweth no matrimonie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> &amp; with how great praises they extolled virginitie and chastitie, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse coulde be sene in fewe of them. But howe God hath requited these mariage haters the spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and hath reuenged the wrong and vilanie done to his ordinance, it is easy to shewe. So that they hated not only mariage, but also cleane extinguished the loue
<pb facs="tcp:1416:109"/>
of womankynd out of their heart. And there was so great contempt and suche hamousnes of these synnes, that it was meruaile, that God droue not mounkes, Nunnes, and Chanons, with all suche lyke, into hell, with a blast of lightnyng. But that we may iudge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise of Matrimonie, and that we may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst it, or flee it, as the Pope dothe, this Gospel may much profite vs thervnto. For that that the Lord she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed his firste miracle in a mariage, in an vnknowen towne called <hi>Cana,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christ hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</note> when he was thirtie yeares olde, being nowe baptised of Iohn, and takyng on hym the office of preachyng.</p>
               <p>By the Popes Canons and lawes, Christe shoulde well and orderlyke haue doone this, yf he had opened his glorie in the mariage, before that he was called to the office of teachyng, and anoynted of the holy ghost. But this is an excellente exaumple, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the dreames of the Pope, whiche are caste and thrust out of our church with clapping of handes, and hissyng: but against the sectes to come, which counte this the chief religion, to despise and forsake matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to go into wyldernes &amp; desert places, where as is a more quiete lyfe, and lesse dangerous then is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie. In the whiche are greate braulynges, chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyngs, and much trouble with thy wife, with thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, seruants, euil neighbors &amp;c. The monks set forth their life for an holy life.<note place="margin">The lyfe of monkes and priestes.</note> But if they say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, it wer rather to be called a swete, quiet, and an idle lyfe, wher they haue liued in great abundance &amp; plentie: wher as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> miserable maried, hath in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time, striued with miseries and hard getting of their liuing: and yet they were clean banyshed and put beside this title, by these pope holy monks, that this kynd of lyfe in matrimony
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1416:109"/>
might not be in the kyngdom of God, &amp; go into euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng life. And although this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ hath put forth vnto his congregation, be magnificent, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious &amp; euident, yet hath it nothing preuayled with the wicked. It was rehersed in the church, but there was no man there, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> could gather so much light therby, that he could truly ponder the matter on this wise: If it be such a great matter to go to the wildernes, and to the cloister, why came Christ to the mariage? If it be suche an vnholy thyng to be occupied in the worlde, &amp; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a maried persone, why dyd Christ with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and first miracle honour mariage? These tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call myseries myghte haue bene mytigate, if this state of monkerie and heremitage had ben put foorthe but a fewe yeares. But nowe sithe they are not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mariage, but also abiure them selues from it by an othe for euer, that is no holy kynd of lyfe, but it is a folowyng of rest and idlenes contrary to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement and ordinance.</p>
               <p>We therfore lerne &amp; know in this place, how greatly the lord god honoreth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fift co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement. For parents &amp; matrimonie, are not without a familie, without gai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, without housholde stuffe, without other meanes of encreasyng the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. All these thynges therfore hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation by this fact of Christ, as holy thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: with the whiche, true godlynes may wel be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: that all by Christes example may not despise these things, but haue them in great reputation, and magni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie them as thinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded of God: and that the doctrine of this Gospell may instruct the youth, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that God is highly pleased in the gouernance of a familie, and that there is no neede of newe insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, as the monks hath corrupted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> path of godlines.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:110"/>
For the housholder that applieth all thynges in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernyng of his house to the feare of God,<note place="margin">Matrimonie is holy.</note> doth wel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structe and fashion his familie, lyueth in suche a kynde of lyfe as is acceptable to God. Yea the wife also, that prouideth for her chyldren all things necessary for that age, let her not seke an holyer kynd of life. The serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes also, are subiect to their bodily maisters when they diligently execute their worke and commandement of their maister, and do hyghly please God: and if they hold fast by this principle, that they continue in faith: the vylest and basest workes that they do, are more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, then all the fastes, howers, prayers, masses of the monkes, yea and whatsoeuer they boste of,<note place="margin">Matrimonye is no prophan thyng.</note> as most chief amongest al their ceremonies &amp; rites.</p>
               <p>Wherfore all these thynges that are belonging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mariage, are not to be counted vile, neither is the example of the monkes to be folowed, whiche iudge all these thyngs worldly and vnholy in respect of their owne. Christ with this his dede dothe signifie, where as he is present with the marying persons, that he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth all this kynde, and that God requireth, that all thyngs appertainyng to the housholdes gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce myght be had for great and high matters, and not for vnholy thynges. As the first precepte beareth recorde, whiche is the chiefe in the second table. Wherfore lette not the maried persons, nor the seruantes thynke vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and basely of their offices. For these thynges please God, and God hymselfe hath blessed matrimony, and hath honored it for the nonce, where as he now beyng a Preacher of the Gospelle came to the marriage at his byddyng.</p>
               <p>If mariage hadde not ben holy inough, hee myght haue alledged for his excuse the holynes of his office.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1416:110"/>
and so absented hym selfe. But he beynge the chief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of all other, is not lette by his moste holy office to come to the mariage, whiche is the first foundation of all housholdynge. But getteth vnto all such commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation &amp; estimation, that who soeuer are in thys kind of lyfe, doo highely esteme the iudgemente of God, in that he hath so placed them in that roume, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be man and wyfe, either chyldren, eyther ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of the familie, they may be sure, that their office is after the will of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christ hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth mariage.</note> For who woulde not bee moued with this notable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Christ, in that that Christ beyng so great a teacher, yea and God him self, is not onely a renoume, but also an healpe to mariage. declaring there his good wyll most euidentely? This doctrine is first necessary against heretikes. And wee can not be at this time without it in the congregation for because of the sectes,<note place="margin">Complaintes agaynst mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> which diminishe the estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of matrimonie, and raileth on it, as thoughe in it were an occasion of all disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, with seruantes children, neighbours, wyfe, houshold stuffe, so that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient care of God, and of his kyngdome may not bee had. And therfore they seke an other deuise, they take vpon them to lyue vnmaried, they make them selues colledges and abbeys, where they may lyue withoute suche paines. Then after that by the authoritie of the dyuell, they haue folowed these deuises, euery man em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>braceth a rule and kynde of lyuynge, that semeth beste vnto hym selfe.</p>
               <p>Against this perill this doctrine is necessarie, and the example of Christ most euident, whiche at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was not the cause of separation or diuorcement But that their copulation myght be more straighter &amp; narower &amp; more beneficiall with them selues, he doth
<pb facs="tcp:1416:111"/>
as a man would saye admonyshe them, by his owne beneuolence and goodnes. For yf he would haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed the mariage there made, he would not haue ben presente at an vnlaufull thynge. If he hadde not fauoured with all his hearte the maried persones, and sones, and thereby hadde declared the fauour of God towarde the maried, he woulde not haue blessed the mariage by the gyft of excellent wyne, neyther would he haue geuen a token in this to the maried, what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and comfort they shold surely fele at Gods hand in such miseries,<note place="margin">Christ bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried persons.</note> yf they feare God.</p>
               <p>And thys is one meanynge in Christes exaumple, that hereby it myghte be gathered, that Matrimonie ought to be honoured and counted among the moste godly sortes of lyuyng, agaynst the phantasticall ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the monkes, whych so longe before were reproued by the Iudgement of the Apostles,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Timo.</hi> 14.</note> where as they are called seducynge spirites, and the doctrine of deuyls, forbyddynge to marry, and to eate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, The other meanynge is, to the comfort of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed persones, that they may surely beleue, that God is presente with them, bee they neuer so muche vexed wyth pouertie, nede, and other myseries. Onely lette thys bee thy care, that thou neuer lacke this gueste at thy feast: neyther bee thou any longer ruled with suche rules and Canons. Thenne doubtlesse he shall alwayes for thy sake make wyne of water, when he shall so prosper thy dooynges with hys blessyng, that thou shalte neuer be lackynge of the greate glorye of <hi>GOD,</hi> where as he also in thy tribulations, whyche doo seeme paste all cure, shall succoure thee at hys tyme appoynted.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1416:111"/>
shewe thys to be trewe. For when the maried persones are godly, they feele the blessynge of God, in preparynge theyr lyuyng: the whiche is promysed by the Psalme: <hi>Ecce dat dilectis suis dormientibus.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple testifieth, that mariage is not to be despised, as som superstitious people despise it.

               <p>All these thynges lacke onely the voyce of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testyng and pronouncynge, that we may beholde this kynde of lyfe, and consyder it, accordyng to her propre nature and true dignitie.

               <p>The examples are great, yet they nothyng preuaile among the Papistes, neither can housholders be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therby sufficiently. The dyuel is the cause thereof, whiche suffereth not this lyght to appeare vnto them, that they may perceiue that whatsoeuer belongeth to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1416:112"/>
the seruice of housholds, that that is taken of God as his owne. For if men wolde thinke this for a suertye,<note place="margin">The state of matrimonie ought to be estemed of vs also.</note> the seruantes wold counte their workes, to be done as a most pleasant shewe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight of God, they wold obey their masters most gladly, and wolde beware of all offence with all diligence. And when they were chidden, they wold take it in good worth, so that they knewe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this kinde of lyfe were for a suerty accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God. They wold euer beholde this shewe, that Christ him self was present in the mariage, &amp; that he declared his singuler good will towarde maried per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons &amp; gouerners of housholdes: least this should seme greuouse vnto them, if they take any labour or paynes in the doing of the busines of the housholde.</p>
               <p>But they that are so stubburne, that they regarde not these thinges, neither are they moued therby, haue stonie hearts, wher as they may haue this power,<note place="margin">Stony hearts</note> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to serue God in their house, yet they care not to do it: or if they do it, they are not moued therby, they shew not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to be ioyfull, as in a prosperous case.

Ueryly the works &amp; taskes, that belonge to this state, are very vile. But the persons, that iudge truely of things, are excellent. Bycause they know, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer ther is of this sort, it pleaseth God. Whatsoeuer the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the worlde be as touching these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, be not thou ruled therby, whiche folowest true godlynes. For this is the reason, to iudge that great, and to be the very seruice of God, whiche God hath commanded, be it neuer so base and vyle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:113"/>Howe fortunat should this lower state be, if it could acknowledge her felicitie, that God alowed all their doynges as his true seruice, where as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryly all the Mounkes muste nedes be discouraged, bycause they haue no commaundement of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge for theyr institution of lyfe. There is none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest all in this seruile kynd of lyfe, But, if he would consyder his sort of lyuinge after this maner, would take great pleasure of this, that he perceaueth that God and all the Angels beholde and alowe his worke. Yea and hereby should they fynde their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters more gentle vnto them, if they would with all diligence shew fidelitie in their office, and they should at due tyme haue sufficient commoditie therby.

For if they be godly and feare God they haue this hystorie as a most certayne pledge, that God will helpe the busines of the maried with a continuall blessing, and correcte and mynish their incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. As he testifieth in this place. For it is not to be refused for this, that the maried shall nedes suffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in the flesh. But when <hi>CHRIST</hi> is taken to the mariage, and all the matter is referred to the worshippe of God, then is it sure, that Gods blessinge and helpe shall not be lacking.</p>
               <p>This much therfore is to be learned as concerning this present matter, and all ought to know this, these things are put forth in preaching to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al might haue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t will at length, to magnifie matrimonie and to count it for a renoume, if they be but maried or if they can but bestow som what to the furdering of mariage. And fyrst let them see to them selues by this doctryne, that they be not leade of the fantasticall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites to superstition whiche count these thinges to be vnholy either to be maried, either to gouerne a familie.

               <p>These bandes the Anabaptistes breake, and take them selues to libertye, least they should be fayne to stryne with these common myseries, as other maried men do.

This doth not Christ. The leaper had scars lie ended his speche, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christes will was ready to helpe, and dyd helpe hym. This benignitie of Christ shold not only moue vs to aske helpe of hym in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and aduersitie, and to be of a sure hope that he wil not denie vs his helpe: But ought also, to be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto vs, to shewe lyke gentlenes and benignitie to oure neighboure. And as Christ dyd, so we should haue no other respecte, then the obedience, whiche we owe vnto God, &amp; the profite and commoditie of oure neighboure. For Christ seketh not his owne glorie or profit by this benefite. He only hath respecte to this, that this miser lacketh help, that it pertayneth to the glorie of God, &amp; that obedience may be shewed vnto him. For thinke not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is done to God, when thou geuest a benefit to him that can requite it, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence lyke or more for it. This thou doest to thy selfe, wher as thou sekest thy owne profite by doing good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:116"/>But he that will occupie hym self wel in doing his duetie toward God and his neighboure,<note place="margin">Charity ought to haue respect vnto necessitie</note> let hym not haue respecte to his owne profyte, but only to the vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent miserie whiche requireth present helpe. And to that, where as God wold haue it done, yea although the least profite in the worlde should come vnto vs therby, yea or although the benefit were but loste vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a chorle. As we are taught also in an other historie, where as Christ healeth the ten leapers, and one only returneth to geue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks to Christ.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.</note> Nine of them dyd not as muche as remember, of whom they receaued that benefite. It is not possible, but that Christ dyd forsee this vnkyndnes. Yet he refuseth not for this to do good to the misers. When they call on him, he is redie to helpe, and as for the residue he committeth al to God. And lykewyse may it be sayde of charitie, in the second signe with the Centurion. Christ referreth all to this ende, that the goodnes and bounteousnes of the Lord may be glorified, and the miserable ridde of their miseries. This is true charitie, which hath res<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pecte to nothing sauing to the word of God and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandemente.</p>
               <p>The example of faith is meruailous, where as this miserable person, that was by the lawe forbydden the companye and felowshippe of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, commeth to Christ without doubting,<note place="margin">An example of faith in the leaper.</note> and falleth flat before hym, and praieth: Lord if thou wilt, thou mayst clense me. And here are two things to be noted. Fyrst, he beleueth stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly and without waueringe, that Christ hath both will and power, and that he can helpe in this disease, wher as if all men wold do their beste, they can helpe nothing, wher as Christ neuerthelesse differed nothing in shape and behauiour from other priuate persons.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1416:116"/>
Secondly, although he doubted nothing of this, yet he yelde all to Christs will. If he will not deliuer hym from the disease of the body, that is, if this be contrary to the will of God, and against his owne saluation, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is ready to abyde this euil paciently more lenger.</p>
               <p>And this is not only the propertie of true beleif, but also of true prayer,<note place="margin">How a man may praye truely.</note> as these two are always ioyned to gether by nature. He that beleueth truely, prayeth truely, he that beleueth not truely, prayeth not truely. For this is wholye requisite to true prayer, that the heart doubteth not, but that God is good and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and that his whole will is to ridde vs of oure myseries.</p>
               <p>Yea and especially this faith ought to be moste stronge, in those things that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge vnto the glorie of God and oure saluation, as are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wherfore here haue we nothing to doo with any condition, when we pray vnto God for these things,<note place="margin">1. That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayer be ioyned with faith.</note> as though that God could herein be otherwyse myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And he that in these things wold vse the leapers forme in praying: Lord if thou wilt pardon my synnes, If thou wilt, saue me. &amp;c. shold not pray aright. For in these thinges we may not doubt of the will of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will do it. For he hath put forth his expresse and absolute worde,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> that this is his ratified and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable wil, that all men shoulde be saued. And for that cause he procured his sonne to be a sacrifice on
<pb facs="tcp:1416:117"/>
the crosse for the synnes of all the world,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 17.</note> &amp; put forth a commandement, that al shold heare hym, receaue and beleue in hym.</p>
               <p>But where as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaper doth vse a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditional prayer: If thou wilt,<note place="margin">In things te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral oure wil ought to be subiect to the will of God.</note> thou maist clense me. The thing is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he entreateth. We sayd before, that whatsoeuer belongeth, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorie of God &amp; our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muste be surely loked for without any condition. For the willl of God is certain, &amp; he hath declared it with absolute &amp; perfecte promises, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as touching these things, ther is no misterie more to be required in God. But in bodily promises, it goeth not so. For there may be miserie &amp; wordlie calamities, &amp; yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true saluation nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g diminished therby, as al christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple.</p>
               <p>Wherfore sith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> true saluation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth not in such bodyly things, yea &amp; oftentymes, the damage of the body &amp; goodes, helpeth much to true saluation, he that prayeth to be ridde of them, as we are to this entised by the leapers exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, ought to think surely with hym self, that God can helpe, &amp; that he will helpe, yet ought he to ioyne his will, with the will of God: that if this be against goddes glorie, and oure principal saluation, then that God will not gratifie and fulfill oure will. And in suche things this is the true prayer, to beleue surely, and yet to point God neither time, neither way how to do it, and how he shall deliuer vs from this euill. For we haue all this fault for the moste part, that we know not what &amp; how we shold aske.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> As Paul saith: <hi>GOD</hi> doth best know what is for his glorie and oure saluation. Wherfore oure will ought to be made conformable vnto his, and we ought not to doubt but that he will surely heare vs, if such a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongeth to his glorie and oure saluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1416:117"/>Wherfore this ought to be a very notable example for the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that first of all it doubt not of the good will of God toward it self, but that he knoweth oure euils and calamities, &amp; that he hath respecte vnto vs. This ought we to sticke vnto, &amp; yet not to prescribe any thing as touching the maner, deuise, tyme, or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse therof. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> congregation remembreth this, that this sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is ioyned with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promises of such things that it be obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in bearinge the crosse. As the leapre doth here. He doubteth not, but that Christ ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> helpe, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath a redie will to helpe, he nothing mistrusteth. For what other cause els had he to praye so earnestly? But he vnderstandeth, that the saluation and health which he now asketh, to be such, as touching y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not alledge the absolute will of God, as it goeth with the thynges aboue rehersed. Suche faith and obedience is meruailously alowed of Christ. Wherfore he suffereth not the desyer of this miser (no not in this petition, wherin if he had not obtayned, yet he might haue retayned the hope of true saluation:) to be voyde and frustrate. This may be set forth as an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent example in the Churche, how greatly God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the prayer of a godly and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mynde.</p>
               <p>And herevnto belonge the most notable sentences of the Prophetes. Dauid saith:<note place="margin">We must not despeire if we obtayne not forthwith. <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. <hi>Abacuc.</hi> 2.</note> O tarie thou the ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Lord, be stronge, and he shall confort thee, and put thou thy trust in the Lord. Again: My soule doth waight for hym: in his worde is my truste from the morning watche vntill nighte. Abacuk sayth also: If the vision maketh tariance, looke for it, for it will come spedelye, without prolongynge. For this is knowen in all hystories, that although helpe hath ben delayde, yet that it hath appeared at the laste.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:118"/>
Yea and in this is the proper trade of God, wher as he heareth not forthwith, he doth it to declare his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie more abundantly toward vs, then we desyer or vnderstande,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.</note> as Paul sayth.</p>
               <p>And it is not a thing superfluouse to make inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as touching this.<note place="margin">Why Christ sent the leper to the Priests <hi>Leuit.</hi> 14.</note> Why Christ after he had clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the leaper, sent him to the Priests, to offer his gifte there as Moses commanded: A man may aunswere hereto very well, if he say: that Christ set foorth vnto vs an example of charitie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>corde, and sobrietie, wher as he wold nothing diminish the right of the Priests, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that was graunted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by God, which thing yet he might haue done, that we should learne hereby to defraude no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his right. But the chief cause of this commandement, tendeth to this ende, that there might be common testimonials yea by the very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries as concerning this miracle. For when the pryest receaueth his gyfte of him, and he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth that he is clensed, he testifieth against him self, and against all rebelles, that this Christ, that wrought this signe ought to be receaued, and that we ought to beleue in him, as in the true <hi>Messias.</hi> For the Prophesies agree herevnto, that Christ shall come with such signes into the worlde. And that Christ had respecte vnto this, he testifieth by his owne wordes, saying: Offer thy gifte, as Moses commanded, for a testimoniall vnto them. As though he should say: They muste nedes con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou art cleane, &amp; that thou art truely clensed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaprosy. But in that that they will not know me for their <hi>Messias,</hi> they bewray theyr vncurable stubbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which shall be duely punished at their tyme. Yet in the meane season this testimonie against them shall profite other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may receaue me, and beleue in me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:1416:118"/>The Pope of Rome wolde stablyshe confession by this commandement,<note place="margin">The Pope proueth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession by this hystorie, but very vnaptly.</note> because synne may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with leprosie, therfore that the Iudgement of the priest, and purifyinge from synne is requisite. But there is no sure establishement for this sentence. For what haue we to do, with that that God comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the Iewes, as touching the busynes of leprosie? We haue no suche Priests at this tyme. And if we hadde, yet this is euident, that the Priests clensed not the leapers: but that they bare record of their clensinge when they were cleane. But I pray you, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this for confession, whiche was referred to the remission of synnes? For the leapers should not offer their leprosie but a cleane body, when they offer theyr gifte to the Priest. But these thinges are not worthie to be aunswered to at all of a wyseman. He that will nedes confesse, let hym fulfill his phantasie. But we knowledge only that confession to be necessarie, when mannes mynd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth freely his synnes before God. This is the confession of the heart, whiche deceaueth not, as doth the confession of the eares &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth. And yet such confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before God clenseth vs not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> synne, nor iustifieth, muche lesse the confession of the eares can do it.

               <p>The second miracle as concerning the sick chyld,<note place="margin">The second miracle,</note> is also a testimoniall of the doctryne of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> That these thinges may be knowen to be vndenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: If God with signes and miracles be redye to

helpe this man so gloriously, then that this doctryne is syncere, true, and fautlesse, and that this is very <hi>Messias</hi> or Christ. And besyde all this, it is an example of a singuler and true faith in the Centurion. As Christ hym selfe testifieth as touching his fayth, that he found not the lyke in Israel. This fayth is hereby tried,<note place="margin">A great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of faith.</note> that where as this Centurion was no Iew, but a gentile, yet it sendeth hym to <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and beleueth steadfastly, that Christes will is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his, and that as he is able, so he will helpe hym. For if he had not thought this with hym self, he wold neuer according to the wrytinge of Luke, had helpe of the elders of the Iewes, to intreat Iesus for hym. But in that they send vnto hym, it is a sure token, that he hoped to obtayne his matter. And with this faith he ioyned great and incredible modestie and humilitie,<note place="margin">Humilitie ioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned with faith</note> in that that he counteth him self vnworthy to come vnto Christ, and to aske any thing of hym. But fyrst he sendeth the elders of the Synagog, and afterward, when he heard the Lord to be comminge, he sendeth his fryndes to mete hym, that he should not take the paynes to come any further, and that he is vnworthie, to haue suche a great man to come vnto hym. And that he nedeth not so muche to wearie him selfe, syth the Lord ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bryng to effect with a word that that he desyreth, although he be not present therat. And he thynketh with hym self that this is so sure, that he taketh his owne example for a confirmation thereof, and sayth: I verily am a man subiect to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, hauing vnder me souldiers, and I say vnto one, go, and he goeth, and to an other, come, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and to my seruaunt, do this, and he dothe it. Wherfore if my word that am but a man, can doo so
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1416:119"/>
muche, how muche more shall it be done if thou do but speake the worde? And in so doyng, he doth not only beleue, but therewith also put foorth a true doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne of faith and of her nature.</p>
               <p>Wherfore this also were to be wyshede, that oure faith of <hi>CHRIST</hi> might be of lyke sort, whiche might helpe vs with so great vertue of his word, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we see not his person. It is an example of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding faith, that this man can be so diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente vnto the word of Christ. Fyrst he doubteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the fauour of Christ towarde hym.<note place="margin">The Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion is only attent to the worde.</note> Then he desyreth no more, but that Christ shoulde speake the worde. This doth he looke for with as sure truste and persuasion, as though he had obtayned all redy the perfecte recoueringe of his chyld. Wherfore thou that now hast the worde, studie to folow him in this point. For there are now extant very large promises, that God will be mercifull for Christes sake. And that we for the faithes sake in Christ, haue remission of oure synnes and lyfe euerlastinge.<note place="margin">We haue the word, but we vse it not in lyke maner.</note> But we for the moste part lacke this faith, wher with this Centurion was endewed as we see, which thinketh that if he obtayne a word of hym, he nede not care for the reste. It will forthwith ensue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the word doth promise. We can not obtain so much of oure selues. And herof it commeth, that we regard not the word, but in the meane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son haue oure recourse to carnall succour, wher as the word is almightie, and, as the Centurion doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie here, it can not deceaue. That that he promesse is sure to haue good successe. But this fayth is so much the more worthye to be meruayled at,<note place="margin">The Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion is an heathen.</note> bycause the Centurion is an Heathen, to whome the promise was not lykewyse made, as it was to the Iewes.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:120"/>
Wherfore he can not challenge that right, which was only belonginge to the Iewes, as to the people of God. For this is the nature of faith, that it maketh humble myndes, that thinke not prowdly of them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, nor are high minded, and therfore they sticke only to the mercie and grace of God.</p>
               <p>And this ought to be consydered of vs in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and that for a speciall cause, that when anye thought of oure owne synnes and vnworthynes shall vexe oure myndes, yet that we caste not of all hope, but constantlie embrace the word of God, and beleue in hope contrarie to hope. This is acceptable to God, and this he requireth of vs. For without this, there coulde be no grace, if that we wold not applye oure selues to the promise, without merite or any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes at all. As this Centurion can not alledge, as the Iewes, that God oweth any thing to hym. And this maketh hym so humble, that he dareth not come in <hi>CHRISTES</hi> sight. He humbleth hym selfe with the loweste,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 15.</note> as the woman of Canaan dyd, so that he sendeth other to entreat Christ for hym, and yet he hath so certainly persuaded him self as touching the goodnes and humanitie of Christ, that he thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with all his heart, that he shal haue help of Christ. And this is verily a true fayth, and true humblenes, that oure vnworthynes cause vs somwhat to doubt, but yet without desperation, so that the bountie and mercie of God maketh vs chereful again.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Iewes are proude.</note>For God requireth both. Fyrst, that we appeare not before hym, with confidence in oure selues, after the maner of hypocrytes. Secondarily, that after the maner of hypocrytes, we despaire not vtterly in thynges impossible to reason. But that accordyng
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1416:120"/>
to the Psalme, we may fele that <hi>GOD</hi> is delighted with them that feare him, and that trust vpon his mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy. But the Iewes dyd not this. For they persuaded them selues, that God fauoured and dyd them good, because he was bounde so to doo. For they thoughte proudly and insolently with them selues, that they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the wyll of God, and deserued the benefites of God, and vnderstode nothyng of his mercie. Wherfore Christe pronounceth so greuous a sentence agaynste them, saying: Many shall come from the east &amp; west, whiche shall sytte downe with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob in the kyngdom of heauen. But the children of the kyngdome shalbe caste out into vtter darkenesse, where as wailyng and gnashyng of teeth shalbe. The cause of all this is vnbelefe, that they trust so much in them selues, and in the meane season they set nothing by mercy. Wherfore as it profiteth them nothynge, in that they are the sede of Abraham, so shall it nothynge hynder the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> because they are not the children of Abraham, if they do but imbrace Christ with a sure trust, and aspire to the grace and mercye of God. For this is Gods trade,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 1. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.</note> to fyl the hungry with good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and to send the riche empty away. For before him neither the Gentile, neither the Iew, neither circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, neither vncircumcision any thyng preuaileth, but only the faith in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> that men beynge desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of their own helpe, may flee vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercy of god.</p>
               <p>And so this Gospell teacheth very exactely bothe of Charitie and Faith, what is the propertie and nature of Faith, how it imbraceth the worde, and looketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the mercy of god with great humilitie. Whosoeuer shall order his faith on this wise, he shal obteyn his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition as the leapour &amp; Centurion did, &amp; it shalbe done
<pb facs="tcp:1416:121"/>
vnto hym as he beleued, that is, as he hath the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes and mercy of God onely in his heart, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteth it, and putteth his trust therin, so will God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his mercy to hym, &amp; receiue hym into his fauour, and deliuer hym out of all his troubles. Now I pray God to instruct vs with the holy ghoste, and to stirre vp in oure myndes suche truste in his mercye, and by this meanes to bryng vs to euerlastyng lyfe. Amen.</p>

He punisheth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde as it is mete with all calamities and plagues, that men may perceaue, that there is no helpe in idols against these euyls.</p>
               <p>And this is the first part of the thre matters, whereof wee purposed to entreate: If thou lykest the state of Christianitie, refuse not to abide tempests. But if thou doo not, thou shalte not be violently handled therfore: but thou shalt perceaue what thou haste doone, when thou muste suffer the agonie of deathe.</p>
               <p>The seconde part is as concernyng Faith,<note place="margin">Howe faythe fayleth not in trouble,</note> which in temptations &amp; agonies fleeth to Christ, and awaketh hym. This also is worthy to be printed in mynde. For our aduersaries the Papistes doo all that they can to deface faith. But they greatly extoll fre will. But they should wyshe for this, that they might be receyued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this shyppe, that they myght at the lest proue what power and strengthe free will hath in temptation and daunger. The apostles fele how the matter goeth. For although their faith was very smalle, yet if this smalle faith had not ben, they would haue despaired through their free wyll, and sunke downe with desperation, but when there is but a lyttell fayth, as Christ witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:125"/>
sayinge: O you of lytle faithe, they are helped so that they doo not vtterly perishe. They flee to Christ, they wake hym, they call to hym for helpe. If a small and lytle fayth can doo so muche, what can a greate and stronge fayth doo? As of late the examples of the leapre and Centurion declared.<note place="margin">Frewyll in trouble is no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thyng.</note> Wherfore freewylle, when his vertue and strengthe was moste requisite, was nothyng at all. It vanysheth away, and can not stande styffe. Then man feleth no other wayes to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape peryll but by wepyng and cryinge, and wysheth hymselfe afarre of, That is to saye, freewyll can geue no comforte in peryll, but casteth vs into desperation, by a lytle more and more, so that at the last they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the sounde of a leafe blowen by the wynde. But Faith, although it be litle and weake, yet standeth and striueth against desperation. As it is perceyued in this place by the Disciples. For the waues fell so vehement<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly: that they couered the shyppe, who would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde in suche a doubtfull danger and peryll?</p>
               <p>But Faithe, although it be but lytle, yet it standeth sure as a rocke of the sea, and as lytle Dauyd holdeth vp hym selfe agaynst great Goliad comyng towarde hym, that is, agaynst deathe, synne, and all daunger, It despaireth not, but seketh helpe there as it should. that is of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> It styrreth hym out of slepe, it cryeth: Lorde saue vs, wee peryshe. So is Faithe wonte to doo. Althoughe destruction and myschiefe hangeth ouer vs, yet it looketh and prayeth for helpe. As sayth the Psalme: I beleued, and therfore I haue spoken and prayde. For no man can praye, excepte he beleue. And free wyll can not doo it. For it onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the peryll and daunger:<note place="margin">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1416:126"/>
that all thynges shall come to naught. And we also at this tyme see the very same things come to passe. The Pope with his rable hateth the worde, he stirreth the high powers continually against vs. The Turkes ar set forward by the diuell. We are in the shyppe. There be tempestes and the wyndes, among the which, we can not looke for safegard. And it is possible, that the Lorde may wynke at these thynges, and shewe no token of helpe for vs., And yet this sleape of hys is in the shyppe.</p>
               <p>But here we must take a good heart,<note place="margin">Christe is to be waked.</note> and think that we must not vtterly dispair, because the Lord is with vs in the shyppe. And although he faineth, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth vs not, yet this ought we to declare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do not let him go out of our syght, but that we thynk con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stantly of hym, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may make the sea calme, although it be now neuer so muche opprest with waues &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes.

And herin must thou not thynke, but that Christ is at hand, and yet a slepe, and that thou must not sette it lyght, and be negligent to go vnto hym, and wake hym by prayer when he is founde, as the Disciples do in this place. They thinke it better to saue them selues, then to suffer Christe to slepe. They thynke thys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now haue we nede to haue Christ waked, or els we are vndoone.

Christ layeth him down to slepe, that we myght fele temptation in dede
<pb facs="tcp:1416:127"/>
For yf he shoulde not slepe, and afterward represse the tempest, we should neuer well perceaue what is true christianitie: yea and we myght soone be brought in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefe, that we were saued by oure owne power. But here is faith strengthned through temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that this confession myght be made a thyng necessarie. No po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of man coulde here haue preuayled, this deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance came onely by <hi>GOD,</hi> and his worde.</p>
               <p>Besyde this doctrine, Christ is described and sette forth vnto vs as a very man,<note place="margin">Christ is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry god &amp; man</note> and accordyng to mans nature, whiche consisteth of body and soule, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had nede of the naturall actions, of eatyng, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, sleapyng, and such other thyngs, that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out synne, euen as we haue. That we myght bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenced agaynst the dotage of the Manichees, whiche iudged Christ to haue but a counterfait body, and not a very body. And as he declareth him selfe to be verye man by this, that he slepeth as an other naturall man dothe: so dothe he declare his godhead and almygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse in this that he maketh the sea calme agayne by the worde. For thys is no worke or dede belongynge to mans power. Herein is gods power requisite, that the violence of suche a great creature of God may bee restrained by his word: That for that cause we might the more esteme this miracle, forasmuche as here it is open, howe God and man is one person in Christ. For the which cause he both can and wyll helpe in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and affliction all suche as call vpon hym.<note place="margin">How this god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>head &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hod ioyneth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one person.</note> And if this can not be doone without the felynge of feare and peryll, as well he declared before, we must be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent therewith. For not so muche as the wicked can bee withoute affliction. And therefore they are neuer free frome an euyll conscience, and fynally they goe to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1416:127"/>
damnation with all that they haue.</p>
               <p>The thirde part is as touchynge the fruite,<note place="margin">The fruicte that foloweth a tempest.</note> whiche ryseth of suche a Faythe, that is, that other consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge thys myracle, fall to repentaunce, and say with greate admiration? What man is this, that the wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and the seas are obediente vnto hym? It is lyke, that these hytherto tooke hym but for a carpenter, neyther thoughte they, that ayde agaynste the perylle of deathe oughte to bee asked and desyred of hym. Nowe they atteyne to so farre knowledge of hym, that he hathe greate and sure myghte to helpe, where as in man there is no helpe.

Nowe is the rage of the worlde very great against vs, so that almost we can hope for none other thyng then very destruction, and that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest and the sea shall haue the victorie to our destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But so that we haue this grace to sticke sure to the woorde and Faith, we shall see a more ioyful end, then we could thynke in heart. The hate of the Pope &amp; Turk is greater then a man wold beleue, wherwith they persecute the congregation: for the whiche cause we grone &amp; mourn as a woman in her trauaile, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hate neuerthelesse shall bring with it some comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing that we neuer hoped for. So ought euery man to thynk surely in his own behalf also, that when he is enuironned and belayd round about with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that in the ende the fruict shall be moste cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, swete, and pleasant.</p>
               <p>Wherefore. howe greate the doctrine of this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is, and howe muche necessarye ayde it hathe, for to further true godlynes, that may be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by these

thynges, whiche are setforth and intreated of, as tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chyng the whole course of vertue and godlynes. And if we be sure to be in the congregation amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: let vs take shyppe with Christ, and there let vs not refuse to abyde the tempeste, and this moste greuous and troublous estate in the sea of this worlde. And when this greuous trouble commeth foorthe, lette vs kepe our selues diligently within our hold and defence of faith, and of the word of God, and lette vs thynke truely, that the tempest and temptation shall not only haue an ende, but that the conclusion shall folow with suche a prosperous successe of all thynges, and with suche abundance of ioye, that it shall soon recompence all myserie, whiche we felt in suffering, with the ioy of the victorie, and with the approued power of faithe &amp; of the word: so that we can not be sory for the labours and afflictions that we haue bestowed and suffered, but rather we would condemne our owne nicenesse, except we had suffered it. Who then will tutne frome the crosse, wher as deliuerance and great glorie are set foorth to all them that are in peryl for the gospels sake But great grefe springeth hereof to the fleshe, and to the old man. It wyll not be gladly combred with this crosse. Wherfore we muste neuer let this example goe out of our eies. We must diligently consider the word that we may be defenced in temptation. Let vs haue recourse vnto Christ, which sleapeth among vs, &amp; she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth as though he had no regarde of vs. But let vs with ardent and earnest praier aske help of him, &amp; we shal surely fynd it most present.

But yet they so order the matter, that they wreste Gods lawes to the maintenance of mannes inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where as they should rather examine all mennes lawes by the rule of Gods worde. And herof sprang diuers heresies of the Arrians, Macedonians, Donatistes, Nouatians, Nestorians, and such other. For al these endeuored to make the heauenly doctrine to seme agreable to mans reason and iudgement.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1416:130"/>
And all this they dyd bycause they knew not God and his kingdom: vntill at the laste the great aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie of his heauenly kingdome by the Byshoppe of Rome corrupted the pure sowen word of God by all kind of tares, which fell to so great wickednes, that he vsurped his false power ouer this kingdom, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to haue it in his daunger by his wicked Canons, Decrees and Decretalles.</p>
               <p>And who can now expresse with any words the great corruption and hurt that it hath wrought in the Lordes felde? But we go not about now to shew the great hurt and damage that is done by him? But this is my studie to make the true face &amp; forme of the Churche to be knowen,<note place="margin">There must nedes be sectes in the Church</note> amonge so many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducinge sectes, that the true Church may perceaue that (as long as it is in this feld, that is, in the world) it must of necessitie lyue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge so many deadly sectes and heresies. For there be very many that will by no meanes suffer them selues to be counted out of this kingdome, and yet there be very few that are true hearted subiectes of this kingdome. And all the rest professe them selues so to be in words only. But they declare partly by their dedes and kynde of lyuinge, and partly by their doctrine and opinions, that they know not what belongeth to this kingdome, neither what are the true vertues and workes therof. But the sayntes and godly can not abyde and suffer this so great goodnes of <hi>GOD</hi> to be abused. But they ought here not so muche to care for the satisfyinge of there oune will &amp; minde in seing to the glorie of God after this maner, but to marke rather to what ende this their ways shall come at the laste. For assone as the church beginneth to seclude from Gods kingdom
<pb facs="tcp:1416:131"/>
all abusers of gods grace as vnworthy synners, and receaueth them for righteous, in whome is no suche kynd of vice espied, it abolished the kyngdome of gods grace and mercie. And by this meanes the Nouatia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and the Anabaptistes at our time also fell into this errour, that whilest they, before time goe about to pluke vp the tares from the corne: of Christianitie they make a monkrie, and so take away the kyngdome of gods grace. Neither were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first monkes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were most vncorrupt, circumspecte and warie ynough in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. For when they went into solitarie places and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wildernes, for the auoidyng of many offences and euilles that chaunce amongest the ecclesiasticall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in the congregations of the citie, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by a litle and a litle to be the maintainers of this lewed opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as though that they were the true chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, that all other that in ciuil corporations did gouerne either families, or ruled the cities &amp; towns lyued in a prophane, vnholie and ley kynde of liuing, wheras neuer the lesse true godlines requireth no su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thing.</p>
               <p>But the truth is this. First it behoueth all men to know the kyngdome of the grace of God, that he may knowe that he obtayneth mercie and remission of his synnes for Christes sake. And so after this let euery man liue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil felowshippes of men, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gouern housholdes, or communalties or let them be seruaunts and laborers in families, or subiectes and citisens in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; let euery man for his owne part doe his owne duetie. The psalme admonisheth vs of this superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> biddynge vs to beware of it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psalm.</hi> 35. The psalme agreeth with the meaninge of the parable.</note> Trust in the Lord &amp; doe good, dwell in the lande, and he shall fede thee in the riches therof. Here he forbiddeth vs to be careful for

pluckyng vp the tares, wheras he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite the earth, either as rulers of families or gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of cities. For true godlines can be had by no other meanes than by this, least out of the kyngdome of Gods mercie ther shold spring monkry and other new inuented seruice. And yet the churche of God can not be, but it must nedes know the difference of the corne and tares. It knoweth for a suertie, that he can not liue in the kingdome of God, but throughe faith in Christ &amp; in the holie gost, wher by man is newe borne and regenerate, man is sanctified and renewed to be made obedient to God. And yet least it should ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe this kingdome of grace, it suffereth long after the example of God, stablishinge his owne minde and conscience in the midle of so great temptations, that it be not seduced. Neither doth it loke for any helpe or succoure by flitting and by auoydyng of mennes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany by going a side into wildernes. and into a cloister of a monkrie or nonrie, but it vseth circumspection and iugement, that it fall not into like euilles.</p>
               <p>In this parable therfore are both these lessons set forth to be learned of the churche. First it must thinke it self to be in the kingdome of God, the lawes &amp; condition wherof verie fewe do know and folowe at all times. For albeit it be the kyngdome of grace, wherunto all sinners ought most desirously to flee, yet the diuel by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helpe of our fleshe, whiche is alwaies fauorable to his part: can doe so muche, that he euen in the middest of Gods holy people &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations, thrusteth in a great heape of hypocrites. Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church perceaueth that within it selfe in all her matters there is suche great offences, it must not violentlie resiste it, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and saue it self warelie against these offences. For
<pb facs="tcp:1416:132"/>
For although these offences be euident, yet the state of this kingdome is suche that it can not by force and violence remedie these offences, after a ciuil &amp; worldly maner.<note place="margin">The offences in the Church may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce after the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill maner.</note> The state and maner of this kingdome must be kept. Whiche is this, euen that the doctrine of the Gospell be purelie set forth as touching remission of synne, and that men be wel instructed as concerning how they must be renued by the holy Ghost. And that mercie and forgeuenes be pronounced to suche as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently in their vocation do the works of Godly loue. This doctrine ought at no tyme to be omitted, be the carnall and wordly men neuer so much offended ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Yet the feare of offending them must not be an oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>casion to vs to ouerthrowe this kingdom.</p>
               <p>Let vs consider the example of the Mounkes and Bishop of Rome, whiche whyle they went about to auoyde such offences and seducinges as chance in this common lyfe, brought in more greuouse occasions to offende, where as they chaunged true religion into ceremonies, rites, and obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. They vtterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the kingdom of mercie and grace. And this is now also the very practice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel, for that he slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the professers of the Gospell, bycause there be many offences and euill examples amongest them. For we can not denye, but suche offensiue examples be in many hypocrites, which boaste of Gods mercie and grace: and yet by their licentiouse liuinge and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by their aduoutrie, extortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vsurie, sensual lustes and many other vices, declare that they regard not the grace of God truely. But what remedie? we are forth with tempted to plucke vp the tares, and to seke such a separation of the euil from the good, that in the meane season, we corrupte the heauenly doctrine as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1416:132"/>
touching the grace of God and remission of synnes. But if we be wise, we wil not suffer oure selues to be withdrawen from doing oure duetie by their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunite, and outragiouse behauioure. For it is muche better to resiste and striue with the wicked examples of their lyfe and maners by doing the contrarie, and so to preserue this doctrine of mercie and grace, then to correcte and plucke it vp violently, and so by that and examples of the Mounkes and Nouatians to flee from <hi>Scylla,</hi> and to fall into <hi>Charybdis,</hi> that is, for auoiding of the lesse daunger to fall into the greater. And especially syth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of this kingdom is such, that it can not vterly auoyde all offences, bycause such muste be for the maintenance of this necessarie doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of grace. Wherfore where as the Papistes now lay to oure charge the frutes of oure Gospell, what other thing meane they therby, than that this kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should be without all offences and euill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? But we may iustly lay this to their charge again that where as they go about by the Mounkerye and other traditions of theirs to make this kingdom without offences, they are fallen into such errour and blyndnes therby, that they haue cleane loste all the doctrine of iustification and godly righteousnes and all the workes of true godlines also.</p>
               <p>If therfore it should be put to oure choyce, whiche of these discommodities we had rather haue,<note place="margin">In punishinge offences we ought to haue chief respecte to the doctryne of mercie and grace.</note> whether of them both should we rather take? Uerily all wold graunt this, that for as muche as this kingdom can not be without offences, yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it were better to chose that offence, where with neuerthelesse the kingdom might be sumwhat vpholden, than that, wherby the kingdom should quite be destroyed without hope of
<pb facs="tcp:1416:133"/>
recoueryng, &amp; wherby the doctrine and true godlines should vtterlie decay &amp; perishe, as it chanced amongest the papistes and monkes. And the doctrine and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this parable of Christ was put forth to thende that aboue all thinges we might haue good respect to know the maner of gods kingdome, and not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with suche inconueniences as chaunce alwayes, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordle vnto it. For wheras it offereth free remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes to sinners, fyrste it cometh herby to passe, that many hypocrites, come to the felowshippe of this kingdome. Then also som men laboringe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie this disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie finde out a meanes to make a ciuil separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they may falsly boste of the grace of God, and yet not be in the felowship with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that vse it well. But Christ sheweth what greate damage ensueth therby, euen that by this separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they plucke vp the good corne also. For the doctrine of grace is pluckt vp by mens traditions whiche were inuented to make this separation. So that nowe the churche is brought to suche a miserable and vnscapable case, that where as before the members were in perill, now the hed is like to decay. Wherfore we muste folowe Christes councel which byddeth vs to suffer the tares, and not to be so precise in pluckyng them vp, least we by oure vndiscrete diligence ouerthrowe the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of this kyngdome as touchyng remission of sinnes.</p>
               <p>Nowe must we vse this kyngdome, that many by remission of sinne may be forgeuen: If ther be any as ther be many, that had rather be sene to be in this king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of grace then to be true members therof in dede, what can we do therwith, if they will nedes misuse the gyfte of God? But if we shoulde be so extreme
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1416:133"/>
against them, that for their sake we would vse viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and force in this kyngdome, what shall we get therby, than that (as we see in the examples before) while we go about to seperat the wycked for their abusynge of Goddes grace, we vtterlye subuerte the kyngdome of Grace?</p>
               <p>Wherfore let vs leue this to be done of the angels,<note place="margin">The Angels shall make a se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paration wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gods kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mercy is come to an ende.</note> that they may sunder the euill from the good. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that shal the kyngdom of grace be no lenger amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g sinners. Euery man then shall receaue accordynge to his workes. Ther shal be no such peril than, as is now, wher as if the grace of the gospel and of the kyngdom of heauen shoulde be taken away by pluckynge vp of the tares before the appearinge of the sonne of God: then the greatest yea and the onely refuge for sinners might seme to be disturbed and taken awaye. And at this separation by the Angels, it shall not nede to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether there are any more lefte to be called to saluation? But it shalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered who hath vsed well this kyngdom of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort &amp; hath ben true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers therof in dede, &amp; who hath ben subiectes ther vnto by name only, &amp; yet in very dede had neuer any true felowship therwith. And this haue we spoken as touchinge the true meanyng of this parable.</p>
               <p>After this we will intreat not onlye what must be done with heretikes, but vniuersally, what they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath offices to correcte offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces ought to do with al kynd of offenders, &amp; whether it is ment by this saying: Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grow:<note place="margin">A question as touchinge punishyng of heretikes and ther offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.</note> that no kynd of offence either in life or in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, shold be punished &amp; restrained? we haue declared before what is Christs especial entent by this parable. Euen that by the vndiscrete vsage of men, the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold not be hindred. Now such things
<pb facs="tcp:1416:134"/>
as by Gods commandement are ordeyned for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of this kingdom, ought not to be thought co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the same. And fyrst to begin at the principall matter,<note place="margin">Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> the excommunication vsed in the Churche is not against this parable. For it is so necessary for the preseruation therof that without it, mercie, remission of synne and the pure doctrine, therof can not be retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for as by absolution Gods grace must be applied to the penitent, so by byndinge must Gods wrathe &amp; curse be applied to the vnpenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> Paule hym self saith that power of binding was geuen to hym not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, but to edifie. Wherfore they that are excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat, are not destroyd. Fyrst of all we ought to haue singular respecte to the maintenance of the ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body or Church. For then is that most in hasard, if these things that are ordeyned of God, to bring men to repentance and saluation, be not openly suffred to be vsed against them that are vnpenitent. Wherfore if the Church shold either for superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or for a vayne ostentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mercifulnes omit this authoritie of byn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge and excommunicatinge the vnpenitent, and not punishe very sharplie suche offenders, and so saue it self holy and vndefiled, and not suffer a litle leauen to corrupte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole dowe, it were greatly to be blamed. Consider also that this is not donne to destroy them that are excommunicat and excluded from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and felowship of saintes. For herby are they put to shame to the entent they should amend and obtaine saluation with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church in Gods kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Or if they wold not ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at all, it may appeare that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churche is not in the faulte, whiche dyd the same for feare lest it also should be defyled and destroyd, by sufferinge the wicked to intermedell with holye thinges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:1416:134"/>Wherfore the Church doth as it is commanded for a good cause excommunicat the stubbourne synners. Neither do they violat and breake <hi>CHRISTES</hi> commandement, which forbad the tares to be pluckt vp. For Christ hym self commanded, saying: Let hym be as an Ethnicke and Publicane.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 18.</note> And yet is he not against his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, where as he forbad the tares to be pluckt vp: As it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the former description. For excommunication hyndreth not the principall entent of Christ: it is not against the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of his grace, but rather for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maintenance therof, where as it casteth out them that behaue them selues disorderedly in the kyngdom of heauen, to the entent they may the beter come to them selues, and retourne again obediently, or if they wil not, to be vtterly caste out of this kingdom with the lesse daunger: where as otherwyse they should heape together more greuous offences by defilinge and prophaninge the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of saintes, and the Church also for her negligent regardi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge her vndefiled holines should prouoke Gods hyghe displeasure and wrathe.</p>
               <p>Now al other restrayninge of offences is amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest the magistrates and officers,<note place="margin">What offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.</note> they are bound dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to see therevnto, lykewyse fathers and mothers are gouerners of families, all informers of other in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and learninge. These are not forbydden by this commandement of <hi>CHRIST</hi> to execute their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,<note place="margin">Magistrates.</note> but they are rather strayghtly commaunded and charged to do them. And as touching their iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion power and gouernance: they exercise it not in the kingdom of heauen. They exacte not certaine offices and rites to be donne, whiche thing belongeth to the kyngdom of grace: But they haue the regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that
<pb facs="tcp:1416:135"/>
kyngdom, that belongeth to the body and bodilie thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to ciuill maners, office, order, humanitie, honestie, they firste procure that the bodie and bodelie thinges may be in safegard, that therby the soules and spiritual thynges maye be the better gouerned. And the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate maintaineth not onlie the second table, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the duetie towardes men, but also the firste, as concernynge our duetie towardes God. He punisheth Idolatrie, blasphemie, wytchcraftes, periurie.

He taketh to his correction them that are stiffe in defendinge of heresie and errors, and punisheth them for malefactors, bycause they seduce many from the truth. And when he doth this, he is not thought to plucke vp the tares, for bycause he and his office is not belongynge to that kyngdom whiche is forbid to plucke vp the tares. It were a superfluous thing to commande or teach that lesson to gouerners of housholdes or to ciuil officers or such other. For they haue all their charges geuen vnto them, which they must nedes execute in their offices w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all diligence, and yet they plucke not vp the tares, for that they hynder not the kyngdome of grace: but cause rather by their order &amp; discipline, the kyngdom of grace to be in better case &amp; to be troubled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fewe offences.</p>
               <p>All officers shold se diligently to quiet and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to be had both in house and citie, that the church &amp; the kyngdome of heauen, might liue a quiet and a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable life, with all godlines and grauitie, in prayers &amp; supplications, with thankes geuing and intercessions. For to thend that this kyngdome of prayer &amp; true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, which is called of Christ the kyngdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen, might be reserued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men, it is very necessarie
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1416:135"/>
that parents &amp; maiestrates see straightly to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. Wherfore magistrates and officers of this corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lyfe do not plucke vp the tares againste the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Christe, when they by sharp &amp; straight correction and execution do withstand these offences that disordre the common welth: But they do the best that they can to see and prouide, that the good corne in the congregation be not ouercome with tares, &amp; so the kyngdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold vtterly be abolished in earth.</p>
               <p>And this haue I sayd as touchynge the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this parable, least it shold by euil vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding therof cause men through superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to abstaine from doinge certaine offices necessarie in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth. Now to declare at large what an haynouse thing it is that Christe here describeth, howe the ennemie in the night sowed his most pestilent tares, and howe the byshoppes and superattende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts by their sleping &amp; slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyshnes gaue hym occasion and leaue so to do, it were a long matter and not fyt to be handled in so shorte a tyme: but at this time I thinke sufficient for me to haue enstructed you as touching the true meanyng of this parable.

And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is appointed to be learned at thys tyme, we will speake somwhat therof. We heare in this parable, how the housholder went foorth in the morning and hyred workmen into his vineyard whiche wrought twelue houres. Afterward he hyred some, that wrought nine houres, then also other that wrought sixe and three, and laste one. Their workes were farre vnlyke, and yet their reward is equall, one hauing no more then the other. For the housholder dyd according to his couenant only with the fyrst, &amp; as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, he rewarded at his pleasure without couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And yet he gaue as much to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were last, which wrought but one hower, as to the first y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> agreed with hym for a peny a daye. This semeth against reason to the world, which foloweth this rule. He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth muche work, must haue much reward or wages: he that doth litle, must haue litle. And yet can no man there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of wrong, if that be payde to any that is due to one, and to an other that is not due. Howbeit to geue equal wages where as is not equall labour, is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of iustice y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> biddeth to geue to euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his due.

But in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corporal &amp; ciuil life it is otherwise. For there must nedes be inequalitie, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ther be differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in degrees. The husbands life is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citisen: likewise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lordes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight Here can be no equalitie, neither must we go about to seke it. But in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom of Christ, whether he be king or prince, lord or serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, mastresse or handmaide, or any such like, they are all equall. For we all haue one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, one faith one gospel, one sacrament, one Christ, one God. For al alike aswel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great as the small heare the Gospell: likewise is it as touchyng baptisme. For our baptisme, the baptisme of children, and of all other, is all one. There is one fayth of Peter, Paule, &amp; Mag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dalen, of the these hanging on the crosse, and of vs all, if we be christians. There is no other God of Iohn Baptist, then is of other synners, when they repente. Neither doth this make any differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or matter before God, that for a ciuile respect there are superiours and inferiors accordyng to mens offices and degrees. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefest part in this Gospel, to lerne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as touching our state &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition in gods kingdom we ar all equal.

And it is Gods wil that it should so be, which dyd ordein &amp; constitute diuers states and degrees.

a suretie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> before God, we are all regarded alyke, for asmuch as there is but one Christe, one baptisme, one Gospell, one holy spirite of vs all, neither hathe one a better Gospell, baptisme, or Christ then an other. The lowest state of serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts hath as good as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highest. For although som hath more good things then thou hast, yet he passeth the not in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath a better god the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hast. And this is diligently to be learned, specially for this cause, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his vocation may from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bottom of their heart willyngly obey God, for asmuch as he may assuredly trust, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although he be no emperor nor Pope, nor abundant in riches, neither is equall in power to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higher states, yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is equall with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath obteined baptisme, &amp; through the death of Christ hath as sure a confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and trust y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> death shall not hurt hym, as hath the highest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is.

               <p>For it can not be otherwise in this kingdom, but ther must nedes be diuersities of degrees, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one les, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other greater y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one rule, &amp; the other serue.

<pb facs="tcp:1416:138"/>
for his seruile and miserable lyfe that he leadeth in so base and low degree. But he must faithfully maintein that state of lyfe, that God hath appointed hym, and take well a worth his present degree, vntyll that God shall open hym the way to a better. In the mean sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son let hym comfort hym self, for that he hath the same Christ, as the high emperours, prelates, and monkes haue, and that he is as muche furdered by him to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and euerlasting life. Or if they will not graunt that the lowest should haue equall felicitie with them in this kyngdom, then haue they themselues no place in it. For it must nedes be so in this kyngdom. All are accepted into Gods fauour, for that that Christ Iesus suffered for them all, and washed vs with his bloud, and that not one more, and an other lesse, but all alike. Euery man hath lyke right to this tresure, neither wil they after that be so greatly greued with this inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that they wyll be sory for their state, and make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny disturba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the publike order therby.

               <p>Our aduersaries the monks &amp; Nonnes do not this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1416:138"/>
They imagin that God hath writing tables or a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting boke, to note euery mans labours woorkes and taskes,<note place="margin">The Iustici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries make Christ to be parciall in his kyngdome.</note> and to marke how much one doth labor more then an other, that thereby he myght haue the higher roume in heauen, and haue a better Christ, than he is that is euery mans Christ. For this haue they taught, that when a priest masseth, he doth such a worke, that profiteth as well the dead as the quicke, and that for-because he is a more worthier person, and of an higher degree in the kyngdome of Christ then the laye people are. These persons can not abide this equalitie, which is in Christes kyngdom, but go about to make inequa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie after a wordly maner.</p>
               <p>After lyke maner haue they taughte, that a Nunne in her abbey is holyer and better then a houswyfe in her house, and if a man teache the contrary, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne hym as an heretike. And herein they are lyke vnto them that murmured in this parable: for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more then other, and shewe God a roll written of al the howers that they wrought in, and suffred the heate of the day. But marke what answere God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them: As for this inequalitie in a ciuil gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he wil not reason with them. For there, to the hygher degree, the higher honour is due. But when ye come (saith he) to the kingdome of my sonne, all are equall, for that they haue but one baptism, one Christ. Neither is a better Gospell taught to some, &amp; to some a worse. For where as the Monkes saye, that the maried men haue but the worst gospell, and the worst commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and that they them selues haue the beste, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are of a hygher degree in Gods kyngdome, it is false and contrary to the Gospell. For therby they go about to make inequalitie in the Gospell, where as
<pb facs="tcp:1416:139"/>
neuerthelesse Christ made all things equall, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally techeth this only thing in this parable, that in his kingdom one is no better than an other. To liue chast if a man haue the gyft, is no euill thyng, neither can it be forbidden by lawes or statutes. But to affirm that a man or woman therby is in a higher degree before god, and that he must haue a greater reward therfore, is a fals doctrine and a great rock, whereat the Pope stumbleth, and therfore doth falsly accuse vs, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byd good workes. We only affirme this, that there is equalitie in Christes kyngdom, forasmuch as God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth vs not for our merit or deseruing, but through his mercy and grace in Christ.</p>
               <p>And thus proceding in this matter, after that a man hath obteined this equalitie and felowshyp: Let euery man in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lyfe applye his vocation, and see to his charge, either in gouernyng youth in the schole, or teachyng the people in the churche, or gouernynge his familie at home, or doing any other lower seruice. And here let euery man doo his duetie diligently. Neither let him loke to be equall with other in a higher degree For in Christ no mans state is better than other, but all in hym obteine the mercy of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Iewes wold haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie in Gods kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>And in this is the worlde and the Iewes greately offended, when they heare that we, that are <hi>Gentiles</hi> and vncircumcised, be receaued to saluation, whiche were neuer burdened with the Saboth, neither with other burdens of the law, where as they haue caried &amp; borne them with great peine and sweate, as Christ in this parable describeth it very proprely: The fyrst had thought that they should had receaued more, and ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they murmured whan euery man had but his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, euen as they had also that were but an hower in

the vineyard. But Christ suffreth not this inequalitie Frende (saieth he) I doo thee no wrong, take that is thyne, and be gon. That is to say, you haue now recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued your wages euen the land of Canaan. But now I wyll ordeyn an other new kingdom, wherin al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges shalbe equal. For all the riches therin are myn, and I may order them as I list. It doth not become you to teache me what wages I shal geue to my laborers &amp; workmen.

Is it not laufull for me to doo with myne owne goodes as me lusteth? A lyke importunitie and vndiscrete maner is there in the Pope also and all his. They abhorre this kyngdome, wherin al thyngs are equall. They require the chiefest preeminence for them selfe as of duetie, but for theyr pride they shal obteyn no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes obteined.</p>
               <p>Wherfore we must not lightly regard this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the corporall and spirituall lyfe,<note place="margin">A difference betwene the kingdome of Christ, and of the worldly kyngdome.</note> or (if it must otherwise bee named) betwene the kyngdome of the world &amp; Christes kingdome. For in Christes kingdom all thynges must be equall: for they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon goodes as is God. Christ, the holy ghost, the gospel, baptisme, the supper of the Lord, faith. And because of this equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, they are all lyke holy and righteous. &amp;c. And syth we haue obteyned this, lette vs be thankefull to God for so great treasure. Let vs truely knowledge that, and not be ignorant of our excellencie and renoume.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:140"/>
And let vs not thinke that our state and condition as much as belongeth to gods kyngdom, is any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the state of all the great and mighty holy an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels. And how cometh this to passe? euen by Christe. Then when we are this instructed and made ioyfull and heartie, let euery man diligently and gladly apply their busines, according to their callyng and vocation. encoragyng them selues with the hope and ful trust of that tresure which is in Christ. And this must we lern in this Gospel, that in worldly thynges there must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be a difference and degree had as touching diuers persons and offices. For the state of this lyfe can no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise be. But in the kyngdome of Christ, this is a right lawe: I will geue vnto this laste euen as vnto thee. And the right co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of this. The kingdome of heauen being a deliuerance from syn and from deathe is due to no man of merite, it is geuen onely by grace. Wherfore we ought specially to beware, that we mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mure not, but rather geue thanks vnto God, and take this for a comfort in all perils, laboures, and miseries, that chaunce vnto vs in this corporall life. Then shall we perceaue and fele great pleasure in all thinges.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination are perillous.</note>In the last sentence of the gospell (Many bee called, but few be chosen) the curious haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great occasion to inuent wicked &amp; vngodly opinions, thoughtes, and imaginations. For this they thinke. They must nedes be saued, whom God hath chosen: Contrarywise, they that are not chosen, whatsoeuer they do, be it neuer so good a worke, yet can they not escape damnation, nor come to saluation. Wherfore I wyl not striue against that must nedes be done. If it be so determined, that I shall be saued, I shalbe safe, if not, I will not leese my labor in vaine. Euery man may easily iudge what

But in the feaste of the Epiphanie, when I expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the saying of Micheas the prophet,<note place="margin">Howe Gods wyll is truly to be learned.</note> we declared sufficiently, that suche thoughts are to be auoided as the diuell hym selfe, and that we must go an other way to work, if we will haue the true know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of Gods will, and not to medle with the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods maiestie, neither with predestination &amp; election. For these things passe mans capacitie, which can not as muche as thinke therof without great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that is to say, either must there nedes ensu after suche thoughtes, desperation, or dissolute lyuyng, with out all fear of God. But he that will come to the true way of knowing of Gods will,<note place="margin">In Christ is God knowen</note> he must so walke that he may beware at suche occasion of fallynge, and seke how he may more and more encrease in godlynes. As Christ hym selfe appointeth vs, when he saith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.</note> No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commeth to the father, but by me,</p>
               <p>Wherfore he that wyl come vnto the Father, and to the knowledge of hym he must go first vnto Christ,<note place="margin">What Christ is vnto vs.</note> to know what he is, euen that Christ is the son of god &amp; God almightie. But what doth the sonne of God? He is made man for vs to deliuer vs from the lawe, he is crucified &amp; dead on the crosse, to satisfie for our synnes. He riseth from death, to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs the way to euerlasting life by his resurrection and aide vs against euerlasting death. He sitteth at the right hand of God to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for vs, to geue vs the holy ghost, &amp; by him to sanctifie gouerne, &amp; leade vs, to defende vs against temptation, and all the dartes of the dyuell. And this is the true knowledge of Christ. Now when thy mind is well confirmed and strengthened with this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nowe is the way to heauen without perill, and
<pb facs="tcp:1416:141"/>
thou canst haue no imagination of God that shall bee euyll and dangerous. For syth that the sonne of God hath done so much for mans saluation, we may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured therby, that Gods wil is not, but that we shold be saued. Howe should he haue any pleasure in oure destruction, syth he let nothyng passe, wherby he may bryng man to life &amp; saluation agayn? And this is the true way to God, as Christe preacheth in the thirde of Iohn: So God loued the world that he gaue his only begotten sonne,<note place="margin">

And now let these thoughts be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with the former though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of predestination, and it shal euidently appere, that the former thoughtes are of the deuyll, whereby men ar seduced to their destruction, so that either they now despaire, or are made voyde of all godly motions.

               <p>There be some that expound the wordes after this maner. Many are called, that is to saye, God offereth his grace to many: but fewe are chosen, that is, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth his grace to fewe, for fewe shall be saued. This is a very wicked meanynge. For who wyll not hate God vtterly, yf he thought thys of <hi>GOD,</hi> that it came by his wyll and faulte, that we be not saued? Nowe lette this sentence bee compared with the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence before, where as it was sayd, that the knowlege of Christ must be as the ground &amp; foundation laide to buylde the knowledge of Gods wyll thereon, and it shalbe euident, that this last exposition is blasphemous agaynste God. Wherfore this must we take to be the true meanynge of this sentence. Many (sayth he) are called.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For the preachyng of the Gospell is vniuersall,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1416:141"/>
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, open to all that will receaue it. And gods will is, that it should be so spread abrode, that all men should beleue and be saued. But how doth it preuaile? euen as it shall folowe in the next Gospell: Fewe are chosen, that is to say, few endeuor them selues therby to doo as God requireth, For some heare, and care not for it: some heare, and yet sette so lyttell by it, that they will not put them selues in danger for it. Som heare it, but they regarde riches and pleasure more then it. And this pleaseth not God, and as for suche, he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them not worthy of his kyngdom. And this mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth <hi>CHRIST,</hi> where as he sayth, Fewe are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, fewe declare suche godlynes as God requireth. But they are chosen and acceptable to God, that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently heare the Gospell, beleue in Christ, and declare theyr faith in good workes, and refuse not to suffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kynde of persecution for it.</p>
               <p>This meanyng is true, and seduceth no man to his destruction, but maketh them learne the way to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For thus shold they serch out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yngs, if they wold please God, &amp; be chosen. They must beware of an euill conscience, &amp; not syn against Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, they must diligently resyst sinne, &amp; at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely here Gods worde, and studiously exercise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues therin: They must desire of God the holy ghost, and neuer cast away Gods worde, they must always be ready to fight against the deuyll and his subtilties, desiryng God alwais to send them helpe, defence, and pacience. And such men waxe perfect christians, wher as contrarywise, they that thinke it Gods will not to be, that all should be saued: either they fall into despe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration, or els into a dissolute &amp; careles liuing, whiche afterward nothing differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beasts in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:142"/>
whilest that they thynke on this wise. Now it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed alredy, whether I shalbe saued or damned, Why then should I bestow labour in vayn. But thou shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not on this wise take thy beginnyng, where thou shouldest haue ended. This commaundement of God is put forth before thee, that thou shouldest beleue in Christ, that he is thy sauiour, that hath satisfied for thy synnes. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement must thou folow. And if thou felest that thou haste no faith or very litle, pray to god for the holy ghost, and doubt not, Christ is thy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and thou arte predestinate to be saued, yf thou beleuest, that is, if thou with a sure faithe trustest in hym, and commyttest thy selfe vnto hym.

Wherfore all kind of vice must nedes ensue therof, stubbornesse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, vnfaithfulnes, iniquitie, filthines, &amp; diuelish desire to reuenge. For if the word remained still in the heart, &amp; they had herd it attentiuely, it wold haue gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished their heartes with true obedience, faith, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, mercie, &amp; such lyke vertues. And these are the first &amp; worst of al. Christ is not a littell offended with these vntoward persons, and therfore he rebuketh none so sharply as them. For this he ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly affirmeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels flying in the aire, steale the word out of their her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may not regard it, nor set so much by it, nor thinke it to be so great a faulte, if men lightly esteme the voyce of Gods worde.

<pb facs="tcp:1416:144"/>
that I may regard and marke these thynges, whiche are set foorth vnto me in thy Gospel. With such as on this wise thirst after the worde, and embrace it with their full wyl, the deuil can not preuaile. For this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie desyre and the deuyll can not abyde together. But these forsayde persones, that are described of Christe, care not a iote when Gods word is sente vnto them. No they thynke it not so muche worthe as is a lytle gaynes or lucre. Lette no man thynke otherwise, but that these men are in the deuils power. And verily the greatest part of men ar of this sort: they here the word and regard it not, because the deuill plucketh it out of their heartes.</p>
               <p>The other two sorts ar not so wicked, but ar weake they despise not to be instructed, they begyn well, and are delighted therwith. Wherfore Christ doth not here say, that they are so farre in the diuels daunger, as the fyrst are, although neuerthelesse, there appeareth not in them the true fruites of godlynes, that should ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of consequently succede. And first ar they of both, that in tyme of persecution &amp; temptation forsake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde. Which after the maner of corrupt fruicte, as long as they are not shaken with the wynde, abyde in their place with the other: but as soone as a tempest ryseth &amp; shaketh the tree, they fall of one after an other: So they also accordyng to Christes wordes, for a tyme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue: but when they see the crosse commyng, they can not abyde that terrour, and they seke how to be out of danger as the multitude dothe. So that here can not folow the fruite of euerlasting life, nor any other good fruict that springeth of the worde and faith.</p>
               <p>The thyrd be they, that for loue of worldly riches &amp; pleasures regard not the worde. For he that is geuen
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1416:144"/>
to worldly cares, seketh, sercheth, scrapeth togither, &amp; bestoweth all labour that he can, to get hym store of riches. This man ouerladeth his heart, as Christ saith in Luke, and so it cometh to passe, that the fruicte of godlynesse is choked vp,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 21.</note> euen as the corn is with thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Substance must be gotten by labour, and euery man acording to his vocation, is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therin to shew industrie and diligence as God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded.<note place="margin">

For it is not studied as it shold be, but other things are alwais set more by then it.</p>
               <p>And these are the thre sortes, in whom Gods word taketh no place, neither can it bryng forth in them the feare of euerlastyng lyfe: which thing is not to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any small losse. Wherfore Christ exhorteth all that heare, &amp; saith: Se that ye geue good eare. For to him that hath, shalbe geuen, and to hym that hath not, shall that also be taken from hym, that he thinketh that he hath. By these wordes it appereth, that he speaketh of no light matters.

But take diligent hede, that thou be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented in making thyne accompt. Thou knowest not

how long thou hast to liue, neither whether thou shalt euer again haue such oportunitie &amp; occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heare it, neither what cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce god shal se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the. And al this deuise is to thyne owne peril &amp; danger only. Al thy craft shal turne to no mans hurt but to thyne owne. Wherfore heare Christ when he warneth thee: He that hath eares to heare, let hym hear. By the which saying he meaneth that we shold not in this busines prolong, lynger, and delaye the tyme, as it is the maner of vs all. Begynne nowe (sayth he) whyle thou hearest, to study for this, that death may not come out of season.</p>
               <p>Wherfore let vs so order our selues, that we maye be in the fowerth sort, although it be small. Let vs by prayer and diligence so prouide, that our mynde be not sinistrall and vntoward. Let vs regarde the worde of God, and kepe it, and bryng forth good fruicts. And of this sorte is the company of sainctes, I meane not of the Pope holy sainctes, which are disguysed &amp; shorne, whyche are Massmongers, and fryday fasters, whose holynes is in their wedes &amp; strange vestures. &amp;c. But they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heare the word of God, wher as contrary wise, the Pope &amp; his holy ones (as it euidently appereth) are very extreme persecuters of Gods worde. They that heare the word, bringeth foorthe fruicte, yea a hundred fold, that is, much and plentifully: or as Mathew spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in parcels:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 13.</note> som a hundred fold, som sixtie fold, som thirtie fold. For as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministrations &amp; offices ar sundry so are the fruits vnlike.

And yet bothe are Christians made free from synne and death and ordeined heires of euerlasting life through Christ. Let vs be of this number, which truly is small.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:1416:145"/>But we haue nede of a toward and pure heart (as Christ saith) that is,<note place="margin">What maner of thynge a good hart is.</note> suche a heart that is not negligent and forgetfull, but careth earnestly for Gods woorde. For that thynge is fyrst of all necessary, that the deuyl may haue no waye in, leste he come and steale awaye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word. Secondarily, it is necessary to haue a strong and a couragious heart, and not a feareful &amp; dastard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that wyll be moued with terror and dreade, or care for mens hatred or fauor. For except we loue God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all thynges, and dread hym, the woorde can not longe endure with vs. For it is neuer suffered in any place of the worlde long without persecution. For the dyuell can not abyde it. It is a very busy and styrryng kyngdome of hys. He suffereth not his seruauntes to be ydle, as we proue and feele by the Papistes dayely more and more. Thyrdely, he muste take diligent hede in this poynt also, that the thornes trouble it not, that is, that he regard not his substance, rychesse, pleasures concupiscence of the flesh and eies, and the pompe and pryde of lyfe, so muche as he dothe the woorde. And worldly trauayle is not more to bee estemed, then the worde of God. But as <hi>CHRIST</hi> saythe:<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:1416:146"/>
we can not by reson of our natural inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neglect and despise worldly things. Besides all this, the deuil letteth no occasion passe: but deuiseth all meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to take the word from vs, and to put in the place therof, couetousnes, pride, wrath, and other thinges of like sort. As there be exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples to shew. For ther shold be many excellent persons in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, if they wer not hyndred by auarice, ambition, lechery, so that they can not regard Gods word. Wherfore it is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, diligently to marke our vicious nature, and not to lyue so carelesly, as the most part doo, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate God for the gift of the holy ghost (which he pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mised for a suretie to geue vs.<note place="margin">

               <p>Nowe after this description of true godlynesse and hope of good encreace therof, this doctrine is not to be let passe in this parable. Let it not seme any meruaile vnto vs,<note place="margin">The word is not euerye where fruict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> that Gods worde shoulde not euery where yelde fruict. For that we learne by the distinction that Christ maketh of fower kynds of hearers, wherof one onely is good, the other thre ar fautie.

Howebeit, the worde and the precher is not in the fault, as the ragious and furious Papists thinke, they may boast against vs in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, for that there rose also many sectes and offences with the settyng foorth of our doctrine.</p>
               <p>But if this made any thing against vs, what wold they saye to the example of Christ, Iohn, and the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?

Why saiest thou not nowe, that Iohn, Christe, and the Apostles were false teachers, for that there was suche incredible stubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and malice, that verye fewe were conuerted by theyr woorde.</p>
               <p>But here they dare not speake what they thynk, lest they should openly betray them selues to be Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.<note place="margin">The word of Christ himself was not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where fruit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full.</note> They think that they haue a lauful cause therfore to raile vpon our doctrine. What is the cause of oure doctrine, and by what right we may maintayn it, and set it foorth: I will not shew at this tyme, I haue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respect that it is Christes worde. For thus he sayth: The sede is the worde. And verily it can not fall into a wicked Papistes heart to saye, that this worde, that Christ speaketh of here, is euill and corrupt.</p>
               <p>But now what saieth Christ, as touchyng the pure and good ground? what encrease co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth therof? The fourth part (saith he) commeth to good, and groweth
<pb facs="tcp:1416:147"/>
to ripenesse.</p>
               <p>Who therfore can doubt, but that the worlde conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in wickednes &amp; without amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, although the worde and the doctrine be pure true and without faulte? I pleade not the cause (as I sayde before) for our doctrine. But we at the least proue this, that oure aduersaries the Papists can not but confesse whether they will or no, that the wickednes of the worlde can not bee amended thereby or taken awaye, althoughe that bothe pure doctrine and preachers come vnto it. The very example of Christ besydes Iohn and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles sheweth sufficiently, that the matter can not be brought to suche case, that all shall beleue and embrace the worde. It is the greater parte, and it wyll be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies euyll, lewde, and vnfruictfull, and very fewe be conuerted and brought to beleue.</p>
               <p>Now if it so chanced to the sonne of God, what mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaile is it, if it chaunced so to Iohn, and to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and now to vs also at this time? Shal the fault therfore be layde to the doctrine? Why doo they not as well blame and denie the good sede, that fell vpon the way, the stones, and the thornes. But they should rather folow the truth, and refrayn from railyng and backbityng. His worde is the sede that is sowen. And that is neuer euyll, neither dooth it of his owne pure nature bring forth any other fruicts then good. And if fruicts folow not thereafter, beware thou blame not God and his word.<note place="margin">The cause why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde is not fruict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> The fault is in the ground, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the good sede is hurte, corrupte, and made vnfruict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

Let them condemne them selues rather, and such other that wil
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1416:147"/>
not receiue the worde with a true heart. For the fault is not in the word, but in the hearte and mynd. They are corrupt &amp; also stirred by the diuel to forsake Gods worde: As Christe sheweth in an other parable of a good ground, which is sowed with good sede,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 13.</note> and yet it can not be without tares. If ye demand how this commeth so to passe: the diuel (saith Christ) soweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the night: which can not suffer, that all thyngs shold be cleane &amp; pure, and albeit, he can not vtterly roote vp altogither, yet he mingleth his tares with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> residue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is pure.

Wherfore here it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ said in the last part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: Many are called, but few are chosen.

God will haue vs acknowlege our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and renoum in this, that we through baptisme are borne the sonnes of God, and his proper goodes. He did not so by all nations, he shewed not the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his mercie and grace to them, whether they be Turkes or sarasens. For they regard not these pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileges of the first begotten. Neither will they hear or see these thinges that make vs first borne before God.

was taken from Iuda, and foreiners had it, likewise he had caste the count, and duly numbred the times as touchyng the weekes of Daniel. These prophecies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the tymes, semed plainlye to him, that the time was come wherin Christe shold be reueled.

               <p>Wherfore by the singuler procurement of the holie ghost, when Marye and Ioseph came into the temple to present the childe before the Lorde and to redeme hym by an offeringe: Simeon also commeth into the temple, not by chaunce, or of custome, but by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy ghost, which put in his minde, that it was the very houre, wherin he might behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> borne Messias in the temple, whome he had hitherto loked for. Wherfore he toke no doubtful deliberation about the matter, when he saw the child: but went forthwith and toke him in his armes, shewinge therwith all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ioye &amp; myrth, that is accustomed to be shewen in suche greate and comfortable matter. And there he pronounceth before them all suche an hartie thankes geuinge vnto God, that teacheth that he truely este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this gyfte, and certified other also of this great matter.</p>
               <p>And he appered to other and especially to the priests not to do this of any custome, Simeon semed to them not to haue his right wittes. For all that was done, was litle estemed, the chyld beyng yonge, the parents poore, and nothing had in estimation. But Simeon is nothing moued with this poore shew, neither regar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth he the iudgement of other in this behalfe, but
<pb facs="tcp:1416:155"/>
boldly and frelye affirmeth, that this is the very child, in whome God hath ordayned succour and saluation not only for the Iewes, but for the Gentils also, and for all men. If a man shoulde demaunde of Simeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, howe he knewe this, wher as there appered at this tyme in hym no notable thynge more than in other, &amp; wher as there had ben many before this time more likelye persons, whiche for their magnificence might seme more apte for this purpos: he might haue had a iuste cause so to haue done. Wherfore, this is a merueilous case, that causeth the parents Ioseph and Mary to wonder, when they see this man Simeon, without externall signes to perceaue such an inwarde light in this childe, as wherby he acknowledgeth Christe, notwithstandynge that he was hid by that poore shewe. The parents were certifyed of this child what he was, by the Angels, neither could these thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs appeare to be opened and reueled to Simeon by flesh &amp; bloud. And this was a certain token of the church and congregation of <hi>GOD</hi> at that tyme, when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne were confirmed by reuelations from GOD. They that were chief at Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the high priests Herod, the Scribes, the Leuites, and Phariseis, dyd not muche regarde the scriptures and the promises as touchyng Messias. All their mindes were bent, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their power, their dignitie, their authoritie and riches. And amonge them was there a litle number despised and vnknowen, of the faythfull. Of the which was Mary, Ioseph, Zacharie, Elizabeth, the sheppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, Simeon, Anne the prophetesse. These had all their hope fired, not in wordly things, but in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises as touchinge Christe. They looked for them to be fulfilled, and with them they comforted themselues,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1416:155"/>
and obtayned them as they trusted, wheras the hye Priests and suche lyke were sent awaye emptie. And after lyke maner is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> state of the church at this tyme. There is alwayes a people that is poore &amp; hungrye, whiche hath God and his worde for their falsegarde: That doth it only regard, without anye further care.<note place="margin">The state of Christes chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che in this worlde, is poore and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.</note> Wheras the Pope and his adherentes in the meane time, which are named the holy churche, knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God nor of Christ nor of his worde. For they regard and esteme only things of this worlde, &amp; boaste themselues for Christian men, because that they can do more with their riches and power, than the other common sorte in the congregation.</p>
               <p>Wherfore you must beware in both parts, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye be not seduced. The hie priest execute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> administration, &amp; yet they are not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true church.

For if they were, they wold not persecute y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> word, but rather reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly extoll it. In the contrary part, Mary, Ioseph &amp; Simeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are without al nobilite, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sort, &amp; therfore are vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with such like.

This appeareth to be false i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this first history of Christ. &amp; on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary part, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle flock is not therfore to be despised.

<pb facs="tcp:1416:156"/>
For this is the maner of gods kyngdome in earth, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be neglected and abhorred of the wise, and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced and set forth of the poore, to whom it is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reueled.

               <p>And let this be sufficient as touchyng, the first part of this historie, wherin Simeon by the holye Ghost acknowlegeth the childe Iesus to be the annointed of the Lord. After this I wil take vpon me to entreat of his sermon. Wherby he signifieth to other, what great helpe and what thynges he surely knoweth to be to come of this child.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, what is his office, &amp; the greatest thing that he worketh in all the worlde: that we herby by this example may knowlege Christe, and be saued. The eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist before described that Simeon receaued an answere of the holy Gost: that he sholde not die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had seen the annointed of the Lord. And when that promesse nowe was fulfylled in the temple, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with his eyes, the child Iesus, and toke hym into his armes, and pronounced these wordes with a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spirite: saying.</p>
               <q>Lorde now lettest thou thy seruaunte depart in peace accordyng to thy worde.</q>
               <p>That is: Now wil I gladly without any refusing yelde my selfe to nature.<note place="margin">Death ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hartes to feare.</note> Flesh and blood hath no such kynde of speache.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1416:156"/>
death, desperation, and lamentable cries, &amp;c. Neither can the naturall man otherwise do, as it is to see, by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of brute beastes, wheras is only a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall death. But in men it is called the death of syn.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>ous to them, then it is to all other thynges, that by the law of destinie are appointed to die. For they must abyde the wrath and iudgement of God, which are ioyned with death, and neuer hath ende. If these thynges accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not death, it wold not be so terrible a thing for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to die. It is no litle grefe that commeth by departyng from thinges most delectable and dere vnto vs, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we must therwith leaue wife, children, frends and suche lyke: But yet it passeth al greife, to fele sinnes, to dreade gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to be opprest with death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wayes to escape. Wherfore the worlde can not singe this songe with Simeon, when death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. But it beginneth rather to synge this morneful verse, O Lord, I am giltie &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned for my sinnes, Wherfore I can not be suffered to departe from them in peace. My minde trembleth and shaketh, I see no helpe offered to me. I knowe from what thinges I must depart, but I can not tel what thynges I shall haue hereafter, excepte this that I am sure of Goddes wrath and damnation, suche is mans minde towards death. Neither can it fynde in nature or reason anye helpe or remedie against suche feare. And therfore it must nedes at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of death fall in despeire.</p>
               <p>Wherfore this lesson and doctrine,<note place="margin">Simeon lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not this way to dye by man.</note> that is put forth here to vs in the example of Simeon, is not of mans witte. He drew to his death without tremblynge: he
<pb facs="tcp:1416:157"/>
despeired not to be saued after the maner of other. He knewe that he was olde, and that olde men haue no longe continuance in this life, he feleth his strength more and more to decay. He perceaued not only by the necessary course of nature, but also by his owne perill, that the time was nigh, wherin his frame sholde be disolued. But yet he is not dismayed therby, but euen now desireth and wisheth for the resolution therof, the which all other, and especially old men wold wish ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to come. It appeareth that he had marueilous helpe, syth that he went to death, with suche strength of mynde, and ioyfull courage. For if it had not ben for that, he could neuer haue ben so glad at the beholdynge of death. But what thynge shall we say that it was, wherwith he was armed against it shall we saye he was no man, or that he was without sin, and therfore feared not gods wrath. But the maner of obtaining saluation through this light, vttereth plainlye, that he felt himselfe to be a synner and a man in danger to gods ire and wrath. And syth it goeth so with men &amp; synners, what peace is it, that this old man boasteth of? His wordes shewe euidently, that he had such sence &amp; felyng of peace, as cold be hindred neither by mans fraile estate, neither by contagion of syn. And this is the thinge that ought well to be marked in this man, that we sinners also may surely truste to the same. And herby it may comme to passe, that synners maye obtayne peaceable and quiete myndes agaynst death, as we see Simeon to be indued with so greate and vncredible confidence and truste. He had hard before that he shold not see death. Now he perceaueth what was vnperformed of the couenant. Yet he thought it not good to vse anye vnluckie wordes and to saye,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1416:157"/>
that he must die, seinge he hath obtayned and gotten hym, that is the Lorde of lyfe and peace. Wherfore he expoundeth death, to be but a licence of departyng in peace, as souldiers after battaill are licensed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne home vnto their frendes and acquaintance.</p>
               <p>But nowe let vs learne of hym this kynd of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful exposition. For he is a gentle and free instructer. He sheweth very louingly the ful reason &amp; meanyng of his opinion and iudgement without askyng, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he sayeth.</p>
               <q>For min eyes hath sene thy saluation.</q>
               <p>Here he speaketh of the childe Iesu, namynge him saluation, sauynge health or sauiour. Therfore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he alludeth to the name of the childe, whiche he knew and learned of his mother or whether he knew it not, yet properlye he toucheth the thynge that was meant by the name, so that he consenteth in all points with the Angell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 1.</note> whiche brought this diuine name from heauen, causynge hym to be named Iesus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he shoulde saue his people from their synnes. Simeon calleth him the saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lord, that is, whome the Lorde himselfe ordained to be a sauiour. And as touching this name, I haue spoken before of the childe Iesu: that wheras God hath ordayned the maiestrate, the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and such other necessary offices to be our sauiours in corporall and temporall affaires as the phisitions in sycknes, lawyers in expoundynge what is euery mans right: So yf this chylde had not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me with an other kynd of saluation, Simeon could neuer haue had suche great confidence in his matters as to expound that his death was but a licence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, or a salfe conducte to go in peace, he could neuer haue regarded synne and death so lyghtlye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:158"/>Wherfore sith Simeon confesseth, that he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace out of this life, bycause he hath sene the saluation of God, he defineth plainly that he is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour againste sinne and death. For how colde he els haue suche sure confidence of peace in a sauiour that was a man? This description is not lightlye to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. For it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehendeth a great wayghtie matter in fewe wordes. It is but one child, whom Simeon so nameth. Wherfore it is herby euidently proued, that whatsoeuer is beside this childe, seme it neuer so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable through the name or outwarde shewe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet can it haue no power to bring to saluation, or to put awaye death and synne. But whosoeuer suffereth it to be applied vnto hym for saluation, worketh his owne damnation.</p>
               <p>Wher Simeon by this worde, mindeth to abolishe and derogat all rites,<note place="margin">The law and good workes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do nothing against sin &amp; death.</note> and ceremonies and all the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations of the lawe, that no man shold put any hope of saluation in them, and that whosoeuer trusteth in the lawe &amp; in his workes, shall neuer obtayne to be saued. For wheras he by a notable praise calleth this child the saluation of God, it is easye to gather therby, that all ayde and remedie againste death remaineth onely in hym. Wherof then commeth this hope in the Iewes, that put suche trust in the law and his workes? What meaneth the Pope and his adherents, so highly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll Masses, Pilgrimages, pardons, as though salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came by them? syth this is the name of this child only, neyther may it be geuen and communicat to any thyng or creature besydes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The worlde ordaineth his sauiours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde Christ.</note>The only wordes of Simeon may be taken for an argument, against these wicked persuasions and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. For mine eyes, saith he, hath sene thy saluation,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1416:158"/>
I say, euen that thou almightie father hast ordayned hym to be a saluation to synners. For the worlde must nedes finde out saluations againste sinne. The Iewe thinketh it saluation, if he obserue the law. The monke and religious man thinketh it saluation if he bynde himselfe to a certaine kynd of life by a vowe, and some chose certaine of the sainctes to be their patrones and defenders against synne and hell. All thinke that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasyng of saluation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in their maner of lyuing. But who can number the workes that procede of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s traditions, and Idolatrous seruice in the popedome, wherin consisted their chiefe hope of saluation? Yf they had well considered this verse of Simeon, they shoulde haue perceaued that this ought to haue ben a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded as a most haynous sacrilege and robbing God of his dewe honour, and they wold not haue ordained any other sauiours, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was determined by the saying of Simeon. They wolde haue suffered hym onlye to haue this glory, whom God had appointed so to be, in whome no man that trusteth can be disapointed. For to this ende came this child, and for this purpose was he sent of God, euen to bring saluation vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Wherfore in this saluation whiche God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, there is suche store of sauing helth,<note place="margin">The saluation of God canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saue.</note> that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science may therby haue perfect quiet, and neuer more dreade the crueltie of death or violence of synne, or the ragyng tyrannie of the deuill, for as muche as he hath the sauing health of God prepared redie, that is, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie and euerlasting saluation, whiche lacketh no kynde of succoure and helpe to saue vs againste synne and death, and geue vs abondance of lyfe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes. Let vs only with this Simeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> embrace this child, that is stycke vnto hym with a true faith, that
<pb facs="tcp:1416:159"/>
we maye conceyue a sure comfort by hym. For when this is surely printed in our heart, that this child is that prepared saluation ordained to helpe vs againste synne and death, then doth ensue therof suche peace of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, that syn and death skeareth vs but in vaine. For our sauiour is redye to helpe vs against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour saieth.</note>And to entreat more at large of the saluation, that commeth by this child, let vs take the record of Iohn the Baptist discribynge hym thus: Behold the lambe of god that taketh awaye the synnes of the worlde. In these wordes is described the sacrifice vpon the crosse for syn,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.</note> and the conqueringe of death by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection to iustifie vs and to make vs rightuous. Wherfore to the obtainment of this saluation, he by his death and resurrection geueth vs helpe against sin and death. And albeit that a Christian man must not omitte to do good workes, yet is not saluation obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therby, neither remission of syn, but this is only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience due vnto god, which god requireth. And he that will not performe it, is not deliuered from his sinnes,<note place="margin">Good works.</note> for his disobedience. For this is the only true way to obtayne that, euen that he that seeketh howe to be deliuered from syn and death, sholde whollie flee to this saluation, that is prepared for vs of god, that it might take our synnes vpon hym, and make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for them, &amp; so deliuer vs. He that doth this, may say with Simeon. Whatsoeuer feare or dreade by death and other perils is set before vs: this is my sure comfort againste them all, that thou Lorde lettest thy seruaunt departe in peace. He that trusteth to anye other thynge, shall in steade of peace fynde anguishe and extreme miserie in suche a tyme. For he shall not haue this sauynge health, but in death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1416:159"/>
shall he perishe. Neither muste we make anye suche difference betwene vs and Simeon, as thoughe he myght more boldlye truste in this saluation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had power to take the childe in his armes and to beholde hym: and we not so, because we haue no suche power. For as touchynge the effecte of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the bodely presence is not auaylable, or hath no great importance.<note place="margin">Simon hath no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this saluation then we haue.</note> Many other Iewes doubtlesse dyd at that very time beholde <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and yet obtayned no saluation therbie. Only this was effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouse in Simeon and furthered hym to saluation, for that he thorowe the inspiration of the holy Ghoste embraced this childe, whiche nothynge differed from other children, by reason and sence, as that onlye sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, whiche was promised to the fathers, Abraham and Dauid. And in this are all Christian men equal to Simeon. For the very same Christe is offered to them by the worde of the Gospell for their saluation, whom Simeon coulde no other wayes knowe to be the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, then by the worde. And wheras he behelde hym wyth his eyes it was the gyfte of GOD pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to hym and not to vs, and yet he obtayned not saluation therby, but that was geuen vnto hym to be saued for that he beleued the worde as touchynge this child. Which is as able to saue thee, as Simeon.</p>
               <p>And for this cause Simeon rehearseth in the verse folowynge all them to whome this saluation belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, least it shoulde seme to pertayne vnto fewe, sayinge.</p>
               <q>Whiche thou haste prepared before the face of all people.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:160"/>
                  <note place="margin">Christ is the saluation of all men.</note>This child is a saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against death &amp; syn, &amp; this maketh Simeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to departe in peace. But he is moued by the consideration of this sauinge health, to open vnto al other, by geuyng so euident commendation of it, for what purpose God hath prepared this saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This saluation (saith he) is not only ordained for my sake. But many belong vnto the felowshipe and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this sauing health.<note place="margin">Simeon put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene the Iewe and the Gentile.</note> For God hath prepared this saluation before the face of all people, so that this child is not my sauiour only, neither his mothers, but the sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiour and saluation of all men. Simeon sayinge is large and great. He pronounceth him to be the sauiour of all nations, as well as of the Iewes, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng that there was a great difference betwene them, by reason of Moses lawe and the diuine ceremonies. But when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidereth this child, he can make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. For both haue like nede of saluation to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered therby from death &amp; sinne. For the obseruynge of all the lawe nothing preuayleth in deliueringe from synne and death. By this sauiour only is all saluation prepared.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene.</hi> 22.</note> This sauiour is not suche a one, that came for some, &amp; for some not. God hath prepared (sayth he) this saluation not before the face of certayne, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of all people. The whiche sentence is all one with the promesse made vnto Abraham, where as he promiseth blessynge to all kyndredes in his sede. Neither can the Iewes be excluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all tribes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all people: But they that are blessed, were not blessed before, but liued in gods curse. Wherfore the meaning of this is no otherwise to be taken, but that if this be the saluation of all people, than is there none at all that can be saued, whiche lacketh this sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And this is one thinge, that Simeon maketh
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1416:160"/>
all men equall, pronouncyng that as well the Iewes as the Gentiles are suche as shold be damned for their synnes: excepte they obteyned saluation by this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng healthe.</p>
               <p>The second thynge is, well to consider the pythe of these wordes:<note place="margin">What reason thynketh of</note> and to conceaue a delectation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by them. The cause and spryng of all our misery is this: our conscience can not denye hyde and cloke synne. And synne muste nedes abyde Gods wrothe, which is the most peinfullest styng of death to fear the iudgement of God. For we can not denie but that sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners must abyde punyshment. Now through this per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceuerance and felyng of this dreade, there is no hope of pardon and grace. If these thoughtes be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, they be so heynous, that they count God to be a cruell and an vnmercyfull iudge, that will remyt no part of the rigour of the lawe, but execute it with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie. Thus can we conceaue no other opinion of God, and thus are we ouerladen with the heuynes of the burthen, and opprest with the rodde of the taske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister, and beaten with the shoulder wande,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esai.</hi> 9.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the saying of the Prophete.</p>
               <p>But Simeon doubtles hauyng respecte to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge and description of this Prophete, as touchynge this chylde, describeth God after an other maner, than any mans conscience is wont to conceaue or thynke of hym. For if it were the wyl of <hi>GOD</hi> to punysh sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with extremitie, without grace and fauour, then were it a vayne thynge to truste in mercye shewed in this Sauiour. Nowe are the woordes of Simeon playne, that God hathe prepared saluation before the face of all people, Wherein all men may bee saued. Wherefore hereby maye it bee euidentlye perceaued,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:161"/>
what is the will of God, accordyng to Paule. 1. Tim. 2. euen that God would haue all men to be saued, not onely with bodily saluation,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Timo.</hi> 2.</note> but with euerlastyng sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation prepared agaynst synne and death. For to this ende is that saluation ordeyned, which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all people. Who therefore woulde dreade this God?<note place="margin">The cause why all are not saued.</note> Who woulde tremble at his iudgemente, seynge that he declareth so openly, that it is his wyll we shoulde be saued, and seyng that he hath prouided all thynges necessary for our saluation? And wher as many peryshe, and be damned, not obteynynge thys saluation, God is not the fault therof, but the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornes of man,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> whiche despiseth Gods wyll, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not for this saluation of God, whiche is ordeyned of God to saue all men. If there were a remedy proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the succoure and reliefe of all beggers and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye folke, and yet some woulde not vse that benefyte and remedy prouided for them, the faulte were not in them that prouided for the suste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation, but in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that should haue receaued it.</p>
               <p>In like maner goeth it with men in the world: The saying of Simeon is true. God hath prepared this sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation before the face of al people. yf the Iewes iudge them selues vnworthy to receaue it, yf the Pope and the Turke despise it, and thou canste not fynde in thy heart to accept it, if now it cometh to passe, that thou and all these be damned, ye can blame none but youre selues, which refused the saluation and grace of God. If this saluation seemeth not agreable to thy reason, thou mayst searche with thy self where it may then be had.<note place="margin">There is no saluation but in Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> But thou shalt not fynde in all the saluations in the worlde succour agaynst synne and deathe, yf thou
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1416:161"/>
let passe this saluation. Wherefore if thou carest ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly for thy saluation, imbrace this chyld. Know for a suretie that God is mercyfull vnto thee, and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thyne offences for this chyldes sake, and so shalte thou well perceaue, that thou art saued. For he is the only saluation agaynst synne and deathe. But if this way of saluation pleaseth thee not, accuse thyne own stubbornesse, whiche causeth thee, that thou canste not escape Gods wrathe and damnation.</p>
               <p>For <hi>GOD</hi> is not in the faute. God hath prepared saluation. Which is a sure token,<note place="margin">God is not the author of any mannes damnation.</note> that he would haue mercy on synners, and delyuer vs from our destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And he hath not prepared it onely, but also proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to all people, that all myght remembre, that all theyr saluation consysteth therein. Not onely Marie, Paule, Simeon, Peter: but all people ought to trust in hym. Who soeuer hath nede of helpe agaynst synne and death, herein may they haue a sure hope thereof. For thus hath God, that most mercyfull father prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ordeyned it. Wherefore hynder not thy selfe by stubborne refusynge of hym: For so shalte thou make thy selfe voyde of all comforte and healpe, the whiche <hi>GOD</hi> hathe not onely promysed, but also performed it faythfully, as Symeon here testifieth. And least small credence shold be geuen to those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des for the shortenesse thereof, he addeth thervnto an euident exposition of the wyl of God as touchyng this saluation, sayinge:
<q>To bee a lyght to lyghten the Gentiles, and to bee the Glorie of thy people Israell.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:162"/>Nowe hee vttereth the matter playnelye, that it might be vnderstande, which all those people are, that God will haue to be receiued. Fyrst therfore (he saith) if thou knowest not whiche be all people, they bee the Gentiles and the Iewes. Let no man come and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake my wordes. Then that thou maist know whose saluation this is, and in what myseries and euyls we must vse him, consider that the Gentiles are drowned in all ignorance and darknesse. For syth they be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Goddes worde, they can haue no certayne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.<note place="margin">Christ giueth lyght to the Gentiles.</note> They put no difference betwene <hi>GOD</hi> and the deuyll, they feare the deuyll as well as God, for their destruction. Yea, they haue more hope in the deuyl then in God, as we are taught by examples. And out of this ignorance, there procede other synnes, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, blasphemye, and many other vices. And suche are the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>But God prepareth saluation for the Gentiles. If they wer not deliuered out of darknes, they shold find no saluation for all that euer they can doo. Wherefore this sauing helth helpeth them against this ignorance and darknesse, geuynge the Gentiles lighte, that is, the knowlege of God by his word for their saluation. These thinges are geuen to the Gentiles which are i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters and filthy synners, through Christ, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and wil of God. By this may the louing &amp; liberall bounteousnes of God the father be estemed, that we flee not from hym for feare of his wrathe, or crueltie, As Christ saith: So God loued the world, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gaue his only begotten sonne, that as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in hym shoulde not perishe, but haue lyfe euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynge. Wherefore there can be doone no greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour to God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> then to thynke that he hateth vs for
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1416:162"/>
our synnes, and that we shall peryshe in our synnes, &amp; yet this thought causeth gret trouble in our hearts,<note place="margin">A syngular comfort for al synners.</note> so that the lyght of Gods mercy can scarsly be kindled therin. For if we were not combred with this euyll, we would not be of suche fearful and desperate hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, whiche dare scarcely in aduersitie and trouble to looke vnto God, &amp; to his word, or put any trust therin.</p>
               <p>And hereby is it now euident again, that Simeon bestowed great study in readyng the prophets.<note place="margin">The diligent study of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon in the prophetes.</note> For he conceaueth not these things of himselfe, but as he had marked the tyme by the prophecie of Iacob and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell, and as he knew by the promise made to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that this saluation was appoynted to all people and kynredes of the earth, that hereby they shold be saued from malediction and curse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>Esa.</hi> 49.</note> and be defended against syn and death. So learned he also of the prophet Esai that this chylde shoulde be the lyghte of the Gentiles. For thus sayth the Lorde by his Prophet Esai. It is but a small matter (saieth he vnto Christe) that thou shouldest be my seruant, to stirre vp the tribes of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and to turne the remnant of Israel. I haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee to be a lyght to the Gentiles, that thou myghtest be my saluation, to the vttermost partes of the earth. It is lyke that Simeon exercised hymselfe well in the vnderstandyng of this sentence, forasmuch as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth it so fitly in this short sermon. Wherfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiles haue a great gyft in this chylde to be their lyght, to open vnto them the ioyfull tydynges, and to set vp for them a kyngdome of saluation. And for this cause was he prepared and brought foorth of God.</p>
               <p>But the Iewes in this behalfe are preferred before the Gentiles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> for that that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto them the lawe &amp; the Prophets, and named them his people.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:163"/>
Wherefore in this the Iewes haue a greate preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and preeminence before the Gentiles. But what then? Is Christ therfore not necessary for the Iewes? haue they therfore no nede of his saluation? It is sayd before, that this saluation belongeth to all. Howbeit, all are not of lyke state and condition, that are healed by this saluation. For the Iewes are not suche syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as the Gentiles were, as Paule putteth a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in his epistle to the Galathians: yet forasmuche as they are not iustified by the workes of theyr lawe,<note place="margin">

                        <desc>•</desc>

               <p>And thys dyshonoure is suche in the presence of Almyghty <hi>GOD,</hi> that they coulde neuer obtayne the trewe and gloryous herytage of God thereby. Wherefore Symeon sayth furthermore: The Iewes glorye is, for that they are not so foolyshe and vnwise as the synners of the Gentiles were. But yet it is a greatte dishonoure to theym, that where as they haue the lawe, yet they are not iustified by the lawe. And now is this saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prepared also for them, that they myght bee iustified by Faythe in Iesus Christe, and so obtayne glorye, for that that they coulde not obteyne it by the woorkes of the lawe, and that soo they myght be heyres in Gods kyngdome, for this saluation Christes sake.</p>

And after thys meanynge shoulde the Hystorye of thys feast bee handled, and especially for that that Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon as an exaumple layde before vs, sheweth the waye to all teachers.

And thus hathe the dyuell by his Papistes mocked Goddes Churche and congregation: And where as they shoulde haue extolled thys lyghte and glorye of the Gentiles, euen thys chylde <hi>IESVS,</hi> they haue in steade thereof ordeyned thys triflyng cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of halowynge Candels, that the congregation beynge kepte occupyed thereby, myghte not regarde thys trewe and necessarye lyghte.

And if a man shold demaunde of them,<note place="margin">The Papists borowe the most parte of their religion of the Iewes &amp; of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiles.</note> why they doo all these thynges: Here they doubte not to answere, that it was a maner of the Gentiles, at the Calendes of Februarie, to cary about fier brandes both in cities and townes: And that Pope Sergius ordeined, that it should be turned out of a Gentile ceremonie, into a christian ceremonie. And here ye maye see how welle they doo, that learne of the Gentiles howe to honor God, and so ordeyne their christianitie therby. For the most part of all their seruice is grounded on suche a foundation, that either they folow lyke apes the law of Moses, or els while they go about to correcte the abhominations of the Gentiles, they ordeyne by lawe in the churche more greater abhominations. And they are euen well rewarded for their foolyshnes. For why would they not heare Simeon preachyng of this sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and lyght of synners, and glorie of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous?

They coulde by no meanes beleue the wordes to bee trewe as hee spake them: They gathered the myracles whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Christe wrought when he raised vp the deade, and gaue sight to the blynd, that god was surely with him And that the kyngdome semed hereby to become his, and that they shold be lordes, dukes, &amp; Earles, in that kyngdom vnder hym.

               <p>But in the mean time herby is it signified, that this is the nature of al good works,<note place="margin">The workes of God are not vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded before thei <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And thus dothe Iohn of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes reherse, that the disciples of Christe, percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued afterwarde, that Christ had spoken vnto them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Faythe is of necessitie required to the worde of God. For when God speaketh, he dothe it after his maner,<note place="margin">Faythe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.</note> on suche wyse, that hys wordes are of suche thynges, as are farre oute of the capacitie of naturall reason. And so longe is faythe requisite, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylle the thynge bee fulfylled, whyche was spoken
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1416:165"/>
of before.</p>
               <p>As for an example. The word of God teacheth vs of the resurrection of the fleshe. Reason vnderstandeth it not: they that take reason for their guide, as the wise of the world doo, they mocke and scorne christen men, because they consente to this article so soone, that there should be an other life after this. Likewise it can seme nothyng agreable to reason, that god shoulde become man, and bee borne of the virgine Marye. All these thynges are to be receaued only by faith, vntill that in the lyfe to comme, they shall be felte and perceyued in very dede.</p>
               <p>It semeth a great foly to reason, that by the water of baptisme, Gods grace and fauour shoulde be obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without desert or merit, or that remission of synne should be geuen by absolution and preachynge of the Gospel. It counteth christen men to be very folyshe in this poynt. What thynkest thou (sayth reason) shalbe done by these small tris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es? Thou must rather do such thynges, as are comendable before God for their peyn and greate trauayle that muste bee taken in doynge theym. We nede not to goe farre to proue this. The Popes doctrine tendeth wholly to this ende, to make menne obtayne remission of synnes by their workes. For it semeth but a fable to reason, that men should be made acceptable to God &amp; meete for Gods kyngdom by Baptisme. The word it self is but a despysed thing. And the professoures therof are but weake synners. Why shold not reason therfore thynke it a madnes to commyt lyfe, riches, and all thyngs els to this worde? We may thank reason only, for that notwithstanding so great knowledge and light of the word, yet so few
<pb facs="tcp:1416:166"/>
beleue. All the other multitude hateth this doctrine as a pernicious and erronious thyng, as though it sette men at libertie to do all kynde of mischief, and to lyue without regard of honestie and godlynes: neyther can reason iudge otherwise. And therefore is the doctrine of faith set foorth to christians, for that the thyngs set foorth in the worde, are not agreable to naturall capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. But yet they count it worthy to be beleued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is Gods worde: whiche wyll, when the tyme is come, bryng it to passe. Then shall we haue perfect vnderstanding of that that now passeth our capacitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The example of Dauid.</note> But the Scripture is full of examples. Dauid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he fought with Goliath, beleued that he shold ouerthrowe and kyll that huge and myghtye gyaunt. And this he declared to Saule: The Lorde (saith he) that delyuered me out of the hand of the lyon, and out of the hand of the beare, shal delyuer me out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand of this Philistine.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.</note> Lykewise he sayeth agayne: This vncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, that reuile the hoste of the lyuyng <hi>GOD.</hi> And agayne he saythe to the Philistine: The Lorde shall geue thee in to my hande, and I shall strike thee, and cutte of thy head. These wordes bee spoken of the mouth of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. but yf they were Dauids wordes onely, and not the wordes of God, they should neuer haue taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But they are Gods, and Dauid beleued them, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they came to passe. Wherfore afterward they toke effect, and it maketh no matter, that some thoughte it a foolyshe enterprise: and therefore coulde not beleue, that it should come to passe as it dyd afterward. For it semed impossible, that Dauid, beyng but a yonge man shoulde with suche a little stone ouerthrowe suche a greate Gyant. But Dauid beleueth it, and dothe it in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1416:166"/>
dede. Then the matter appered certayne, and not fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. When he came fyrste and spake the worde, reason iudged it a vayne and a foolyshe enterprise. For after this maner dyd reason counte: Dauid is yong, and a shepheard without knowledge of the feats of warre, and nowe he gothe forthe vnarmed with a staffe and a slyng, as though he would fyght with a dogge. But the gyant is harneissed, and commeth with his shielde and speare. Wherfore he crieth oute and sayth: Thou foolyshe boy, takest thou vpon thee that, that none in the hoste durste take? And Dauid hym selfe sawe no more then this by reason, but he beleued more, euen that God woulde reuenge this blasphemie, and saue hym: and so it came to passe.</p>
               <p>But to be short, this is the maner of all good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and workes, that before they are done,<note place="margin">Baptisme &amp; the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead</note> they seme impossible, and yet they take effect. And when they ar come to passe, then they seme easy to reason. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are done, they belonge not to reason, but to Faith. For where as we are washed from sin by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and shall rise agayne from death in the last day reason shal neuer vnderstand it. And especially sith the saintes and godly men haue so diuers chances. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some are cast as a pray vnto wyld beastes and fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the ayre. Some are burnt, and their ashes cast into the flood. What crueltie vsed the Pope agaynste that holye manne Iohn Husse at <hi>Constantia</hi>? Here reason thynketh: Howe can God recouer his body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne? Nothynge woorketh this but Gods worde. Wherefore no man oughte to count it impossible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it seme to syght so to bee. But nothyng is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to them that beleue. For al the effect and ende of the matter lyeth in Gods power, whych is almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:167"/>
and maketh all thynges of nothyng.</p>

No more than a chylde that is borne thirtie or fortie yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vs?<note place="margin">God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghty, &amp; can doo what he wyll.</note> Wherfore sythe this is Gods maner to make all thyng of nothynge, then can he muche more make agayne, somewhat of that, that was before. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the godly must not consyder, whether a thyng be possible, but whether GOD hath sayd, it shalbe done be it neuer so vnpossible to syght. For althoughe that can not appere to me,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 19. <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.</note> yet God hym self is he, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thinges impossible to be possible, and of nothing, all thynges. Wherfore all, that calle Gods worde to the tryall of reason,<note place="margin">Reson ought not to Iudge Gods works</note> are woorthy to bee abhorred. For is not God able to rayse the deade, because it is not in my power? Wherefore lette euery man esteeme it a greate wyckednesse to trye or ponder Goddes power and worde by reason and carnall iudgement. For yf all thynges myghte bee vnderstande and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by oure reason, God neded not to shewe foorthe hys worde. But for as muche as he geueth his word, it is a token, that there bee thynges, whiche our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can not conceaue and comprehend. And we learne by experience, that the word of God, is aboue and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste all reason.

in thy fleshe no other fourme, then was before. But I pray thee is absolution and Baptisme therefore of no strength? Thynke not so, but hyghly esteme them, for that they are belongyng to the administration of Goddes kyngedome, and commaunded by his word Wherefore we muste by faythe surely beleue for the wordes sake that thynge that thou shoulde neuer per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaue trewe by thy sence and reason. And this Faith as touchynge the great beneuolence of God towarde hym selfe is surely perswaded, beleuynge that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taketh hym for his sonne, and <hi>CHRIST</hi> for his brother, and that the angelles greately reioyce of his prosperous estate. If it please not the Pope to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue this, what is that to vs? God is shewed to haue respecte vnto theym, that esteeme hys woorde, and thynke it woorthye to bee beleued. And the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliste poynteth an example of suche a Faithe in the blynde. Hee perceyued by reasone noo lykelynesse of the matter, but susteyneth an vncurable euyll. But as soone as the woorde of <hi>CHRIST</hi> soundeth in his eares, Looketh vp, he beleueth it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 18.</note> and the thyng came to passe. This worde was by it selfe pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, before the effect appered.</p>
               <p>For the eyes of the blynde were as yet not open, but forthwith after the word, because it was beleued, folowed the effecte, and then the vnderstandyng of the matter was easye to the blynde. After lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner goeth it wyth the disciples in this place, Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herseth vnto them the hystorie of those thinges that should be done at Hierusalem, and they because they vnderstode them not, toke it for no truth. Not because they suspected anye vayne talke in <hi>CHRISTE,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:168"/>
but they thought that his woorde should haue ben ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken otherwise.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The word of God deceueth not, although it seme impos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sible.</note> And this is the fyrst part of this gospel, euen that we should beleue Christes wordes boldely, and withoute wauerynge. The Pope is ignoraunt of this Faythe. But we must knowe, that this is the Christian fayth, to heare the woorde of God, wherein is promysed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of synne, and by no meanes to doubt of it, but to beleue constantly, and to assent to that promyse, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though neither reason nor sence vnderstandeth or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth any thynge of this matter. And such a fayth and hearte is alwayes requisite to gods worde. This faith whersoeuer it bee fyrste, it is sure afterwarde to take effecte: so that all that obey the worde shall say, they were happie, that they went not frome faith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner of other. But the Pope, the Turkes, and the Iewes shall then curse them selues, for that they were so stubborne agaynst the woorde of God. And then they shall perceiue the pride and foly of their owne reason. But it shall be to late, when all hope of saluation is paste.</p>
               <p>This is therfore the doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we go not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gods word, if reason be offended, no although it seme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason, contrary to iudgement, vain, &amp; vnpossible. But let vs sticke sure to this inuincible argument. If God haue said it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> it is a thyng most certayn: demand not whether it be possible, but whether God hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it? For if God hath spoken, he is so mighty &amp; true of promise, that it may be counted done as soone as it is spoken. Wherfore the word of God is forthwith to bee beleued. Hee that beleueth not, is a blasphemer of God. The first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement requireth suche faithe to Gods word, that God by this meanes myght be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1416:168"/>
and deuoutly glorified of vs. When we beleue consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly that ther is nothing that he speaketh, which commeth not to passe. This worde doth God speake vnto vs euery where, in the lord supper, in baptisme, in absolution, in the gospel. He absolueth vs. Of him we receaue the bodie and bloud of his sonne. This must we beleue constantly, and thynke it to be true, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out all doubtfulnes. This is the firste part of this gospell.</p>
               <p>In the second part, the Euangeliste by the example of the blind teacheth vs the crafte to begge,<note place="margin">Howe we must praye.</note> euen that we shold lay a syde al shame, which is vnprofitable for beggers: and neuer cease from crauyng, but to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. For he that is shamfast, colde and weak hearted is sone dashed out of countenaunce, and is vnapte to be an oratour or spokes ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He must not be ashamed. For god requireth them that make sute vnto hym, to be bold and importunat.

Beggers in this behalfe haue no nede of this precepte. For they are of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord very troublesome vnto men. But God counteth it no trouble or paine, as men do, but taketh it rather for his renoum, to be stirred of vnshamfast beggers to exercise his great liberalitie.

Wherfore we ought to take it for an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to bolden vs, &amp; to come vnto Christ to pray before hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Lord I am a sinner, graunt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy kyngdom may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me vnto me, &amp; forgeue me my dettes. Helpe me in all places. He that praieth earnestly after this sorte, doth wel, &amp; god accep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth it tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kefully.

Suche prayers are of greate force to impel God to heare vs. When we after this maner of necessitie entreat him: lord this is thy glory, &amp; this belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor of thy name, for me to aske of thee. Wherfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider not how vnworthy I am: But how muche nede I haue of thy helpe. For my prayer vnto thee is to thy glory, &amp; also for my necessitie.

               <p>The euangelist beginneth the historie,<note place="margin">Christ lead of the spirit.</note> how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ was ledde into the desert of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit, that is, of the holy ghost. For sith he had no other superiour lord to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande him, he was obedient to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the holy ghost, wherby he was called into the desert. And the euangelist speaketh this not without a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler meaninge, euen willinge therby, that all men should beware of their owne inuentions and imaginations. For Christe came not into desert by his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell &amp; will, to wrastle with the deuil, as manie doth, which institute diuers thinges without the spirit and word. Wheras it is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so to do. For no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must take any thinge vpon hym,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> or go forth as a pilgrime to any place to serue god: except he know for a suretie, that god hath commanded it, eyther by his worde, or by men, whiche hath the power from god to shew vs what God byddeth vs to doe. For they that take any thynge vpon them withoute this vocation, as the monkes and nonnes went to their cloisters, they not only do no seruice to God, but offende also greuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, contrarye to the obedience that they owe to God.</p>

But was commanded so to do by the holye Ghoste: That we folowynge Christe shoulde institute nothinge of our owne witte, so that in all oure doinges we maye boaste, that we take nothynge in hand but to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to obey Gods commandement. This is nowe a doctrine muche vsed of vs, that first in all thinges that we take in hande, we haue respect to gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and do nothynge contrarie therto.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:172"/>
And as touchynge the common workes of charitie &amp; loue, there is no nede of a new commandement. For they are commanded in the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. Ther doth God commande to heare his worde, to loue god and to call vpon him, to obey the parents, not to kyll, to abstaine from fornication. All these are the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, and gods commandementes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought here to inquire for no other commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the holy ghost, that he should put vs forth any other speciall commandements of mariage and suche lyke. The commandement is geuen alredie. But wheras the monkes folowe their traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, kepe their cloisters, faste .xl. dayes, and abstaine from certaine of godly hymnes, as <hi>Gloria in excelsis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Alleluya,</hi> in le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: here haue they no commandement of god, nor worde, to maintaine their doinge or to ground their faith on, without the which all is but synne.

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Math.</hi> 15.</note> and no gods seruice. Nowe let vs consider these temptations in order.</p>
               <p>The fyrst is, when the deuill saieth to Christ, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing hym to be hungrye:<note place="margin">The first te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that he shoulde haue no trust in god</note> if thou be the son of God, speake that these stones may be comme bread. This temptation to sight semeth not to be so sore. For this do we thinke: how should it haue ben preiudiciall to Christ, if he had tourned stones into bread, sith that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he wrought greater miracles? But yet for the temptations sake, he withstandeth the deuyll. For he perceaueth to what ende the deuill tended. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils wil was not so much to prouoke Christ to worke a miracle: But his purpose was only, (as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the wordes of Christ) to take from Christe all trust that he had to the goodnes and mercie of God,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1416:172"/>
and to make hym beleue that God had forgotten hym and cared not for hym, but set so litle by hym, that he wolde not as muche as prouide a litle bread for hym. Wherfore Christ answereth to this saying of the deuil: The matter is not so, as thou woldest make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue to be. For man lyueth not only by bread, but by euery worde that procedeth out of the mouth of God. So that a man may gather this as touching the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the deuill, that he wold that Christ shold thinke of nothinge but of bread, and that he shold beleue that nothing cam from God but bread. This temptation endureth yet to this time, wher as the deuill byddeth vs to reason on this wise: If thou be the sonne of God, god can not be angrye with thee. Therfore seeke thyn aduantage, applie thy selfe wholly to thy gaines, exercise all crafte to get substance, there is no perill in so doinge. Thou canst not synne, thou art the sonne of God. If he would denie the food or clothing, howe shold he do the dutie of god or of a father, which wold haue his mercie and goodnes knowen? By this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son men are enticed to wickednes, as wel in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye as in Cities and townes, so that they geue them selues ouer to couetousnes, and thynke this: that God is not despleased therwith. For it is expedient (thynke they) to get their lyuing. Our house and children must be prouided for. And so the deuill, by this saying (thou art the sonne of God) daseleth their eyes, that they see not their synne. As though he shold say, thou canst not offend, or syn. And ther be many examples herof in the worlde. For no man thinketh it to be an offence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard lightly the worde of God, and to set al theyr care to get bread and other lyuelode. Wherfore this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is alwayes in the worlde, wherin the deuil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faceth
<pb facs="tcp:1416:173"/>
the worde, and driueth men with all his power to set more by their substance and worldly welth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the worde. But now must we consider how this temptation maye be ouercomme. We must after the example of Christe diligentlie marke that crafte of the deuill whiche goeth about to make the to be despised. But contrarie wise, that mynd is so to be stablished, that it maye not for feare of hunger &amp; lacke of liuing, come in danger of losyng gods worde. For one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both must nedes be put in danger, yet it is better that the bodye perish, then to be preserued with this meate, and the soule to perish and to be cast into hell.</p>
               <p>Herby is our saluation confirmed, but yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great conflict and perill. For the deuill withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it with all his force and power, employing all his diligence to make vs only to haue regarde of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life, and not to esteme the worde of God to be necessary or profitable. He hideth also and cloketh this vngodlines with guile, that we are the sonnes of god, and he our father, that wolde not haue vs vnprouided of bread and liuelood. But Christ admonisheth vs by his example to beware of the serpent that lyeth hyd in the grasse. For it is the temptation of the deuill.</p>
               <p>And this temptation is so to be taken and iudged as Christ here appointeth:<note place="margin">Two sortes of bread.</note> mans helth and saluation, is preserued by two sortes of bread. The firste is the worde of God, sent downe from heauen. The second is this corporall bread, whiche commeth of the earth wherby we maintain this present lyfe. When the first whiche is the better, is not lackyng vnto vs, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we suffer it not to be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs: the second, whiche is corporall can not be witholden from vs. But stones shoulde be turned into bread before, that they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1416:173"/>
that truste in gods worde sholde be destitute of bread. And they that regarde not the heauenlye bread, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge onlye respecte to the corporall bread, after that they haue their desyre, and nowe muste die, they are cleane destitute of all other treasure and goods. And yet they can not spend all their selues, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the psalme,<note place="margin">

But we muste be ware of this preposterous maner, wherfore we muste take diligent hede vnto this temptation of the deuill, when he casteth among vs persecution, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurie, famine, and such other miseries. Play the man, and suffer boldlie hunger with Christ when thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauest that thou artmoued by the spirit therto: euen to applie thy vocation. For at the laste thou shalte fele the Angels come to serue thee, and to fulfill thy desyre, as the Euangelist maketh mention that they did by Christ. And this belongeth to the first temptation,<note place="margin">

For when the deuil is not able to make vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spayre and to fall from hope of saluation, he goeth an other way to worke, he proueth the right hand, when he preuayleth not by the lefte, if he can make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ful of false trust, and to presume to muche on gods fauour. This temptation is to brynge hym from the feare of God. The first was to bryng from trust in gods helpe to despayre and flee from god, and that by gods word. In the second he worketh by crafte and gile, to bringe that fayth, wherwith Christe was surely stablished against temptation to presumption and so to put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym the feare and dread of God.

By this authoritie the deuil goeth about to bleare Christes eyes, and to cause hym to forget his vocation and charge and to folowe that, wherof he hath no charge or commandement. For Christe is nowe a man, and in that takyng &amp; case not to do miracles by his godly power, but to sustaine and ouercome those thynges, whiche synners shoulde haue sustayned and ben ouercome without Christe.

All this temptation is set forth not by art of logicke as the other were, but by retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical amplifications and externuations. He sheweth hym the kyngdome of all the worlde with glorie and power, and beautifieth this his greate gyfte, with magnificent wordes, and so he assayeth to ouercome hym with grosse matters when he coulde not by fyne and subtile meanes.<note place="margin">Riches cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> But as for worshippynge hym selfe, and Idolatrie, he maketh a light matter of it.

For there is no redier waye to destroye and peruerte the truth, then to geue the setters foorth therof rule and worldly dominion. The example of the Pope sheweth, what great strength &amp; force this temptation hath, wheras he estemed so greatly the occasion to take the kyngdome vpon him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath euer sythens behaued himselfe as an obedient seruant in all points to the deuil for that.

They muste crepe vp to this kyngdome by the pretence of religion. And this is the very worshipping of the deuil, when religion is pretended, and yet all is done and applied to outward holines and hypocrisie,<note place="margin">Worshippyng of the deuill.</note> &amp; well allowed by reason. And in so doinge they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme two thinges.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet religion. And this is the subtiltie of the deuil in this temptation. He setteth forth the kyngdome of the worlde to be a wayghtie thinge, profferyng it apon a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he may be worshipped, how be it there is no great peril in this temptation. But when he goeth so to worke, that religion hereby may seme beautifull to reason, and worthie of kyngdomes, and all highe renoums and promotions: eyther that through reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion thus transformed, great patrimonies of kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and other thinges maye be retained and kept: now is this a deuyllishe condition of worshipping.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is necessarie to haue redie before oure eyes a description of godly worshipping and holines: That as often as we be moued by the stirringe of the deuil, to thinke that the true religion shold be so fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that it might please reason, or haue the profittes &amp; commodities of wordly thinges ioyned therwith, and not be vexed and troubled with the kyngdome of the deuil: that then we may haue recours to the true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worshippinge.

that is geuen to Gods word? For wher is it counted so holy a thyng to be a maried person, to fynd &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his children, to do houshold busines, to shew obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience &amp; fidelitie therin. As it is to weare this wede or that, not to dwell or lyue as other do, not to eate flesh on friday, to kepe vigils and prescripte fastes, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site saincts relikes. &amp;c. This obseruation of traditions is so beautifull and glistring to sight, that the heads of the world, as emperours and kinges are in loue with them, &amp; highly reuerence them. The Pope by suche ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice inuented by mans traditions, rose to such renome with all his secte, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it might better be called a trym then a true religion.<note place="margin">The popes re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trymme then true.</note> For he should neuer haue rysen to such power by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true seruice of God &amp; pure doctrine of sincere godlynes. But this made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loke vp vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they went aside into an abbey, &amp; forsoke all the world as they say, &amp; applied them selues to Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, laying a side al worldly cares.

But to be brief, this was a diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshe temptation. For this religion came not of Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, neither is this y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true seruice &amp; worship of god, which yet neuertheles is only to be worshipped, &amp; to be serued (as Christ saith here.)

For his word is playne. wherin he commaundeth such thynges to be done. Therfore, whatsoeuer name before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world such offices and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are done to fathers &amp; mothers, to masters of housholdes, to neighbors, to children, and to citeze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they are all counted Gods seruice, because they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Gods word, which saith: Thou shalt loue thy neighbor, and shalt in thy outward works declare the office &amp; dutie of loue vnto him. In that the Pope regardeth not this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, and appointeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peculiar worshippings of god deuised of his own brayn, as the wearyng of coules, the necessary vse of certain meates, oile and fyshe to bee eaten in steade of fleshe and butter, and suche other triflyng traditions: it is altogither diuelyshe.<note place="margin">God ought to be worshyped accordynge to his word, and not after me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s traditions.</note> For they agree not with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God. Yea they make as muche vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true iustice before God, as it doth vnto the buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding of a substancial house, when children make them houses of papers. And this is the reason. There can no worshyp be geuen vnto God, but that only, which is agreable to his worde. Therfore, where the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God is not: we worship not God, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyl and only alone foolyshe fancye. And vnto suche worshippers God saith: Ask thy reward of hym, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou seruest. For I commanded thee to obey thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and the higher powers, and to loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1416:177"/>
it can not so bee. Of these thinges it is euident, that the Pope, and all his, are playne Idolaters and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppers of the deuyll. For he dothe not onely despise the word, but he also persecuteth it: and yet wyl he be counted a good religious man, for these outward wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shyppynges that he hathe deuised in shauen crownes, in coules, in vowes, in fastynges, in meates, in mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syngs, and such lyke. And yet from this wickednes he can by no meanes be brought. The cause is. The diuell hath shewed and promised him the kyngdomes of this worlde. And this is the cause, why he mocketh vs with our doctrine and woorshyppinges of God. For wee mainteynynge the true religion, lyue in pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in hunger, in thyrste, and daily suffer persecution. But the Pope extollethe his woorshyppynges euen vnto the very heauens. For he sucketh out of theym no small profite, lucre, and aduantage. For by this mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes he hath gotten such and so greate richesse, estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, authoritie, rule, and power that he hath brought kynges and Emperoures vnder his subiection. And herof doth it appere how greatly the deuyll hath ouer come the Pope with this tentation. But it is our due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that feare <hi>GOD,</hi> stoutely and manfully to resyst the deuyll when he tempteth vs, and to answere him,<note place="margin">

There is nowe no tyme to dispute of Predestination This woman prayed, and regarded not her gentilitie: What should hynder me, but that I may also pray for suche thyngs as I haue nede of? And of whom shold I aske these thynges but of God alone in heauen for Christes sake his sonne, and my Sauiour? This is an hard &amp; greuous conflict, &amp; meruailous to be found in a Cananite, which was an heathen woman. Now saith the story, that she cried: Oh Lord,<note place="margin">2 Christ answe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth nothing.</note> thou sonne of Dauid haue mercy on me. This is an humble and right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy maner of praying, precedyng from an earnest and feruent faith. For in this her praier she maketh a noble confession of her faith concerning Christ, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mysed Messias and sauior of the world, which should come, being born of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sede of Dauid.

<pb facs="tcp:1416:180"/>
This her crye Christe well heareth, and yet he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not a worde. Thys is an other greuous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For she feleth God to be suche one towarde her, euen as she her selfe is, that is to say, a stranger. For she was an Ethnicke, and vtterly estranged from the common weale of Israel, and therfore pertained there vnto her none inheritance, neither could she claym any fruite of Gods gift and liberalitie. For this cause whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she foloweth Christ, and maketh intercession vnto him he speaketh nothyng at all, as though she pertained no thynge vnto hym. The strongest that are, might haue ben dismayd by these two blocks that were cast in her way. For howe coulde she otherwise then thinke with her self, that what soeuer she had heard of Christ, and of his gentlenes toward all people, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came vnto hym, was nothinge els then mere vanitie and vtterly false. As though she should say: Is this the man, that hathe ben so commended vnto me, that he is mercyfull, and at all tymes ready both to heare and to helpe so many as come vnto hym? But as farre as I see and proue, he heareth whome he wyll heare,<note place="margin">We must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually prayr and not cease<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and when he wyll, and not when we haue nede of his helpe. Yet for all this, the poore woman suffereth not her selfe to falle from all hope, but remayneth styll constant and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast in callyng on Christ, in so muche that the disciples of Christ were euen weary of her continual crying, in so muche that for the dispatche of her, they spake vnto Christ, so that there appered in them a greater clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and a more mercye towarde the woman, then in Christ. Neyther semed they to commende in hym this hardnesse, inhumanitie, and vngentlenes, and therfore thei make intercession vnto Christ for her. Oh Lorde, (say they) Graunt this woman her request, and sende
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1416:180"/>

               <p>This is a notable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to declare, that we ought not to cease from praier, but diligently continue in the same, tyll we haue obteined our desyre. <hi>Taulerus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in a certayne place, that we must sometyme geue ouer prayer. But men ought not so to teache. For the geuyng ouer of prayer commeth soon inough, yea and to soon, euen of it owne accorde. We ought rather to styre vp our affections vnto prayer. And this example testifieth sufficiently, that we ought by no meanes to geue ouer prayer, but to go forthe and continue in the same, and to say with the woman:<note place="margin">Note and practise.</note> It is no time now to dispute whether I be good or badde, worthy or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthye.

Being now thrise most greuously strike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet as a noble warriour, that hath so many tymes ben assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, she cometh more stoutely vnto the battaile.

Therfore is this a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example to consider, wherin we may euidently see, what a great thyng Faith is. For Fayth (euen when <hi>CHRIST</hi> is moste angrye) taketh Christes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vnto the beste, and turneth them vnto her owne commoditie, makyng them of angry woordes, moste comfortable wordes.

I grant I am a dogge:<note place="margin">Faithe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth all thyngs to the best.</note> neither doo I desire to be in better case then dogges are.

               <p>This is a most singular and notable example, sette foorthe vnto vs, to declare, that we ought to be, not waueryng, but constant in Faythe,<note place="margin">

The deuill sought to be reuenged on him therfore moued he the Iewes to crucifie hym, and at the last by death to dispatche hym out of the waye. Yet had neither the deuill nor the Iewes the ouerhand. For Christ ouercame them both.<note place="margin">

For Christ hath not onely driuen the deuyl out of this man (of whom the gospel of this present sondaye maketh mention) but he hath appeared (as S.

For nothing can make voyde the promes of God. Neither
<pb facs="tcp:1416:187"/>
is the holye Ghoste therefore of the lesse power in the worde and in the Sacramentes, althoughe the person be wycked and without the holy ghost, whiche mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth the worde and the Sacramentes, we therfore are most indebtedly bounde to render vnto god most hartie tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckes for this his singuler goodnes towards vs, whiche hath geuen vs suche power and strengthe againste our moste cruell enemy and extreme foe, the deuil, though he buffeteth vs again, it is no merueill. For how can he abyde this, that we miserable sinners should so disquiet hym beinge a proude and myghtie spirite, only with the worde, that he can haue no place to rest in? Therfore he maketh against vs all that euer he can, by raysinge vp in euerye place persecutions and other tentations against vs. But that thyng ought not to seme greuous vnto vs for the hope that wee knowe, that we shall not onely dryue hym oute here, but we shall also at the last daye (as we toforesayde) iudge and condemne hym vnto hell fyre for euermore. These thinges well &amp; diligently considered, we ought to haue in great estimation and honour the worde of GOD and the Sacramentes,<note place="margin">The worde &amp; the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts oughte to be had in greate reuerence.</note> and not so vilelye to thincke or speake of them, as many do commonlye nowe a dayes, and speciallye the wise and prudent of this worlde. The Sacraments (I graunt) are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ceremonies, as the eyes see. The very worde also is an externall thynge, whiche is receaued by the eare, and redde with the eye: As the Christians also are bodely menne. But these thinges are not therefore to be despised. The reason is this. When a Christen man handleth the worde of GOD accordyng to the commandement of Christe, then is that power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent whiche the deuill can not abyde. In that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1416:187"/>
the worde and the Sacramente do outwardlye appeare so homely and base, we ought not to dispise them, but rather geue thanckes vnto GOD, that he hath geuen so greate vertue, power and strengthe to so weake instrumentes. For what are we poore men in respect of the deuill? Therfore if his power were not repressed by Godes power, by his worde, &amp;c. We were not able somuche as one moment of an howre to stand againste hym. But what doth God? he kyndleth that poore litle strawe thorowe his worde that heauenlye fyre,<note place="margin">The worde of god driueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye Satan.</note> that it maketh suche a lyght and brightnes in the worlde, that the deuill knoweth not wheare to abide, so that he must this daye flee from this place, to morowe from another place, and so vtterly at the last be driuen out. In consideration wherof sainct Paule calleth the Gospell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> the power of God, whereby men obtayne euerlastynge saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is to saye, suche a might and strength, as is named the power of God, and restoreth man from synne vnto righteousnes, from death vnto life, from hell vnto heauen, from the deuils regiment vnto the kingdome of God. These things must we Christians learne, and thancke god for them, &amp; highly esteme his holy worde &amp; blessed Sacraments, as our moste pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reliques &amp; iewels. As for the vnfaithful they are not worthye to behold the greate power and maiestie of gods word, according to this saying: <hi>Tollatur impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, ne videat gloriam dei.</hi> Let the vngodly be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he see not the glory of god. And as Esay saide of the Iewes: ye shall heare, and not vnderstand: ye shall see, and not perceyue. We therfore are muche bounde vnto God, that we haue both knowen and felte the greate maiestie and power of his worde.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay.</hi> 6.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:188"/>
And in this behalfe we ought greatly to reioice, that although we be poore and beggerly synners yet we be endowed with suche power, as the deuill is not able to abyde. Thus see we, that this worke amonge the Christians is perpetuall, I meane to caste out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles, to make the dumbe to speake, and the deaffe to heare,<note place="margin">It is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miracle to driue the deuil out of mens heartes, then out of their bodye.</note> althoughe it be not done corporally. For this is a matter of greater wayghte and of more excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to caste the deuill out of mens heartes, and to driue hym out of their bodies. For he sytteth faster in the heart, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the body. But Christ driueth him out corporally also, that we with our eyes maye beholde his power, and the soner beleue, that he will driue him also out of that place, where he muste stedfastly syt, I meane the hearte, yea and that by playne and homely thinges, as by the worde, by baptisme, by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body and bloude &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These singuler gyftes and noble graces hath God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto vs, and therfore ought wee continually to thancke hym, and to vse the same vnto oure comforte againste the deuill, that wee by that meanes maye dryue hym out of oure heartes, and not be dismayde, thoughe he suffer vs to haue no rest in this worlde, but continually heape vpon vs afflictions, troubles, persecutions, hatredes of men, tormentes of tyraunts, and at the laste death. For these thinges shall he be paide home at the last daye, when without anye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne he shall for euer be caste out into hell fyre, there worldes without ende to remayne.

               <p>Nowe followeth it in the gospell, what the worlde

yea it is the worke of the deuill, and done by Nicro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancie: so stockblinde are they, and so hard hearted, that they cannot see the wonderful worke of GOD, but ascribe altogether to the deuill. And this setteth forth their insolent arrogancie and excedynge greate pride, in that they call the prince of the deuilles Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub, which soundeth in our English to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble bee,<note place="margin">Beelzebub what it is in Englishe.</note> or a great flye.

But these good holye folke thincke the more they can despise the deuil, the more shal they make the art of Christ in casting out the deuils to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. What great matter is this, saye they, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the greater flye casteth out the lesser? Thus they blaspheme the worke of Christ, although they haue nothinge to saye againste the truth. But this they consider not that they them selues haue a legion of deuils in them. For they are full of blasphemies, of murders, of lyes, of deceauinges &amp;c. They fulfyll the deuils wyll vnto the vttermoste, in that they thincke that the deuill hath nothing to do with them, and that they are in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of him.

For we haue experience of his power in this wyse: When he hath made any man his captiue &amp; bonde slaue, &amp; hath caste him into errour or heresie, he holdeth him so faste in his clawes, that he very hardly can with infinite sermons be called fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his errours vnto the true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christen religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Thys thyng doth Christ teache vs in this his miracle, in that with fyue loaues he fedeth fyue thousand men besydes women and chyldren, whose numbre perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture was equall with the other. They all were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and yet there remayned muche. In thus doynge Christe setteth not foorthe the bare worde, as he dothe in the syxt Chapter of S. Mathews Gospell, but hee expresseth the same in very acte, and geueth an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therof. As though he should saye: I am ryche, and can easily fede thee. Onely see, that thou behauest thy selfe godly. Folowe the worde of God, and kepe that. As touchyng thy foode, laye the care therof vpon my backe. This is the doctrine of Faith which Christ set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth foorth in this miracle vnto vs. The faithfull only vnderstande it: the vnfaithfull regarde it not, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laugh it to scorne, as they doo all the other myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God.</p>
               <p>But besides this doctrine, there are remaining two thyngs, which the Euangelist doth diligently set forth The first is, that Christ asketh a question of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and they answer what they thinke good.<note place="margin">The cause of incredulitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g liuing.</note> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that he commaundeth to gather vp the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, that nothyng perishe. Nowe as concerninge these .ii. disciples, Philip, and Andrewe: it euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth, what is the cause, that although he prouoketh
<pb facs="tcp:1416:197"/>
vs vnto faythe by this his vnloked for blessyng, yet it can not be founde in vs so true, ryght, and perfect as it ought to bee. For that letteth vs, that was also an impediment to the disciples: I meane, when we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consyder, howe muche wee haue nede of, and haue noo regarde,<note place="margin">Philip.</note> howe muche Christe is able to dooe, wyth his blessynge. Philyppe leaueth to reason and sayeth, that two hundred peny worthe of breade is not sufficient, that euery manne may haue a litle mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell. If a count be here taken of the people, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that summe of money that Philip here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: it semeth to be lytle in dede. For there were not only fyue thousande men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 14.</note> but there were also many women and chyldren, as S. Mathewe saythe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are not numbred. Philyp foloweth the rule of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">Reason is an euyll coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailer in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God.</note> and accordynge vnto that maketh his accompt. Euen so we go to worke. Reason altogether ruleth in vs, and we caste our accomptes, how much we haue nede for our necessary dayly and yerely expences. But when we perceaue that our goodes fayle vs, then are we out of countenance: then fall we to desperation, and thynke verily, that we shall neuer bee able to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyne our selues and our familie.</p>
               <p>And euen thus goeth it with Andrewe also. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauyng the good wyl of Christ toward the pore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Andrewe.</note> wold gladly that they were relieued, &amp; therfore tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Christ what prouision there is, &amp; how that a boye had fiue barley loues and two fishes. But notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng when he remembred what a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany there was of hungry folke, and considred how sclender the prouision was, he counted it nothing at all. What are these (saith he) among so many? Streight wais consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the nomber, he casteth away faith, &amp; thinketh it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1416:197"/>
not possible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such a multitude can be holpen and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with so litle quantitie of bread &amp; fishe. And this is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune fault among vs al, not only when we think of liuing, but also in all our other troubles and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. For we run streight wais for help vnto reson.<note place="margin">Note well.</note> yf reason se no help, then out of hand we fall vnto mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; lamenting, vtterly despairing of confort. But it were much better, if we did cast al our care vpon God &amp; fall to no reasoning about necessary thinges. For by this meanes there shold be but one inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie when any miserie shold chance. where as now thorowe our care it is doubled, and yet nothynge amended.

Examples in this behalfe want not. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seyng that reason can no otherwise do, but bee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied about those thynges that we haue nede of, and shewe her selfe carefull about necessaries, as thoughe our whole wealthe depended of her carefulnesse and deuise, whiche is directly against faithe: The Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist wold not let passe this thing vnremembred, that by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the disciples we may learne, how leude and wicked such toyes of reason are, namely in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, whiche oughte onely to depend on Christe and his worde. After the rule of reason Philippe and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe iudged truely: neither is it possible,<note place="margin">The worde of God, and not reason is to be considered.</note> that a man onely ledde with reason can otherwyse thinke, or haue any better Iudgement. But we Christians may not looke vppon Reason, but vppon the woord of God. Therfore we ought not so subtilly to reason, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly &amp; stedfastly to beleue: &amp; where reason faileth, there to lean vnto the worde of god &amp; faith, &amp; diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, what a noble and faithful steward Christ
<pb facs="tcp:1416:198"/>
is to the Christianes. We can geue no more then wee haue. But Iohn saith here of Christe: He gaue of the loaues and fyshes, not so muche as was at hand, but so muche as he would. Neyther is it to be thoughte, that he dyd this only but ones, and that he from hens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth wyll doo no more so among his.<note place="margin">God is at all tymes bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall.</note> For, as I sayde before, his examples and miracles are publyshed and sette abrode at all tymes, not onely concernyng foode when <hi>GOD</hi> respecteth and healpeth them that are nedye and without comforte, but also in all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities and miseries.

               <p>This consolation and confort ought we diligently to consyder, and onely (as Christ sayth) respecte thys, that fyrste of all we seeke the kyngdome of God, and the rightuousnes therof.<note place="margin">

For so soone as <hi>CHRIST</hi> toke the bread into his handes, and added therto his blessyng, it was streight wayes perceaued, how it was multiplied and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1416:198"/>
The fyshes also when Christe distributed theym, and commaunded them to be delyuered to the people were encreased meruailous greatly.</p>
               <p>Thus woulde Christ haue vs bothe to perceaue, and to beleue, that we by this meanes myghte attribute more to the secrete and inuisible richesse of God, then to our present reason and store.<note place="margin">The miseries of thys our tyme.</note>

This is suche an horrible wyckednes and greuous synne, that it maketh any Christen heart to tremble and to shake for feare, seinge that da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mnation hangeth vpon it, as Christ sayeth: he that heareth not the worde of God, is not of god, but he is the sonne of the deuill: namely when they are so frowarde and wicked,<note place="margin">

This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very deuil, that chalengeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym the honour of God, desiereth to be counted holy, and by no meanes suffreth to be reproued.

But this is not so to be vnderstande, as thoughe the deuill had made them, and geuen them their mouth, eyes,<note place="margin">What it is to be of the deuill</note> reason and so forth. Nay all suche thinges are of Godes creation and gyfte. Therfore muste a man make a difference betwene the thinge and the vse thereof. That man whiche lyeth and deceaueth, had a good tonge geuen hym of God, but the abuse of the tonge is of the deuill, because he geueth his

In lyke maner when the hearte thincketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane and cruel thinges: the very hearte it selfe of the owne nature is not euil, and is of god, but the euil vse thereof is of the deuill.

For they are put vnto that vse,<note place="margin">What it is to be of God.</note> for the which god made them. So in like maner, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart thincketh honest, pure, chaste, &amp; godly things, as howe our neighbour maye be edifyed, and not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, howe Godes glorie may be set forth and not hyndred: suche an hearte is the creature of God, as the eares and the tonge lykewise are, and doth right wel please god<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But they are therefore named to be of god, because they wolde not, that these their me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres shold thincke, speake, and heare anye thing, that shoulde be againste God.

Therfore as God is a lyuing god, so lykewise is he the very lyfe of all them, that are of hym, and heare his worde. This doth Christ confirme here with this his notable saying, worthy for euer to be remembred:<note place="margin">The worde of god deliuereth from drath.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely verely, I saye vnto you, if any man will kepe my worde he shall neuer see death.

Yea if it were possible, they wolde leape thorow a thousand fyres to escape death. But so shall not they do, sayth Christe, that be my disciples, that heare my worde and kepe it.

When suche are at the point to dye, they can fynde neyther helpe nor councel. And what remayneth there for all suche, then lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, feare, tremblyng, horroure, yollyng out, roring, yea desperation and damnation? Therfore this is the principal point of doctrine contayned in the Gospell of this present sonday, that we diligentlye embrace the worde, gladly heare it, and faithfully beleue it. If ye do this, then shall ye ouercome synne, deuyll, death, hel, &amp;c. And althoughe death shall take you out of this lyfe, yet shal ye fele no payne of hym, but it shalbe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you as a moste swete and pleasaunt slepe. For the worde of God is suche a conforte and present helpe, that it bringeth vnto vs a quiet lyfe, a mery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, &amp; euerlastyng saluation. As for the vngodly and suche as despyse the worde of God, there can no more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief be wyshed vnto them, then they suffer all redy. For seing they heare not the worde of God, they are not of God. As an vnruly childe, whiche despyseth the commandement of God, careth not for his parentes. What can be spoken more vnto his reproche, then that he is the sonne of the deuill, and not of God? This is not lightly to be regarded, or to be set naught by. For it were better to be the bonde slaue of the Turke, or of any other most barbarous and cruell tyraunt, then to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1416:208"/>
to be the captiue and bondslaue of the deuyll, which is an accuser, a calumniatour, a picker of quarels, a mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derer, and seketh all means possible to cast vs into vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter destruction. Take hede of this mischiefe, and dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently consider with your selfs, in what gret reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and estimation ye ought to haue the woorde of God. For there is none other reskue, help, or remedy against euerlasting death, deuyl, sinne, hell. &amp;c. then to hold fast the word of Christ, that is to say, to beleue his promise and thorow faith in his worde to haue a sure hope of euerlastyng saluation. For when Christ saith:<note place="margin">Of what word Christe speaketh.</note> He that wyll kepe my woorde, shall neuer see deathe. He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not the lawe that God gaue to the Iewes by Moyses. Whiche lawe although it bee a trewe, holy, and profitable doctrine,<note place="margin">The lawe of Moyses.</note> yet seyng we because of our vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious and corrupt nature can not obey that doctrine, it is become vnto vs the ministerie of deathe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies reproueth, accuseth, and condemneth our sinne before God. Therfore haue we nede of an other word that we may be delyuered from synne, and be iustified before God. And that nowe is the woorde of Christe where he sayth: He that beleueth in me,<note place="margin">The lawe of the Gospell.</note> shall neuer se deathe. This worde muste be apprehended and layde hande on with a strong faithe, so that we may by no means doubt, but that it is true, which Christ promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. For he that refuseth the worde, and taketh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of his owne deuise, he shal fynd death and not life. Therfore in the agony of death, not according to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we fancie, but according to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which we heare in the word must we iudge and saie. I see that I must die, but I heare the promise and word of Christ my Lorde, that thorow hym I shall haue life. For as touchyng sinne, for the whiche I must nedes suffer death, it is vtterly
<pb facs="tcp:1416:209"/>
taken awaye by hym,<note place="margin">Synne is the cause of death</note> so that God for his deathe and resurrection, wyll be mercyfull vnto me, and geue me euerlastynge lyfe. This is truely to kepe the woord of Christe. But it is an harde thyng to haue this faythe. For fleshe and blood can not otherwise bee persuaded then as they fele and proue. Against this peruers and froward reason must we striue, and aske of God hys holy spirite, that he may stablishe our hearts throughe the worde,<note place="margin">Faithe is the gyft of God.</note> that they may retaine and keepe the true Faith. What the cause is, why the worde of Christ is of so great efficacie, myghte, and power, Christe hym selfe sheweth in the ende of this Gospell: And in thys poynt he so greatly moueth the Iewes, and stirreth them vnto anger, that they are ready to stone hym vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deathe. For this troubled the Iewes, that Christe said, his worde preserueth and defendeth from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng death, forasmuche as they sawe, that Abraham Moyses, and other holy men, which be greately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the holy scripture, wer dead. They thought that Christ was muche inferiour to them, and that it was a matter worthy to be laughed at, that he should so muche bragge, boast, and sette out his worde. But Christ answered: Abraham desired to see my daye, he sawe it and reioyced, that is to say: If Abraham had not kept my word, he had dyed euerlastyngly, and ben damned for euer. Before Abraham was, saith Christ, I am. And that is thus muche to say: I am almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and euerlasting God.<note place="margin">Christ God &amp; man onely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

This could neither Moses nor any of the Prophets speke truly of them selues. For they were all men. But Christ is god
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1416:209"/>
and man. Therfore is he able to geue life &amp; euerlasting saluation, &amp; none but he alone. This is a great consort and a most sure confirmation of our faithe, where we confesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ is true &amp; euerlasting God, as we haue the like testimonies of this thing in many &amp; diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of the Euangelical history, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our whole trust shold be in hym, &amp; in his word, &amp; in none other.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND it came to passe, when Iesus hadde finished all these sayinges, he sayd vnto his Disciples: Ye knowe that after two dayes shalbe Easter and the sonne of man shall bee delyuered ouer to be crucified. Then assembled together the chief Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes and the Scribes and the elders of the people, vnto the Palace of the high Priest (whiche was called Caiphae) and healde a Counsell, that they myght take Iesus by subtiltie and kill hym. But they said: not on the holy day, lest there be an vprore amonge the people. When Iesus was in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanie in the house of Symon the Leapor, there came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym a woman, hauynge an Alabaster boxe of precious

oyntment and powred it on his head as he sat at the boorde. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saying: Wherto serueth this wast? This oyntment might haue ben well sold, and geuen to the poore. When Iesus vnderstode that, he sayd vnto them: Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wroughte a good woorke vppon me. For ye haue the poore alwayes with you, but me ye shall not haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. And in that she hath caste this oyntment on my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, she did it to bury me. Ueryly I say vnto you: Wher so euer this Gospell shalbe preached in all the worlde, there shall also this be tolde that she hath done, for a memoriall of her. Then one of the twelue (whiche was called Iudas Iscarioth) wente vnto the chefe Priestes, and sayde vnto them? What wyll ye geue me, and I wyll delyuer hym vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you? And they appointed vnto hym .xxx. pieces of syluer. And from that tyme foorth he sought oportunitie to betraye hym. The first daye of sweete bread, the disciples came to Iesus, saying to him: Where wylt thou that we prepare for thee to eate the Passeouer? And he sayde: Goo into the Citie to suche a man, and say vnto hym: The master saith, my tyme is at hande, I wyll kepe my Easter by thee with my disciples. And the disciples dyd as Iesus hadde appoyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted them, and they made redy the Passeouer. When the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen was come, he sat downe with the twelue. And as they dyd eate, he sayde: Ueryly I saye vnto you, that one of you shall betray me. And they were exceadynge sorowfull, and beganne euery one of them to saye vnto hym: Lorde is it I? He aunswered and sayd, he that dyppeth his hande with me in the dyshe, the same shall betraye me. The sonne of man truely goeth as it is writen of hym: but wo vnto that man by whom the sonne of man is betrayed it hadde bene good for that man yf he had not bene borne. Then Iudas, whiche betrayed hym, aunswered and sayde: Master, is it

I? He sayd vnto him: thou hast sayde. And when they were eating, Iesus toke bread, and when he had geuen thanks, he brake it, &amp; gaue it to the disciples, and said: Take, eate, this is my body And he toke the cup &amp; thanked, &amp; gaue it to them saying: Drynk ye all of this, for this is my bloud (whiche is of the new Testament) that is shed for many, for the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes. But I say vnto you, I will not drinke hense forth of this fruite of the vine tree, vntyll that daye when I shall drinke it newe with you in my fathers kyngdom. And when they had sayde grace, they went out vnto mount Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uete. Then saide Iesus vnto them: All ye shalbe offended because of me this night. For it is writtene: I wyll smyte the shepherd, &amp; the shepe of the flock shalbe scattered abrode: but after I am risen again, I wil go before you into Galile, Peter answered and saide vnto hym: Thoughe all men be offended because of thee, yet wyll I not be offended. Iesus saide vnto hym: Uerily I saye vnto thee, that in this same night, befor the Cocke crowe, thou shalte denye me thryse. Peter saide vnto hym, yea though I shoulde dye with thee, yet wyll I not denye thee, lykewyse also sayde all the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Thenne came Iesus with theym vnto a farme place (whiche is called <hi>Gethsemane</hi>) and sayde vnto the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Sytte ye here whyle I go and praye yonder. And he tooke with hym Peter, and the two sonnes of Zebede, and beganne to waxe sorowfull and heauye. Then saide Iesus vnto them: My soule is heauye euen vnto the deathe. Tary ye heare, and watche with me. And he wente a littell far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and felle flatte on his face, and praied, sayinge: O my father, if it be possible, let this cuppe passe from me: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, not as I will, but as thou wilte. And he came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Disciples, and founde them a slepe, and sayde vnto Peter: What, coulde ye not watche with me one houre?
<pb facs="tcp:1416:211"/>
Watche and praye that ye enter not into temptation. The spirite is willyng, but the fleshe is weake. He wente awaye ones again &amp; praied saying: O my father, if this cup may not passe away from me, except I drinke of it, thy wyl be fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And he came and found them a sleepe agayne, for theyr eyes were heauye. And he left them, and wente agayne and prayed the thirde tyme, saying the same wordes. Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methe he to his disciples, and sayde vnto them: Sleepe on nowe and take your rest. Behold the houre is at hande, and the sonne of man is be trayede into the handes of sinners. Ryse, let vs be goyng, beholde he is at hande that doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me. Whyle he yet spake, loe Iudas one of the number of the twelue came, and with hym a greate multitude with swordes and staues, sent from the chief Priests and elders of the people. But he that betrayed hym, gaue them a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, saying: Who soeuer I kysse, the same is he, holde hym faste. And forthe with he came to Iesus and sayde: Hayle Maister, and kyssed hym. And Iesus sayd vnto hym: Frend wherfore art thou come? Then came they and layde handes on Iesus, and toke hym. And beholde, one of them whiche were with Iesus, stretchede out his hande and drewe his sworde, and stroke a saruaunt of the hye Priestes, and smote of his eare. Then saide Iesus vnto hym: Put vp thy sword into the sheathe, for all they that take the sworde, shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysh with the sword. Thinkest thou that I can not now pray to my father, and he shall geue me euene nowe more then twelue legions of Angels? But how then shall the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be fulfylled? For thus muste it be. In the same houre sayde Iesus to the multitude: Ye be come out as it were to a thiefe with swordes and staues for to take me. I sat dayly with you teachyng in the Temple, and ye toke me not. But all this is done that the Scriptures of the Prophetes myght be fulfylled. Then all the Disciples forsoke him and fled. And they toke Iesus and led him to Caiphas the hye priest,

where the Scribes and the Elders wer assembled. But Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter folowed him afarre of vnto the hie priests palace, &amp; went in, and sat with the seruants to se the end. The chief priests and Elders, and all the counsel sought false witnes against Iesus) for to put hym to death) but founde none, yea when many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two fals witnesses, and sayd: This felowe said, I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to buyld it agayn in thre daies. And the chief priest arose, and said vnto him: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerest thou nothing? Why doo these beare witnes against thee? But Iesus held his peace. And the chief Priest answe, red and said vnto hym: I charge thee by the liuynge God, that thou tell vs whether thou be Christ the sonne of God? Iesus said vnto hym, Thou hast said. Neuerthelesse I saye vnto you, herafter shal ye se the sonne of man sytting on the right hande of power, and commynge in the cloudes of the skye. Then the hye Priest rent his clothes, saying: He hath spoken blasphemye, what nede we of any more wytnesses? Behold nowe ye haue heard his blasphemie, what thynke ye? They aunswered and sayde: Hee is woorthye to dye. Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted hym with fistes. And other smote hym on the face with the palme of their handes, saying: Tell vs thou Christ, who is he that smote thee? Peter sate without in the Court, and a damosel came to hym, sayinge: Thou also wast wyth Iesus of Galilee. But hee denyed before them all, saying: I wote not what thou sayest.

<pb facs="tcp:1416:212"/>
for thy speeche bewrayeth thee. Then beganne he to curse and to sweare that he knewe not the man. And immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the Cocke crewe, and Peter remembred the woorde of Iesu, whiche sayd vnto hym: Before the Cocke crowe, thou shalt denye me thryse: and he wente out, and wept bytterly. When the mornyng was come, all the chiefe Priestes and Elders of the people healde a Councelle agaynste Iesus, to put him to death, and broughte him bounde, and deliuered him vnto Pontius Pilate the deputie. Then Iudas (whiche hadde betraied him, seing that he was condemned, repented hym selfe and broughte againe the .xxx. plates of siluer to the chiefe Priestes and Elders, sayinge: I haue synned, betrayinge the Innocent bloode. And they saide: What is that to vs? See thou to that. And he caste downe the syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer plates in the Temple, and departed, and wente and hanged hymselfe. And the chiefe Priestes tooke the siluer plates and saide: It is not lawfull for to put them into the treasure, because it is the price of bloode. And they tooke counsel, and bought with them a potters field to bury stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in. Wherefore the fielde is called <hi>Acheldema,</hi> that is the fielde of bloud, vntill this day. Then was fulfilled that whiche was spoken by Hieremye the Prophete, sayinge: And they toke .xxx. siluer plates, the price of him that was valued, whome they boughte of the children of Israell, and gaue them for the Potters fielde, as the Lorde appoynted me. Iesus stode before the Deputie, and the deputie asked him, sayinge: Art thou the kinge of the Iewes? Iesus said vnto hym: Thou sayest. And when hee was accused of the chiefe Priestes and Elders, he aunswered nothinge. Then saide Pylate vnto hym: Hearest thou not howe many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses they laye against thee? and he aunswered him to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a worde, in somuche that the Deputie meruailed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1416:212"/>
At that feast, the Deputie was wont to deliuer vnto the people a prisoner, whom they would desire. He had then a notable prisoner called Barrabas. Therefore when they were gathered together, Pylate sayde: Whether wyll ye that I geue lose vnto you Barrabas, or Iesus whiche is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Christ? For he knew that for enuy thei had deliuered him When he was set downe to geue iudgement, his wife sent vnto him, saying: haue thou nothing to do with that iust ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for I haue suffred this day many things in my slepe because of him. But the chief Priests &amp; Elders persuaded the people that they should aske Barrabas, and destroy Iesus. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie answered and said vnto them: Whether of the twaine wil ye that I let lose vnto you? They said Barrabas. Pilate said vnto them: what shall I do then with Iesus, that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Christ? They all said vnto him: let him be crucified. The deputie said: What euil hath he done? But they cried more, saying: Let him be crucified. When Pilate saw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he coulde preuaile nothing, but that more busynes was made, he toke water, and washed his handes before the people, saying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iust person, se ye. Then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered all the people, and said: His bloud be on vs, &amp; on our childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then let he Barrabas loose vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and scourged Iesus, and deliuered him to be crucified Then the souldiors of the deputie toke Iesus into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon hal, and gathered vnto him all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, and they stripped him, and put on him a purple robe, and platted a crowne of thornes, and put it vpon his head, and a reed in his right hande, and bowed the knee before hym, and mocked hym, sayinge: Haile kyng of the Iewes, And whenne they hadde spytte vppon him, they tooke the reede, and smote hym on the head. And after that they hadde mocked hym, they tooke the roabe of hym agayne, and putte hys owne rayemente on hym, and ledde
<pb facs="tcp:1416:213"/>
hym away to crucify hym. And as they cam out, they found a manne of Cyrene (named Symon) hym they compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to beare hys Crosse. And they camme vnto the place, whyche is called <hi>Golgotha</hi> (That is to say, a place of dead mennes skulles) and gaue hym vineger myngled with gaulle to drynke. And whenne he hadde tasted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he woulde not drynke. Whenne they hadde crucifyed hym, they parted hys garmentes, and dydde caste lottes that it myghte bee fulfylled, whyche was spoken by the Prophete: They parted my garmentes amonge theym. and vppon my vesture dydde they caste lottes. And they satte and wacched hym there, and sette vp ouer hys head the cause of his deathe written: Thys is Iesus kynge of the Iewes. Then were the twoo theeues crucifyed wyth hym, one on the ryghte hande, and an other on the lefte. They that passed by, reuyled hym, waggynge theyr hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and sayinge: Thou that destroyedst the Temple of God, and dyddest buylde it in three dayes, saue thy selfe. If thou bee the sonne of GOD, come downe frome the Crosse. Lykewyse also the hye Priestes mockynge hym wyth the Scrybes and Elders, sayde: He saued other, hym selfe he can not saue. If he bee the Kynge of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, lette hym nowe comme downe from the Crosse, and we wyll beleue hym. Hee trusted in God, lette hym de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer hym nowe yf he wyll haue hym. For hee sayde: I am the sonne of GOD. The thieues also, whych were crucified with hym, caste the same in hys teethe. Frome the sixthe hower was there darkenesse ouer all the land, vntyll the nynthe hower. And aboute the nynthe hower, Iesus cryed wyth a lowde voyce, sayinge: <hi>Ely, Ely, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masabathany,</hi> That is to saye: My God, my God, why haste thou forsaken me? Some of them that stode there,

And streyghte waye one of them ronne and toke a spunge, and whenne he hadde fylled it full of vineger, hee putte it on a reede, and gaue hym to drynke. Other sayde, Lette bee, lette vs see, whether Helias wylle come and delyuer hym. Iesus whenne hee hadde cryed agayne wyth a lowde voyce, yealded vp the ghoste. And beholde, the vayle of the Temple dydde rent in two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, frome the toppe to the bottome, and the earthe dydde quake, and the stones rente, and graues dydde open, and manye bodyes of Sainctes whiche slepte, arose and wente out of the graues after hys Resurrection, and came into the holye Citie, and appered vnto many.

But Satan with his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, the Scribes and Phariseyes sought an other thyng, euen to slea Christe, to bringe Christ to shame, and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to roote hym out of remembraunce, both hym and his doctrine, that there might be no more mention made of hym. And so the wicked Iewes thorow their enuie, their blinded heart, and their vngracious cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel executed contrary to theyr wyll and deuice, the decree

and determination of the heauenly father, wherby tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the mercie of (Christ dying for them) health and saluation chaunced to so many as beleue. Yea the vu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlye Iewes worthelye blynded, were deceaued of their purpose, and aduaunced Christ (whome they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined vtterly to destroye) vnto glorie, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: The Lorde bringeth the councell of the heathen to naughte,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.</note> and maketh the deuices of the people to be of none effect. But the councell of the Lorde shall endure for euer, and the thoughtes of his hearte from generation to generation.</p>
               <p>When we earnestlye consider these causes, then shall we see, how miserable and damnable synners we are, verely euen suche, as coulde none otherwise be saued, but only by Christe, so that for vs and for our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he muste neees dye, yea and that the most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious and spitefull death of the crosse. Again, we shall see the moste brenninge heart and incomparable fyre of the loue of our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father and of his sonne Christ, which hauing no regard to our synnes, nor yet that we were his enemies, died for vs, that we shold not perishe in our synnes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we see, how faithfull and true god is,<note place="margin">God perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth what so euer he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth.</note> and that all his wordes and promises will take place and procede against all the violence, force, power, strength, crafte and suttiltie of the deuill and the worlde, and that heauen and earthe shall sonner fall, perishe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me to naughte, then one iote or title of gods worde shalbe founde vntrue and false. By the first we learne of the lawe,<note place="margin">Synne hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous in the sighte of God.</note> howe greate and horrible a thynge synne is before the eyes of Gods maiestie, for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing wherof, the onely and innocent sonne of God must be scourged, and dye so bytter, ignominious and
<pb facs="tcp:1416:218"/>
spiteful death, yea and that onely to take awaye other mennes synnes. By the second we learne the Gospell and the louing, gentle, and mercifull hearte of GOD toward vs, whiche for vs &amp; for our saluation sent his only begotten sonne that incomparable treasure into this world, and suffred him to be nayled on the crosse. By the third we learne assuredly to truste and beleue the promise of God, and not to feare the vngodly and wicked persecutours, forasmuche as we see, that he hath so faithfully and so abundantly performed by his sonne all that euer he promised. Again, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and brought to shame the deuill and all his children of this worlde, and hath made frustrate and voyde all their deuices, councels and imaginations, in so muche that where as they thought with this their worke vtterly to kyl, confounde and extinguish Christ, they haue moste of all aduaunced Christe vnto his great honour and glorie, and by this meanes brought to passe, that all the faithfull shall receaue saluation by this crucified Christe. For howe could Satan and the stifnecked Phariseyes thincke, that Christ by death vnto life, by buriall vnto resurrection, by ignominie and contempt vnto glorie and honoure, shoulde be brought, and made king and ruler ouer all creatures both in heauen and in earth? But mightie is the lorde our God to performe his promise, and to confounde the worlde with his God the deuill, as he both doth and shall do euen vnto the very ende of the worlde. But now followeth the third thing,<note place="margin">Of Christes Paynes both Inwardlye &amp; outwardly.</note> which we ought to consider about the passion of Christ. This is howe great paine and affliction Christe suffered inwardly &amp; outwardly. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> externall passion &amp; outward suffring we haue abundantly in the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelical history, where
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1416:218"/>
we rede, how he was taken, be spitted, whypped, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, crowned with thornes, and at the last crucifyed &amp; put to death. Of the inwarde passion and suffrynge, that he had in his hearte and conscience, when he must striue with death, which was before his eyes, hell and deuill, Luke writeth in his gospell on this maner:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.</note> he was in an agonie, and prayed the longer, &amp; his sweat was lyke droppes of blood, tricklynge downe to the grounde. Of the whiche wordes the excedyng greate horror and torment, whiche Christ suffered in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, may be estemed and iudged, and how horrible the sight of death, of sinne, which he toke on him, of hel and deuil was before hym, seing that his sweate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to al reason of nature was bluddye, and so came from hym: Againe, in that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortour &amp; creatour of all the worlde was cast into such necessitie &amp; feare, that his father sent an Angel vnto him for to conforte him, as Luke in the aforesaid place doth also testifye. That stryffe of death is fearefull beyond all measure, and taketh awaye all strength of nature, as we see in condemned persons, whiche are sodenlye taken to be put vnto death. What a meruelous torment &amp; anger appeareth there in them, til nature hath made her selfe captiue to death, so that the payne and death it selfe may iustly seme to be nothyng in comparison of that great agonie, trouble and feare? How excedyng greate &amp; vnmeasurable it was in Christe, his bloudy sweate that came from him doth manifestly declare, whiche thing was neuer done nor hearde of any other. This calamitie and fearefulnes was afterwarde wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully encreased, when he hanging vpon the crosse was forsaken of all his disciples &amp; frendes: again, mocked, scorne and spitefully rayled on of his enemyes, in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
<pb facs="tcp:1416:219"/>
that he being in suche an agonie, cried out vnto his heauenly father, sayinge: O my god, O my God, why hast thou forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me? wherof we may rede more at large in the xxij. Psalme of Dauid. In the whiche psalme the Prophete hath exactly painted &amp; set forth the bytter complaintes and the afflicted conscience of Christe miserable and forsaken:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psalm.</hi> 22.</note> where also thou shalt fynde in what angore and affliction he was for our synnes. And here let vs lerne (as we sayde before) the highe hatred, greate displeasure, and extreme wrathe, that God beareth against synne, in so muche that because of that he woulde not spare his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and dearely beloued son, nor yet forgeue him, seinge he toke vpon him the cause of other mens sins, as we may see in the Prophete Esaye. And S. Paule sayeth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esa.</hi> 53. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> He spared not his onely begotten sonne. This signified Christ also, when he spake to the women on this wise: If they do this in a moyste tree, what shall be done in a seare &amp; drie tree? As though he should say: Learne of me,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.</note> whiche beare other mens syns, and in my selfe am innocent, righteous and holy, what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishmentes ye haue deserued, and what shall chaunce vnto you, which by nature are synners and wycked, &amp; can do nothing that good is. Therfore Christ war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the women to wepe vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, which with their sinnes had deserued that payne and punishment, that he nowe must suffer. In consideration wherof s. Peter sayth:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.</note> If the righteous shall scaslye be saued, where shall the sinner &amp; the vngodly appeare? for God hath here plainly and euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly set forth before our eyes in Christ his anger, wrath &amp; displeasure against sinne, seinge that he suffred the highe goodnes, innocencie, wisedome iustice, euen his onely begotten sonne to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1416:219"/>
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me because thereof into extreme pouertie, paine, contempt, &amp; ignominie, as though he were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest enemie that god hath, &amp; suche one as is not worthy to liue on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. yea god did so shew him self toward him, as thoughe he had geuen him ouer for euer &amp; euer &amp; wold neuer after be reconciled vnto him, as Christe miserablye complaineth in the xxij. psalme. And al this came to passe for other mens sinnes, whiche Christe tooke vpon him. O how horribly shal god auenge sins in them, that naturally are prone and bent vnto sinne,<note place="margin">Synners.</note> and cane none otherwise then sinne and do wickedly seing he declared this so seuerely in his sonne, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithstanding he had a singuler delight and great pleasure?

                     <hi>Math.</hi> 3.17.</note> whiche confesse not their sinnes, yea whiche wilbe counted holye and righteous, and wyl by no meanes receaue Christe to be their sufficient Sauiour and perfecte redemer to purge and put away their sinnes,<note place="margin">Hippocrites.</note> but will rather cleaue to their owne righteousnes, to their owne workes, and to the merites an intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of other? Therfore let all true and faithfull Christians diligently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider this matter, and with all study and labour beware of sinne and of the wrath of god, seing it coste the sonne of God the price of his lyfe, seinge also that for the aduoydinge of the same he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to suffer most greuous payne, greate &amp; bytter sorowe, and at the laste the moste ignominious and shamefull death of the crosse, that by this meanes he mighte apeace the wrath of GOD kyndled againste man for synne, delyuer man from synne, reconcile man to his heauenly father, and make him enheritour of euerlasting glorie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly let vs consider the fruites and profites
<pb facs="tcp:1416:220"/>
of the passion and death of Christ. For this is our ioye and comforte,<note place="margin">The fruites of Christes passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; death.</note> verely as they be greate, so are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and innumerable, if they were diligently and at large wayghed, pondered, and considered, for Christe is that true wheat corne,<note place="margin">

Nowe for as muche as <hi>CHRIST</hi> was in all poyntes pure and innocente, and vtterly wythout all synne: Deathe, and hell coulde by no meanes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome hym:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> For seynge that death is the rewarde of synne, as the Apostle saythe: and Christe hadde no synne at all: so doothe it ryghte well followe, that death had no power ouer Christ, and that it assaulted hym wythoute cause, and therfore deathe loste hys ryghte, because wythoute cause hee abused Christe beynge innocente and free frome all synne. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencye therefore of Christe was the cause, that deathe and hell (they onely haue power ouer synners. For,<note place="margin">

Whiche is none other thyng then yf he should saye: I am <hi>GOD,</hi> and the Lord both of death and of lyfe, &amp; I handle them, as I my selfe lyste. Therefore Saint Paule in hys Epistle to the Romaines writeth, that by thys he was declared to bee the Sonne of GOD,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> whenne he rose agayne frome deathe. For no manne can escape deathe, as Dauid saythe: What manne is he that shall lyue,<note place="margin">

And Saincte Paule to the Hebrues sayeth: That all menne muste needes ones dye, and after that commeth the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Seyng then that Christe was not onely man, but also very GOD, the Creator and lyfe geuer of all creatures,<note place="margin">

               <p>Thus sewe that the Apostlike regiment is an auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and power, not ouer politique, ciuile and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters, or ouer suche synnes alone, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> world accuseth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth, iudgeth, and punisheth but ouer all those synnes, whiche thou in thy conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and god in his righteousnes count to be sinnes, so that by thys meanes the syns of the whole worlde are subiect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles &amp; to all the ministers of the church: yea, when time requireth, to all Christians, so that thou maist cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenly persuade thy selfe, when thou hearest of thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour, or in his absence of any other Christian, that thy sinnes are forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee in the name of Christ, that that is so true, iuste, and certen, and is also of no lesse po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as though Christ himself had spoken it, or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from heauen had declared it vnto thee at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Christ.

is a wonderfull and incredible power, that wretched man whiche is a synner also, should dryue the deuyll out with his power, whom otherwise the hole worlde coulde not expell and driue out. For so sayth Christ: what soeuer ye losen in earth,<note place="margin">

And as it is rehersed in this our gospell: as my father sent me: so lykewise do I send you. These wordes are so plaine and euident, that no man ought to doubte of them, but as he heareth the wordes of re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mission of sinnes pronounced vnto hym, so lykewise shall he receaue and enioye it. And this is the cause that we admonishe you so often, seinge Christe hath geuen suche and so great power to his churche, that ye shoulde vse the same, and by no meanes despise it. For vnto this ende hath Christ ordeined this ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that on this wise the synnes of the worlde shoulde be forgeuen and taken awaye, so that they be sinnes in dede, and with a repentaunt fayth, and faithful repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce knowledged and confessed. For as for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite and forged synnes, they pertayne nothynge vnto this matter. They must be sinnes in dede, which trouble, vexe and disquiet the heart, as Adam in the fyrste booke of Moyses preached and sayd to his son Cain:<note place="margin">

For thy synne lieth &amp; lurketh
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1416:238"/>
not vnto this ende, that it shoulde for euer rest and be kepte secrete, but that it should comme to light, that it may torment, trouble vexe, and byte thee so that thou shalt not know what to do, nor whether to turne thee.</p>
               <p>They therfore that are not moued with their sins, haue notwithstandinge synnes in dede, but yet suche as are not venial, remissible or able to be forgeuen, and therefore are their sinnes retained, holden, and bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. For they haue no luste nor desyre to be forgeuen, for if they had, they would repent and leaue to synne.</p>
               <p>This was the doctrine of the Papistes, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer wold haue remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their sinnes they should firste of all confesse all theyr synnes to the priest,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the papistes concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of syn.</note> be contrite and sorie for them, and receaue penaunce at the priestes hande, and so afterward folowed the abso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lution &amp; remission of synnes, and by this meanes was the forgeuenes of sinnes afterwarde grounded in that contrition.

This is right, and ought so to be.

We in this behalfe differ nothynge from the Turkes and Iewes, whiche also beleue that they shalbe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, although they haue not <hi>CHRIST,</hi> but the Pope is worser the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Turke or Iewe, for to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne his wickednes and abhomination, his false and corrupt doctrine, he without all shame abuseth the name of Christ. Therfore let vs diligently marke, that Christ includeth forgeuenes of synnes in his worde, &amp; not in pilgrimages, in masses, in almose dedes, or in any other workes, by what soeuer name they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. He therfore that desireth forgeuenes of his sins,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1416:240"/>
lette hym go vnto hys Pastor, that is learned in the worde of God, and heare of hym the glad and ioyful tydyngs of the Gospell,<note place="margin">The waye to obtayne remis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion of synnes is to heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of god, and to beleue it.</note> and faithfully beleue the same and he may be sure to haue hys synnes remytted and forgeuen hym. For thys is certayne and sure, that we can not ouercome synne with any woorke. But whatsoeuer we be able to doo, though we should tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our selues neuer so muche, is altogether vayne, and nothyng to the purpose, as they hadde experience in the Popes kyngedome, that hadde an euyll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and therfore gote them selues into Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and became cloysterers,<note place="margin">Fayth in the worde onlye quieteth the conscience.</note> or tooke vppon them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes, that they myght be deliuered from their synnes, and haue quiete consciences. But at the last, they were compelled to graunt, that neyther garment, nor monasticall order, nor prayers, nor fastynges, nor Masses, nor Pylgrimages, nor anye other kynde of paynefull dedes, coulde appease and quyete the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes and tourmentes of theyr conscience. Why so? Because that synnes can neyther be retayned nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytted by any other waye then by the worde, as we haue tofore hearde. Therfore who soeuer embraceth not this word, wherin alone is Remission of synnes: he muste nedes be vnder that worde, wherein synnes are retained. For there is none other waye or meane to forgeue synne, but the worde. Therfore whatsoeuer a man dothe, yet shall his synnes be retained, excepte he commeth to the worde. For the Lorde our GOD hath sette the forgeuenes of synnes in no worke that we do, but in thys one onely worke, that Christ hath suffred and rysen agayn from deathe. And this worke by the woorde hath he putte in the mouthe of hys A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and preachers, yea in the mouthe of all christen
<pb facs="tcp:1416:241"/>
men, if nede require, that by it they may distribute and declare remission of synnes to so many as desire it. If thou wilt fetche forgeuenes of thy sinnes from thens, thou shalt not be deceaued of thy purpose. For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Christ is at hand, that synnes shold be forgeuen. If thou wylt not fetch forgeuenes of thy syn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes from thens, I meane from the word of God, thy synnes shall styll be retayned and holden, doo what thou wylte. For as it hath bene many tymes sayde: Wythout the worde there is no Remission of synnes. <hi>CHRIST</hi> hath put thys woorde in the mouthe of his Apostles and mynisters, yea in tyme of nede, in the mouth also of al the Christians, to declare the same vnto the comfort of all troubled consciences. He that will not fetche it there, and beleue the worde, he shall dye in hys synnes, doo what he wyll. For this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement is strong and sure, that the Lord taketh away from the whole worlde, and from all works, the forgeuenes of synnes, and repose it onely in his word: there hangeth all the matter.</p>
               <p>But this is not onely to be vnderstanded of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, or of the preachyng of the worde, but as it was sayde in the begynnynge, Christe comprehendeth the whole ministerie in this commandement, that remissi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of synnes should be declared and distributed to the faythfull, bothe in the worde and in the sacramentes. For to this ende is the Gospell preached, that menne may knowe theyr synnes,<note place="margin">Why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospe is preached.</note> &amp; afterward thorow faithe bee iustified, and so for euer after leade a godlye and vertuous lyfe. We also to this ende are baptised, that oure synnes should be forgeuen vs thorough the death of Christe.<note place="margin">Why we are baptised.</note> Agayne, the sayde Christe hath ordeyned
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1416:241"/>
his holy Supper vnto this ende, that we shoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that his body was betrayde for vs,<note place="margin">Why christe ordayned hys Supper.</note> and that his bloud was shedde for vs, and that wee shoulde not doubt of the remyssion of our synnes. And that faith myght be constant, sure, and throughely perswaded, that oure synnes are forgeuen vs, thee and me, and the whole worlde, if the whole worlde would repent beleue and amend, Christ hath ordeyned, not that one for an other shold be baptised, and receaue the Lordes supper, but that euery one should be baptised &amp; receiue the lordes Supper for him self, and require priuate ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solution,<note place="margin">Euery man ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes for hym selfe.</note> if he can not be sufficientely confirmed and comforted by the publike preachyng, so that no man ought any thyng at all to doubt, but that as hee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Remission of hys synnes in the name of Iesus, so lykewise hee dooth receaue it, and is vtterly made free frome his synnes before <hi>GOD</hi> in heauen. Therefore the woorde and the Sacramentes are not to be separated: for Christe hathe ioyned the worde and the Sacramentes together,<note place="margin">The worde &amp; the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. ought to go together.</note> so that wythout the woorde the Sacramentes can brynge no consolation or confort at all: yea withoute the woorde we coulde not knowe what the Sacramentes were, nor vnto what ende they serue. Therfore it is not only a great blyndnes and erroure, but also a moste greuous myse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that the Papistes prate muche of the forgyuenes of synnes, and yet vtterly forgette the worde, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the whole matter consysteth, and telle the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a tale of a tubbe, that they muste gette them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mssions of theyr synnes by theyr owne workes, &amp; by theyr owne inuentions. But seyng that oure Lorde &amp; and Sauiour Christ Iesu hath placed forgeuenes of
<pb facs="tcp:1416:242"/>
synnes in the worde: And, as it hath often ben sayde, hath commytted the same to his Apostles, and to the Ministers of the woorde, yea and to all Christians in tyme of necessitie, to bee pronounced and declared: so foloweth it, that we must beleue the forgiuenes of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:<note place="margin">By faythe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in Christ are we freely iustified and saued.</note> &amp; that this forgeuenesse of synnes commeth vnto vs onely by Faith geuen to the worde and promise of Christe, as this is the foundation of oure doctrine, that we are freely iustified and saued by faithe alone in Christe. For this can no man denye, that the word of Christe, whyche he put in the mouthe of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, can not be comprehended nor gryped with han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, nor yet with the woorkes of fastynges, prayers, almosse dedes, pylgrimages, or what soeuer kynde of work it be besides.<note place="margin">Why faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone iustifieth without wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes.</note> It is Faith alone, that laieth hand on this worde, and receaueth it, and the heart only, is the very true cheast, wherin the word can be included or shutte in, so that by this, it is most playne and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that we are iustifyed by Fayth alone, seyng that Remyssion of synnes is onely comprehended in the woorde, and the worde can not otherwyse bee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and layd hand on, than by Faithe alone. But this knoweth not the Pope, with all his sectaries, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo they vnderstand this doctrine of Christe. yea they are so blockyshe and doltyshe, so mad and so farre estranged from the knowledge of Christen doctrine, that they neither can nor will vnderstande it, and so blynde, that they wyll by no meanes se it, yea so stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and so styffe necked, that in no wyse they wyll receaue and beleue it.<note place="margin">In the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes churche faithe and the worde were neglected.</note> Therfore bothe Faithe and the worde were neglected, and nothyng regarded in the Popes churche.

and woorkes. But <hi>GOD</hi> confounde Sathan, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriste, Pope, and all Sectaries, which wyth their wycked doctryne of woorkes, laboure to obscure, yea and vtterly to extinguyshe the glorye of <hi>GOD</hi> the merites of Christes deathe and Resurrection, the Iustification of faythe. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It shall therefore at all tymes bee mooste neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarye and conueniente, that wee conferre the Popes doctrine wyth ours, whyche is the trewe and sounde doctrine, and that we neuer forgette the abhomyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whyche hee hathe broughte into the Churche of Chryste, and wyth fyre, faggotte, sweard, halter, drownynge, and all other kynde of force and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, goeth foorthe to defende the same, that we bee not ledde agayne oute of the trewe waye, nor seeke remyssion of our synnes in our owne woorkes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the woorde of GOD.

of hys shepe, and putteth a difference betwene them and other shepe. And this he doothe for this purpose, to make a diuersitie betwene his doctrine and heresy, or any other doctrine, saying: I am the good shepherd and I knowe my shepe, and my shepe knowe me. As the Father hath knowen me, and I know the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I geue my lyfe for my shepe. As though he should say: Thus goeth the matter: If ye wyl be my shepe, and knowledge that I in dede am youre shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde: so shall ye be withoute perill and daunger.

               <p>Therfore this doctrine is to bee receaued as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample, that as Christ dyd and suffred all thynges for vs: so likewise we shold gladly do &amp; suffre al things for the wordes sake.

but to be eschued as the deuill. After this sorte goeth it with the doctrine of the pope, which is full both of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and heresies.

But the Pope teacheth thus: He that will be safe against the wolfe, that is to say, against the deuyl, and deathe, he must be his owne shepheard, and loke for help in his owne works. As ye know, what thyngs they taught in the Popedome of the sacrifice of the Masse, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, of pilgrimages, of vowes, of the monasticall lyfe,<note place="margin">Christs voyce is only to be hearde and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</note> of the workes of supererogation. &amp;c. If therfore we will be true christians, we muste folowe the shepe whiche knowe the voyce of their shephearde, and take hede vnto that: As for a strangers voyce they knowe not, neyther wyll they heare it. Therfore we ought to send them away from vs with these words: I know not thy voyce. I heare a wolfe, which goeth about to pluck me away from the flock of Christ. Away, hence with this woluysh houling: I wil folow my shepherd and heare his voice. For so saith Christ here: They shal heare my voyce. And a litle before he said: They folow no stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, but flee from hym, because they know not the voyce of strangers. For it is not possible, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a shepe whiche hath begunne to beleue, and hath herd y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> voice of his shepheard, &amp; receiued it, shold here &amp; allowe that doctrine, whyche is contrary to the voyce of Christe. The shepe heareth the commaundementes of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Kynges, Princes, Maiestrates. &amp;c. but it kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that these thynges pertayn not vnto saluation. For thys worketh not saluation, because this politike and ciuile obedience is declared and shewed. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a teacher commethe foorthe with this doctrine, and

saythe: If thou wylt bee saued, thou thy selfe muste satisfy for thy synnes. Thou must cause Masses to be sayd for thee. Thou must geue almes, that thy sinnes may be forgeuen thee. Thou must put on S. Francis coule, that thou dying and beynge buried in the same, mayst be saued. &amp;c. In this case the shepe heareth not, but sayth: I know not this voyce. It is the voice not of a shepherd, but of a wolfe.<note place="margin">The property of a shepe</note> For thus is the report of this beast, that is to say, of a shepe. It hath this nature and propretie, that amonge all beastes, there is none that hath so quick an eare, and so sharpe and redy sense of hearyng, as the shepe hath, as experience declareth. For if neuer so many crye and call, it regardeth them not. It refuseth all, excepte her owne shephearde. Hys voyce shee knoweth and heareth: Unto that she goeth and maketh haste. In lyke maner yong lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes euen in the greatest flockes: euery one knoweth the bleatyng of his owne damme, and foloweth that so long, tyll at the last he hath founde her. Christ hath respect to this nature of the shepe, and compareth his Christians wyth theym, that they also after the same maner should moste diligently hearken to the voyce of the shephearde, that they be not deceaued. And this is his meanynge, that where the voyce of Christ is not, his shepe can not be allured nor moued there to geue any eare.<note place="margin">Howe shepe are to be folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</note> And herein he geueth vs a playne comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that if we will be his shepe, we muste haue fyne and picked eares, whiche may discerne the voice of <hi>CHRIST</hi> frome all other, although those voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces seme to be neuer so clere, pleasant and swete.</p>
               <p>Therfore in this place it is to bee learned, that wee geue diligent attendance to heare the word of GOD yea, and that alone, and none other, that thorowe it

But those troubles are shorte, transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and of no continuance: Againste all these thynges the word teacheth me, that here after I shal haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.

the voyce of our shephearde. Wherfore this only remai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth, that we holde fast the worde, and by no meanes cast it awaye, til al these thinges be reueled &amp; brought to light in that euerlasting lyfe that is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, which we now heare in the worde, and beleue. For as this life, &amp; the life to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me do differ: so is it impossible, that the true feling and experience of those thinges sholde chaunce in this life, which are to be felt and perceaued in the life to comme. Therfore it is a matter of greate waight to knowe a Christen man, yea he can not be perfectly knowen in this lyfe. For what man can saye this, that he is in euerlasting lyfe? And notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we must confesse, that this child, which is vexed with death, sinne, and all kynd of miseries, where no point of euerlasting lyfe appeareth, immediatly after his baptisme biginneth in this worlde euerlasting life.

But yet for all that aboue that accustomed and defyled lyfe, God hath ordained euerlasting lyfe. wherin we also liue accordynge to the worde and faith, although we do not yet se and feele it. And this it is to knowe a true Christian, not to iudge hym after the iudgement of reason and mans vnderstandinge, but by the voyce and worde. As a shepes lyfe is in the voyce. For when she is destitute of her shepeheardes voyce, she can not escape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of wolues. For without the shepeheardes voice, she can not be kept in order and safetie.<note place="margin">The word of god only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true Christian.</note> when she hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that, she is safe and without all perill. But when that is ones lost, she is in danger on euery side. After the same maner goeth it with the Christians: if the worde be lost, there remayneth no conforte: But the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1416:249"/>
worde being safe, they beholde Christ their shepheard, and what so euer maketh for their saluation thorowe Christe, that is to say, forgeuenes of synnes and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting lyfe. Therfore hauing this assured hope, a true Christian serueth his vocation, doth his worke, eateth, dryncketh, yea and in the middest of his crosse and trouble he is ioyefull and merye. For he is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther geuen to heare the voyce of his shepheard, and accustometh hym selfe to iudge not after the sence and course of reason, but accordinge to the voyce and worde. And this it is that Christ sayth here: I knowe my shepe, and my shepe know me: as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth me, and I knowe the father, &amp; I geue my lyfe for my shepe.</p>
               <p>This thing must we learne, and diligently consider in our heartes, that we be not offended, nor forsake the voyce of our shephearde, though the Christians be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and troubled, yea and dye, as other do. For this is the alone knowledge of the Christians, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saye: As concernynge the outwarde life I do no see any difference betwene the godly &amp; the vngodly. Yea many times the state of the Christians is harder and more intollerable, &amp; they are incombred with mo mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then other are. But in the worde there is greate difference, namely that the Christians &amp; the vngodly haue much diuersitie betwene them, not as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning outwarde thinges, but that the Christians heare the voyce of theire shepeheard, which the Ethnickes and Infidelles heare not: nor yet the Turkes, Iewes, and Papistes, but only the shepe of Christ. As touching all other external thinges, there is no difference.</p>
               <p>Wheras Christ speaketh of other shepe, which must also be broughte, that there maye be one shepehearde
<pb facs="tcp:1416:250"/>

This conforte tendeth special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this ende, that for the shortnes of the tentation, which should chaunce very veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Disciples by the reason of Christs passion and death, they should not despaire, but be on a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte and courage: forasmuche as he would absente hym selfe from them but a litle while &amp; that he would comme againe vnto them after his resurrection, and make them ioyeful and mery for euer after, so that of this their ioye there should be no ende.</p>

For when tentation was at hande, and the most ignominious and spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death of Christ troubled al their wittes, they could not then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, what this lytle while ment, but their heartes were so astonyed, that they thought Christe to be vtterly vndone, &amp; that they shortly after should also comme to that point, and for Christes sake be in lyke maner moste miserably handled. But that this their sorowe and tentation should not continew past two or three daies, when the Lorde Christ should rise again from death vnto an euerlastyng lyfe, and helpe them here in this worlde againste the worlde, deuill, synne, and death: and at the laste geue them a moste ioyefull and euerlastinge lyfe in the worlde to comme: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnderstode they not: neither though they it possible.</p>
               <p>Therfore S. Iohn afterwarde in his Gospel decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, how the disciples hyd them selues, and kepte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> secret for feare of the Iewes, neither wolde they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">How reason Iudgeth of the crosse.</note>Mannes witt and reason thinketh and Iudgeth on this wyse: If God had any regard vnto vs: the godly shold neuer be in so great miseries and troubles, as they are.

Against these thoughtes and imaginations of reason, we muste get vs ayde and helpe out of the worde of God, lest we suffer this matter to be dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after: the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of reason, where as we ought to referre the whole iudgement in this behalfe vnto the worde of god.

It is solde for halfe a farthing, &amp; yet Christe

sayth, that God hath care of it. How muche more shal he care for the godly, whiche are better then many spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes? He will not therfore suffer the deuil and the worlde to do with them that their pleasure is, but what his good will is, so that what soeuer hindraunce shall chaunce to the godly thorow the deuill and the worlde, it can not be without the prouidence of god,<note place="margin">The deuill &amp; the world can do no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of god the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and suffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth.</note> neither can they rage further, then God appointeth.

                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 93.</note> And this is worthy to be noted and for euer to be remembred, that thou in thine affliction persuade thy selfe,<note place="margin">A good les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what soeuer aduersitie chaunceth vnto thee, it commeth not by fortune or by chaunce, but by the singuler proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, councell, and determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god, yea and that vnto thy greate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, althoughe it semeth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to thy blinde and carnal reason.</p>
               <p>And here nowe riseth also a greater difficultie: for yf I must thus persuade my selfe,<note place="margin">Reason can not se that our affliction co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For what health or saluation maye be loked for of paynes, plagues, and punishmentes? in our great and greuous afflictions we can not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be persuaded, but that God euen of displeasure and hatred againste vs doth plague and punishe vs. And this greatly encreaseth our sorowe, and in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bringeth vs to desperation, because God doth so punishe vs, If any other thing were the cause of oure
<pb facs="tcp:1416:253"/>
plagues and troubles, it would not so greatlye greue vs: for then we woulde thincke, that there were some helpe and conforte remayninge in God towardes vs. In this case therfore must we haue recourse vnto the worde of God, and not heare nor obey the iudgement &amp; sentence of reason. For if we heare and beleue that, we shall surely fall into desperation, yea and vtterlye detest and abhorre God.</p>
               <p>The worde, whiche in this behalfe conforteth and openeth vnto vs the will of God, is this. S.

But when we are iudged of the Lorde, we are chastened, that we should not be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned with the worlde. By this sentence of the Apostle it is euident, that whome God wil not haue condemned with the worlde,<note place="margin">Affliction co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This sentence in affliction is di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligently to be considered and remembred. One hath this crosse, an other hath that, whereof they woulde gladly be eased.<note place="margin">Howe wee should behaue our selues in trouble.</note> But if euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold thincke on this maner, &amp; saye to him selfe: If thou were not restrained with this byt of aduersitie, if thou were not thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte thou wouldest surely do that, which shold worke thee greater displeasure, and be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of a more euil: but God doth send thee this aduersitie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou sholdest not be damned with this worlde, but hereof take an occasion to amend thy life, to call thy selfe vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> to feare GOD, to call on his blessed name, to thancke him for his benefites &amp;c.

they not be angry with god for laying that crosse vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, nor thincke that he doth it of hatred &amp; displeasure against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather of fauour &amp; good wil towarde them: yea then would they loue and praise god, that he in that affliction sheweth tokens of his fauour and good will toward them, by this meanes preseruinge them from eternall damnation vnto euerlastynge saluation.<note place="margin">

               <p>And as the worde doth preach and declare vnto vs of the crosse and of afflictions: so lykewise is it set forth by examples.<note place="margin">Examples of affliccion.</note> who can or dare say, that god the father hated his onely begotten sonne Christe Iesu? And yet for all that yf thou considerest his lyfe and death, and weighest the matter after the iudgement of reason, there shall appeare no great signes of gods loue towarde hym, yea rather signes of hatred then of loue: and that the vngodly and wicked Iewes were more regarded with god, then Christ, whom they ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at their pleasure, and entreated as they woulde, accordyng to the saying of the Prophete:<note place="margin">

He was despised &amp; abhorred of menne. We reckoned him so vile, that we hyd our faces from hym: yea he was despised, and therefore we regarded hym not. We dyd iudge him, as though he were plagued &amp; cast downe of god. And Christ hymselfe sayth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> psalmographe: As for me,<note place="margin">

               <p>Now as god did handle his owne derely beloued &amp; only begotten sonne Christe Iesu here on earth: euen
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1416:254"/>
so wil he handle al Christians in this worlde, as Christ hath to fore saide: The seruant is not greater then his maister. If they haue persecuted me:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn·</hi> 15.</note> they wil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute you likewise. And it is sayde both moste trimly and truly in the Epistle to the Hebreues, as we heard afore: If ye be not vnder correction,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note> (wherof all are partakers) then are ye bastardes and not sonnes.</p>
               <p>Thus see we by the wonderful and certein consent both of sentences and examples, and by them are we taught, that god not of euill but of good will, not of displeasure but of fauoure, correcteth vs: and that in the middest of our trouble we should knowe the good wil of god, and certeinly be persuaded, that God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our affliction be neuer so great, doth not hate vs, nor set naught by vs, but rather that this correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a most assured signe, that he loueth vs, and taketh vs for his children, seinge he doth so louingly correcte and chasten vs.</p>

For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are not small, as it is set forth in a certein psalme, where Christ him self crieth out on this maner: Saue me O God, for the waters are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me in, euen vnto my soule,<note place="margin">

                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:256"/>And vnto this ende specially belonged the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the woman that trauaileth of child,<note place="margin">

And where as some time the ende of suche trauaile is not gladnes, that chaunceth but seldome. The common trade is, as Christ saith, that sodenly and vnlooked for, sounde, ful, true, and perfect ioye foloweth sorow and sadnes, as the Psalmographe sayeth: Heuines may endure for a night, but ioye commeth in the morning.

When the holy Ghost (saith he) shall come, he will rebuke the worlde of synne, of rightous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and of iudgement. Christe in these his woordes comprehendeth many great thynges, and saieth, that the holy Ghost shall not only rebuke small companies certaine kyndes of men, certayne nations or people, but the whole world. He had nede be well fenced and armed, that will take vpon hym to haue too do with the whole worlde. For the world is, what soeuer hath growne vp from Adam hytherto, Monarches,<note place="margin">What the worlde is.</note> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, Kynges, Princes, no man vtterly, no not of the hyghest degree, excepted. All these muste be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of synne by the Apostles, and by the ministers of the worde, at the motion of the holy Ghoste. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Ghoste by the preachers shall rebuke theym all of synne, of righteousnes, and of Iudgement, none nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther high nor low excepted, not Hierusalem for her holi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, not Rome for her wisedome. &amp;c. All must receaue this correction and rebuke of the holy ghost, that they may be saued. For al men, with all that euer they haue are vnder the kyngdome of the deuyll. Neither theyr righteousnesse, nor their holynesse, nor yet theyr good

And thys is the office, that the holy Ghost wyll doo in the worlde by the Apostles, menne beggerly and of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, euen to rebuke the worlde of synne. It is no small thynge, but a matter of weyghty and great importance, to rebuke the worlde of hygh and great matters. For he hath an office to rebuke the world of synne, of righteousnesse, and of iudgement.

And Christe hym selfe saythe: Except a man be borne agayne, he can not see the kyngdome of God. This is truely the sermon of the holy Ghost thus to rebuke the worlde for synne.</p>

Of this synne the worlde knoweth nothynge.<note place="margin">In credulitie is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateste synne and the roote of all synne.</note> It is the whole and alone doctrine of the holy ghoste. For the worlde counteth those synnes onely, whyche are forbydden in the seconde Table of Moyses. Of Christ it knoweth nothyng, muche lesse knoweth it, that it is synne, not to beleue in hym. But what shoulde we wyth manye woordes rebuke the ignorancye of the worlde, seynge that euen in the schooles amonge the learned, incredulitie, infidelitie, or vnbeliefe is taken for no synne, namely for no originall synne. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to no science to teach that incredulitie is synne but to the holy Gost. And he by this doctrine maketh the whole worlde gyltie of synne, where as many ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes the worlde is able to proue her externall iustyce and outwarde ryghteousnesse. Thys is therefore the Doctrine of the holy ghoste, that it shoulde reproue the whole worlde of synne, no manne excepted. The worlde hathe not bene accustomed vnto suche an vnwonted kynde of doctrine, neyther knoweth it any thynge of that, that it is bounde to beleue in Christe. Thus it thynketh: If wyth the Phariseye it be noo murderer, no adulterer, noo vnryghteous persone, it is ynough, and the worlde requireth no more. But the holy ghoste preacheth otherwyse, and sayth: I knowe well, that amonge men, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge outwarde and bodyly righteousnesse, one is better then an other.

But conferre thou this their interpretation with the text.

               <p>Therfore incredulitie or vnbelefe is the principall &amp; greatest synne,<note place="margin">Unbeleif is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greatest sinne, and the faun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyne of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll.</note> and the fountayne out of the whyche all other synnes and vices doo issue and sprynge.

And these are the leaues, yea and the hole tree of incredulitie, whiche spring out of these rootes, for the whiche the holy Ghost rebuketh the world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffreth he any thyng to resist and withstand his office.

               <p>The seconde parte is, that the Holye Ghoste wyll rebuke the worlde of ryghteousnesse. Thys alsoo is an harde sayenge. The worlde hathe Synne, but it hathe not Ryghteousnesse: neyther dothe it knowe howe it shoulde bee Iustifyed and made Ryghteous. But what is thys Ryghteousnesse? Lawe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes be the chiefe thynges of the worlde. And the Philosophers haue prescribed Rules and Preceptes of the Offices and dueties of Righteousnesse, and of other vertues, that menne myght lyue an honest and Ciuile lyfe. Neyther canne thys be counted vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, to hange vp theues, to punyshe adulterers. &amp;c. Yea, it is an acte bothe ryghte and good. But Christe speakethe not here of that Ryghteousnesse,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:262"/>
whiche the world counteth righteousnes: but of that righteousnes, whyche is of valour, and wyll goe for payment before God. He speaketh not here of politike and humayne iustice or rightousnes, but of that, which is comprehended in this worde of Christe: I go vnto the Father,<note place="margin">The blyndnep of mans iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemente con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacion.</note> and ye shall see me no more. This is more mysticall and harder to be vnderstanded, then the last where it is pronounced, that it is synne, not to beleue in Christe. For thus men thynke, that they haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall strength inough to lyue godly, to prepare them selues vnto grace, and to praye for it. And that is the cause nowe a dayes also, that the Papists can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue nor vnderstand this doctrine, so far out of frame semeth here the description of righteousnes, that thou art then righteous, when Christe goeth vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Rightousnes commeth not by workes.</note> and thou seest hym no more. This is a meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous goodly text, and nothynge can bee more euident and playne, then this description. For what will man nowe glorye and boaste hymselfe of his good works?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.</note> Christes worde is manyfest in this place, that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes is not gotten by woorkes, but it is gotten by this meanes onely, that Christe gothe to the Father. This his iourney and goynge vnto the Father, is the true and euerlastynge righteousnes. This knowledge is vtterly vnknowen vnto the worlde. For in all his monumentes and bookes, there is not one syllable of this rightousnes. This is sette foorth in theyr bookes that he whyche kepeth the tenne commaundementes dothe nothyng agaynst honestie, publique ordinances lawes, custome. &amp;c. is a good, honeste, and righteous man. But Christe speaketh not one worde here, what I ought to doo,<note place="margin">Ciuile righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes.</note> or to leaue vndoone, but he speakethe symply and onely of his owne worke, that is to saye,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1416:262"/>
that he goeth vnto the Father,<note place="margin">Christes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge vnto the father is our righteousnes.</note> and that we shall see hym no more: and that this is our righteousnes, and none other thyng.</p>
               <p>Therefore when we doo determyne to get vs true ryghteousnesse, we maye not go about to obteyne it with our owne workes, and with our owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes. It maketh nothyng vnto this matter,<note place="margin">Though good workes iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie not, yet may they not be left vndone for the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But the whole pythe and summe of the matter consisteth in this, and so is delyuerance frome synne obteyned, that thou knowest, that Christ is gone vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although good workes may not be left vndone. For thou arte commanded of God in the tenne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes to doo them, and diligentely to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise thy selfe in all good dedes commaunded of God, and prescribed in hys holye woorde. But thow mayste not adde thys vnto theym: That thou sekest to bee iustified and made ryghteous by theym. For by thys is righteousnesse onely to bee goten, that <hi>CHRIST</hi> is gone vnto the Father. Thys is the alone waye, and none other, whereby wee are dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered frome our synnes, and iustifyed.<note place="margin">what christes goinge vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father is.</note> Christes iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neye or goyng vnto the Father, is none other thynge, thenne that hee hathe suffered, dyed on the Crosse, and by deathe is gone awaye oute of the worlde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Father, that is, He is ascended into heauen, and there sytteth on the ryghte hande of <hi>GOD</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and gouerneth his Kyngedome. Wee see not thys, but we beleue it.</p>
               <p>Thys is the whole matter, whereby we are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed: so that ryghteousnesse is not to bee imputed to my strengthe or power, but to Iesus Christe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

He that wyll be saued (say they) must bryng that to passe with his owne workes. In dede this is godly and truely sayd, that a Christen man must lyue in this worlde godlye, iustly, and holyly: but that he shall bee made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by his holy and good workes, that is most false. For it is here playne, that the goynge of Christe vnto the Father, worketh that onely. This is the assured, certayn, true, and infallible righteousnes, wherof the worlde knoweth nothynge. The Holye Ghoste one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reueleth and openeth that mysterie. But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes obiecte thys saying of Christe agaynst vs: If thou wylte enter into lyfe,<note place="margin">

The Christen ryghteousnesse therefore is a mooste synguler and excellente ryghteousnesse, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che no hearte can thynke, no reason or wysedome can conceaue. All the matter is to be knowen and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Holye Ghoste: Neyther though we heare it can
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1416:264"/>
neither though we heare it, can it otherwise be percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then by faith alone, as Christe sayth here: I go vnto the father, &amp; yea shall se me no more. That is to say, ye must beleue:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.</note> otherwise shal ye neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de this my worke of your iustification. This is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian righteousnes, whiche the holy ghoste alone tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. Of the righteousnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. Philolosophers, Lawyers, and the expositours of the lawe do teache, &amp; parentes also in their familie. But a Christen mans knowledge is an other maner of science,<note place="margin">with out faith all thinges are synne.</note> wherof the worlde knoweth nothing, namely, that without faith all things are sin, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the true &amp; euerlasting righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes consisteth in this only, that Christ goeth to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; we se him no more. The third part is, that the holy ghoste also rebuketh the worlde of iudgement. What maner of iudgement this is, Christ sheweth on this wise. The prince of the world, saieth he, is iudged. Therfore as the holy ghoste doth rebuke the worlde, because it hath sinne, for asmuch as it beleueth not in Christ: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath no righteousnes, because it knoweth not, neither hath any conforte therin, that Christe is gone to the father:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 14.</note> so likewise doth he rebuke it of iudgement, because it knoweth nothing hereof, and therfore feareth, where nothinge is to be feared, if it wolde heare him, and receaue his worde. For this is an extreme miserie and a lamentable plague to haue syn &amp; no righteousnes, and besides that, not to knowe of any consolation and conforte againste sinne, death and all other euilles.</p>
               <p>In this also, sayth Christe, is the office of the holy ghost, that he should preach of iudgement,<note place="margin">The holye ghoste rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the world of Iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gement.</note> and procure to be pronounced and set forth by the gospel, that the prince of the worlde is iudged, and that therfore he can
<pb facs="tcp:1416:265"/>
not hurte them that beleue in Christ, and put their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his goinge vnto the father. He maye vexe them with diuerse tentations, but he can neuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againste them. For although he be the prince of the worlde,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Luc.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> yet the prince is iudged: he is spoiled of his pallace &amp; armour, and with the chaines of darcknes as Peter speaketh, is he bounde of Christ. There is no cause, why Christen men should feare him, or all his kyngdome. For if the prince be iudged, the world also, whiche is his kyngdome, muste nedes be iudged and depriued of all his power.</p>
               <p>This the vngodly knowe not. Therfore althoughe somtime they heare the worde,<note place="margin">

But this is not true.<note place="margin">The holy ghoste taught no newe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</note> For this is the righte vnderstanding of Christs wordes, that the holy ghost shall teache the Apostles and the churche, and instruct them concerninge suche matters, as Christe him self had to fore taught them whiche by the reason of their carnal iudgements they could not vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, nor attaine vnto the knowledge therof.

The holy ghost openeth and lightneth the darke mindes of the Apostles with the golden &amp; glisteryng beames of his godly influence.

none other helpe, then to staye them selfe with praier, and to crye vnto God for helpe.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before the prayer concernynge dayly breade,<note place="margin">

Nowe for asmuch as we of our owne nature are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impacient, we thynke always, that it is now high tyme to healpe, and that God deferreth the matter to longe: and thus we prescribe and appoint God how, when, and what he shall doo.

But of these thynges we shall speake more at an other tyme, whenne wee shall treate of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Resurrection of the deade. Lette vs nowe come vnto the principall poynte of the whole matter,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:279"/>
wherunto also the Angels had speciall respecte, when they called agayne into the waye the Disciples, that gased here and there, that they should rather consider, why Christe is ascended into heauen, then how he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng a littell afore seene, is nowe seene nomore. The doctrine of the Apostles in all thynges moueth speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to this poynt, that we should consider vnto what ende all the actes of Christe were doone: as for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> They referre Christes deathe vnto our sinnes, and his resurrection vnto oure Iustification, and so likewise of the other. After this sorte muste we nowe also see, why Christe ascended into heauen, and what commoditie and profyt we haue by that his ascension</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Christ by his ascension de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> his kyngdome is not of thys worlde.</note>And fyrst of all lette vs behold the nature and state of his kyngdome. For in that that he is gone vp into heauen, he declareth, that his kyngdom is not of this worlde, and that his administration shall not be after the maner of worldly kyngdomes. When the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples demaunded of Christe, at what tyme he woulde restore the kyngdome to Israell, they were of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinyon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18.</note> that Christes kyngedome shoulde be a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and worldly kyngedome. But by his ascension, they are taught otherwyse to thynke of his kyngdom: that is to saye, that it is no worldely kyngdome, oute of the which great richesse, dignities and promotions are to be looked for,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Actes.</hi> 1.</note> but rather a spirituall and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastynge kyngedome, in the whyche hee shoulde geue Spirituall gyftes vnto menne. Therefore lette no manne become one of Christes flocke to the ende that he wyll gette temporall goodes and worldely possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to come vnto great honour: for these thynges are not to be found in this kyngdome.

not instituted for te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall thinges, neither shold Christ euer haue ben reueled in the world,<note place="margin">Why Christ came down from heauen</note> if it had not bene for a more graue and weighty cause then this. For our euerlastyng saluation and rightousnes came he down from heauen. There was therfore an higher &amp; greater matter, why the sonne of God did either descende or ascend: verily that he might prouide for vs euerlasting goodes, as are the fauor of God, remission of sinnes, the gift of the holy Ghost, righteousnes, &amp; euerlastyng lyfe. Such gyfts must we loke for at Christes hand, which continued not in this life, but we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into an euer stinge life, euen into heauen, and there hath begun a spirituall, inuisible, and euerlasting kingdome. Whych thing was longe before prophecied by Dauid in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Psalm,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal</hi> 68. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.</note> which S. Paule reciteth in his Epistle to the Ephesians, and interpreteth it of the Ascention of Christ, and of his spirituall kyngdome. The words are these. Thou art gone vp on hie, thou hast led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie captiue, and receiued giftes for men, yea euen for thyn enemies, that the Lord God might dwel among them. The sentence is short, but it comprehendeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thynges, and euery one of them oughte dilygent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be weyghed, pondered, and consydered. The first worde Paule hymself handleth lyke an Apostle, when he saith: That he ascended, what meaneth it, but that he also descended fyrste into the lowest partes of the earth? He that descended, is euen the same also, that ascended vp aboue all heauens, to fulfyll all thynges. S. Paule in these hys wordes dothe very exquisitely handle bothe the descension and ascension of Christe, that by thys meanes we maye knowe, from whense so many and so greate gyftes came, that we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by the ascension of Christ. Let no man thinke
<pb facs="tcp:1416:280"/>
that he with his owne woorkes, rightousnesse, holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of lyfe, or wyth any other thynge hathe deserued, that he should receaue the noble gyftes of Christes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension, but Christ himselfe hath deserued it, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the gyftes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.</note> in that he came downe, and humbled hymselfe, and for our sake became manne, and for vs dyed on the crosse.</p>
               <p>These gyftes dothe Paule signify by these his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, when he, as it were, interpreteth the mynd of the Prophete, and putteth Christes descension before his Ascension. For as muche then as the Holy Ghoste by the Prophete speaketh thus of Christe: Thou wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test vp on hye: It foloweth herof, that he came down before, and was made lowe. Whych altogether was doone for our sake.</p>
               <p>Therfore Paules interpretation agreeth wel with the woordes of Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 16.</note> whiche ye lately hearde. It is expedient for you that I go. For except I go my way, the comfortour shall not come. But when I go my waye, I will sende hym vnto you. If I go my way, I wyl prepare you a place.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 14.</note> This sayeng, Thou art gone vp on hye, maketh a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene Christ and them that ascended into heauen. Enoch was taken vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.</note> Helias wente vp in a fyerye charette, but <hi>CHRIST</hi> went not so vp into heauen, but he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended by his owne power, as hee also by hys owne power, rose agayne frome deathe vnto lyfe, without the healpe of any thyng. This is a great diuersitie, for we shall not rayse vp oure selues at the laste day,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.</note> but Christe shall rayse vs vp. Christe hymselfe rose frome deathe vnto lyfe by his owne power, as he sayeth in the Gospell of S. Iohn:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.</note> My Father loueth me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I geue ouer my lyfe, that I maye take it again.

               <p>Where as the Psalme sayth moreouer: Thou wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test vp on hye: It is none other thing, then as we sayd before, &amp; Christ pronounced before Pilate: My king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this worlde.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 18.</note> Therefore althoughe we are in the worlde occupied about matters of houshold and Policie, yet seynge wee are Christians, and the kyngdome of <hi>CHRIST</hi> is not of this worlde, we oughte to lyfte vp our myndes vnto heauen, that we maye aboue all thynges embrace this spirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and looke vnto that.

Of this matter dothe the Psalme make mencion, saying: Thou art gone vp on hie: thou hast led captiuitie captiue.

Is this therfore a conforte? Christ answereth, that it is a conforte, but we must make a distinction betwene confortes.

The doctrine that setteth forth. Christ, that bringeth true consolation, &amp; maketh the heartes of men mery. All other bring to the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted conscience not conforte but disconforte, not lyfe but death, not saluation but damnation.</p>
               <p>Therfore all the matter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in this one point, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou truly, rightly, and certeinly know this consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; confort: so mayste thou be bolde to saye: I beleue in Iesus Christe, whiche died for me.

<pb facs="tcp:1416:289"/>
alone, and non other, will I admitte and receaue. For if there were any conforte better or surer then this, the holy ghost wolde also haue brought it, but he doth nothing elles then testifie of Christ.</p>

                  </note> This is don to this ende, that we should the more diligently attende and marke the worde. For this is certein and true, that the worke of the holy ghost is inwardly in the hearte. But yet will not he administer this worke otherwise, then by the outwarde worde, as Paule also saith, that fayth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

He geueth forth his witnes openly in the worde: ther is he to be sought and loked for, tyll by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde, which thou outwardly hearest, he touche thy hearte, &amp; so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly thorowe his workyng thou felest his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Christ. But this inward witnesse cometh not, except the outwarde witnesse of the worde goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherin it is declared, that Christ for oure sake be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>came man, was crucified, died, and rose again. So that the summe of this gospel is, that if we entende to be Christians,<note place="margin">What Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s shal loke for this world</note> we maye not in this lyfe loke for richesse dignities, renowne, glorie &amp;c. But rather thincke most certeinly, that for this our profession we shall haue the world an enemy to persecute vs, besydes the vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of synne, deuill and death. Therfore when these tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes ryse vp in the breaste of a Christian, he is by
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1416:289"/>
and thynkethe on this maner with hymselfe: Alas, what haste thou doone? Thou myghtest welle haue bene a Christian, and yet neuer haue comme to this myserie and daunger. Thou art come to thys poynte thoroughe thyne owne faulte. &amp;c. Nowe when suche horrible examples come also to mynde, as putteth vs in remembraunce, howe greuously greate and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous menne haue in tymes paste fallen, and coulde not escape tentation: then (sayeth Christe) is it tyme for the comforter to come,<note place="margin">vnconfortable thoughtes are of the deuyll.</note> whyche without doubte will not longe tarye awaye, but wyll spedylye come, and teache you, that suche greuous and fearefull imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and thoughtes are not of hym, but of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll. The reason is. For suche thoughtes bryng trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and disquietenesse, yea and dryue vnto desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the holy Ghost maketh not afrayde, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth, encourageth, and so handleth the matter, that he testifieth and beareth witnesse of me, that I haue ouercome the worlde with his prince and God, euen the deuyll. Therfore all other thoughtes, that brynge with them heauynes, sorowe, and discomfort, are not of me, but of the deuyll. But the holy Ghost bryngeth and geueth confortable and ioyefull thoughtes, for as muche as he beareth wytnesse of me, that I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed my lyfe for you, dyed for your synnes, and rose agayne for your Iustification.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> Of thys testimonie or wytnesse ye maye easyly gather, that I hate you not, and that I doo not entende to condemne you, but to saue you.</p>
               <p>The whole substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thys matter therfore resteth in this point: He shal beare witnes Of me. This is prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipally to be obserued and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly noted against the Sectaries and false teachers. For here it is surely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:290"/>
that when the holy ghost shall bryng foorth comfort, he shall doo it by the testimonie or witnesse of Christ, that he may stablish and print Christ in their hertes. Wher as contrarywise, the deuyll goeth about to plant in the heartes of men, feare the wrath of God, syn, death and damnation. This wicked spirite dothe the holy Ghost by his testimonie resist, &amp; by the word speaketh in our hearts,<note place="margin">A swete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte.</note> and sayth: Ah man, what dost thou? Canst thou doo none otherwise, but alwayes thynke on death, synne, and damnation? Turne thyne eyes from these greuous and terrible sightes, and loke vpon me. Doest thou not know that man, whiche is called Christ Iesus? Of hym it is thus written: that he was conceaued of the holy Ghoste, borne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the virgin: that he suffred vnder Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dyed, was buried: that he descended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, rose agayne from death the thyrd day, ascended vnto heauen. &amp;c. Wherfore was all this doone, thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest thou? Was it not doone for this purpose, that by this meanes thou shouldest comfort thy selfe againste deathe and synne? Therefore leaue of, and cease thus to feare &amp; to trouble thy selfe: for thou haste no cause so to doo. If Christ were not, and if Christe had not doone these thynges for thee: so shouldest thou haue had a iuste cause to feare and to be sadde.

Nowe lette vs come vnto the seconde part, as touchyng the Crosse and affliction. And here muste we note specially the sayenge of Christe to hys Disciples:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.</note> They shall excommunicate you out of their Synagoges. These wordes declare euidentely, that they whyche excommunicate the Christians, and driue them out of theyr synagoges, maintayn this title, and doo greatly glory, that they are the Synagoge, or true churche, yea and they wyll also be counted suche, as are alone the true woorshyppers of God, and that in handlyng the Christians on this wyse, they doo God great, true, and faithfull seruice. For ells what needed Christ to haue spoken these wordes? The houre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that who soeuer kylleth you, shall thynke, that he doothe an acceptable sacrifice vnto God, and an hygh greate seruice.</p>
               <p>It is therfore necessarie at al tymes, that we make
<pb facs="tcp:1416:291"/>
a difference betwene the true and false churche. That is the false churche,<note place="margin">The true and false churche.</note> whiche chalengeth this name, and is so called, and yet not withstandynge is not the trewe churche. The true churche is that, which is not suffered to bee called the churche, and yet is the trewe Churche in dede.<note place="margin">The pope and hys Secte is not the true churche.</note> But it is an harde thyng to discerne these two churches. For thys hyndreth greatly, that the false Churche also hath the office of mynisterie in it, as it is to be seene. We frankely and frely confesse, that the Pope and his sect is not the trewe churche, and therfore we condemne theim as the Synagoge of Satan: Notwithstandynge when they baptise, ordeyne pastors, confirme maryages, we fynde no fault wyth these thynges for the ministerie and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des sake, but we confesse theyr baptisme to be trewe, and therfore doo not we baptise the chyldren agayne, whiche were baptised of them.

And this was his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Heretikes (saythe he) are not in the vnitie of the Christen churche: Therfore can they haue no Christen ministerie. But this is not true.

A notorious synner also is not of the vnitie of the Churche, yet hys mynisterie that hee hath in the churche, is not to bee despised. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is thys.

               <p>Therefore he that wyll ryghtly and truely discerne these two churches, he maye not onely haue an eye to the ministerie. For the false churche also may haue the mynisterie, and yet is it not the true Churche.

Wherefore we muste fyrst of all consyder thys, whyther they vse the name of God, and of hys Church aryght, or not.</p>
               <p>And vnto this matter dothe the rule greatly helpe,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:292"/>
whyche Christe prescribeth in thys place,<note place="margin">How the false churche maye be knowen.</note> when he in the ryght colours poynteth and setteth foorth the fals churche. For the true churche doothe not vsurpe the power of the swearde and of temporall punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the false churche chalengeth this power, and moste cruelly persecuteth the trewe Churche, as Christe prophecied before, that it should come to passe. By thys mayst thou well knowe, whyche is the fals church. But yet this is a more certayn argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that Christ saith: These things shal they do to you, because they neyther knowe me, nor my Father. Here is also the false churche paynted and sette foorthe in her right colours, with her ordinarie power. They may cloke theyr matters with the name of God, and of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and so bleare the eyes of the vnwyse and symple, as theyr manner is to doo, but yet for all theyr fayre shewe and glorious pretence, Christe sayth, that they neither knowe hym, nor hys Father.</p>
               <p>But what is it to know Christ and his Father? It is not to say Masse,<note place="margin">What it is to knowe god.</note> to be shaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the crown, to wear a typpet &amp; a long gowne, to be cladde with a monkes coule, to vowe pouertie, chastitie, and obedience at the appoyntement of Antichriste, to absteyne frome fleshe, and to enforce the bealy with all kynde of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie fyshe to lyue idelly in the cloyster of other mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.</note> &amp;c. But to knowe Christe, is to beleue, that Christ is the lambe of God that taketh away the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the worlde,<note place="margin">What it is to knowe christ.</note> whyche for our sake became man, dyed for vs on the crosse, rose agayn from the dead, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into heauen. &amp;c. Wyth this full persuasion and assured hope, that God wyll be mercyfull vnto vs for his sonne Christ Iesus sake. And this is to know the Father,<note place="margin">What it is to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father</note> to be throughly persuaded, that he for his son
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1416:292"/>
Christes sake will haue mercy on vs, and not impute our synnes vnto vs, but frankly &amp; frely forgeue them for Christes sake. Where this knowledge is, there is the true churche. But where this knowledge is not, there is not the true churche, although the ministerie and the name of God be there.</p>
               <p>Therfore we muste haue respect to this knowledge aboue all thynges, that the true churche may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be knowen. The scisme or dissention, that nowe a dayes is in the Churche, offendeth manye, that they can not telle, to what parte they shoulde ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. But in thys they fayle and do not theyr duetie, in that they wyll not consyder this rule. Thys is our doctrine, that before God nothing can preuail against synne and death,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the true churche.</note> but the alone death and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ: &amp; that who soeuer doth truly beleue this, is saued. But whosoeuer beleueth not this, what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer workes he dothe besydes, he can not be saued. Nowe what foundation, confirmation, and probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we haue for this our doctrine, the scriptures both of the olde and newe testamente doo abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and it hath ben sette foorth afore vnto you many tymes. But what hath folowed?<note place="margin">The doctrine of the false churche.</note> For this doctrin the Pope and his church most cruelly persecute vs, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth, pronounceth, and killeth vs as heretikes. For this is his doctrin: who soeuer loketh to be saued he hymself must make satisfaction for his own sinnes. Christe (saieth he) satisfied onely for Originall synne, what soeuer wee offende after Baptisme, that muste euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make amendes for, and with his good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes recompence the same, and so pacifye the wrath of <hi>GOD.</hi> But howe agreeth thys doctrine with the knowledge of Christ? For thys is a good consequence.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:293"/>
If Christ hath satisfied for oure synnes: then are not we able to make satisfaction for them. Good workes ar not to be left vndone, but we must do them for an other purpose, then to make satisfaction for our sinnes and to deserue euerlastyng lyfe by them,<note place="margin">whi we ought to do good workes.</note> euen to shew our obedience to God and to his holy comaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, to sette foorth the glory of our heauenly Father, to stoppe the mouthes of the aduersaries, to declare our Faithe in Christe, not to be vayne, idle, or dead: to mortifie olde Adam, to profite our neighbour, to wyn other vnto the trueth of the Gospell. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus see you by this rule of Christ, whyche is the right and true churche. But notwithstandyng we are caste out of the synagoges, and excommunicate of the Pope and his sect, because we repose and set our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes and acceptation before God in <hi>CHRIST</hi> in his deathe and Resurrection. Nowe where as the the Pope and hys churche chalengeth vnto them sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by theyr owne workes, merites, and satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: it is an euidente argumente, that they neyther knowe Christ, nor the Father. Forasmuche as we be well assured and certain, that we know Christ aright and the Papistes knowe not Christ: it ought not to trouble or moue vs any thynge at all, although suche a church as neither knoweth Christ nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, dothe excommunicate vs, and pronounce vs Heretikes, and the church of the deuil. Let this rather confort vs, that we know the sonne and the father, and nothing at all care, that the Pope doth so greatly auance &amp; set forthe himselfe against vs with the name of the church, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in dede his church is nothing els then the very syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge of Satan. Let vs in the meane season looke for an other iudgement,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.</note> where not men with their lewde
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1416:293"/>
iudgement, but God hym selfe shall truely iudge, and make voyde and of no force the Popes excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and shal at the last day before God and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels declare vs to be his true churche. For it can none otherwise be in this lyfe, then as Christe sayeth here: that there shall be two churches, and one shall excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate an other, and by no meanes one abyde an other to dwell together. But excommunication is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer publikely exercised of the true Churche agaynste the false churche. For the false churche hathe euermore for the moste parte the sworde in her hande, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defende her selfe at all tymes against suche as it fauoureth not, as we may see by the Pope: which is a moste sure argument, that he and his can not be the true churche. For as concernyng the true churche, it is in thys our Gospell playnly declared, that it shalbe excommunicated, vngentilly intreated, and miserably handled. They shall (saythe Christe) caste you out of the synagoges. Who are those Yow? Are they not the disciples and Apostles of Christ? They shall kyll you, (saythe he.) Who? Euen they, that call theym selues the Churche.</p>
               <p>And thus also goeth the matter euen at thys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent daye. Therfore thys excommunicatyng and mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deryng whyche the Pope and hys churche,<note place="margin">The tokens of the true churche.</note> vseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste the sainctes of God, whyche are the trewe churche, ought not to make vs afrayde, but rather to take it ioyfully &amp; paciently, &amp; learne, that these things are the right tokens and manyfest declarations of the true and christen churche, yet so, that there be lykewise aboue all thynges the true knowledge of Christe and of hys Father. For the Anabaptistes and other sectes do suffer persecution also, but they haue not the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:1416:294"/>
of Christe and of his father, but they brynge in, and sette vp a newe kynd of monkery, and thorough thys they looke to be saued, and to haue God mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto them. But contrary wyse, the true Churche knoweth Christe and hys Father, that is to saye, it beleueth and trusteth onely in the goodnes and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye of God for Christes sake, and for that Fayth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and hope, it gladly suffreth persecution, so that whatsoeuer chanceth vnto it,<note place="margin">The true chureh taketh all troubles pacientlye and thankefuly.</note> it grudgeth not, but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently take it, because it knoweth, that Christe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied and tolde afore hande, that these thynges should so come to passe. Therefore it is well contente quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beare the tyrannie of the Pope, beyng gladde of thys, that it knoweth Christ and hys Father, where as the Pope and all his adherentes, althoughe they bragge neuer so muche of the Church, neyther know Christe nor his Father, but rather persecute them, that haue thys knowledge. Wherfore with a gladde heart and wyllynge spirite it suffreth all kynde of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wyth a sure hope, that after thys lyfe it shall reygne with Christe, and lyue with hym euerlastyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the kyngdome of his Father. To whome with the same Christe his sonne, and the holy Ghoste that moste swete comforter, be all honoure and glorye for euer and euer. Amen.</p>

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1416:299"/>
for no other cause but to receaue these gyftes of the father, and to geue them vnto vs. Wherfore in our prayers we can not doubt, for it is not onely, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God that we shoulde praye for the holye ghoste, and also promised that we shall obtayne, but also his wil is redie to geue it. For as muche as Christ therfore sitteth at the right hande of God the father, to distribute amongest vs these gyftes. For he also receaued them of the father, as it is writent in the .lxviij. psal. Not for hymselfe, but for men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.</note> to geue them vnto them. Besides prayers, there are other things, also necessary to the obtayninge of the holye Ghoste. For we muste haue a feruent studie to read or heare the worde of God, and to vse often the Sacraments, that all these thinges ioyned to gether, may make ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way for the holy ghost. For this is once for all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed of the holy ghost, to worke in vs by the worde &amp; sacramentes. He therfore that litle regarde these thinges, to him shall the holy ghost never come. For to this entent are we baptised, receaue we the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lorde, and heare the worde of God. For we know that all these thinges, are as instruments, by the whiche the holye ghoste doth accomplishe his operation in vs. As examples doth shewe. The three thousand soles, whiche were conuerted this daye of sainct Peter, had neuer ben conuerted, if they had not hearde the worde before.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</note> After that they heard the worde, and their heartes were therby moued, they came to baptisme. For Christ so commanded.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 28. <hi>Marc.</hi> 16.</note> So the chamberlain of the Quene of Aethiops could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the holy ghost without the worde, whiche Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippe spake by the interpretinge of scripture.<note place="margin">

                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:300"/>When his heart was touched by the preachynge of Philippe, it behoued hym also to receaue baptisme, that the holy Ghoste myghte worke therby.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if thou be desirous to haue the holye Ghost, first of all thou must pray to the father, for it, and after that thou muste geue diligent hede to the worde and preachinge, thou must often call to minde thy baptisme, what God promised thee there, and what maner of couenaunt he hath made ther with thee. Thou must often come to the Lords Supper. For by the worde and sacraments the holy ghost doth kendle oure heartes with a new light of fayth, that we maye not onely heare the worde, as the harde hearted Iewes dyd heare, but that we maye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it also, &amp; that therby we may become new men, and get vs new heartes. Furthermore we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that we do not let the holy Ghost in his worke by fylthy and shamfull liuinge, and that we caste hym not out of vs by wanton an sinfull maners. For one place can not serue both for the holy Ghost and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.<note place="margin">The lyfe is godly to be ordered.</note> Therfore when the deuill tempteth the with couetousnes, wrath, lechery, and other synnes, flee straight waye to prayer, as thou woldest to an anker in a tempeste, that GOD maye preserue thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst temptation, and kepe the obedient vnto hym. For it is necessary to abstayne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinne &amp; the workes of the fleshe, eyther that the holy ghost may remayne with thee styll after thou hast receaued hym, or that thou mayst obtayne hym, that was neuer in thee: or if by infirmitie thou chaunce to fall, thou mayst ryse again, &amp; retourne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> newnes of liuing. And then spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially shal we perceaue that the holy ghost must nedes take place in vs, and helpe vs against the deuil, death

and hell, wheras contrarie wyse, they that continew in voluntarie synnes willinglye, by a lytle and a lytle fall more and more into the deuils power, &amp; liue with out all repentaunce, and neuer are part takers of the holy Ghost, whose proper office it is as I sayd before, first to sanctifie vs thorowe faith and remission of our synnes, and then to be an helpe vnto vs against sinne,<note place="margin">The office of the holye ghoste.</note> that we may shewe obedience to God. But we saide before, that we receaue only the first frutes of the holy ghost, and that fleshe and bloud doth yet remaine in vs, &amp; shall as longe as we liue, &amp; abide in this worlde.</p>
               <p>And herof it is that they, whiche haue receaued the holy ghost, are neuerthelesse weake, and doth fal often. Let no man here be offended and thinke, as the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes do. whiche are of this opinion, that no man can fal which haue receaued the holy ghost. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion shold be true if euery man would folow the holy ghost alwayes. For than shold we neuer fal. But that is not possible, because of the craftes and giles of the deuil, and the offences of the worlde, and the infirmitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleshe. Wherfore it is alwayes necessarie to praye, that the lord wil not take his spirit from vs, but that he wil of his goodnes kepe vs in his grace,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:1416:302"/>
this worde? why doth he make mention of loue, and speaketh not after his olde customable maner, saying, he that beleueth in me?

For I geue not goods, nor golde, but euerlastinge life,<note place="margin">Loue doth all thinges.</note> wherof the possession is not taken in this life, but after this life. Wherfore all the matter resteth herein, that ye loue me. If loue be in you, ye wil kepe my saing, and contineue constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, although that ye should do it to the perill of your life. But if ye loue me not, ye wil not kepe my wordes. For ye shall haue so many dangers, calamities, and afflictions, that they shall make you faint and put you in desperation. But he that knoweth Christe truly beleueth in hym, and loueth him,<note place="margin">Loue proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of fayth.</note> he is troubled by no aduersitie. For he thinketh surely, Christ dyed and was buried for vs, and rose againe: wherby all suche ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther surely that Christ doth greatlye fauor them. So that this loue procedeth of faith, which afterward is able to withstand all perils and dangers, neither doth it feare the greate threatnings &amp; wrath of the worlde. For it setteh more by Christ and his worde, then by all these threatnings and displeasures of men.</p>

For the worde of Iesu Christ is the fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and pillar of all thinges. He that hath this, saith Christ, neither suffereth hymselfe to be plucke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence,<note place="margin">How god is to be knowen.</note> ought not to doubt, but my father doth loue him. And this is the peculiar phrase of Iohn, whiche hath a proper kynde of speache, beside all other Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes, that first he ioyneth men to Christe, and then thorough Christ bringeth them to the father. For this is the order and proces in this matter: As Christ here teacheth, that first we must know Christ, &amp; loue hym, and take him for one that is most desirous of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and profit.<note place="margin">Note well.</note> When we haue suche trust &amp; loue toward Christ, there foloweth also a sure confidence, that the father also loueth vs. And although we had none other confort before our eyes, but only this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauinge and vnderstanding, that we nede not feare any crueltie, or any wrothe or yre of God: yet were that sufficient to certifie vs, that we nede not feare synne or the deuill, because god loueth vs, for that, that we loue Christe.</p>
               <p>This is a great confort in all tribulation, to beleue constantly that GOD is not againste vs,<note place="margin">A great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort</note> but he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinglye embraceth vs, if so be that we loue Christe &amp; kepe his worde stedfastly. But in the tyme of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, oure heartes can hardlye thus be persuaded. But we thinke rather contrariwise, that God hateth vs, and hath no regard to vs, but that he goeth about
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1416:303"/>
rather to prouide punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for vs. But these thinges are false. For Christe doth not lye, whan he sayth: yf we procede so farre, that we loue hym, and count it abhominable to hate hym, that then we muste not doubt, but the father doth loue vs and will so declare hys loue toward vs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.</note> that he wyth his sonne and the holy ghost will haue their abyding with vs. It is a greate matter, and a singuler confort,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> that a righteous man by fayth doth not say in his heart, who is ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in to heauen? &amp;c. For in whatsoeuer place he be,<note place="margin">What it is to be in heauen.</note> whether he be at Ierusalem, or at Rome, or in the felde or in the Citie, he is taken to be in heauen, for that that god the father, the sone and the holy ghoste, doth come vnto hym and haue their abydinge with hym. And this thing haue we heare in this lyfe in the worde, and do fele it inwardly by fayth, but all these thinges shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be felte in dede in the lyfe to come.</p>
               <p>For, to haue god dwelling in vs in this lyfe,<note place="margin">What it is to haue god dwel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyng in vs.</note> is none other thynge then that all thinges that we do, saye, thinke, or suffer, are acceptable vnto God, and that al thinges, when we eate, drinke, worke, slepe, wache, praye, reade, singe, learne, &amp;c? are alowed of hym.

For the glory of the godly doth herein passe the glory of heauen. For God sayth not so by heauen, that he will dwel in it: but thus he sayth, that heauen is his seat, and the Earth his footestole. But the heart of the godly is the very habitation, wherin god dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, if so be that he can but so much apprehende Christ, that he beleue surely, that he suffred and died for vs, &amp; for these benefits loue him.</p>
               <p>And so all thinges are consistinge in this, that we
<pb facs="tcp:1416:304"/>
should loue Christ, and as for the rest there is no cause why any man should greatly feare. For this loue shal make all other thinges easie and tollerable, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shal chaunce for hym and his worde sake: where as contrariwise without this loue all thynges shall seme intollerable and aboue all mens power, as Christ sayth in the wordes folowing.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Where as Christe is loued, this is also certayne, that the father for Christes sake doth loue againe; and doth not onely loue vs, but commeth vnto vs, and he with Christ &amp; the holy ghost maketh his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng with vs. This thing is so great, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if we consider it well we could not but patiently suffer all thynges, that chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto vs for Christs sake. Where this loue of Christe is not, and wheras men receaueth the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to the entent,<note place="margin">Spollers of church goods</note> that they maye inuade the Churche goodes, and make hauoke therof to their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and commoditie, and to serue their owne lustes, (as it is the fashion of the worlde in all thynges to seke his owne vantage and profit) ther can not the worde of Christ be long kepte. For it is very necessary to haue loue, if a man wyll be constant in trouble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite &amp; gaines doth nothyng helpe in this case. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we loue godlines in dede, that we wold not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the golspel, we must so vse all thinges, that we may saye: In the name of our Lord Iesu Christe was this begon, and by his commandement do we this: Wherfore no case so harde can moue vs, but that we take all things well in worth that God sendeth. But what is the cause that we should styke vnto the worde so constantly, and that we shold geue no place
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1416:304"/>
to anye danger or perill? Surelye because Christe sayth furthermore:<note place="margin">That Christ keth god spea speakethe.</note> the worde that I speake is not myne, but my fathers, whiche sent me. And after this maner doth Christe often times speake. And this is the pyth of that that Christ speaketh: If ye do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue me and embrace me, that is, my worde and promesse, then be ye sure of this, that the true GOD hath receaued you, neyther must ye thinke besides of any other GOD. For ye shall find god no wher els but in me and in my worde. The reason why is, that the worde that I speake is not mine, but the worde of my father, If ye receaue this worde, ye receaue my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If ye beleue in it, ye beleue in my father. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe it is easie to iudge howe the worlde stande. Mahumet, the Turke, the Pope, the Iewes do crake much of GOD, they praye muche, and affirme them selues to be the true worshippers of GOD. But the matter is plaine, that Mahumet, the Turke, the pope, the Iewes do not fynde the father, neither knowe anye thynge of hym. For they haue not the worde of Christ, which is not Christes, but the fathers.</p>
               <p>Wherfore Christe by these wordes geueth a sure doctrine to beware by, as thoughe he shoulde saye: Yf ye will heare GOD, and haue hym ioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, ye must tourne awaye your eyes and eares in no case from him. But heare me and ye heare God, see me, &amp; ye see God. For this it is decreed: eyther must ye heare god by me, or neuer heare him. Wherof this muste by reason folowe, that Christe, when he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the bountefull worde, the hole godhed doth alow it, so that neyther the deuyll nor the worlde can make it frustrat and false. The reason is this. Christs word is not his, but the fathers, as he saith: the wordes
<pb facs="tcp:1416:305"/>
that ye heare are not mine, but my fathers that sent me. The wordes be so simple and plaine that nothyng can be more simple and plaine. Wherfore whan the men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are worldly wyse chaunceth vpon these words, they thynke that they are but wordes coldlye &amp; slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly spoken, &amp; that in great and wayghtie matters he woulde haue vsed more earnest and pythye wordes.<note place="margin">vexacion ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge.</note> Howbeit what great matter there is included in these wordes that are so basse and slender, that doth then appeare, when great perill and feare is at hande.</p>
               <p>Wherfore Christ here maketh an ende of his sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and saith these thinges haue I spoken to you, whan I was byding with you? but the holy ghost the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, whome my father will send in my name, he shal teache you all thynges,<note place="margin">Wyth out the in warde tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge of the holy ghost out warde doctrin profiteh lytle.</note> and shall put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of those thinges whiche I haue spoken vnto you. For if a man shoulde bestowe neuer so manye wordes yet if the holy ghoste shoulde be lackynge, the matter coulde not be perceaued. Nowe whatsoeuer remaineth in this gospell, it is the conclusion of the whole sermon, that Christ in this chapter made to his Disciples, that they should be of good confort, and not be troubled, nor offended for the spiteful death, that he shoulde suffer, and so be dismayd, forasmuche as they shold therby obtayne their saluation. Of this dyd we speake here tofore. Therfore nowe we wilbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with this doctrine that we haue taught, which Christ doth cheifly entreate of in this part, that then specially shall we kepe the worde, and shall not go from it for feare of any peril,<note place="margin">With out christ no good thinge cometh to vs.</note> if so be that we loue god. And that this is the onely waye to make God loue vs, and to come so nighe vnto vs, that he dwell in vs. But he that goeth to God by any other waye, then by the loue
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1416:305"/>
of Christe, he fleeth frome God, and can neuer come nygh vnto hym, and whatsoeuer he dothe or suffreth, all is but loste labour and in vayne.</p>
               <p>Wherfore seyng that our Lord saith, that these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that he spake, are not his, but the fathers: all men ought to take diligent hede, and to beware, that they receaue no other doctrine or worde, but that that com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth foorth of this mouth: For then surely is there a perfect waye to seke out God, that can not deceaue, where as otherwise God can not be sought and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out by any meanes. But it chanceth nowe a days as it chaunced amongest the Iewes. They hadde their mercy seate, and their tabernacle, where they dyd pray, and trusted certaynly, that they should be heard there and no where els. But what dyd they? They refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the places that God appointed theym, and chose them selues certaine places as they thought good in theyr owne eyes. So commeth it to passe euen now. Christ saith: If ye purpose to serche out God, and bee desyrous to make hym to loue you: fyrste come vnto me, loue me, and receaue my worde. But what doth the Pope? what doo the Anabaptistes, the Iewes, the Turkes, and suche lyke? they lay asyde Christ and his worde, and applye theyr myndes to mens traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Pope trusteth in Masses, vowes, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steynyng from mariage. The Anabaptistes in theyr streight kynde of lyuyng, in their homely apparell, and vndefenced trauaile. The Iewes and Turkes haue theyr order also. These thynges must wee diligentely eschewe: Christ and his word is onely to be imbraced For this is Gods commaundement, heare him. And Christ saieth here: The wordes that I speake, be not myne, but my fathers. Wherfore it is vnpossible,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 17.</note> that
<pb facs="tcp:1416:306"/>
he that dothe not loue Christ, and herken to hym on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, shoulde heare God, and come vnto hym. Nowe the mercyful Father graunt vs his grace, that we may loue Christe, and kepe his woorde, and that we maye through the holy Ghoste constantely cleaue therto, and so come to euerlastyng lyfe.

For the woordes be suche, that they can ease a mynde that is troubled, and restore to lyfe agayne, the soule that is dead, yf so be that they beleue them stedfastly. But forasmuche as it is not possible, that a man shold sufficiently expresse thys sermon of Christ by wordes: Fyrst lette vs call vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> that he wyll expound these woordes more playnely in our heartes, then we can by oure wordes and interpretation, and that hee wyll enkendle them, and make theym so playne, that our conscience may receaue conforte and peace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Amen.</p>
               <p>The pythe of this excellent sermon is: That God so greatly loued the world, that he deliuered his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten son for it, that we men shold not dye, but haue euerlastyng life. As though Christ shold say: Beholde, I wyll shew the such a thyng, as thou neuer heardest of, and put forthe before thee such an ensample as thou neuer hast sene or heard: Where he that geueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gift, and he that receaueth the gift for to geue to other, and where the profit and gaines are so great, that no man by words can expresse them. And fyrst let vs se who is the geuer. Here is no mencion made of kyngs,<note place="margin">God geueth·</note> of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; of other mighty personages in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, but God himself is set forth, which is incomprehensible and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtie, which made all things by his word,<note place="margin">God is deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> and still dothe preserue them, which is aboue al, and in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of whom, al things create, heuen, earth, &amp; al that is therin, are but as dust. He is the geuer, in respect of whom, all Princes and Kynges, with all their gyftes, are nothing in comparison. And oure heartes myght worthely bee lifte vp and exalted with a godly pryde,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:307"/>
in that we haue suche a geuer, so that all that shoulde chance vnto vs by any other liberalitie, might be coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted of no price in comparison of this. For what thyng can be sette before vs, that is more magnificent and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellent then God almightie?</p>
               <p>Here God, whiche is infinite and vnspeakable, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth after suche a sort,<note place="margin">Gods vndeser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued liberalite.</note> as passeth also all thynges. For that that he geueth, he geueth not as wages of desert, or for a recompence, but as the wordes dothe sounde of mere loue. Wherfore this gyft is wholly proceding of Gods excedyng and diuine beneuolence and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as he saith: God loued the worlde. There is noo greater vertue then Loue.<note place="margin">Loue refuseth no perell.</note> As it may hereby be wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that when we loue any thyng, we will not sticke to put our lyfe in danger for it. Uerily great ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues are pacience, chastitie, sobrietie. &amp;c. but yet they ar nothing to be compared with this vertue, which com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>priseth and includeth in it self all other vertues. A good man dothe no man wrong:<note place="margin">Loue excelleth all vertues.</note> he geueth euery man hys owne: but by loue, men geue their owne selues to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ar redy with all their heart to do all that thei can for them. So Christe saith here also, that God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to vs, not by right or merite, but by this greate vertue, that is by loue. This ought to encourage our heartes, and to abolysh all sorow, when this exceding loue of God commeth in mynde, that we might truste therto, and beleue stedfastly, that God is that bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifull and great geuer, and that this gifte of his procedeth of the great vertue of Loue.</p>

As the kynde, louynge, and syncere mynde of the geuer is most acceptable in giftes geuynge. So contrarywise
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1416:307"/>
when men perceaue not what is the mynde of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, they regarde the gifte so muche the lesse. Yea and where as gyftes be sclender and faultie in the thynge, as if they be maymed, or halfe blynd, or hath any other fault: yet if they come of loue and of a fatherly mynde, is not one eie in this case, or one foot more acceptable then many eies and fete without this condition? And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of Christ are playn, that God loueth vs.<note place="margin">Baptisme and the lordes supper.</note> Wherfore for this loues sake ought we greately to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme all thynges, that he geue vs. And especially those gyftes, whiche are ordeyned and geuen of hym to vs for our saluation and confirmation of oure faithe, as Baptisme, and the Supper of the Lord is. &amp;c. For all be it that the worlde doth not regard these thyngs, yet they ought to be estemed for oure chiefe felicitie, that by them we myght put asyde all sorowe, and be ioyful in heart, forasmuche as these thinges are of a fatherly loue and beneuolence ordeyned for our saluation.</p>
               <p>Wherfore Christ in this place sheweth not only that the father will geue vs any thinge,<note place="margin">God geuethe vs all thinges of loue.</note> but also he descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the way, how the father will geue vs, that is, of a fatherly and of a godlye loue. And as hytherto wee haue spoken of the geuer, and of his louyng mynde: so is the gyfte it selfe no lesse to be estemed.<note place="margin">Christ is the gyfte that god geuethe.</note> For God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not riches here, nor kyngdoms, nor any creature but geueth his onely begotten sonne, which is no lesse than the father. If wealth and prosperitie causeth ioy, howe great ioy ought this gift to be to them that it is geuen vnto? For as God the geuer is excedyng great, and his loue also, wherof the gyfte procedeth: So is the gyft that he geueth, which is his onely sonne. For he geueth hym selfe wholly in this gyft, as Paul saith to the Romains: seyng God hath geuen for vs all, his

               <p>Wherfore if we beleue truly, and receiue this moste excellent gift by faith, it must nedes be that euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fautie or not fautie, muste be ours, and geuen to our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, as saint Paule saith in an other place: Al things ar ours,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phas, either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, or life or deth.

What is the cause that we sette so lyghtly by suche an hygh gift, and do not embrace it worthily as we ought to doo? The deuyll truly, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che casteth a myste ouer our heartes, that we care not for the worde and promise, as touchyng this gifte, but in the meane tyme we bestow all our cares in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thynges.<note place="margin">Why we sett so lyghtlye by gods gyfte.</note> Wherfore in the beginnyng I sayde, that these woordes oughte dayely to be rehersed and vsed,

For so is not god distinct in his substance, but there is one only substance of god. Wherfore although there be three persons, god the father &amp; god the sonne, and god the holy Ghost: yet in substance they can not be deuided or discerned.

                  </gap>ragrammaton,</hi> whiche is only attribute and geuen to God, because the only true God hath so said. But Paule pronounceth precisely, who was this god: euen Christ. Hym, saith he, do we tempte euen as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of them tempted him. Let him scof out this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that will: surely I can not. For Paule saith, that it was Christ, whom they tempted. But Moses saith, that it was the onely true God. But at that tyme was not Christe borne, nor Marie his mother, no not so muche as Dauid was borne. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb facs="tcp:1416:316"/>
this Paule saieth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Iewes, which were than in the desert and not yet come into the lande of Canaan: tempted Christe, and admonished vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that we should not do likewise, least we fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lyke punishement. These wordes do proue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlye,<note place="margin">Moses and paule confese christe to be god.</note> that Christ is that man of whome Moyses wrote, that he is the onely, eternall, almighty God. Therfore Moyses and Paule doth confesse with one mouth, although the wordes be diuers, that Christ is true and eternall God.</p>
            <p>Lyke testimonies are in the new testament &amp; that very man, whiche can not be denied, but that a man may firmelie proue by them, that Christ is God, and therfore that he is begotten of the father, and hath a certaine difference from the father, thou mayst call it with what name thou wilte, we call it a person, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this name is not sufficient. But otherwise we can not name him. For we haue no proper vocable, so that the father and the sonne are not one person, and yet are they one vnseparable and indiuisible sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and nature, that whatsoeuer is spoken of the father, maye also be spoken of the sonne, excepte this that the father doth begett the sonne eternallie, and not the sonne the father.</p>
            <p>So Paule also sayth to the Ephesians at Miletum wher he byddeth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 20.</note> farewell: Take hede to you and to the flocke, in the which the holy Ghost hath put you, that ye fede the congregation of god, whiche he hath purchased by his bloud. This is also a plaine sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that <hi>CHRIST</hi> whiche by his bloud pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased the congregation, is GOD. For this is of a certaynetie, that the church belongeth to none but to God. For she acknowledgeth no man for hyr God.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:1416:316"/>
Wherefore if Christ hath purchased it, and it be his, it must nedes be, that he is God. But truly it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne that he hath purchased it by his bloud, wherfore it must nedes folow, that Christ is true God, &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally begotten of god the father, &amp; borne into the world of the virgin Mary temporallye and corporallie. For so saith Paule here, vnto the pastours: Take hede to your selues, it is no small charge that ye haue, to fede the congregation of god, that is to saye a multitude, whome god hath purchased by his bloud. And this it is to put teachers in remembrance of their hard fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; dutie.<note place="margin">He speaketh of the popyshe Byshoppes.</note> For although we haue not the orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and apparell of bishoppes, yet is our ministration bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more certain, than theirs. God graunt that we may execute it better, then many of them do. There be many moe lyke sentences in the Gospel of Iohn, as touchyng the godhed of Christe, and yet that the father &amp; the sonne are distincte persons. Which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be ouercome by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iesting of the Iewes &amp; Turkes. Ther is in the new testament great store of such testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis, wheras y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter is plaine &amp; very certain. Ther be many also in the olde, but more darke then these of the new. As Iohn in his gospel alludeth very properly to Moyses,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.</note> where as he calleth Christ for his eternall natiuitie, the worde. For so doth Moyses entreate the matter, that god before the makyng of all thinges, had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word with him, &amp; that it was almightie, as he is, &amp; that god by this word made all things. Here must it nedes be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is a diuine substance, betwene god and the word. For both be coeternal, and yet for all that, he that speake the word, and the word it selfe that is spoken, be two distinct persons.

            <p>And here again shold we acknoledge our felicitie be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore god &amp; that with thankes geuing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in such hard ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticles, we haue suche notable, plaine &amp; excellent testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holye scriptures,<note place="margin">The holye ghost is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtye god.</note> wherby we may stablishe our heartes, &amp; leane therto strongly against the deuill &amp; all the worlde. We haue no nede of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s record. But Christ himselfe doth testifie, and teache very plainely, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy spirit is eternal &amp; almightie god.

            <p>But what is this third person, Christ doth declare.

            <p>This sentence and many suche other as concerning the holy ghost, were the very same wherwith, the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly fathers dyd defend this article against the deuil and the worlde, and hath maintained it vnto our time, that we beleue onely in one god, and do confesse further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, that this one god is god the father, god the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne and god the holy ghost eternally. It is not, as the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes saye and triflingly imagin, that these three na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes do signifie but one person, whiche hath diuerslye shewed forth their selues at diuers times. If they are troubled with this article because it seme absurde, to reason what is that to me? For if a man myght reason in this matrer, surely I coulde do that and not all of the worste, ye and perchaunce better then any Iewe or Turke can. But I count this thinge as the greate benefite of god, that I do not dispute of this article, whether it be true and agreable to reason, but wheras I see that it is so plainly set forth in scripture and hath suche a sure fundation, I beleue god more, than my owne reason, neither do I any thinge care, howe this shoulde be true, that ther is but one substance &amp; three persons in one substance.</p>
            <p>For we go not about here to shewe whether the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:1416:319"/>
trueth may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded by a forme of reason, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be certayne by the worde of god. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of god holdeth with thee, care for no more. It wil not deceaue thee. Wher as the word then is certaine and euident, as it is proued, and this article is maintained of the holy fathers with suche constancie and power, stycke thou also surelye therto, and dispute not muche, how the father, the sonne and the holy ghost maye be one god. Thou canst not know precisely, what is the cause of laughing in the face, neither what is the cause of the sight of the eyes, that they see a thing so farre of. And also when thou slepest, wherof it commeth, that as muche as belongeth to the bodie, thou art deade, &amp; yet a lyue? We can not know a very litle thing of our owne reason, &amp; yet we presume to go vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to searche &amp; comprehend god in his maiestie with our reason. Why do we not first begin to serche our selues after that sorte, &amp; first learne to know wher lyeth the operation of our senses, when we slepe? Ther might we dispute without perill. But in this article there is great peril. And here we must stycke surely &amp; simplely to the worde, which sayth of Christ,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.</note> that he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of the father, and his first begotten before al creatures, that is, he is no creature, but eternall god, as there are many testimonies in Iohn.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.</note> All thinges are geuen to me from my father, he that seeth me, seeth my father. Doste thou not beleue that I am in the father, and the father is in me? There is no place for cauillations in this thyng. God hath spoken and sayd, that ther is no difference betwene the father and the sonne, then in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne is begotten of the father. But how this sholde be done, how this eternall generation shold be, we can not know, only know we this, that (as the scripture
<pb facs="tcp:1416:320"/>
sayth,) he is the first begotten before all creatures, and the image of the inuisible god in nature. So doth scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture also teache of the third person, euen of the holye Ghost, which is called the spirit of God.</p>
            <p>And as it is taught before, he procedeth from the father that is,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> he hath his substance of the father, so that ther is no part of godhed wisdom, veritie, power in the father: whiche is not also in the holy Ghoste. But how this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe, I can not expresse: for it can not be by reason comprehended and it is aboue all angels and creatures. Wherfore we must thynke and beleue no further of this, than is declared in scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but to the wordes therof we may surely sticke. But to know that perfectly is a thynge not belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to this lyfe, but vnto the lyfe to come. Wherfore we must differre the vnderstandyng of these, and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute theron, but beleue plainelye and simplye, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the scripture affirmeth of this matter. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle is very well set forth in the articles of faith. And firste of all this is euident and agreed vpon amongest all men, that we are not the first inuenters of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. Neither are the holy fathers the authors therof. But they collected it out of the writynges of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Prophetes very shortly and compendious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, euen as bees of many floures gather honye. Here first we saye: I beleue in God the father. This is the first person in the godhed.<note place="margin">God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> And these are his proper workes, in that he his omnipotent, and the creatour, which made all thinges &amp; preserueth all thinges vnto this time: In this worke is the father described. After that we say: And I beleue furthermore in one person, which is also god.<note place="margin">God the sonne</note> For we must beleue in none els but in only god. What is the name of this person? His only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:1416:320"/>
son Iesus Christ. So hath al christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men prayed &amp; beleued, now more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thousand &amp; v. hundred yeres. Yea rather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first beginning of the worlde. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this article hath not at al times so plainlye ben forth, but hath ben taught at diuers times after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sortes. For fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the son of god was called the sede of the woman. After y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was it named the sede of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of Iacob of Dauid, &amp; so forth. And al this is but that onely man Iesus Christ: Yea the angels also are called the sonnes of god, &amp; so are al godli me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; are so in dede, but neither is there Angell nor any other godly man whiche may be called the only begotten. Wherfore only this Christ is so begotten of the father, as the sonne, to whome he hath none like nother in the angel nother in creatures Wherefore it is euident therby, that he is also God. This do we beleue and confesse, and our children also with all Christian men and women.</p>
            <p>After this confession foloweth there a rehersall of his workes and office,<note place="margin">The workes and office of christe.</note> what the sonne of God hath es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallye done: That he was conceaued by the holy Ghoste, borne of the virgin Marie, suffered vnder Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried, and rose from the dead, and ascended into heauen, and sytteth at the ryght hande of god the father almightie, And here doth he retourne again to his godhed, that he may be knowen and beleued of all men, that he is the Image of the father and lyke vnto God. And this I say againe that we inuented not these wordes, but receaued them of the congregation as a man woulde by hand to hand.</p>
            <p>Thirdly we saye: I beleue in the holy ghost. Here we geue lyke glorie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghost,<note place="margin">God the holye ghoste.</note> as we geue to the
<pb facs="tcp:1416:321"/>
father and to the sonne wheras we beleue in him. So that this article is plainlie comprehended in the como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crede,<note place="margin">The crede of the holy ghost</note> and that so wel, that it can not be better, so that it may wel be called the crede of the Apostles. For it was scarsely a thyng possible for any other beside the Apostles, to comprise it so simplely and certainly. Nowe what be the workes of the holy Ghoste,<note place="margin">The workes and office of the holy ghost</note> it is plainely also described, that is, that he gathereth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the churche out of all languages, and ioyneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together in the vnitie of fayth, &amp; doth sanctifie them, by the remission of synnes, and doth enkendle in them the hope of remission of sinnes, as we saye: I beleue the remission of synnes,<note place="margin">The workes of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> the resurrection of the fleshe, &amp; lyfe euerlastyng.</p>
            <p>So here be comprised verie properly in the crede the three persons in one diuine substance, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse euery person is set forth with the orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his owne office and propertie. To the father is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute and geuen the creation, To the sonne, redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the holy ghost, the power of sanctification, and makyng holy. That is, that he doth distribute pacifie and confirme, the remission of synnes, and transpose vs from death vnto euerlastyng lyfe. These are as a man wolde say certaine markes and differences, that the persons may not be confusely put together, but distinctly discerned,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</note> that the father is the creatour, &amp; Christe becometh man, &amp; the holy ghost cometh wyth tounges like fire, and pacifieth mens heartes. All these are the workes of the only god. But accordyng to the distinction of the offices and properties, we must make a distinction also of persons. For god the father was not made man, and the sonne dyd not shew forth himselfe in fyerie tounges. These are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proper workes
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:1416:321"/>
of the sonne and of the holy ghoste.</p>
            <p>Wherfore this article was deliuered vnto vs: we made it not. And this we know also by histories, that <hi>GOD</hi> hath defended this article with great plagues, and hath punished the heretikes, that went about to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow it, with great punishement. Wherefore we must nedes sticke constantly vnto it, and not forsake the word, neither must we reason or dispute any thing in this matter. For thus saieth the hystorie,<note place="margin">Cherinthus the heryetike denied the god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>head of christ.</note> that Iohn was constreigned to write his Gospell, especially for the heretike Cherinthus sake, whiche dyd denie Christ his godhead, and blasphemed hym.</p>
            <p>It chanced that Iohn, and they that wer with him entred into a bathing house, in the which when he saw Cherinthus a washyng,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ecclesi. hist. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</note> by and by he and his disciples went out with hast, saying this withall: let vs flee w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all hast possible fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this blasphemer. And they say, that not long after, the bathe fell on hym,<note place="margin">Examples of gods anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as denied the god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>head of christ.</note> and slew Cherin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thus the enemie of truthe. And the end of Arrius the heretike was not muche better. He was the head and author of great disturbance and tumult in the church, which endured in the church more then foure hundred yeres. In so much that not euen now can the sparkles of this vngodlynes be que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched and extinct out of the myndes of the common sorte. He dydde graunt, that Christ was borne of God before all creatures, but yet that he was a creature, and neuerthelesse farre better and worthier then all other be. And wher as all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full byshoppes in euery place, dyd (as it was meete) resyste thys blasphemie, and many variances and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions dydde ryse thereof: it pleased Constantinus the Emperour to quenche this flame, whiche at Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea gathered together a councell of many learned men
<pb facs="tcp:1416:322"/>
and godly byshops, which condemned the error of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. And when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not long after Constantinus was dead, and his sonne Constantine, whiche was fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Arrius, was made Emperor, they that were Arrians laboured with all their power to restore Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius agayne from the excommunication: And when that Arrius on a certayne day, was commyng to the churche to be receaued agayne into the congregation, in the waye he was taken with a great griping in the bealye, And thereby was fayne to go out of the way to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon place of easement,<note place="margin">An <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For as touching this article, and the doctrine that thervnto belongeth, we haue spoken in our former ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon more plentuously. Now therfore wil we entreae in order of this gospel, and all the partes therof. Christ entreth into a long disputation with Nicodemus, the chiefe of the Phariseis among the Iewes, and that of a matter, that Nicodemus coulde not vnderstande the doctrine therof, because it semed strange vnto him, for lacke of custome therto,<note place="margin">Nicodemus a louer of christ</note> and because he was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:1416:324"/>
to an other kynd of doctrine. Nicodemus beyng no euyll man, declareth bothe by word and dede, how highly he estemeth Christ, where as he setteth so much by him, whom his own companions hate so extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and commeth vnto hym (albeit by night) to testifie this openly before Christ, that he acknowledgeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God to be in him, and doth not condemne him against his conscience as dyd the other Phariseis and Scribes. Neither is it to be counted blame worthy in this man, that he doth acknowlege Christ for the man of God, and thinketh him worthy to be receiued of all men, for that that he is sent from god. What is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause then that Christ doth seme to receaue this man after an vngentyll sort, which gaue suche an excellent praise as concernynge Christe? Uerilye, there was a verye deadly error in this man, whiche ought not to be ouer passed of Christ: least that he should seme to consent to Nicodeme in such a great matter, wherof yet he was most blamelesse. For as touching the knowlege of god he shewed himself here, to be very perfect and certain, in this that he pronounceth, that he knoweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ was sent from God to be a teacher, &amp; in that he toke the miracles which Christ dyd, for the very workes of God. But Christ doth declare by his answere, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he reproueth Nicodemus opinion, as touchyng the kyngdome of God, what this knowledge preuayleth. Nicodemus therefore thynketh this, that he knoweth what is the kyngdome of God, bycause he knowethe God, and vnderstandeth how al things are wrought and gouerned by hym. It were true, that if he knewe <hi>GOD</hi> well, he muste nedes knowe hys kyngdome. But bycause the firste is false, <hi>CHRIST</hi> rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him in the laste: that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knoweth not what
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1416:324"/>
is the kyngdom of God, as he thynketh that he doth. Wherfore all the disputation standeth in this poynte, what is the kyngdome of God, and who dothe see it, and know it. Nicodemus neuer had other opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this tyme, but that the kyngdom of God had his description in the lawe, that out of it might be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the holynes and sanctitie of God, &amp; the whiche ought to be performed and fulfylled of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yf they wold liue with God most holy in his kyngdom.<note place="margin">The opinion of nicodemus as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of sal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uacion.</note> He ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer thought, how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> synne can not be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by the lawe, and that the lawe should be but a testimony to declare to vs our synne, that it myght be a begynning of a hygher knowledge, as concernynge God and hys kyngdome in vs. For he that is ignorant of the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, is ignorant bothe of God, and also of his kyngdome. Wherfore we muste not haue respecte to the iustice of our workes, but vnto the remission of synne, if thou woldest know God truly and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome And this kyngdome of God doth consyst in the reuelation of the promises and of the sonne of God.<note place="margin">

This newe and strange saying of Christ, as touching the kingdom of God, troubled Nicodemus so greatly, that he could not tell whether to go.<note place="margin">Why nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus came to christe.</note> But there is no better way to make playn this matter then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nicodemus came not to Christ to bee instructed with the knowledge of the kyngdome of God, but to shewe hym, that he was not stubborne as his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were, and that he was not out of the kyngdom of God, and he loketh for no other thynge of Christe, then to bee allowed for his wisedome. Hee coulde not thinke, but that he should be in hygh reputation with Christ: but Christ setteth nothyng by the frendshyp of Nicodeme, before he had instructed hym with suche a
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:1416:325"/>
doctrine. that he myght perceaue the errour not onely of the foolyshe and ignorant phariseis, but also of the wisest, as touchyng the Iustice of the lawe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth his disputation (wherewith he endeuoureth to confute Nicodeme, and all other, that had no true opinion of the kyngdom of God, and to enstruct them as concernyng the true iudgement of these thynges, by a holy othe, saying:
<q>Uerily, verily, I say vnto thee: except thou be borne a new from aboue, thou canst not see the kyngdome of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This dothe Christ call into question, whiche Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus neuer thought to moue. Wherfore by the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn demandyng and contrarying in an vnknowen matter, he is so abashed, that he could not tell what to answere,<note place="margin">The ignoranc of nicodemus.</note> but that he muste nedes declare his own ignorance, wher as he knoweth nothyng at all as con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cernyng how a synner must be regenerate and newe born to the kyngdom of God. And now consyder here well the pithe of Christes sayinge, where he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that no man can beholde and see the kyngdome of Christ, except he be borne a newe. For this is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined, that what soeuer is borne of fleshe and bloud by our parents, with all their powers, as farre as mans power goeth, with al their reason, wil, &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with their laws, studies, disciplines, exercises, en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deuors, facts, &amp; works can not escape damnation. And hereby doth it appere, how ouerthwart they be, which shewe vtterly as though they taught of the kyngdom of God, and of saluation, and yet as touching the new birthe they speake nothing,<note place="margin">The corrupte doctrine of the Pope concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng saluaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> but as it is euident by the Pope, they enioyn them workes to do, and traditions to folowe, that thereby they may get saluation. But
<pb facs="tcp:1416:326"/>
this is nothing agreyng with Christs doctrin. which teach plainly: if thou be not born again, thou shalt not be saued. And this thyng belongeth not only to Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus, but it pertaineth to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which can do great vertues and actes, as are the examples of the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, concernyng modestie and loue towarde parentes or countrey, iustice, and liberalitie. &amp;c. For all are not aduoutrers, nor fornicators, theues, and sluggish peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but there are notable woorkes and vertues, and surely the discipline therof is not to be despised, for as muche as God hathe greate respect and regard ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto in the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. But when they come to this especiall matter to trie, what is the way to the kingdome of God, and what way bryngeth to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the saying of Christ is playne, that all other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges worke death and damnation, that are without the new byrth and regeneration.

But when we entreat of this matter, how we must come to the kyngdom of God: there doth none of these thinges preuaile, neyther rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor will, nor lawe, nor good woorkes. But thys thing only is of stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, to be borne again: &amp; wher this is lacking, there is no hope to come to the kingdom of God.<note place="margin">An obiection concernynge good workes.</note> All our powers with the lawes and preceptes are of no efficacie and strength.

But to thynke or saye this, is an euident token of vngodlines. Wherfore do both. Fyrst see diligently to the lawe with all his woorkes, then know thy self to be a synner, and that thou canst not by thy workes escape damnation: Then turne thy selfe to the doctrine of Christ, and hearken, what hee preacheth of the kyngdom of God, after that he hath declared, that the old man can not enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. Nicodemus perceaueth the straighte Iudgement of Christ, that without the newe Byrthe, there is no hope of the kyngdom of <hi>GOD,</hi> and he is soone reformed and persuaded, that the carnall byrth healpethe nothynge thereto. And therefore he asketh howe the newe byrthe might be. And <hi>CHRIST</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1416:327"/>
And doth redyly shew a notable doctrin therof, saying on this wise:
<q>Uerily, verily I say vnto the. Except a man bee borne agayn, he can not enter into the kyngdom of God. Whatsoeuer is borne of the fleshe, is flesh, what soeuer is born of the spirit, is spirite.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the second sentence against the first byrthe shewyng that it is carnall &amp; synful, and that it can not be encouraged to obteyne the kingdome of God: As though he should say: Thou demandest, whether thou shouldest otherwise be borne of thy mothers wombe: although thou were borne a thousande tymes of thy mothers wombe, yet thou shouldest not bee borne to the kyngdom of God. Ther is no nede of father and mother to the kyngdome of God: which are also them selues fleshe, but there is nede to haue water and the spirite: but he that hath ben so borne agayne, is a new man, and shall come to the kyngdome of God. This doctrine had Nicodemus neuer learned in Moses: He had learned there what he should doo or not do by the preceptes.<note place="margin">The lawe bringeth no man vnto per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection.</note> But as touchyng this new creature, he had learned nothyng at all, not as muche as by a dreame. Wherfore he is so confounded that he graunt that all this while he had lerned nothyng at all. But the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of this sentence ar not so lyghtly to be passed ouer, the sentence is perfect, that good works must be done, and obedience is to be geuen to the lawe. But the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of the kyngdom of God cometh not hereby. But if we will come to the seyng therof, not good workes but a newe man is requisite thereto. And that is not doone by the carnall manne,<note place="margin">water in this place of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> but by water, and by the spirite. They are the verye parentes that are mete to bryng forth this new chyld of God. Water is nothyng

els but baptism.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marc.</hi> 16.</note> For so saith Christ in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> last of Marke He that beleueth, and is baptised, shall be saued. Thys strength of the water is not of his owne nature. For water is water, that is to say, an eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and creature, whiche can not change the hert, and wash away syn. But the water wherof Christ speketh here, and which we call the water of Baptisme, is not only water na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but water in the worde and promyse of God. Two things are here ioyned together, the water, &amp; the word, and are so ioyned together, that they can not be sundred. If thou sunder the water from the worde, it is no baptisme. If thou sunder the word from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, neither than is it Baptisme.<note place="margin">The worde and the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t maketh a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> But when the word and water ar ioyned together, this water is such with the whiche the holy ghost will come vnto thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate thee to the kyngdome of God. Whiche is as much to say, as to forgeue synnes, and to bryng salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This sentence therfore is not lyghtly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and especiallye because of the Anabaptistes, whiche holde opinion,<note place="margin">Anabaptistes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confuted.</note> that the Baptisme of infantes is nothyng woorth, where as yet Christ in this place, applieth water to regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to the new birth, and ioyneth it as the cause therof with the holy ghost. If children therfore haue nede of this new byrth, and can not see the kyngdome of God without it, and seynge Baptisme is ordeyned of Christ as the cause of all that muste bee newe borne: It is not onely an vnmercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thynge, but also violence in the kyngdome of god, and playne tyranny, to exclude them from Baptisme and from the kyngdome of God, for whome Christe dyed, and decreed,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:1416:328"/>
this newe byrth is also necessary for children, that they may see the kyngdome of God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Titus.</hi> 3.</note> And although the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dothe nothing profite without the holy ghost, yet the holy ghoste by the water of Regeneration muste woorke in vs, as Paule dothe so ioygne them bothe together: Accordyng to his mercy (saith he) he saued vs by the water of regeneration, and renuyng of the holy spirite, the which he shed vpon vs abundantly. This lauer or washyng can not be without regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and renuyng of the holy spirite. Wherfore the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is detestable that in certaine places dyuers prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers doo baptise chyldren without water. For it is not only requisite in baptisme to haue the word &amp; spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,<note place="margin">Christes ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naunce maye not be altered.</note> but also to haue water. For so did Christ ordein, &amp; no man hath power to change his lawe &amp; institution.</p>
            <p>The baptisme of water is seene with the eies, but the worke of Regeneration and new birth, whiche is wrought by the holy ghost inwardly, is not sene. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore this outward ceremonie of the water of baptism may not be omitted, because of the priuie and inuisible administration of the holy ghost. Christ sayth further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more vnto Nicodemus:
<q>Meruail not that I sayd vnto thee, thou muste be borne again from aboue: the wynd bloweth wher he will, and thou hearest the sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therof, but thou canst not tel fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, and whether it gothe So is euery man that is born of the Spirite.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These wordes are very simple, as the ceremonie is it selfe. For it is not estemed with reason, when an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, or an aged man is offered to make his confession on this wise, that foloweth: Behold, the yoke of synne and of the deuyll is so great, that there is no helpe or remedy against it, but that he, whether he be chyld or
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1416:328"/>
man, be baptised, and washed with water, in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the holy ghost. But here must we rather marke, what Christ sayth, where he biddeth vs rather to consyder what is done by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie operation, then by the open ceremonie &amp; outward signe. For the worke of the holy ghost is priuie &amp; hyd from the eies. Wherfore we must beleue it as it is set forthe in the worde. Thou shalte neuer perceaue it by the eies. As it chanceth in the wynd. The sound ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is heard, but we can neither declare the risynge nor the slackyng therof. So is it in the newe byrthe. The outwarde ceremonie commeth by the water vnto the eyes, and the word is heard, that the woorke is done in the name of Iesus vnto the absolution and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of synnes. He that regardeth not the worde and spirite, and the vertue thereof, and seketh it not after that sorte, as Christe hath appoynted, shall bee decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For nothyng els is requisite to the getting of the newe birth and spirite, but that thou must be baptised with water, and take diligent hede to the word.

Wherfore Christ here doth not teache, but he sheweth by a plain demonstration, baptisme, &amp; the word. And doth admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe vs, that if we will not be content to vse the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and word, that we shall haue nothing of the holye ghost, neither shall we euer atteyne to the new byrth. Wherfore let vs haue diligent regard of our baptisme and of the word, as of the chief part of our saluation. Where we know for a suretie that if we kepe that, we are new borne vnto the kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1416:329"/>And this doctrine, how we must be new borne, that is, how we must come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom of God, is stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and not heard of in the world, and yet it is only true &amp; vnfallible, where as of the contrary part, all other doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines deceaue, seme they neuer so good by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the world, &amp; of reason. The life of the phariseis, the rules of monkes, the deuotion of the single shaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, are very fantasticall. And the works of vertue &amp; of the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements do not a little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue them. Yet there is none of al these things that doth regenerate. It is only water and the spirite that doth worke these thinges, which spirite will no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be knowen of vs or felt, but as the wind is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by the sound. He that heareth the sounde, that is, beleueth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marc.</hi> 16.</note> &amp; is baptised, he is new borne, &amp; shalbe saued.</p>
            <p>But Nicodemus is so deepely drownde vp in his phantasticall imaginations of the law and good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that he can not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend this doctrine: as it doth also chaunce in those Papistes, that are moste wittie. For it hindreth them alwayes, when they think thus: should all this be nothing? should not this please God, that we fast, that we pray, that we geue almes? Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore Christ ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dleth hym with the more austeritie, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil not beleue &amp; knowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true doctrine, &amp; saith:
<q>Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these thinges?</q>
            </p>
            <p>As though he should say: How then doest thou thy dutie, as a maister of Israel, seinge thou knowest not the way of true saluation? This doctrine of the newe byrth and regeneration, is the doctrin of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets, &amp; necessarie to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now art thou so ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou doest not knowe that vice in oure nature, whiche hath neede to bee abolished by regeneration? But for what purpose is this reprouing of a maister in Israell?
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:1416:329"/>
Uerily that all preachers of religion and of true salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may know, that all learninge, which is without the doctrine of regeneration, is naught and false. Not because it is a faulte to teache good workes, and to adhorte men therto. For so doth the lawe of god, and doth wel therby. But herin are they to be blamed, that beside this doctrine they teache men nothyng els, as though nothing els were requisite to euerlastinge life. For it is euident in this place, that although the lawe and good workes be done, yet they profitte nothynge to the attainement of the kyngdome of god, but that there muste nedes be the new byrth of water &amp; of the holy ghost. And it is the spirite, which by the water &amp; worde doth make other new men. The lawe and the workes do change, neither the men, neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes. Wherfore he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thinketh with himselfe how he might bring men to saluation, let him haue respect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> newe byrth, as Christ hath here: &amp; let him not beginne it by good workes,<note place="margin">Howe salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion is to be taught.</note> but let hym laye the fundation by that thing, that can make a new heart, that is, let hym lead men to baptisme and to the spirit, ye and to the word, by the whiche the holy Ghoste doth worke in mens heartes. For as the winde nothing is knowen but the sounde, so of the holy ghost nothyng is perceaued but the worde. That must ye kepe surely, and then looke for the operation of the holy ghost. Nowe what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worde this is, and how the holy Ghoste doth make a sounde, Christe here teacheth:
<q>No man goeth vp into heauen, but he that came down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, euen the sonne of man which is in heauen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This begynninge of the sermon is of that, wherof Christe sayth: ye beleue not me, if I speake earthlye thinges to you, how wil ye beleue, if I speake heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly
<pb facs="tcp:1416:330"/>
things vnto you? For this sermon can not be inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by any man, but the only begotten sonne which is in the bosom of the father, hath declared it vnto vs. Of this sermon or saying ther are two partes. The fyrste is somwhat harde.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.</note> For of this it is certainely decreed: No man ascendeth into heauen but he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came downe from thence, the meaning wherof is all one with the saying before: Except a man be new borne, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not see the kyngdome of God. That is, No man can be saued,<note place="margin">No man by hys owne strengthe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be saued.</note> or obtaine remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his sinnes &amp; rightousnes, neither by the law, neither by good workes, reason, or free wil. And he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath no more then these things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be neuer so good, he is da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned &amp; can haue no hope of saluation. It is a very euident &amp; plaine sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, whiche if the Iewes &amp; papistes wold beleue, it wold make them to forsake al the trust that they haue in their owne workes and righteousnes.</p>
            <p>For what man hath his birth from heauen? None no not the first that were, Adam and Eue. It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sonne of Mary, as Christe here saith. Therfore if none shal enter vp to heauen, but he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen:<note place="margin">By our fyrste byrthe we are all damned.</note> it is plaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men, as they be borne of their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, can not ascend into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If they can not go vp into heauen, what place is there, for them? For they can not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew in earth for death. If therbe no going vp to heauen, than can no man escape damnation. This is the iudgement of Christ as touching all the worlde, no man excepted, whether it be Adam, Eue, Abraham, Moyses, or Dauid, all they can not enter in to heauen. For he only asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth into heauen that came down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence. What do we then preuaile by good, workes, merits, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, or free wil? All these things are of no strenght, &amp; they can not bring vs to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But thou wilt say: Are al conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, &amp; are al w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

There is but one way to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we do not ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; make, but the son of god doth it. And of this speaketh christ now immediatly, saying:

               <pb facs="tcp:1416:331"/>This sermon is a heauenly thynge, which can not sufficiently be set forth &amp; commended vnto men, &amp; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to Nicodemes, that is, to them that thynke that the law must be obserued vnto iustification, and that it is sufficient vnto saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>Furthermore they muche lesse know, that we must ascend into heauen by this man the sonne of Mary, which only came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen.

            <p>In the fourth booke of Moyses, ther is such an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Numer.</hi> 21.</note> The people of Israell, when they were werye of suche thynges as they had in the wildernes: They murmured against god &amp; Moses, &amp; despised Manna as a light meat. This sinne &amp; trespas dyd god punishe after this sorte: He sent amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest them ferye serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, &amp; by and by at their styngyng followed a swellynge &amp; an inflammation in their bodies, so that they fel down on heapes &amp; died. Then came they to Moyses &amp; said, we haue trespaced, in that we haue spoken againste God, and they pray hym that he wil take away from vs these serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. And the lord spake vnto him: Make

            <p>First let vs learne the cause of this dreadfull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whiche Christ hath pronounced twise before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste all men: that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man can go vp to heauen, but the sonne of man, that came downe from heauen.

Wherof came this great misery to man, that he is thrust out of heauen, &amp; should for his owne desert perish for euer? It came of no other thing than that the old serpent the deuil dyd so byte &amp; hurte the first man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</note> and so corrupted him &amp; infected hym by syn. That he is now in danger of euerlasting death, &amp; can not by himself get any remedie against it: as the type &amp; figure in the Iewes doth shew also: whosoeuer were stonge they died al. So is it with vs also,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of sinne is death. And looke wher synne is, ther must death nedes folow. For as much then, as al men,<note place="margin">

            <p>But here doth God shew his mercie, in that he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth not awaye men that are in this miserie, and so infected &amp; damned to death, but euen as in the figure and tipe of the brasen serpent, he put forth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which serpent was in all points lyke other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, sauing that he had no poyson, &amp; was a remedie against poyson: so doth he procure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his son shold be

lyfte vp on the crosse that all that looke on him sholde not perishe, but escape the danger of death, &amp; get euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting lyfe. Yea he himselfe on the crosse had y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> forme of a poysonful serpent, but yet hath no poyson but the lykelines therof. For although Christe had our fleshe &amp; bloud,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> yet that fleshe and bloud was without sinne: yea and is of such strength that it deliuereth vs from poyson and sinne.</p>
            <p>This is the very voyce and sound of the holy ghost, by the whiche he beginneth the newe byrth in oure heartes, that faith may conceaue, and that this serpent by true faith may be in our syght, and geue saluation. But this sight of Christ is not regarded, because of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe reason. As it is very lyke, that so it chaunced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, which wold not be brought in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther was so great vertue in sight of such a dead thing.

What doth it profite (saith reason) to saue the life, if a man beleue in Christ? The commandementes of the lawe must be fulfilled also, and synne must be auoyded, and than ther is hope of saluation.<note place="margin">By faythe in christ comethe saluation.</note> Therfore few men perceaue this, that all the meanes to come to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth depende hereof, that we beleue in Christ.

            <p>And this is the plaine doctrine of this gospell, that first we are al sinners &amp; damned to eternal death. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that by this we are deliuered from eternal death, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we behold the man Iesus Christ on the crosse, that he made satisfaction for vs, and vanquished death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and brought vs at one with god, and made vs partakers of euerlastinge lyfe. This is the doctrine that forgeth new men and new heartes, so that we may say in sin &amp; death. Although I am deadly sto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the old serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and can not deme it: yet this thing maketh me haue sure hope of saluation, that in the man Christe Iesu there is so great vertue, that if I loke vpon him being crucified, I get therby sure deliuerance from sin, death and the deuill. Wherfore there is nothing that can feare me, be the bytting of the deuil neuer so great, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth he all thinges neuer somuche with matter and blacke poyson.

Wherfore he leaueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge vndone, but seketh alwayes possible, to bringe men to this felowship and companie of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they may be deliuered from this poison, as he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered.

Yea, and this we maie be bolde also to saie, after the councell of Christ with a sure faithe, that it shall likewise befall and chaunce, to all suche as are like in condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to this riche man, and to this Lazarus. As Christ declareth, wheras he putteth forthe this example, to terrifie and to feare the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous Phariseis.</p>
               <p>There are put forthe here generally twoo exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the whole worlde. The one, of hym that is riche in this worlde, and after that poore without ende. The other, of him that is poore in this world and after that blessed and salfe for euer, that euery manne might folowe that state, that he thynketh beste. For pouertie and other discommodities ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with godlines, are not to bee refused, so that thou maiest thereby come to saluacion. As contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wise, prosperitie putteth not a man in suche safetie, as though he neede not feare vngodlinesse: but rather for riches and wealthes sake, should a man suspecte the more the perill of Idolatrie, and

of vngodlinesse, least couetuousnesse, whiche is the worshippyng of Idolles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe. v.</hi>
                  </note> should crepe on a manne before he beware.</p>
               <p>But now let vs entreate of the examples by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> self. And first of all,<note place="margin">What is put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forthe to vs in Lazarus example.</note> the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Lazarus teacheth vs, that we iudge not godlines without fruite for the painefull life. For the kyngdome of heauen, whereto godlinesse would vs to haue chief respect is with this condicion, that it can not bee in this life without persecution and affliction. For no chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man ought to thinke with hymself, when he is vexed, that God therefore careth not for hym, or that he forgetteth hym. For this is the maner of God, that whom he loueth, them he chastineth, that thei by this chastment, maie lesse licenciouslie sinne. Whereas if it were not for the punishemente, thei would liue more carelesse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prouer. iii. Hebre. xii. Apoca. iii.</hi>
                  </note> and haue lesse regard to flie synne. Wherefore a godlie manne ought not to thinke, that affliction is an euill token. But let him rather gather thereby, that <hi>GOD</hi> loueth hym, and careth for hym, as saieth the wise man. The soonne that the father loueth, he chastineth.</p>
               <p>Wherefore menne are herein greatly deceiued, whiche of this present fortune will iudge of the will of <hi>GOD.</hi> In deede all these giftes are the blessyng of <hi>GOD,</hi> housholde stuffe, riches, health, perfite sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. &amp;c. but all these thynges are not immortall. For at length we must departe from them, and thei can not be had with vs from hence. And this is the greatest perill ioyned thereto, when the riche of this worlde do not trust in the liuing <hi>GOD,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>i. Timo. vi.</hi>

And there can bee no other waie to auoide perill in this, then either that thei iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> self, or els suffer <hi>GOD</hi> to iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by diuers tribulacions, least thei become voide of their duetie dooyng in godlines, praiyng, faithe, and studie of his worde.<note place="margin">The spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and true blessyng.</note> But the true and perfecte blessyng of <hi>GOD,</hi> whereby gods goodnes maie and ought to be perceiued, is not onely of present thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but also of eternall riches, that <hi>GOD</hi> hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a man to the Gospell, wherein we learne how <hi>GOD</hi> is mercifull for his soonnes sake, and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth synnes, and will saue vs for euer, and in the meane tyme whilest we bee here, he will defende vs of his goodnes against the deuill, and the tyrannie of the worlde.

For in comparison of eternall thynges, thei are verie small. If he lacketh money, yet is he sure of Gods mercie. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For <hi>GOD</hi> is mercifull to me for Christes sake, whiche also is my father, and will put me in an euerlastyng enhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce.</p>
               <p>And this was the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte of this miser Lazarus.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1416:335"/>
There lacked no sense of paines in his bodie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he mourned ofte and wepte. Yea his hearte also had his prickynges, by the whiche it was broken and discoraged, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sawe himself oppressed with many burdens of sickenesse, pouertie, contempte, whereas the riche manne, had store of all thynges. But here also brast out the moste greuous tormente of al, where as he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strained to heare the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Gods lawe against hym in his moste ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie and makyng for the wealthie riche manne. For these thoughtes troubled hym sore, when he thus reasoned in his harte: If thou haddest doen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou shouldest now haue liued therein: this riche man hath liued therein, and therefore, he hath doen them. The aucthoritie of <hi>GOD</hi> is in the voice of the lawe. How greate this temptacion is,<note place="margin">The comfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort against this, when he saied thus in his hearte: I se that this is the will of <hi>GOD,</hi> after this meanes to mortifie my sinfull fleshe, &amp; seyng it is so, I knowe it shall not longe continewe, within a fewe yeres, this will come to an ende, and all thynges shalbe in better case, when the lorde shall take a waie the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde troubles of the iuste, and deliuer theim ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For the promesse is sure that <hi>GOD</hi> is mercifull vnto me, and that for Christ his sonnes sake he doeth pardon synnes, and riddeth theim from the cursse, and take theim to his mercie and grace, that putte their trust in hym.</p>
               <p>Wherefore although this presente state be hard, yet will I paciently take it. If men care not for me, nor can finde in their heart to geue me their leauyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:336"/>
whiche thei are not wonte to deny to their dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet this is my comfort, that <hi>GOD</hi> is mercifull vnto me, and suffereth me not to lacke the eternall goodes. In the meane tyme I will bide these hard and bitter thynges, vntill at due tyme a better case shall come. And it is like that Lazarus had suche thoughtes first, as a man may gather by his name. For Lazarus in Hebrue is <hi>Eleazar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The name of Lazarus, what it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</note> &amp; signifieth, God helpe, so that in no man he trusted, but in <hi>GOD</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then is this also a token thereof, whereas the Euangelist saieth, that Lazarus was carried by the Angelles, into the bosome of Abraham. For this is nothyng els, but that Lazarus embraced with a suer faith, the promes made vnto Abraham, that is, that all should be blessed in his seede, and thereof he tooke hearte of grace in this state, so that if he had been holde as accursed of al the worlde, yet he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not but he should obtaine this blessyng, through the blessed seede. And this maner of saith caused him at his death, to bee carried vp into the bosome of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</p>
               <p>And Christ would vs to looke diligently on this example. For christian men must looke for no other, but to suffer neede and trouble with Lazarus. He that is without comfort, can not haue pacience, and yet will despaire at last. For the nature of fleshe and reason can not be chaunged, excepte there be helpe in the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> and in the studie thereof. For thus dooe menne thinke alwaie, that in aduersitie <hi>GOD</hi> forgetteth vs, and regardeth vs not, for els would he helpe vs and succour vs. And there is not suche wisedome in our myndes, as to comforte our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1416:336"/>
selues with the hope of that, that is to come. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there riseth murmuring against <hi>GOD,</hi> and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng of hym, whereof at lengthe ensueth the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie of desperacion. And so at the laste we fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>GOD,</hi> hate hym, and looke for no saluacion at his hande, ioyning to our present miseries, eternall pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes also. The example of Lazarus is put forthe,<note place="margin">The historie of Lazarus is diligently to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of the crosse.</note> for the Godlie to defende them selues thereby against this daunger. He was after the descripcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ moste wretched. But because he suffereth not the promesse of Christ to be taken from his mynde, but loketh stedfastlie for euerlastyng life, &amp; in the meane season obeieth Gods will in all poinctes: he is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously recompensed for all this at his tyme, and in stede of a little paine, he obtaineth euerlastyng plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and comfort. This is the example of Lazarus, whiche christian men in al their crosse and trouble ought to beholde, that thereby thei maie be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, what is beste for theim to doe.</p>
               <p>The other example is of the riche man,<note place="margin">The riche man.</note> whiche in this life liued in prosperitie at his desier, but in the life to come, was in all miserie and paines. And here muste wee consider the certaintie of Christes testimonie. For he putt foorthe this example speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie, that carelesse and coueitous hypocrites, might knowe of their miserable ende in the life to come. Wherefore we ought to consider, the truthe of this matter with our eyes, howe the riche man is horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie tormented in flames, in suche wise that it can not be written with penne, nor expressed with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. And that the chiefe and speciall cause of these tormentes and paines is:<note place="margin">The cause of the riche ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nacion</note> bicause he beholdeth the
<pb facs="tcp:1416:337"/>
felicitie of Lazarus, whom before he despised and disdained, neither can he haue asmuche as a droppe of water from him to coole his burning therewith. And furdermore, he is constrained to suffer this paine perpetually, without hope of remedie. But what is the cause, why that miser is caste into suche pain without ende? Not his riches, neither for that he apparelleth hymself, and liueth by his gooddes. For these are the giftes of <hi>GOD,</hi> so that there bee measure in vsyng them, and be not wasted riotous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For if these thinges be vsed in the feare of <hi>GOD,</hi> and with thankes geuyng, <hi>GOD</hi> will not disalowe it. But this is the cause, for that this riche manne hath store of goodes, clotheth hymself and liueth ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otouslie, &amp; yet he hath no respecte of the life to come, he hopeth for no longer life, when this life is come to an ende, he careth not what becommeth of him in the other life. All his care and studie is, to geue him self to pleasure and pastyme in this life, as though he had nede of nothyng els. As Christ doeth admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe in the Gospell of this, that our heartes be not ouerladen with surfet and drounkennes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke. xxi.</hi>
                  </note> and with the cares of this worlde. This is one cause of his damnacion.<note place="margin">To haue no respect to the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes nede.</note> For of this it foloweth, that he regard not the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> neither is he any thyng mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued either at his promises, or at his threatninges, so that in this life he maie not bee defrauded of his luste and desires. The second cause is, that he sawe Lazarus nede before his face, but yet accordyng to the Prophet, he openeth not his hand to the nedie, but rather after the Euangelist, the dogges shewed more humanitie to this miser, then did the riche
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1416:337"/>
man. He thought not on this, that the great ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie was geuen to hym to thentent, that he should help the needie. But like an vnsaciable gredie gutte,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esaie. lviii. Luke. xvi.</hi>
                  </note> he loued greate heapyng of all thynges together, and yet is he nothyng moued with other mens lacke and nede. These sinnes crieth for vengeaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, that after a little pleasure of this life, he maie haue euerlastyng punishement.</p>
               <p>This example doeth Christ setforthe before vs, that we might beware of his iudgement, and of synne, that we might not geue our selues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out care to surfetting in this life, as though there were no other life to come, and that we should not forget the poore. For he that hath suche plentie of goodes, that he maie helpe the poore,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math. xxv. Iames. ii.</hi>
                  </note> and yet doeth not, he shall in the laste daie suffer greate paine and tormente, at what tyme he shall see the poore whom he despised, before his face in greate ioye and felicitie, to his owne greate sorowe, as the riche manne did the Lazer. Contrary wise, he that hath helped many, and doen them good, shall take greate pleasure thereof in the life to come. This is a more harde case, that the riche man in all his heate and burnyng, is denied a droppe of colde water.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let vs not forget the poore and nedie,<note place="margin">The poore must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</note> but let vs helpe and succour them, not onely after the accustomable maner, as when we geue a half-penie to beggers, or suche like, as euery man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after his degree. But an almose shall then bee moste acceptable, when euery man after his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in his vocation, doeth maintaine the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:338"/>
felowship, and whom he can: That is, that euery manne vse and tourne his crafte and gaines, and what so euer he occupieth, to suche purpose, that no man be deceiued, no man be defrauded, and that loketh not onely to his owne vantage, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth no man by waight and measure. For it is not vnknowen, what craftes and guiles be emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest them that fell. A daie were to little to expresse all the fraudes that are vsed in certaine occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for gaines. Wherefore when it is vprightlie doen, yea in the leaste contractes and bargaines, that be, it is in a maner a very almose deede. And contrarywise, that that is doen with fraude and deceite, is plaine theft. And thei shall be iudged no otherwise then for theues of <hi>GOD</hi> in his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, whereas all these couetous and riche shall behold Lazarus, whom thei haue deceiued so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies in their bargaininges, and hath spoiled them of their goodes, and after the maner of this riche man, thei shalbe punished with euerlastyng paine.</p>
               <p>After this sort maie euery man make his craft and occupacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be an almose pleasyng God, and not onely temporall blessynges shall therof ensue, but as Christe saieth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke. xvi.</hi>
                  </note> we shall gette vs frendes in this life, whose testimonie shall profite vs in the life to come. But the worlde can not bee brought vnto this beliefe. He that hath a stocke will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng diminishe thereof, but rather encrease it. He that hath none, studieth al that he can to make hymself an heape of substaunce, caryng not how he come by it. Wherefore God can not but plague
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1416:338"/>
the worlde, vntill at the last, hell maketh an ende of all. And yet can not the worlde be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by plagues, neither by threatnynges. But is not this the greatest madnesse that is, to prouide in perilles, that we suffer not hunger when there is scarcitie of victuals? But why then doe we not take hede in that case, whereas if we offende, there shall ensue eternall paines? This iudgemente is so muche the more greuous, bicause it can neuer be chaunged, beyng ones dooen. For there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no hope of remedie. Abraham and Lazarus, as thou hearest here, are not onely vnwillyng to coole the heate with a little water, but also vnable.</p>
               <p>What an ouerthwartnesse is this then, that we so little regarde this greate daunger of ours, and seke not rather remedie for it?<note place="margin">The greate blindnesse of men.</note> The light trifles of this life doe sore vexe vs, while we se to our digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to suche as bee ours, that we maie make prouision for theim, with all the commodities of this life. And when men haue gotten these thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, now thei labour no farther, as though thei had gotten all. But when thei haue not that, thei en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour with all studie and care to come thereby. But in the meane season thei haue no regarde of this thyng that is moste necessarie, vntill thei fall sodainly into this snare, euen into this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and damnacion.</p>
               <p>And this is the cause, why Christ putteth forth the example of the riche manne, to withdrawe vs from the care of thynges present,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>i. Timo. vi.</hi>
                  </note> and to make vs geue more hede to euerlastyng life. For if this rich man had not geuen ouer his heart to worldly pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:339"/>
but had rather trusted in the liuyng God, he had neuer come to this place of tormente and destruction. But now, contrary to the precepte of God. He drowneth vp himself with riches, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth his state to come. He applieth all thynges onely to his desiers and lustes, and will suffer no other thyng to come into his mynde. Contrary to this teacheth Christ, that we should watche, least we suffer with the riche man euerlastyng death, as a recompence for this little ioye.</p>

                  </note>These twoo examples are suche, as neuer ought to fall out of memorie, that firste of all in tyme of trouble we might haue a suer trust and comforte: Then also that in the prosperitie of this world, we fall not into daunger of euerlastyng death. And to this also doeth that belong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Christ speaketh after, that the riche manne perceiuyng his owne cause to bee paste remedie, yet careth for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne, and desireth that Lazarus might be sente to his fathers house, least that if thei continue in their olde conuersacion, thei also should fall into like punishemente.

But when the riche man proceded, &amp; alledged that there should ensue muche profite by this message, if the deade should goe preache to theim that liue: Abraham answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: If thei heare not Moises, nor the Prophetes, neither will thei beleue if any should come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from the deade. Now this riche man vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that he that will escape this, hath neede of repentaunce, and perceiueth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that that maie chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

to other, as it chaunced to hym, that although the worde of <hi>GOD</hi> and the Preachers thereof, abide with men in the worlde, yet it doeth not moue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither to repentaunce, neither to amendement of life. Wherefore he thinketh it beste for his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne, if one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deade, that could tell of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges inuisible, should come vnto theim. Neither would this seme to vs also other wise then the matter requireth, if suche a Prophet should come emongest men.</p>
               <p>But Abraham can not be perswaded to allowe this, and therefore he saieth.<note place="margin">The woorde of God muste onely be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hede vnto.</note> He that will escape this paine, muste haue respecte to nothyng but to the Prophettes, and that this is the onely waie to escape the daunger of eternall damnacion. But he that will heare neither Moses nor the Prophet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, it were in vaine if one should rise from the dead, or if an angell, or <hi>GOD</hi> himself should preache. For suche would neuer bee brought to beleue. This is an high praise of the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> and of the ministerie thereof, whereas men are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily bound to it, so that thei ought not to thinke that there is any other meane, to auoide this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence and destruction. But what doeth Moises and the Prophetes teache? these two thinges spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. First, thei shew the promised sede of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that should breake the serpentes head, that is, should depriue and strippe the deuill of all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and make good the damage taken in paradise.

Thou, saieth he, shewest outwardly, that thou haste a greate desire of that, that is to come.

This gospell maketh verie greuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Iewes and Gentiles. Now will we prosecute the parable in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Who made this supper.</note>The manne that made this Supper, is <hi>GOD,</hi> whiche is a sumptuous and a riche feaste maker, and hath after his riches and maiestie prepared a Supper, whiche is called great, not so muche for the respecte of the maker thereof, whiche is <hi>GOD</hi> (albeit it might be worthelie called a greate Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for that cause onely) but because the meate it self also is magnificent and greate, that is, the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,<note place="margin">This supper is the Gospel</note> yea Christe hymself, whiche is in the Gospell sette before vs to feede on, that he for our synnes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1416:342"/>
thorowe his death hath made satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and hath deliuered vs from eternall death, from helle, from the wrathe of God, and damnacion. This doctrine as concernyng Christ, is the greate supper, to the whiche he calleth his geastes, that he maie sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them by his Baptisme, and comforte and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme theim by the Sacramente of his bodie and blood, so that nothyng at all is lackyng, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite and necessarie to the greatnesse, magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and plentifulnes thereof, and for the gorgious and gentle intertainemente of the geastes: so that for this cause it maie well bee called greate, euen for the sumptuousnesse and the delicates, whiche are so dressed and prouided, that no man can sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly expresse it with to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, nor thinke it with heart. For the meate and drinke thereof is eternall: after the whiche there followeth neither hunger nor thirste, but it so satisfieth theim, and quencheth their thirste, that a continuall ioye ensueth. And this supper is not onely inough for one man,<note place="margin">Why it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a greate supper.</note> but it is sufficient for all the worlde, if it were muche big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and larger. For the Gospell saieth this: he that beleueth in Christe, that for our sake he was made man, and borne of the virgine Marie, crucified for our sinnes, and ascended into heauen, and sitteth on the right hande of <hi>GOD</hi> the father. &amp;c. he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth so, doeth liue for euer.

But this meate is euerlastyng, and is neuer consumed. And by this doeth he declare to the hypocrites that were present, that this supper
<pb facs="tcp:1416:343"/>
was of an other sorte, then that, that was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. And yet are thei of suche malice and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, that although thei prate muche therof: yet thei proudely despise, <hi>GOD,</hi> and his bountifulnes, euerlastyng life and saluacion, and in the meane season set muche more by other thynges.

               <p>In this are the geastes that were present repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and specially, that masterlike fellowe, whiche before Christe had craked of the kyngdome of God, and the meate thereof: Blessed is he that eateth bread in the kyngdome of <hi>GOD.</hi> Christe doeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete to this man his saiyng: If thou, saieth he, carest for this, how happie thou art, this will I say vnto thee: the supper is now set on the table: Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Baptiste is come.

The thirde is more proude for his newe maried wife, and therefore he despiseth the supper. These three thynges doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the descripcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that kyngdome of <hi>GOD,</hi> and of the breade, whereof that maisterlike felowe and hypocrite made mencion.

               <p>Firste the Iewes laye for their excuse Moises lawe, and all the ceremonies. For when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did teache, that after that there should bee no

That doeth Christe here reproue by the buiyng of the Farme, when he saieth: I will goe see the Farme that I haue bought, that is, we Priestes doe labour, and goe to Harueste, that is, we gouerne the people (as Christe call all teachers, workemen,<note place="margin">

And so it chaunceth to the Iewes. For when the princes, priestes, and all the chief emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the people, despised the Gospell for the causes aboue rehearsed, <hi>GOD</hi> receiued the humbe fishers, whiche is a poore and a despised sorte.

When all kynde of synners and Publicans drewe nigh vnto Christe, to heare his worde: the Scribes and Phariseis seyng that, laied it to Christes charge as a crime, that he vsed the companie of this kinde of men, with whom <hi>GOD</hi> and thei that are beloued of <hi>GOD,</hi> could haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng to doe: and that by this, he did declare, that he was farre vnlike <hi>GOD.</hi> Christ answereth, and alledgeth a iuste cause of his doing, that is, that he doeth nothing otherwise, then the common maner of men is, yea, and that in inferiour matters, when
<pb facs="tcp:1416:351"/>
their chief care at all tymes, is to recouer that is loste or in daunger, that hereby he might reproue the vntolerable frowardnes and arrogance of the Phariseis, wheras thei giue iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t so vnshame-fastly of a matter that thei vnderstande not.</p>
               <p>And that the matter maie be the better percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this, whether there is any place for synners in the kyngdome of <hi>GOD</hi>? For if there be not, Christes doing was worthely reproued, that whereas he professeth hymself to bee the sonne of <hi>GOD,</hi> yet he companieth with theim that are not of the kyngdome of <hi>GOD.</hi> The Phariseis &amp; Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes are deceiued, in iudgyng Christes doyng, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thei knewe not truly, what is the kyngdome of <hi>GOD,</hi> and yet thei thought theim selues moste perfect thereof.

               </p>
               <p>And this is the verie iudgement of reason also. For as sone as there riseth any sense of synne, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1416:351"/>
there is had respect vnto the wrathe of God,<note place="margin">The Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning synners.</note> whiche is alwaies dread and looked for in synne. For thei iudge that he can haue no hope in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God, which stireth hym to wroth with their synnes. As Adam and Eue maie be an example:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene. iii.</hi>
                  </note> as sone as thei had transgressed the precept, thei could not abide their owne conscience, thei seke to be hid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dare not come in sight. And yong children also declare this to be true, when thei are in any faute, thei seke corners. For this is the nature of synne, to make the hearte afraied,<note place="margin">Synne, and the nature thereof.</note> bicause it dooeth alwaies feare wrothe and punishemente. Contrarie wise when the conscience is pure and fautlesse, it trusteth well in it self, although other mennes iudgemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes be neuer so muche against theim. Like as all reason therefore in synne, doeth naturally flie from God, and for her vpright and honest behauiour, is wont to haue confidence before God: So the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseis in in comparison of them selues, whom thei thought iuste, exclude synners. Thei did see, that thei were directe againste the lawe of God in their doynges, and therfore thei also pronounced plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thei ought to haue no place in the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. Thei suspect Christ also, that he doth not after Gods will, bicause he had to doe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such.</p>
               <p>But consider thou this with thy self,<note place="margin">Before God and the lawe all menne are synners.</note> to what case the matter will come, if synners should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from God and his kyngdome, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseis thinke? For although thei suppose, that there is a kinde of men that liueth without synne, yet <hi>GOD</hi> and the lawe knoweth none suche. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though euery manne committeth not adulterie,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:352"/>
slaughter and thefte, yet before God no manne is without synne, yea, and those synnes are the more greuous, if thei fall in a manne that hath wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and strength to resist them. If then the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseis iudgement be true, that <hi>GOD</hi> doeth tourne awaie from synners, it maketh as muche against them selues, as against other. For by the lawe, are not onely reproued the sinnes of the Publica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and of synners, but also their owne &amp; all others. Then will it followe, that no men haue place in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. So that the Phariseis are proceded so farre by ignoraunce, that as thei are fore against other, so giue thei a moste greuous sentence against them selues. But all their ouersight riseth here of, bicause thei knowe not why Gods lawe was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, neither what corruption of synne there is in all men. And as in other thynges, one errour brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth an other, so here also of the kyngdome of God, doe these hypocrites knowe nothing, whiche must nedes be set vp by Gods grace and goodnes.</p>
               <p>But Christ groundyng his reason on true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, openeth the misterie of the Gospell, vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to naturall witte, and to all that followe the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes of the lawe: that is, that God hateth not sinners, nor willeth their death, and that he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this his will in Christ: whom he sent into the worlde, to bring home againe to their foldes, shepe that straye from their flockes, and that all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hath onely respect to the fulfillyng of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1416:352"/>This is plainly an other kinde of doctrine, then the doctrine of the lawe and Phariseis, whiche ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not here seede and roote in our nature, but is brought from heauen by the sonne of God: as saith Ihon. No man hath seen God at any time,<note place="margin">

                  </note> the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten soonne, whiche is in the bosome of the father, sheweth hym forthe. For no man knoweth that will of God, that he is not angrie with sinners nor damneth them for their synnes, but receiueth them rather to his grace and saueth them: but all knowe the contrary. Wherefore the feare of the wrothe of <hi>GOD</hi> is naturally ioyned with synne. But Christe teacheth vs here by his Gospell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke. xv.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>GOD</hi> is otherwise mynded towarde synners, and that he is not angrie, but mercifull, and that the Angelles in heauen reioyce, when synners repent and amende. This doctrine must be the better mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, bicause it semeth contrary to our reason, that we by it maie confirme our conscience. For he that in suche temptation, followeth reason and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, goeth hedlong to the Deuill, and there is no remedie against desperation. Wherefore this goeth the matter, we must agree surely with Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reason and al other thinges, that although we are synners,<note place="margin">Why God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> yet that by Christ we must be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and called againe, as shepe goyng a straye, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of our saluacion. As Christ setteth forth a plaine parable in this place, to the declaracion of his moste excellent office.</p>
               <p>In diuers other places doeth the Gospell declare, why God casteth not awaie synners,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ihon. iii.</hi>
                  </note> as in the third of Ihon, that <hi>GOD</hi> is suche, that hateth not the

For although God might haue helped vs otherwise, yet he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to doe it by his soonne, so that we should haue no cause to doubte of his deliueryng and redemption. For this is moste true,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> that God is more pacified by the death of his sonne, then offended by our synnes.</p>
               <p>Furdermore, there is an other cause set forthe by Christe, why God casteth not awaie synners. For he sheweth that sinners are a portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods substance, whiche fell from him, &amp; yet God hath suche respect to the matter, that he regardeth not the greatest thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that he hath, vntill that that is loste be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And all this waie of recoueryng is sette vp by Christe, as he hymself saieth in this place. Wherfore it ought to seme no maruell, if he make a searche for synners, that straye from Gods houshold, to bryng them home againe. For he is sent for this very cause to bryng home synners againe, and if he should dooe otherwise, as the Phariseis appoinct hym, he could not execute Gods commaundement.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The tender affection of Christe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sinners</note>But it is verie comfortable to see the affection of Christe toward synners, whiche is described in the tipe and figure of this careful and studious shepherd, whereas he followeth after the straye shepe, takyng no care in the meane season of the reste, and when he findeth her, he beateth her not, but handleth her ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly, as though she were blamelesse. He taketh her on his shoulders, and at his retourne he maketh ioyfull gratulacions with his frendes. All whiche

But when there is daunger, and yet there is more care for that that is in daunger, then for all that is safe: this is naturall and true loue.

He pursueth not after theim (I saie) as after his hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies, but searcheth them out as miserable shepe that are in peril, &amp; endeuoureth wholy hym self to recouer theim, before the Woulfe oppresseth theim, that is, that thei dye not in their synnes.

               <p>And these thynges ought to be considered fullie and perfectly, that wee maie vnderstande, howe greate loue and care <hi>GOD</hi> hath for the saluacion of man, that he can not abide to se hym to be made a praye for the deuill. He maketh sute for synners, as for his owne right. And least he should be repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for sinne, as though he had no right, he appoint a shepherd, whiche hath right to recouer synners, as straye shepe. And when he seeth that thei are not able to retourne againe, he followeth after theim, and bryngeth theim againe vpon the shoulders of his mercie.<note place="margin">The lawe bryngeth no man to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion.</note> By the lawe of Moises, whereon the Phariseis grounde their determinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>GOD,</hi> there could neuer be ordeined suche a recoueryng of the loste. For the lawe dooeth not onely not entise vnto it the straunge shepe, but also it driueth her furder of, with sharpe and cruell wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.

And in it now he bryngeth forthe suche workes of the spirite, as no hypocrite, no Pharisie, no Monke can bryng.

               <p>Suche mercie also must we vse.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued true in our Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers.</note>It is euidently seen, how full of wickednes and wrong, the husbande menne and the people of the countrie be.

               <p>And this is the example, that Christ appointeth vs to followe, that we also likewise maie be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and not prouoked to malice, by other mennes malice, after the maner of the worlde, that reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and pursueth his right.

               <p>But we must put in a caueat in this place, and beware that wee take not this doctrine of mercie so, although all kynde of reuengyng,<note place="margin">All reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente is not forbidden.</note> were disanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hereby. For there are diuers persones, in one christian man. A christian, and the disciple of Christ doeth not reuenge.

               <p>Wherefore this commaundement of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in a certaine respecte to an other order, that is, that the sonnes of <hi>GOD,</hi> that is to saie, Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s followe the example of the mercie of their father.

To sight therefore is doen now and then, a woorke of greate crueltie and sharpnes, where as in deede it maie well bee coumpted, an acte of mercie and clemencie.</p>

And this is a greate subtiltie of the Deuill, that againste the moste ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie offices of mercie, he inuenteth the names of a blab, a traitour, a tyraunte, a termegante, a spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. &amp;c.

               <p>Thou must therefore take diligent hede, to what ende this precept of mercie is giuen, that first of all thou regarde the commaundementes of <hi>GOD,</hi> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially made vnto thee, to shewe thee thy duetie, and yet that all these ought to be mingled with mercy.

Wherfore he commaundeth vs to be mercifull, not as the Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be, whiche shewe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vnto them, from whom thei loke for helpe, and so that one hande should washe an other:<note place="margin">Mercie is to bee shewed not onely to frendes, but also to foes.</note> But as the father in heauen, whiche sheddeth out all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges plentuously, that are necessary for vs, so that there is sufficient for all men to gather, not onely for the good, whom he could dispatche in one daie, but also for the euill. For <hi>GOD</hi> doeth not suffer his goodnes to wither awaie, bicause there be many euill and vnkinde. Yea, rather in this poincte, the euill are better prouided for. This example, saieth Christ, put I forthe to you, that professe my name, not onely to doe good to your frendes (for this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue maie bee also in the Gentiles) but also to your enemies, as ye se that your heauenly father, grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged no man the light of the Sonne, no not asmuche as the theues, robbers, adulterers, vsurers, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

               <p>Doe you, saieth he, likewise. Suffer not paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be taken from you. Bee not lesse beneficiall for other mennes faultes, as the worlde is wonte, when it craketh: All thinges are full of ingratitude and churlishenes. A manne can neuer doe to little.

It is no greate thyng to helpe your frendes.<note place="margin">Christes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortacion to the christians</note> For the Gentiles will no longer dooe good, then when thei looke for like, wherof if there be no hope, farewell good doyng.

Yea, <hi>GOD</hi> hath so greate power, that he can punishe the vnkinde, by diuers instrumentes, by water, fire, and stones. &amp;c.

               <q>Iudge ye not, and ye shall not bee iudged: Condemne not, and ye shall not be condemned. Forgiue, and it shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen you.</q>
               <p>Christe would haue vs godlie in deede, that we should not crake of faithe and the Gospell in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, as the moste parte doeth, that boaste them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to bee Gospellers, and prate muche of Christe.

               <p>For we are in daunger of Gods iudgement, and damnation for our synnes. What hath the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father doen?

Applie thy self thereto. Bee thou likewise vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: then art thou a true christian, whiche beleuest in Christ, neither condemnest thou thy neighbour, but forgiuest hym gladlie thy hurte.

Thou nedest not doubt of this. For the commaundement is this: Iudge ye not, and ye shall not bee Iudged, but if ye will not cease iudgyng, <hi>GOD</hi> shall iudge you also.</p>
               <p>The common practise sheweth how harde this inibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is. Assone as we iudge our selues hurt, forth with we vse this iudgement: Why should I do good to the vnkinde? I haue holpen hym often, and he dooeth not onely like for like, but dooeth a shrode turne for a good. I should offende, if I should helpe the vnkinde so often. But this is an vnmercifull mercie, and painfull helpyng. When thei Iudge, bicause thei obtain not the like. And then appereth Gregorius saiyng true: True Iustice hath doen compassion, but vntrue is double iniquitie. For when a man giueth me a croune, he is thought to go about to make me his bondman thereby.

This is truely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng els, but to serue and Iudge, as the Gentiles doe, that there maie be a recompensation. For this is no good waie. If thou doe good to an other, and he acknowledge it not, or doeth euill for good, thou maiest admonishe him not so to doe, least he offende

God greatly. But yet hast thou no iust cause to hate hym, to iudge, and condemne hym. Giue hym vp to his Iudge. For thou knowest not what <hi>GOD</hi> will doe with hym, whither he will amende hym. If he be not amended, <hi>GOD</hi> hath officers sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be reuenged of hym. And so suche thinges chance daily, that there rise sodain tempestes against the stubburne. Onely beware, that thou iudge him not: but thinke thus: <hi>GOD</hi> hath not so cruelly dealte with me. For if he had, I should haue been killed long a gone in my synne, when I liued in filthy I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie and Hypocrisie.</p>
               <p>Likewise also beware that thou dooest not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne: for it is not thy duetie. To chide, to tell one of his faut, to dehort, to declare to them that iudge and condemne, it is lawfull. But thou haste no more to doe, then to be mercifull: thou maiest not Iudge, thou maiest not condemne. And if thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be so obstinatly set to do thee hurt, that he will not cease, yet thou oughtest to bee willyng to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue, and not to hinder his profite, or goe about to reuenge, but rather to furder &amp; to helpe him. These thynges are harde to doe, but remember that thou art a Christian, and that more perfection is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of thee, if thou earnestly embrace this name, euen as the example of our heauenly father, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declareth before vs. For if thou dooe good to thy neighbour, and he be vnkinde, and doeth requit thee with euill, doubte not but that <hi>GOD</hi> will laye it to his charge. Resigne and giue ouer thou the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce vnto him, and do thou thy duetie. <hi>GOD</hi> doth reuenge all these thynges at his tyme. Wherefore

               <p>Christ hath comprised these preceptes very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and laboureth specially, to cause vs to fulfill the true workes of Charitie. Wherefore as he hath commaunded, that synners should be mercifullie and gentlely handeled, as we are gently handled of hym, that we Iudge and condemne theim not, but committe that vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> and praie for theim to <hi>GOD</hi>: So he commaundeth to doe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, helpyng, and counsaillyng. &amp;c. and then not to doubt, but <hi>GOD</hi> will requite our liberalitie, bee it neuer so greate: That so the minde maie abounde with Charitie alwaie, and neuer bee ouergrowne with the thornes of vnkindenesse, to cease thereby from well doyng, as the Gentiles doe, whiche can not abstaine from iudgyng and condemnyng. For assone as thei thinke them selues hurt, thei forgiue not, before thei are humblie asked forgiuenesse. So thei will not giue any thyng, but where as thei loke for gaines and for benefite. Wherefore thei can neuer escape the Iudgemente of <hi>GOD,</hi> neither are thei Iudged worthy of Gods benefites, and of his mercie and grace.</p>
               <p>This faute must we eschewe, and so doe for our neighbours, as our heauenly father doeth for vs. He slacketh his straight Iudgement: he pardoneth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1416:364"/>
vs: he will not be cruell and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne vs, although we be vnkinde: He enioyneth vs to do likewise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, or if wee will not, he putteth before vs a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ende, that we shall loke so to be serued of hym, as we serue other. For with the same measure, saith he, shall other measure to you, as you haue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured with. And we can not deny but <hi>GOD</hi> hath giuen vs good measure. For if he would haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs after our desertes, he might haue plagued vs with wrathe, plague, pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and all euill, and put vs to death, assone as we were borne. I will not rehearse how manifolde waies we haue offended hym, through all our life with sinnes. This might worthely be giuen to vs as measure, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death and hell. But what doth <hi>GOD</hi>? He putteth awaie that that we haue deserued, that is to saie, wrathe, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation, iudgement, death, hell. &amp;c. and bryngeth to vs, heauen, grace, libertie, and a quiete mynde, from the condemnation of the lawe, and of an euill conscience. He riddeth vs from al penurie &amp; blame and giueth vs all that is good.</p>
               <p>This is truely a large and plentifull measure, but whereas thou deniest other the same measure after that, thinke not, but like measure shalbe giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thee from <hi>GOD,</hi> as thou giuest other. Thou wer fortunate before, bicause he helped thee with the measure of grace. Now shalt thou haue suche mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as thy vnkinde and craftie behauior deserueth.</p>
               <p>This teachyng is marueilous, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth, that <hi>GOD</hi> requireth more earnestly thy duetie, towardes thy neighbour, then towardes hymself. For as touchyng hymself, he pardoneth

Contrarie, when we be vnmercifull to our neighbour, <hi>GOD</hi> will neither bee pleased with vs, neither forgiue vs any thyng. Wherefore, all this rate of measuring is to be appointed &amp; doen after faithe, and not before. For before thou haste faithe, <hi>GOD</hi> dealeth not with thee after thy desert, but was mercifull vnto thee, he opened thee the waie to his worde. He promised thee remission of sinnes. This is the first measure giuen to vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we began to beleue, after that this measure was receiued, he giueth commaundemente to measure to other likewise. And he that doeth so, lette hym looke to be doen vnto, as he doeth vnto other. If he be cruell, let hym looke for no mercie of <hi>GOD</hi>: if he iudge, he shalbe iudged and damned. Wherfore this measuryng hath her beginning after faithe, when <hi>GOD</hi> requireth so greatly thy duetie towardes thy neighbour, threatnyng that he will reuoke all his grace, if we will not be mercifull to our neighbour.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he that thinketh earnestly, how to serue <hi>GOD,</hi> let hym doe good to his neighbour, let him doe as <hi>GOD</hi> doeth, that is, let him not iudge, let hym not condemne, but forgiue, and giue glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let hym shewe hymself beneficiall and liberall, when he maie.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Uke signifieth by this historie, how Peter and the reste, came to their Apostleshippe. And the miracle of the Fishe, and the holy ministerie of the Gospell, is well applied to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleshippe. For by the takyng of so many fishes, Christ declareth the power of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in the worlde, wheras it shall drawe vp a great multitude of synners, out of the kyngdome of the deuill, into Gods kingdome. And at last Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it so himself, wheras he pronounceth that Peter, Iames, Andrewe and Ihon, should become fishers of men. But before that the Euangelist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth the historie, he rehearseth that many follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed Christ, to heare hym preache. And that to the intent, that we hauing an eye to this example, may come to the worde of <hi>GOD</hi> desirously. For he that heareth this woorde diligently, obtaineth twoo thynges thereby, whiche otherwise he could not come by.<note place="margin">What fruite commeth of the woorde of God.</note> The first is, that we knowe hereby what is Gods will toward vs, bothe in this life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, whiche without the woorde of <hi>GOD,</hi> wee could not knowe at all. But wee rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the contrary in our mynde, of the wrathe of <hi>GOD</hi> toward vs, and of his punishement. But the worde teacheth vs this, as we shall heare hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>GOD</hi> although we be synners, is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie with vs, but is mercifull, that we might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from synne, and get euerlastyng life. This is one thyng, that we get by the worde. The second is, that out of the woorde we learne to order, the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1416:368"/>
trade of this externall and ciuill life, for that, that it is allowed and sanctified by the worde of God, to be a true worshippyng of <hi>GOD,</hi> so that he hath no nede to become a Monke or Frier, that will serue <hi>GOD,</hi> but he maie waite on his owne vocation, and doe his owne office diligently, whether it bee in a Maiestrates office, or in other kinde of life. This is a true and pleasyng seruice to <hi>GOD,</hi> and shall neuer be destitute and voide of the blessyng of <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This doctrine is necessarie, to the true informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conscience, that all men maie knowe for a suretie, that their vocation is set forthe by Gods woorde, so that all thynges whiche thei doe, or doe not, maie be confirmed by Gods commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes certainly. Suche a conscience maie withstande the Deuill in temptacion, and thinke surely,<note place="margin">Whatsoeuer is dooen in faithe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God.</note> that he hath doen suche thynges, and yet doeth, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the whiche, <hi>GOD</hi> hath giuen a sure precept. For all thynges otherwise are dooen with synne, and displease <hi>GOD.</hi> As Paule saieth: whatsoeuer is not of faithe, is synne.</p>
               <p>Now hath <hi>GOD</hi> giuen vs his woorde plentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, whereby we maie trie all our deedes, and saiynges, and gather certaine testimonies for them all, out of Gods worde. For he that beleueth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom. xiiii.</hi>
                  </note> that is, he that embraceth Gods grace with a true faith, whiche he hath bestowed on vs, through Christe, what soeuer he dooeth, either appartainyng to the commonaltie, or to his housholde, or to the nature of manne, it pleaseth <hi>GOD</hi> wholly. For the persone from whom these thynges procede, pleaseth <hi>GOD</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:369"/>
for his faithe in Christ. And this should be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent before God, for euery manne to comfort hymself with this worde, that GOD hath put forthe, and sticke vnto that faithe, and serue God with all ioy and mirthe, for whatsoeuer is dooen in faithe, be it neuer so little, pleaseth God, and are moste excellent woorkes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">All our doyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Gods woorde.</note>But after that, this also is necessarie for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life, whereof commeth the congregation of God, that is, that euery man maie be certaine, as touchyng his doynges and degree. Wherfore of this also doeth God put forthe a sure woorde, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth obedience toward parentes. Wherefore whatsoeuer worke, office, children, seruauntes, be in the housholde, all that is sanctified by this worde, so thei that doe these thinges in a familie, maie well boaste of a sure commaundemente of God, and by this worde are the officers and maisters of house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdes, blessed and sanctified. For thei are the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of this common life, wherein God would haue tranquilitie and quiet, for the continuaunce of his congregation. And as touchyng their honor, God hath put forthe lawes, that thei might accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to their honour, behaue them selues in their offices, and bee sure of their dooynges by the lawe, that thei are doen accordyng to Gods woorde and commaundement. And as their conscience maie be established, whiche followe Gods woorde in their doyng: so he that hath not his worde, can haue no sure ground to sticke vnto, and is tossed hither and thither, with euery little blaste, like a moueable Rede. Wherefore we ought highly to esteme Gods
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1416:369"/>
worde, that as the Prophet speaketh, but of the old age, of youth, that it should correct his waie, in ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng Gods wordes: So all ages, al kindes, offices and functions, might haue wherto thei might,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal. cxix.</hi>
                  </note> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly order their life. Onely this trade of life, hath asure and quiete conscience. Neither the Turke, Iewe, nor Gentile, Monke, nor Papist, can obtain this so greate a thyng. This Science belongeth onely to the good, that thei maie knowe for a sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that bothe their inwarde iudgemente, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, procede accordyng to Gods woorde. Wherefore thei set on their matters, without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueryng and feare, although thei bee perilous. For all thynges belongyng to their vocation, are sette forth by Gods commaundement, neither haue thei any thing, wherein thei ought to feare vngodlines.</p>
               <p>This doctrine ought chiefly, to be taught vnto all Christian men, that thei might knowe how to sette on all thynges, and to bryng theim to passe in Gods worde, and so shall thei the soner beware, all the tyme of their life, of supersticious and wicked perswasions. If Monkes had folowed this trade, thei had neuer fallen to so greate vngodlines, by the preceptes of mennes traditions. Neither doe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, care for any thyng more, then to propound the plaine and simple worde of Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as touchyng Iustification before God, and the residue of the life to be passed ouer with Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Thei that followe the obedience of this worde, can not be put beside saluacion, although thei either in warfare for their countrie, or doyng some other daungerous charge of their vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, chaunce to die.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:370"/>
The reason is, thei serue in their vocation, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beie God, and knowe for a suretie, that thei doe all thinges, according to Gods commaundement. And so might this life bee passed ouer of all men, Godlie and vertuously, if thei would onely order it, after the tenne commaundementes, and the faithe in Christ. But the Deuill withstandeth this, withall his might, least the worde of <hi>GOD</hi> should come in mynde, at any of our doinges. Neither when we rise nor when we goe to bedde, nor when we eate, haue we any care or thought on Gods worde. And it is no maruaill, if thei before thei are wares, are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preste with the wicked worlde. But christian men must haue more regard, of so great and necessary a thyng, that thei maie be sure at all tymes, to be of Gods Kyngdome, so that thei maie haue Gods worde for a testimonie, whiche sanctifieth all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in al their matters. The thinges that are doen be not alwaies greate, nor glorious, and the moste part are common, bothe to the Ethenike and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.<note place="margin">A difference betwene the woorkes of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideles.</note> But in this there is greate difference, onely the Christians hath Gods worde for their leader, wherby all their workes are sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified before God. As for an example, when Paule saieth: seruauntes obey your bodily maisters, in feare and trembling, through singlenes of heart. And againe: Children, obeye your parentes in the lorde. This worde and faithe sanctifieth all their woorkes, that thei maie be pleasaunte vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> whereas emongest the vnfaithfull, thei can not bee acceptable, for lacke of the worde and faithe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe. vi.</hi>
                  </note> For there is nothyng holy in the yearth, besides Gods name and faithe. And all
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1416:370"/>
thynges that are sanctified, are sanctified onely by the name and worde of <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And surely by the worde of the fifte commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all mannes life,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod. xx.</hi>
                  </note> bothe in the gouernement of a commonaltie, and also of an houshold, is blessed, if so be faithe lacketh not, but that thou doest euery thyng obediently, in the name of <hi>GOD.</hi> But lette this be sufficient to admonishe here, that we maye vnderstande, that this example of Christe, was put forthe to the intent, that many of them that folow Christe, should be prouoked and stirred, studiously and diligently to heare the worde of <hi>GOD</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is setforthe for them onely,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal. cxix.</hi>
                  </note> that thei maie not bee confounded, when thei looke on all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes. But as for the other muste needes abide confusion, bicause thei haue no light of gods worde in their doynges.</p>
               <p>Now therfore, as we intended at the beginning let vs come to the historie: wherof are twoo partes. The firste is a doctrine, as touchyng this corporall life, that <hi>GOD</hi> also will prouide for the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the bodie, after that of the Spirituall life, that he will not leaue vs destitute of hope, for our synnes sake, but bee mercifull vnto vs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer vs from destruction. Bothe these doctrines are very necessary and profitable, and are worthy to be learned with all diligence of the godly.</p>
               <p>The comfort of the corporall life resteth herein, where as Christ commaundeth Peter to caste his Nettes, and Peter obeieth, and taketh a great scull of fish. Here is a good steward, if a man could make hym ouersear of his businesse. For nothyng could
<pb facs="tcp:1416:371"/>
lacke, where he is present. But the Euangeliste de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth sufficiently, that Christ will not doe so to al men, but to theim onely, that all the night labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in vaine, and afterwarde heard Gods woorde: that is, he will helpe the righteous and poore that felt nede. For the Christians in this life, hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles and temptacions. But when thei are tempted, and yet sticke constantly to their vocation and to the worde, Christ is ready to helpe them.</p>
               <p>And this is one comfort put forthe for vs in this place, that wee maie retaine faithe, and although we are now and then in pouertie, and lacke thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges necessarie, yet that we despaire not, nor vnpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently murmure, but to stande in good hope, that blessyng shall not long cease. For it chaunceth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with Peter &amp; his fellowes, to spende a whole night in vaine, and to take nothyng. Afterwarde commeth Christ. And first he putteth for his worde and maketh them Christians. Then he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to launche forthe, and to caste their Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for a draufte, Peter obeieth, and hath his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. This should we doe in our owne matters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. <hi>GOD</hi> giueth vs not by and by in the beginnyng all thynges plenteously. For if he should giue it vs, as sone as we were Christianed, and receiued into the catholike churche, we would not thinke it came from hym.<note place="margin">Christe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vs after pouertie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</note> Wherefore he sendeth vs pouertie for a tyme, that we should not be ignoraunt of trouble, and that one should almoste be faine to despaire, in that he lackyng all thynges, can not tell what to doe, or whiche waies to take, and also is in perill to be famished. In this case then that mercifull Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1416:371"/>
Christe, will bee at hande and saie: sette thy heart at reste, I knowe all, lose forthe thy net, cease not to labour, and looke for a blessyng.</p>
               <p>For although thei be nedie, yet must thei not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, and deny Christ, and murmure against God but trust that <hi>GOD</hi> at his time, will sende thinges necessarie, and that he will not suffer them to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, in doyng their labour and vocacion. For Christ giueth not Peter fishe on this wise,<note place="margin">We muste not cease fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hope and labour.</note> that thei should leape into his boate, but he muste launche forthe his shippe, prepare his Nettes, and dooe all thynges as Fishers are wont to doe. Although he became a Christian now first, he muste commit the successe thereof into Gods hande.</p>
               <p>So must we also walke, as euery mannes vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is. If thou labour for the maintenaunce of an housholde, or art an officer with aucthoritie: apply thy vocation diligently. For this is not against thy religion, and thou maiest by so doyng, doe that that is acceptable to <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>i. Peter. v.</hi>
                  </note> As for all other charge and rare, caste it on <hi>GOD,</hi> as how he should nourishe thee, and finde thee thinges necessary. And despaire not, bicause thou must striue with nede and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For there remaineth time inough, wherin thou canst not tell, what thyng or blessyng shall chaunce, as thou seest here. Remember this onely that thou must kepe constauncie and continuaunce, least thou be ouerthrowen with impacience. He that can not be content to doe this, but casteth awaie his nettes assone as he looseth his purpose, and forsaketh his vocation, and fall to an other kinde of life, it is no marueill if this man hath no good and prosperous
<pb facs="tcp:1416:372"/>
chaunce in all his life.</p>
               <p>This is the first doctrine, that we be not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and vexed in pouertie and necessitie, if we fele not Gods blessyng by and by at our nede. We muste not require this of God, to fulfill our desire whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we will. Bee thou not lothe a while to take labour in vaine, and to be paciente. Thou muste not refuse to lose a nightes labour, so that thou maiest thereby hope that the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, will helpe thee at his tyme with his blessyng, accordyng to the common saiyng: <hi>Dat deus omne bonum, sed non per cornua taurum.</hi> Labour and pacience is requisite.<note place="margin">God giueth all good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not the Bull by the hornes.</note> Thou maieste looke for Gods blessyng, so that thou forget not the first poincte, that is, to lende thy shippe to Christe, as Peter did, that he sittyng therein maie teache, and that we heare the worde diligently, and learne it exactly. For this is specially to bee marked in Peters example,<note place="margin">Peter obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word.</note> that he suffereth nothyng to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hym, but casteth from hym, the frowardnes of the vnbeleuers, and goeth wholly to Gods worde. And that it maie be well vnderstande, how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is in Peter, he is not feared, by that that is Gods common practise in all his woorkes, and is vsed also of <hi>GOD</hi> in this draught, wheras he poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the matter first to be doen, after a triflyng sort. For this is commonly the waie of Fishyng, not to looke for any greate praie out of the water at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie. The night is more fitte for this gain. And the Fishers are not wont to fishe in the main, but nigh to the bankes. Christ regardeth not this common trade of fishers, but commaundeth Peter to launche forthe to the depth, and whereas thei had taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1416:372"/>
in the night, in that place. Now he biddeth them at middaie, to lose their Nettes for a draught This semeth an absurde and foolishe thyng to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he seeth that Christ knewe not the arte of Fishers well, but yet he answereth manerly: Lorde (saieth he) we haue laboured all this nighte, and haue taken nothyng. If wee should followe the preceptes of our occupacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we should haue no great hope of a praie, yet will I proue at thy woorde. If that helpe not, all is but loste laboure. If Peter would not haue shewed his reuerence towarde Christ, he might haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him more roughly bicause of his ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on this wise.<note place="margin">Reason doth alwaies cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte Gods woorde.</note> How presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this man, that he taketh on hym to teache a Fisher his crafte, whereof he is ignoraunte? Why should he put his ower into an other mannes bote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not one thyng, to bee a teacher, and a Fisher, Christe when he teacheth, ought to bee heard. But when he teacheth to fishe, who should heare hym? Thus would we perchaunce answere Christe. For so are we alwaies wont to doe. We will bee wiser then Christ. But Peter is wiser then so, he laieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all suche thoughtes, and thinketh thus: what soeuer my craft be, I will not despise this woorde. And so he embraseth it with all his hearte, and he letteth passe, bothe his science, and his reason, and all suche like.</p>
               <p>This is marueilous, as touchyng the faithe of Peter, whiche could folowe Christes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and laye a side all his owne thoughtes, and sticke surely to the woorde. For this is euident by common experience, that men are well pleased, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:373"/>
their commaundementes are doen, although there come little successe thereby. Contrariwise, thei are greued, when the maister commaundeth, and the seruaunte obeyeth not, but thinke his owne waies better. In our owne matters we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not abide suche menne, yet wee shewe our selues suche alwaies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>GOD,</hi> settyng so muche by our owne reason, that we obeye not Gods worde. But what vntole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable arrogance is this,<note place="margin">God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to his worde.</note> when <hi>GOD</hi> is controlled in his worde? Who can abide this in his seruaunt, if he stande proudlie against his maisters commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and thinke his owne reason better? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>GOD</hi> iudgeth, that he is specially worshipped, when we shewe our selues suche, toward hym and his worde, as this Peter did. And although we be otherwise entised, yet let vs bridle our selues, that we maie preferre the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> before al rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. He that holdeth the worde after this sort, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <hi>GOD</hi> and all his Angelles. And if the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion could obtaine this, it could not be so encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with sedicion, there would be no sectes, no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, but all congregacions should perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as touching doctrine and sound faithe. Now thei can not be perswaded hereto, and bicause eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man trieth the opinions of religion, by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of reason, and mannes wisedome: it commeth to passe that all thynges, are full of errours and discorde.<note place="margin">We muste not despaire if it succede not.</note> This is very true, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptacion, when it chaunceth to vs, as it did to Peter. To labour all the night, and to take no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite thereby: we take it vnpaciently, and goe about to lay all aside, and depart. But we ought to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1416:373"/>
this temptacion, and sticke to our vocation stedfastly, and to caste all our care on the Lorde. For I haue knowen this often tymes by experience, when the obedient children in a familie, hath had misfortune: and contrariwise, the disobedient and stubburne, good fortune. But at laste the hard case of the good was more commended, and the wicked had an euill ende. Wherefore if it chaunce likewise to thee, that all thinges goe not well, be constaunt, and strengthen thy self, that thou be not ouercome of temptacion. For better is misfortune with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, then good fortune with wickednesse. The reason is, that <hi>GOD</hi> at the laste casteth awaie the disobediente, with their prosperitie, bee it neuer so greate, and exalteth the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble and meke, to great renoume. This example of Peter,<note place="margin">The example of Peter.</note> is studiously to bee followed, in that he hath respecte onely to the worde, and followeth that, and is nothing moued with these thoughtes, whiche surely would great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue troubled vs, and doubtles thei were in his minde also. For we are commaunded aswell as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to labour and to serue in our vocation. He that taketh holde to his vocation, and suffereth not him self to be withdrawen from his purpose, although it doeth but slowly prosper, and the blessyng is lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in comming, yet must he not doubt of a prosperous ende. For <hi>GOD</hi> can do no otherwise, but at length haue respecte to obedience, although he differreth it for a tyme, and proueth vs, whether we regarde his commaundement or not. Wherefor no manne ought to be weary, if he hath laboured all the night without profite. For if Peter had gone about this
<pb facs="tcp:1416:374"/>
draught in the night, he would haue imputed it to his cunnyng and labour, neither would he haue thought any thyng els, requisite to suche a successe. But whereas he fisheth all nighte, and taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, and Christ first ministreth his woorde, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng hym there with to assaie againe: there hath Peter a sure triall, that this good successe, came not by fishyng and labour, but of Gods worde and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng. And lette this suffice you, as concernyng the firste doctrine, whiche is corporall, and pertaineth to the bodily liuelode, that Christe will be present, with all his that laboure by his blessyng, and not suffer them to perishe for hunger.</p>
               <p>The second doctrine is spirituall. For thus doth it followe in the historie, that Peter is astonied by the draught of fishe, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the knowledge of Christe, that he is not onely man. And whereas he acknowledgeth hymself a synner, and falleth doune at Christes feete, saiyng: departe from me Lorde, for I am a synner: It is a spirituall matter and fewe vnderstande it. For it semeth hereby, that Peter did it of a certaine religion, and that he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a reuerence, to departe from Christe. But the meanyng of it is not so. The conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is in this case.<note place="margin">Marke well</note> When <hi>GOD</hi> commeth with his grace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miseth remission of synne, and life euerlastyng, frely for Christes sake: the grace is so large, that all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges seme to greate for vs, neither dare we approch nigh thereto, for the greatnesse thereof. It is easie to beleue that <hi>GOD</hi> is good and mercifull: but that he imbraceth vs with his greate mercie, our heart can not be made to beleue that. All men thinke, if
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1416:374"/>
I wer so pure and rightuous, as Marie the virgin sainct Peter, sainct Paule: I would couple my self also to his grace, but I am a sinner: I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of grace, but rather of wrothe. Then commeth the Deuill, and he inlargeth sinne so muche in thy heart, that thou maiest see nothing but thy vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, and thou canst not but wonder, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mased at the greatnes, of that exceding grace. This is a spirituall temptacion, whereof the prophane and rude (as wee bee almoste all) haue no perceue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce nor vnderstanding. For this is learned by experience onely, and no otherwise. Wherefore the greatest sort liueth on such wise, that thei thinke not muche, either of their sinne, or of the grace of <hi>GOD.</hi> But true Christian men doe alwaies tremble and feare, that that is to muche that <hi>GOD</hi> doth, on his owne behalf. Who am I (saie thei) O Lorde <hi>GOD,</hi> that thou bryngest me thus farre, I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of so greate mercie of <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And herevnto belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth, that Christ comforteth Peter, to be without feare, for bicause he goeth not about now, to iudge Peters synnes, but to deliuer hym from sinne, and to sette hym in suche an office, that he maie bryng other also to the same grace. So that all this comforte maie bee applied, if wee should chaunce to haue suche thoughtes, and be put in like feare: to encourage vs to resiste theim, and not to giue place vnto them.<note place="margin">Christe hath mercie on synners.</note> For Christe came not to driue synners from hym, but he came into the yearth for their sakes. Wherfore he comforteth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against suche thoughtes, and biddeth hym not to feare, as (he saieth) also in an other place. Feare
<pb facs="tcp:1416:375"/>
not little flocke,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math. ix. Luke. xii.</hi>
                  </note> it is my fathers will, to giue you the kyngdome. In that place Christe talketh also with suche, that thinke: How canste thou come to heauen, and to eternall life? Canst thou obtaine to the fellowshippe of Angelles? If thou were holier, there were no cause why thou shouldest despaire. But as thou art now, all thy hope is in vaine. But Christe answereth otherwise, you feare (saieth he) but dooe not so. For it hath pleased my father, to giue you the kyngdome, and that of his owne free will. For whereas you are vnworthie beyng syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,<note place="margin">God giueth to the vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of his mercie.</note> this is his mercifull will, to giue it you of his grace and mercie: wherefore feare not, but receiue it ioyfully, and with a gladde hearte. For if <hi>GOD</hi> would not giue vs, vntill wee were worthie, wee should neither haue meate nor drinke. But he will not haue respect to our worthinesse &amp; merites, but to our nede, and to his owne goodnes &amp; mercy. And this is the cause, that he giueth vs not onely thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges requisite to the bodie, but also euerlasting life, with suche temptacion is Peter also here encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. He perceiueth the greate goodnes of Christe, and casteth in his mynde, howe vnworthie he is thereof, and therefore he beginneth to despaire, what place (saieth he) is there for thee with vs? Couple thy self with the rightuous, I am a synner. But Christ comforteth hym, and sheweth hymself to be farre vnlike that, that Peter thought of him, commaundyng hym to bee of good chere, and to take heart of grace, and that the matter as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng the fishe, is but little in comparison of that, that, he will make hym a fisher of men. Now thou
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1416:375"/>
art a Fisher, but I will giue thee an other office, to enter into other waters, and to take other Fishe, that is, men, that heauen maie haue store of suche fishes to be saued, as thy shippe is now full of fishe. I will finde thee an other Nette for that draught, that is, the Gospell. By this shalt thou take the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that thei maie bee Baptized, beleue, and haue euerlastyng life. And that not in one place, but that in all the worlde, thou maiest tourne to the faithe, in one place, a citie, in an other the whole people.</p>
               <p>This is a spirituall comforte, whiche <hi>GOD</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forthe to his disciples, that he will not onely satisfie their hunger, but gouerne their spirituall administration, and sende them into all the worlde, to Kynges and Princes with the Gospell. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the deuill withstandeth those Fishers, with all his might, yet the vertue of this Fishyng, can not be restrained, but that the worde breaketh tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, and getteth many Christians, enuieth the deuill neuer so muche. And the Gospell, Baptisme,<note place="margin">A Nette for spiritual fish.</note> and the Lordes Supper, are our instrumentes for this matter, whereby the waie to euerlastyng life is opened vnto vs.</p>
               <p>It is a greate thyng, that we are appoincted to euerlasting life, and a thing hard to be beleued. But consider on the contrary part, what a great thing it is to burne in hell fire, and that we might escape this punishement, <hi>GOD</hi> giueth vnto vs, his worde and sacramentes, whiche are Nettes prepared for the draught of suche fishe. Wherefore Christ comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and saieth, feare not, consider not whether ye hee worthie. It is my fathers will, that ye should
<pb facs="tcp:1416:376"/>
not perishe, as your synnes haue deserued. Wherfore cleaue to me onely: come to Baptisme: vse the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des supper: shewe your selues obedient to my Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and there shall be no perill. We haue now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of these twoo doctrines, with the example, that Gods woorde might be greatly studied.

               <p>The seconde is, that he helpeth vs against sinne, that we maie not be damned.

Wherefore must we also endeuour our selues, not to doe fained woorkes towarde our neighbours, but true and hartie, euen as <hi>GOD</hi> wrought the woorke of our saluation in verie deede. And for this cause, Christe taketh on hym this Gospell, to expounde the first precept, and putteth forthe to vs an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to beware, saiyng: Except your rightuousnesse exceade the rightuousnesse of the Phariseis and Scribes, ye can not enter into the kyngdome of heauen. The sentence is shorte, he must haue more rightuousnesse then the Pharisie, that aspireth to

the kyngdome of <hi>GOD.</hi> What is then the rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of the Phariseis? This is not to be blamed, that thei liued an honest and sober life, refrainyng them selues from sinne. &amp;c. For <hi>GOD</hi> requireth that of vs: as is his commaundemente: Thou shalte not kill: Thou shalt not commit adulterie: Thou shalte not beare false witnesse. And he that obeieth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, dooeth well. But this was to be blamed in the Phariseis, that thei thought theim selues rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for these woorkes, and that thei were fautlesse, in all that the Lawe requireth, as though thei had whollie accomplished it. And least we should haue suche an opinion, Christ warneth vs in this place, that although we doe the woorkes of the lawe, and liue blamelesse in the sight of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet that we should not be so arrogant, as to thinke ourselues iuste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>GOD</hi> therefore, and in perfecte obedience. For as Christ saieth here: Although a manne hath not killed with the hande, yet maie he be a murtherer, and a breaker of the lawe before <hi>GOD.</hi> The reason is. For <hi>GOD</hi> hath forbidden all anger in the heart, euery wrathfull worde, and all angrie signes in the face, by this commaundement.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of the Phariseis.</note>So that the Phariseis rightuousnes, signifieth outward rightuousnes, as not to kill, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultrie, and to thinke that all rightuousnes and holinesse consisteth therein, and that the Lawe hath nothyng against vs, but that we haue fulfilled it, and haue no neede of Gods mercie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the heart inwardly be full of suche sinne and concupiscence.

woorkes fulfill not the lawe, but an heart is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site thereto, whiche is pure, and voide of ire, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, enuie, lecherie, &amp; other concupiscences.

               <p>But thou wilt saie, where maie suche an hearte be founde? Uerely neither I, neither thou haue it in store.

Truely this
<pb facs="tcp:1416:378"/>
must we doe. We must not followe the Scribes and Phariseis, to thinke our selues rightuous for our woorkes. But for all our rightuousnes, what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we dooe, we muste shewe suche submission, and humblenesse before <hi>GOD,</hi> that wee maie saie: O Lorde I am a synner, be thou mercifull vnto me, and enter not into Iudgement with thy seruaunt, as touchyng workes, but deale with me accordyng to thy mercie and grace, whiche thou haste promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and performed to vs in Christ.</p>
               <p>This doctrine tendeth to this ende specially, that spirituall pride maie therby be restrained, and wee by that meanes come vnto the knowledge of our filthy hearte, and moste corrupt nature, and so at the laste be brought to the hope of Gods grace, fauour, and mercie.

By this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shalt thou by little &amp; little, driue out al wrathe out of thy hearte, and make it vanishe awaie as the smoke.</p>

               <p>Therefore Christe admonisheth vs, that we bee not prouoked vnto euill, through the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Scribes and Phariseis.

               <p>Christe maketh this doctrine a matter of greate necessitie, and willeth, if we will be christians, that wee continually excercise our selues in these and suche his woorkes. For as it is a sentence graue, waightie, and of greate importaunce, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saith first:<note place="margin">

For where dissention and wrathe is, there are twoo partes: One whiche hath hurted and doen vniustly: the other, whiche was hurt,<note place="margin">In dissention there are two parties.</note> and suffered wrong.

come and offer thy gifte. For if thou dooe not this, all thyne Oblation shalbe in vaine, neither shall it please <hi>GOD,</hi> what so euer thou offerest.</p>
               <p>In these woordes Christ tareth and reproueth the thoughtes and fansies of the Phariseis, which imagined that thei should so bleare the eyes of God that he should not perceiue and see, their enuie and hatred in their hearte against their neighbour, and so thei should bee coumpted rightuous of all men. But Christ saieth thus:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene. iiii.</hi>
                  </note> Thou deceiuest thy self. God firste of all will beholde the hearte, how it is affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towarde the neighbour. If he spie any enuie or hatred to be in the heart, thinke not, that thy obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,<note place="margin">

For what a leude maner were this, that thou shouldest offer an Oxe vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> and slea thy brother? This wer to offer vp an halfpenie, and to steale awaie infinite talentes, Thus it becometh thee not to doe. But if thou wilt worshippe <hi>GOD</hi> a right, firste of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, that there be no hatred in thy hearte against thy neighbour, otherwise thou canst by no meanes please <hi>GOD,</hi> what so euer thou dooest. And hereof cometh it to passe, that many through displeasure, borne to their neighbour, abstaine from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and by no meanes giue them selues to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer. For this peticion maketh them aferde, when thei saie:<note place="margin">

                  </gap>ither ought thei to thinke otherwise. For if thou wilte not forgiue: neither will <hi>GOD</hi> forgiue thee.

Christ also chargeth this partie, that he be redy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reconciliation, and by no meanes shewe hymself harde, &amp; vntoward in this matter.

It appereth, that suche as appoincted this Gospell now to bee redde, had a consideracion of the tyme, seyng that this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is set foorthe in the fruitfull tyme of the yere, that all men maie learne and vnderstande, that all these thynges, whiche wee receiue and take of the grounde, come vnto vs by the blessyng of God, and that God euen at this presente daie, worketh with vs this miracle, whiche at the tyme he wroughte in the wildernes, saiyng, that with a fewe nourish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes, or slender prouision, he is able now also, through his blessyng, to minister foode to many, yea, to thousandes, thousandes of people, as he daily doeth, so that although many times through tempestes, the fruictes of the yearth haue no good successe, yet that wee should knowe, that our chief help and comfort, consisteth in the blessyng of God.

And this is the cause, that he afterward is so carefully mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to make prouision for them, and coumpteth it his office, to see that thei lacke nothyng, leaste thei should perishe for honger: that it should bee a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all doctrine to vs, first of all, to haue a singuler re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to the woorde of <hi>GOD,</hi> and to practise the same, in our life and conuersacion: and afterward as touching thinges apperteining vnto our liuing to caste all our care vpon Christ.

to teache them many thynges.<note place="margin">The greate miserie is the lacke of gods worde, which is the foode of the soule.</note> And this is the first and chifeste miserie, whiche Christe, as a good Doctour and teacher considereth, that the people were as scattered shepe, euen as we also were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the kyngdome of the Pope.

               <p>It appereth by sainct Marke, that the people of the Iewes were in greate miserie and blindnesse, forasmuche as thei were as shepe without a shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd. There wer Priestes and Leuites in office, to teache the people of the commyng of Christ, and of his gracious and mercifull kyngdome. But what did thei? Thei became of Shepheardes, rauenyng Wolffes. The worde of <hi>GOD</hi> thei taught not, but thei sette forthe to the people their owne dreames, vnto the greate daunger and perill of the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shepe, as it chaunced also vnto vs in the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. For vnder the Pope no man knewe, that <hi>GOD</hi> would bee mercifull vnto vs for Christes sake, and forgiue vs our synnes, so that the doctrine of reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And this is the first and principall calamitie and miserie, that Christ noteth in the people, and therefore is moued with a ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t compassion toward them, and preacheth vnto them a long sermon. As though he should saie: What do

               <p>Therefore Marke saieth: Thei were as Shepe without a Shepheard.<note place="margin">A shepe with out a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</note> It is an extreme miserie, when a shepe is without a shepherd.

then highe penurie, and moste miserable lacke, as we se here. The Apostles also take care. But what is their care? For sothe this: whens shall we gette bread here in the wildernes, that we maie fede this people? This their care is suche, that no goodnesse cometh of it.

And thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye take hede, ye shall bee deceiued, and fall into daunger, before ye beware. But who shall be in the faulte? Surely not I, whiche warne you to take hede, but ye your selues, whiche heare the woorde and haue it, and yet will you not kepe it, nor holde it faste. &amp;c. For if a christian man being circumspect, and hauyng regard to himself,<note place="margin">The Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to bee knowen of al degrees,</note> and to his owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion, had no more but the Cathechisme, that is to saie, the tenne Commaundementes, the Articles of the faithe, the lordes praier, the wordes of Christ concernyng Baptisme, and the Lordes supper: euen by these thynges onely, might he defende hymself against all heresies and errours. But seing there is so greate negligence of hearyng the woorde, and so fewe that delighte in the same, with their wholle heartes: it is no marueile, though the Deuill take place in theim, and throwe theim hedlong into all kinde of wicked and vngodly doctrine.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:396"/>Against this so greate daunger, Christe would haue vs well enarmed,<note place="margin">The woorde of God is a defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se against the Deuill and all his ministers.</note> and strongly defensed, that we be not circumuented nor beguiled, yea, deceiued and destroied of those Wolffes: whiche shalbe, if we caste a waie this securitie and negligence, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse our selues manly and valiauntly, with the worde of God.

and make the husbande to forsake the wyfe, &amp; the wife her husband, to ioyn them selues to their wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked and damnable religion: when they take away the proprietie and owneshyp of worldly goodes and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, and would haue all thynges common: when they contemne and condempne the politike and ciuile power as prophane and vngodly, and professe theym selues in dede ennemies to the congregation of God, to the ciuile power, and to the gouernement of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies or householdes, This faire face also was set vpon the rules of monkes and nonnes, so that by them also the whole worlde was in a maner deceiued. But this iugglyng is now vttered by the word of God, so that nowe the wolfe, whyche lurked vnder the sheepes clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng is come to lyght, and knowen of all men.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, great gifts lykewise ar shepes clothing, wherof Christ speaketh in the Gospell,<note place="margin">Great giftes.</note> that some shall come in his name, and prophecie or tel things to come some shall cast out deuils, and worke greate miracles. In these thynges also, there oughte to be no preiudice to the Christians, as though they ought not therefore to make inquisition of the truthe of the doctrine. The woorde muste bee consydered without any respecte had to the prerogatiue of any persone: and the wolfe is alwayes to be feared and suspected vnder the shee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes clothynge.</p>
               <p>And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first rule, whiche Christ prescribeth to his christians, that they diligently take heede &amp; beware of shepes clothyng. For although their speeche be fayre and curteous, their office true: their outward life faut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lesse: besides a great number of excellente vertues: yet we ought to mystrust, lest vnder them crafte, falshode, and deceyte, should lye lurkyng, forasmuche as vnder
<pb facs="tcp:1416:402"/>
faire and sugred speche, there may lye hyd most dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poyson: vnder a true office, a corrupt vsyng therof: vnder a religious lyfe, fraude, guile and deceipt: vnder great giftes, great wickednes. Therfore so soone as thou seest the shepes clothyng, thynke, that thou must take good hede and beware. For Christe hymselfe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth warnynge, that wolfes haue suche clothynge to hyde them selues in. Wherfore thou muste diligently searche them, that theyr craftes and subtilties may be knowen. But howe shall that be doone? Ueryly that will the second rule teache,<note place="margin">The seconde rule.</note> whyche is: Thou shalt let passe the outwarde face and fayre shewe, wherof we haue hitherto spoken, and thou shalt consider the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.<note place="margin">The fruites are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</note> By their fruicts (saieth he) shall ye know theym. And he putteth forth a similitude. None of you (sayth he) is so madde, that he wold gather grapes of thorns or fygs of thistles. For such fruits grow in other trees In orchardes also men iudge by the fruictes of apple trees, of the good tree: but wher nothing is, they iudg the contrary. This trade doth Christ also put forth to vs for to iudge of false teachers, that we be not decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the first blushe, although the wolfe cometh clad with neuer so goodly and godly shepes clothyng.</p>
               <p>But first of all, what is the fruit of a true prophet &amp; teacher,<note place="margin">The fruite of a true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note> wherby he muste be knowen to be no wolfe, but a true shepe? Truely not the outward life, nor the office, nor the titles, nor yet the noble gifts. For Christ dothe testifie this, and experience techeth the same, that men by these are oftentimes deceaued. The true fruict is, as Christ sheweth in the ende, to do the will of the Father, whiche is in heauen. And here it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Christ speaketh not generally of all Cristians but onely of Prophetes or teachers. This is trewe,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1416:402"/>
that all men ought to do the will of the heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; therby do they also get saluation. The Fathers will is, not only that we should do the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and by that meanes declare our obedience to God:<note place="margin">What the wyll of god is</note> (For seyng we can not do this perfectly in this lyfe. it is impossible for vs to affirme, that we haue don the will of God, or that we haue any power of our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to obtein saluation &amp; the kingdome of God by our workes:) but also and moste specially this is proprely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> will of God, as Christ saith in the gospell of S. Iohn, that euery one that seeth the sonne, &amp; beleueth in hym,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.</note> should haue euerlastyng life. And I will raise hym vp, saieth Cnriste, at the last daye. This is the only waie whiche all teachers and scholers muste walke, if they, wyll come vnto euerlastyng saluation.</p>
               <p>Christ speaketh here specially of techers or prophets whose propre and true fruict is,<note place="margin">The fruite of true prophets and teachers.</note> to set forth &amp; to teache this wyll diligently, that God is gentill and merciful, and willeth not the death of a synner, but that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and lyue: and that God hym selfe declared that mercye, when hee sente his onely begotten sonne into this worlde to become man. He therefore that recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth hym, and beleueth in hym, that is, he that hathe this hope and truste in hym, that God is mercyful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for his sonne Christes sake, and forgeueth hym his synnes, and will geue him euerlasting lyfe. &amp;c. He that setteth forthe this doctrine syncerely and purely, &amp; bringeth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Christ, as the only &amp; alone mediator betwene God &amp; vs: this man as a true techer doth the will of God. And this is the true fruicte, whereby no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be deceiued. For if it wer possible that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuell himself shold so teach, this doctrine could not be false,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:403"/>
but that he, whiche doth beleue it, should surely obtein that, whyche it promyseth.</p>
               <p>After this fruict, whiche is trewe, proper, and most certain, and can by no meanes deceaue: other also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,<note place="margin">Godly lyfe of the teachers.</note> that is to say. that the lyfe be agreable, and not contrarie to that doctrine. But this seconde fruicte is then to be counted true, when the first, that is to say, the doctrine of Christe is presente. For it is possible, that the doctrine may be faultlesse,<note place="margin">Not the lyfe but the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the preacher is chefelye to be consydered.</note> when notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng the lyfe is euyll &amp; sclandrous. Therfore we must not looke specially to the lyfe, but to the doctrine. For by that means shall we most certainly know, whether it be a wolfe or a shepe, that commeth to vs in shepes clothyng. He therfore that will trie the Pope with his churche, let hym take his beginning of the first fruict, that is to say, of doctrine. For there shall he fynd, that the Popes doctrine of Remission of synnes,<note place="margin">Howe the pope and hys churche are to be tryed.</note> and of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is not onely directed vnto Christe, but vnto all maner of workes, vnto the vowes of Monkes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the syngyng of Masses, vnto pardons and merits of sainctes.<note place="margin">The doctrine and lyfe of the pope and hys churche.</note> These are prickyng and hurtefull thornes, whiche come not foorthe in a figge tree, or in a vyne. Secondarily, lette theyr lyfe also be consydered. Here shall it be founde, that the Pope and all his, cast asyde all due obedience to God and theyr princes. Again, the Pope and all his complices doo moste extremely hate the worde of God, and the true professors of the same: they persecute them moste spitefully, they punish them most cruelly, where soeuer they can laye hand on them they lyue moste filthyly and abhominably: they labour not, but vnfruitfully waste and spend away lyke bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gods and Epicures, the goodes of the church. To be short, there is nothyng in their lyfe worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1416:403"/>
Looke therefore where these two thynges are, that is to say, where the lyfe and doctrine be both naught: thynk surely that there are thornes &amp; thistles: and that if thou seeke there for grapes and fygges, thou shalte not onely not fynde them, but thou shalte also departe with losse. For thys ought to offende no manne, that the vyne is so yll fauoured woodde, and the fygge tree so weake: And contrarywise, that all, whiche belongeth to thornes, is more beautyfull and syghtly, yea swete roses comme of them. For not the fayre syghte and pleasaunte looke is to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydered, but the very matter, and the fruict and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie that commeth thereof. Applye all thynges to this poynt, and to none other.</p>
               <p>Nowe what shall be the punyshement of such false Prophetes?<note place="margin">The reward of false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes.</note> Christe sheweth by the similitude of a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tree, euen to be cut downe, and cast into the fire. This shall bee the ende of suche teachers, and also of theyr scholers, whenne they regard not true doctrine nor yet the fruites therof. Therfore lette vs highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme the woorde of GOD, diligentely heare and marke it, and endeuour our selues to the vttermost of oure power, to brynge foorthe good fruictes, and all false doctrine and wycked lyfe eschue and auoide, as the deuill and the pestilence.</p>
               <p>The Lorde Iesus <hi>CHRIST,</hi> thoroughe the holy Ghost, geue vs all grace so to do, and so to continue vnto the ende.</p>

In that behalfe there is no fault in the golde, nor in other thynges, because the woman doth abuse them: yet this example tendeth to this ende, that I may admonishe thee, that seinge this woman for a litle aduauntage taketh so greate payne in deckinge and trymminge vp of her selfe to please her louers: thou muche more oughtest to sett a worke all the lymmes of thy bodye for the attayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euerlastynge lyfe, and that thou mayst please Christe thy louer. This is not so vnderstanded, as though filthynes and dishonestie semed worthy to be folowed, but this care and diligence is set forth for an example, to induce thee vnto a better thyng.</p>
               <p>But how goeth the worlde? Christ pronounceth an horrible sentence, &amp; saith: The children of this worlde are more prudent, more forecastyng, more circumspect, more wise in their generation, then the children of lyght. The matter is plaine. For when there is any hope of game and aduantage, howe doth the children this worlde carcke and care, swyncke and sweate, moyle and turmoyle? They spare no labour, no dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, no payne, no trauaile: with howe great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunces, perilles and dangers are robbers &amp; theaues
<pb facs="tcp:1416:410"/>
afflicted and vexed? Their care and pensiuenes ceasseth neither night nor daye. Pursepickers, stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, whoremongers, adulterers, &amp;c. Haue their paines &amp; labours, and sweate not a litle to gratifie &amp; pleasure the deuill, and to satisfye their wicked lustes. But contrariwise Christen men lye as it were oppressed with a dead slepe,<note place="margin">The sluggish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> secure, carelesse, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any thought, when they shold do the workes of charitie and serue god. They thincke al things to much, when they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do or suffer any thyng for Gods cause, or for the commoditie of their neighbour. And whereas the worlde bestoweth so greate payne in purchasing, hell, and in pleasing the deuil, there muste the Christians be vrged and drawen, as it were a beare to a stake, to do their dutie although, god knoweth, they do it both slenderly and slowly.</p>
               <p>It is therfore a most goodly and trymme example, that Christ setteth forth here vnto vs. If we haue any consideration of our dutie, we nede not fetche exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples a farre of, or borowe them out of these bookes and those monumentes: only let euery man consider his owne famely or housholde, and diligently marcke, howe diligent and paineful his children or seruauntes are to do a mischeife, and to worke that which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleasant to the deuill. All these may be an example vnto vs, that we shoulde with like diligence and care embrace the worde of God and the thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vnto euerlasting life. For seing they be careful in euil &amp; wicked things: ought we not much more to be careful &amp; painefull about good and godly thinges? Let vs not thincke this by any meanes to be suffred, that the wicked lymmes of the deuill shold make such haste to hel: and we that wil be counted Christians to stande still lyke dastardes, &amp; to go about nothing,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1416:410"/>
that may further vs vnto the kingdome of heauen and vnto euerlasting life.</p>
               <p>But the worlde doth here helpe vs notably well with an holsome example concernynge the busines,<note place="margin">An example of acouetous man.</note> wherof Christ speaketh in this place. For, set before thee som man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is geuen to couetousnes: Thou shalt see, that he can take no reste neither night nor daye. The desire and care of money doth so tosse hym, as it were the sea, when it is most vnquiet. He inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth suche subtile wayes to get goods, as those that be witty men can none otherwise then greatly marueille at his doinges. To be shorte, he will not let scape so much as a farthing, if there be any hope to come by it. For his drie iawes are as gredy &amp; as wide gaping for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle as for the greate. Al is fysh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cometh to the net.</p>
               <p>This couetous miser, this miserable Mammonisie, this wycked worldlyng, ought to moue vs all by hys example,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> that as he hath an vnsaciable desire vnto the getting of money: so we likewise shold haue as gredy a mynde, as feruent a desyre, as wel willing an hearte to obtaine and get euerlasting lyfe.</p>
               <p>But where are these Christians, that study thus to do their dutie? That are as muche delighted to helpe their neighbours nede wyth a lytle money euery man accordyng to his habilitie, as this couetous man is delighted to see his stocke of money encreased eyther by vsurie or by any other vnlawful meane. When not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandynge all that the couetous man getteth (as I may speake nothing of the shame &amp; dishonestie) is but transitorie and soon passeth away and cometh to naught. But looke what things we get be Christen liberalitie, &amp; by doing good to the poore members of Christe, they bringe with them euerlastinge fruites
<pb facs="tcp:1416:411"/>
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities. For thus sayth Salomon: He that pitieth the poore,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 19.</note> lendeth to the Lord: and looke what he layeth out, it shall be paid hym again. Here a man nedeth not to feare the losse of his stocke or gaynes thereby, for he is promised, that he shall loose nothing, but whatsoeuer he bestoweth vpon the poore, it shalbe abundantly recompenced hym. But this wil take no place among vs, neither do we beleue it. For by the deuil are the sences and iudgements of the vnfaithful hindered and letted, that they can not perceaue this, nor haue any mynde to this gayne and aduantage, whiche farre surmounteth and passeth all worldly lucre and profite. Wherfore we are worthely punished for oure madnes, seinge that we set more by thynges present although frayle &amp; tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore Christe concludeth very truly, when he sayth, that the children of this worlde are wyser in their generation, then the Sonnes of God. For the deuill receaueth an hundred times more of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then God doth of his.

stay we leaue vnto, that we are the children of lyght. If we do but only kepe this name diligently,<note place="margin">Marke well.</note> and not go from the knowledge of this light, althoughe all thinges be not the perfectest, nor done with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest prouidence and forecaste, as the matters of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this lyfe are, yet are we not excluded from the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session and glorie of this light, if we haue but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to take in hand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes of godlines, that we may be nombred among them that are called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light. For this is certein and sure, that in the prouision of thynges, we shall neuer be of lyke dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the children of this worlde, so long as we liue. Therfore this ought not to discourage vs, though oure olde man go slenderly forward vnto godlines, wheras the children of this world runne spedily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any stay vnto hell:<note place="margin">Wee oughte daylye to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in the waye of godly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes more and more.</note> neither let vs suffer our selues by any obstacles or lettes to be drawen out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waie, but rather let vs go forwarde dayly somwhat in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, lenitie, softnes, gentlenes, mercie, compassion, &amp; in suche other workes of godlines.

But as concernyng these lyghtes, thus he putteth forth his example: This one thing, sayth he, I do: I forget those thinges which are
<pb facs="tcp:1416:412"/>
behinde, and endeuour my selfe vnto those thinges whiche are before, and accordyng to the marcke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, I preace to the rewarde of the high callinge of God thorow Christ Iesu.</p>
               <p>This is therfore our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte, that he wil not conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne vs, that are made the children of light by the grace of god in Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> with the children of this worlde whiche ronne hedlong vnto hell, although we be yet weake, for asmuche as we alwaies striue, and to thuttermost of our power labour to obtaine the rewarde of the high callyng of God. For although he might well and worthely reproue vs, because we beinge the children of light, ronne so slowly in our course: Yet he by his grace in forgeuynge vs our synnes doth supply that, which lacketh in vs: whiche his grace as the wyde heauen, is extended ouer all our lyfe, so that it lyeth hydde with all her imperfection and poore state vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his heauen of Gods mercie and grace continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If we stycke fast to this purpose, we shall at the lest fynde some frendes there,<note place="margin">We ought li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally to geue vnto the poore.</note> but specially the highest frende of all, which is able to geue heauen and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng saluation, euen our Lorde Iesus Christ. And this is the doctrine, which is to be learned out of this our gospell, euen that we vse iustly and truly the Mammon of iniquitie, or the wicked Mammon, that is to say, our goods and worldly possessions, and make vs frendes of them, namely, that we transpose them vnto the benefites of other, &amp; vnto the helpinge of such as be in necessitie, as this steward maketh him frendes of an other mans goodes.</p>
               <p>But here som doubt and demaunde, how this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine agreeth with the doctrine of iustification by fayth alone. The papistes busye them selues in this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1416:412"/>
place beyonde all reason, and expounde it on suche sorte,<note place="margin">Papistes a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>buse the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of god.</note> as thoughe euerlastynge lyfe were gotten by workes, and that only fayth can not do it, seynge Christ saith: make ye frendes of wycked Mammon, that when ye shal departe, they may receaue you into euerlastynge tabernacles. Although the Papistes are not worthy to be answered as touchyng this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion or any other (for they do not, nor wyll not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it whatsoeuer be answered, but they go styll for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to exercise their tyranny against the truth of gods worde and the faithfull professours of the same) yet for theyr sakes, in whom there is some good hope of amendment, I will answere somwhat to this doubte or question: Firste of all the Papistes them selues must nedes graunte, that these frendes, of whome <hi>CHRIST</hi> speaketh here, are men,<note place="margin">Note this rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son.</note> whiche are conuersant among vs. For otherwise could we geue them nothyng. But how shall they geue vs heauen, that as yet are not in it them selues? And yet this is true, that they geue heauen. For they are the wordes of Christ, which can not be chaunged, nor called into question. make ye frendes of wycked Mammon, saith he, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when ye fayle, they may receaue you into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euerlasting tabernacles. But how this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, Christ teacheth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel of s. Mathew where he saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 25.</note> that he himself at the last day wil come forth &amp; testifie, that whatsoeuer we haue done in our life time to his poore members, we did it vnto him, and that he wil abundantlye recompence it with the reward of euerlasting life, not that ye haue deserued the same by our workes, but for his promis sake: as he saith: Come ye blessed of my father, possesse the kyngdome, whiche was prepared for you from the
<pb facs="tcp:1416:413"/>
beginning of the worlde. But here is a difference to be made in this question. For the right and true frend, which is both able &amp; also wil geue vs heauen, is Christ This is without all paraduenture. As for the poore beggers, whome we haue holpen with our goods in this worlde, they shall not do it. But here ryseth an other question, whether we by our almose and other good workes are able to deserue heauen and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting lyfe? This question is sone answered. Paul saith: whatsoeuer is not of faith,<note place="margin">Whyther by oure good workes wee deserue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> is synne. It foloweth therfore that God doth not allowe thee almose of the vnfaithfull: again, that he will not geue heauen and euerlastynge lyfe for that. But they that beleue in Christe, and afterwarde declare their fayth by theyr workes: their workes please God for their faiths sake: and he will also rewarde suche workes in the lyfe to come. But yet for all that this doth not herof folowe, that euerlasting life is geuen vs for our workes sake. For that is annexed only vnto faith, as in the gospell he doth oftentimes testifie: He that beleueth in me, sayth he, shall neuer see death. I am the waye, the truth and the lyfe. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 11. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.</note> God deliuered his sonne, that all that beleue in him, should not perishe, but haue euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting lyfe. This is a true certein and sure solution. For Paules sentence is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</note> as we heard before: Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is not of faith, is synne. Therfore if any almose shall please god, there must nedes be first of all fayth in Christ.<note place="margin">Faythe.</note> That fayth hath euerlasting life folowynge it: It obtayneth remission of sinnes, and causeth, that God aloweth our workes, althoughe they be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and not altogether pure: again, that God of his liberalitie and munificence will rewarde them in the lyfe to come, as we hearde before out of the gospell of

               <p>Therfore when Christ sayth: make you frendes of wicked Mammon, that when ye departe or fayle, they maye receaue you into euerlastinge tabernacles: the sence and meaning of these wordes can be none other but this If we be the Disciples of Christ, and do good workes, that god will rewarde those good workes in the life to come.

For if the most noble, goodly &amp; beautifull citie were not spared, because hauyng the worde of god, it repented not: let all men thincke this for a moste certeintie, that except they repent in time &amp; amend, they lykewise shal neuer escape the dreadful displeasure &amp; whote vengeance of god. Christ himself is marueilously troubled concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauy destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so great &amp; so noble a Citie, &amp; wysheth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it wold call it selfe to remembraunce, and well consider afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hande the wrath that is to come, and addresse it selfe vnto amendement, mourne, wepe, and lament, &amp; desire god to be merciful vnto it, &amp; to forgeue it, &amp; tourne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye those plagues, that it worthely hath deserued.

<pb facs="tcp:1416:415"/>
despise it: that they shoulde not be carelesse, nor thincke with themselfes, that god wil forgeue them this fault This punishment shall as surely chaunce to all suche, as god lyueth. Therfore let vs repent in tyme, &amp; cease from all sinnes,<note place="margin">The dispy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng of gods worde is a most horrible synne.</note> but specially from that sinne, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth the worde of god or the tyme of visitation, and that heare the sermons, and yet truly tourne they not vnto godlines, but goeth forth in all kynde of wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckednes, whatsoeuer is preached and taught to the contrarie. For the paine is not therfore taken awaye, because it is differred for a time. For here is set before vs a terrible example of the most fearce and horrible iudgement of god against a Citie that he most dearly loued and was counted the holiest Citie in the world, and against a people, which God had chosen as pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to himselfe before all other nations vnder heauen. This Citie was the house and dwelling place of god, and the people therof were his owne familie &amp; hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.<note place="margin">Ierusalem.</note> For next vnto heauen Ierusalem was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest place, where god and his Angels dwelte, where al the seruice of god was appointed to be done, where almost all the Patriarches lyued, and were buried: where also Christ the Sonne of God was, &amp; walked in the fleshe, died, and was buried, rose again, and sent the holy ghost: so that this Citie in holynes passed all Cities in the worlde, neyther was the lyke euer founde on the earth, neither shalbe vnto the worldes end. And yet for all that, all these thinges nothyng at all regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, seing it receaued not the word of god, nor obeyed the same: god did so seuerely punishe that offence for the honour of his worde, that he woulde rather haue that Citie, ones tenderly loued, extirped and plucked vp by the rootes, then he wolde suffer his worde so to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1416:415"/>
to be dishonoured, and the glorie therof defaced. If God delt thus with his best beloued citie:<note place="margin">Let vs repent betymes.</note> is it to bee thought, that he will spare other cities, kyngdomes, and nations, where he hath not dwelt, and where the people therof ar not so nygh vnto hym, as the citisens of this kyngdome were?</p>
               <p>Therfore this example ought to be a monument of Gods anger, that we despise not the woorde of God. Let vs not vse this talke, as we were wont to doo: Peace, peace: There is no ieopardie, All thynges are well. The anger of God will neuer be so great against vs. Tushe, he wil neuer punishe vs, as he dyd the city of Ierusalem, and the inhabitantes thereof. But bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let vs not deceaue our selues. For if he suffered this holy citie, wherin he had so great delight here on the earth, to be so destroyed &amp; vtterly subuerted, that one stone was not lefte vppon an other, because of their wickednes, which heard his worde,<note place="margin">

For as histories report, there were than in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie .iii. hundred thousande strangers besydes the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes therof. For this was Gods determination to make a generall plague in this moste frequent and populous company, that all beyng gathered togither, as into the verye place of punyshement, the Romai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shoulde punyshe theym all alyke. For thus wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that in the whole tyme of the siege and
<pb facs="tcp:1416:416"/>
occupiyng of the Citie, there were slayn ten hundred thousand people, and consumed with death: Agayne, That there were ledde awaye Captyue, seuen and nynty thousande. They were so despysed and counted thynges of naught, that thirty of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wer sold for one peny. And so were they recompenced at Christs hand, whome they bought of Iudas the traitour for thirty pence. And this is that moste noble and excellent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whome God with meruailous great signes and wonders delyuered out of Egypt, and broughte into the lande of Chanaan, yea hee was as a father vnto them, reueled vnto them his word, and handled them most louyngly and gentilly. And yet for all this, when they despised his worde, and would not heare hym: he made hauocke of them.</p>
               <p>And this is the cause, why Christe euen with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping teares, saith: If thou dyddest know those thyngs which belong vnto thy peace: euen in this thy daye, thou woldest take hede. But now are they hyd from thy eyes. Thou goest foorth carelesse, as though there were no danger. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter will not alwais stand in this case.

               <p>But why, wyll somme manne saye, doothe <hi>GOD</hi> deferre the punyshement? Why doothe he not shewe his anger streyght wayes, and falle to plaguynge of them without delaye? Ueryly GOD deferreth hys plagues ta thys ende, euen to declare and shewe hys longanimitie or paciente sufferynge, and to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee wyll amende or not,<note place="margin">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1416:416"/>
Lykewyse sayth Saynct Peter:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note> The Lord is paciente to vs warde, for as muche as he woulde haue no manne loste, but wyll receaue all men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce. For yf God shoulde streighte wayes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe vs for oure synnes,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> we shoulde lyue a verye lyttell whyle. Therefore God deferreth his plagues, and geueth vs tyme and space to repente and amend oure lyues.</p>
               <p>And this is a woorke, wyche greatly setteth forth the goodnesse of GOD, and hyghely commendethe his excedynge great mercy towarde vs. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll beynge an angry spirite doothe not thys: for yf he coulde kyll any man with a fyllyp, he woulde doo it. But God is mercyfulle, and therefore doothe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre hys punyshemente: but yet wyll he not forgeue excepte repentaunce come. But wycked men greately abuse this lenitie, and longe sufferyng of God, and by that meanes becomme carelesse, so that they doo not onely not amende, but they also become dayly worse and worse: as wee haue the adulterers, vsurers, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and suche lyke for an exaumple: whiche, because they are not out of hand punished, lyue without feare, and perswade theym selues, that they shall longe so continewe. But yf that thou bee wyse, bee ware, and eschewe the daunger betymes. For thou heareste here, that GOD vseth to deferre the punyshement, and to conceale and wynke at the faulte for a tyme. But yet the payne is not auferred, beecause that it is deferred: neyther is the punyshemente taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, because there is made a delay thereof. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore returne to the ryght waye betymes, repent and amende.</p>
               <p>This is that, which Christ saith here: But it is now

hydde from thyne eyes. As though he should saye: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the paine is hydde, lette not that deceaue thee. Thou shalt kyll me, as thou haste kylled the Prophets before me. Nowe I dissemble the matter: I suffer and beare all thynges. And thys ys the cause, that thou thynkest it shall alwayes go thus with thee. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no manne earnestly goeth about to repente and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende. But knowe thou this: thou haste not escaped the punishement. If thou couldest onely beleue, thou wouldest then deuise howe to escape this payne. But forasmuche as thou doest not beleeue, thou arte secure and carelesse, and neglectest the tyme of thy visitation wherin thou art moued to repent,<note place="margin">It is a moste greu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is the synne why the wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God shall fall vpon thee, and vtterly destroy thee. Marke howe diligentlye therfore in this place, what syn God recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth the greatest. For here Christ gathereth all syns into one, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, that the sonnes of perdition regarde not the word of God: they let go all sermons and admonitions as thoughe they were deafe: and in the meane season they thynke: that theyr matters wille not falle oute so euyll, so that they goe foorth without all repentaunce to synne. For Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem was a citie full of bloud,<note place="margin">Repente O England and amende,</note> euen as Englande also in tymes paste, yea, and that of late yeares, haue ben ful of bloud, for the manyfold persecution of the word Besydes this sin, there were many other in Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as fornication, adultery, vsery, couetousnes, theft, spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore, oppression of widows &amp; fatherles, glut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tony, dronkennes. &amp;c. Nowe (saieth Christ: My mynde
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1416:417"/>
was to reproue these thynges with the worde, that ye might amende and eschue the wrathe of God. And for this cause I sent before vnto you my prophetes, Iohn the Baptist, and myne apostles. Yea I my self taught among you, wrought miracles, and left nothyng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, that was requisite &amp; necessary for your ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and saluation. All your sinnes shold easily be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Ierusalem shold remayn, if ye wold only know the tyme of youre visitation. I come not vnto you, with swearde or armour, but meke, gentyll, and lyke a Sauiour. I teache and cry: Repent, repent: Amend,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iere.</hi> 9.</note> amend. Heare and be obediente vnto God, before his anger waxe whote, and there be no manne that can quenche it. Thus I visite you, but I profite nothing. ye heape synne vppon synne, yea and that extremely, because ye haue no regarde to the tyme of your visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neyther can ye abyde it. Therefore for as muche as ye refuse all good counsell, all good help shal forsake you. For who wyll be the surgion of that wounded man, whiche would go aboute to destroye the body of that surgion, whiche seketh his health? After this sort are ye Iewes. God procureth, that remission of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shoulde be declared to you by me, and that he wil be a mercifull God vnto you: Agayne, that he pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and forgeueth you al things so clerely, as though ye had neuer offended: onely this is his desyre, that nowe at the last ye should ceasse frome synne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue his word. But ye blaspheme me: ye say, I haue a deuyll: ye condemne my doctrine as heresie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 8.</note> and are fully determined to put me to death, yea, the most vile ignominious and spitefull death of the crosse. This is to muche a beastlynesse, where God dothe determine not onely to forgeue you your synnes, but also to geue
<pb facs="tcp:1416:418"/>
you great abundaunce of bothe heauenly and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefites, to turne your backes, and most churlish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to refuse, yea to blaspheme his grace, and to sette naughte by hys mercye. But forasmuche as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is come to that poynt, there nowe remayneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, that may appease the wrathe of God: the pain plague, and punyshement must nedes procede, suffer it ye muste.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 109.</note> They that refuse peace, muste nedes haue warre. ye woulde not haue the blessynge of God: his curse therfore muste nedes fall vppon you. For where men can not abyde remission of synnes and the fauor of God: there is no more hope of saluation.</p>
               <p>And this is the principall cause, why the anger of god is so fierce and great. For as the Iewes coulde not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde eyther to see, or to heare the worde of GOD: so lykewise God afterwarde vtterly refused theyr crien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, prayers, sacrifices, and all other thynges, neither coulde his anger be pacified, tyll this citie was vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyed &amp; pulckt vp by the rootes, so that neither man, neither beast, nor yet any the lest part of the citie remayned, whereby the place or situation of the citie might be discerned. For the souldiors laboured to the vttermost of their power, that nothing at all myght remayn, neither of the citie, nor yet of the thyngs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertainyng vnto the Citie. And this is that most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and terrible example, whiche the Euangelist set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth foorthe in this Gospell of this present sonday, to admonyshe and warne vs, that wee despise not the worde of God, nor let passe the tyme of our visitation.</p>
               <p>But this is moste of all woorthy to be consydered, that Christ saieth here: But nowe thys thynge is hyd frome thyne eyes. For so for the mooste parte it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that men do neuer remember the plague
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1416:418"/>
and punyshement that is at hande, but because God for his long suffryng sake deferreth the payn, &amp; loketh for amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the world thynketh, that he wyl wink at the matter, and regardethe not theyr synnes. But Christ sayth: Although ye doo not thynke of the pain, because ye see it not: yet knowe ye, that it shall moste certainly come. God hath prepared so many plagues, peines, punyshementes, snares, fetters, manicles, loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, boltes, stockes, cheynes. &amp;c. for the wicked, that ye can by no meanes escape. For first of all, he hathe appoynted parentes, and gouernours of housholdes,<note place="margin">Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and householders.</note> and to them hath he committed the care and charge of vnruly youth and of families. He that will not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned and ruled by this power. he muste be delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the maiestrate to correct and punyshe hym. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these the deuyll remayneth, whiche if thou canste not yet be tamed, hath so muche power thorough the sufferance of God, that he will punyshe thee with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, famyne, drownynge, burnyng. &amp;c. so that no man ought to thynk, that he can preuayl agaynst god, or that he shall escape vnpunyshed. If thou regardest not thyne office, nor wilt not heare &amp; obey the word of God: thou shalt haue the hangman, and the deuill to be thy maisters and gouernors, whiche shall discipline thee to the vttermoste, &amp; bryng thee so low, that thou shalt neuer be able to rise againe, or ones to lift vp thy heade. Therfore receaue ye this doctrine in tyme, that ye maie discerne and iudge betweene the hidde and the open payne. For the peyn of sinne is euer cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and yet it is hydde: and in that it is hydde, it dothe deceaue menne, as Salomon also sayeth.<note place="margin">The plage is certen and yet hydde from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wycked.</note> It is not good nor profitable, that men be not punyshed out of hand, &amp; that god doth so long wink at matters.

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandyng, what dothe this signifie? verily none other thyng then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although the payn be hid, yet at the last it will surely come, yea and that so much the more greuous, because it is differred. Therefore be mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to me, O Lord: Forgeue me my synnes, and geue me grace so to repente and amende, that I offende no more. Here Peter teacheth, that we shoulde vse the pacience and long suffering of God, vnto our confort and saluation. For God desireth not the destruction of menne, neyther deliteth he in the death of synners. It is therfore for our saluation, when God hideth the peyne, and deferreth the punyshment. But when this waie can do no good with synners, but in the daye of wrath, they heape vp more wrathe by goyng forthe to syn: then can not God any longer deferre his plagues but seyng no hope of amendement, he rendreth to the wicked, accordyng to their wickednes, as daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth. When theues will not cease from their stealing, they at the last come to the gallowes, and are hanged. The whoremongers and adulterers also go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng forward in theyr vnclennes at the last are taken, brought to shame, &amp; punyshed. Thus dyd Christ plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare to Hierusalem, that although God did as yet hyde the peyne, and deferre the punyshement, yet that he would at the laste come, and most miserably plage those stiffenecked and disobedient people. Therfore let euery man feare God. Let all thynke this, lyttel, great olde, and yong, that if they synne, and wyll not cease, and repente, that punyshement wyll at the laste come. For to this ende is the exaumple of Hierusalem,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plinius lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</note> that most holy and beautyfull Citie sette forth vnto vs, of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1416:420"/>
the whiche citie, the very Ethnike histories also report that it was the goodliest citie of all the easte partes. But it is now destroyed, &amp; vtterly brought to naught. The cause of the subuersion &amp; vtter ruine therof was, because it made no ende of synnyng, neither would it receaue the woorde of God, but rather hate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute it.</p>
               <p>Suche example dothe Christ set forth to vs in this Gospell, that wee maye repente and amende, or ells that we should knowe, if we wyll not repent, we shall surely bee plagued, althoughe the peyne for a tyme be hyd, and that when the tyme of punyshment cometh, al praiers &amp; supplications vnto God shalbe frustrate &amp; vain: as God himself saith by the mouth of Salomon I haue called, &amp; ye refused it. I haue stretched out my hand, and no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regarded it: but all my counsels haue ye despysed, &amp; set my correction at naughte.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.</note> Therfore shall I also laugh in your destruction, and mock you, when that thyng that ye fear, cometh vpon you: euen when the thing that ye be afrayde of, falleth in sodein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lyke a storme, and youre miserie like a tempest: yea when trouble &amp; heuines co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vpon you. Then shall they call vpon me, but I wil not heare. They shall seke me early, but they shall not fynd me: and that because they hated knowledge, and receaued not the feare of the Lorde, but abhorred my counsayle, and despised all my correction. Therefore shall they eate the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of theyr owne way, and be fylled with their own inuentions. For the turnyng away of the vnwise shal slea them, &amp; the prosperitie of fooles shalbe their owne destruction.</p>
               <p>Euen thus didde God handle the Iewes. The tyme of the siege was not longe, euen frome Easter
<pb facs="tcp:1416:421"/>
vntill September, and all that tyme there was sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficyng, praying, and syngyng to the vttermost, but all in vayne. For God had shutte vp his eares. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is this. For he had hyd and deferred the punysh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they myght heare his word, repent, amend and knowe the tyme of theyr visitation. But all these thyngs dyd no good with that indurate, hard herted, and styffenecked people. Therfore where he publyshed the punyshement, he hyd hym selfe, that he coulde bee founde in no place, as Oseas the Prophete thretnethe also the kyngdome of Israell:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Osee.</hi> 5.</note> They shall come with their shepe and bullockes to seeke the Lorde, but they shall not fynde hyme for he is gone from theim. This example therfore ought not to be neglected or to be set at naught, but for asmuche as God hath suche places in store, and wyll at this tyme bryng them to lyghte, let vs feare hym. And forasmuch as he doth not take vengeance of our synnes out of hande, but geueth vs daies of respite, that we may repent and amende: let vs loue hym as a moste mercyfull Father, and saye: O Lord, I knowe that thou wylt not suffer synne to escape vnpunished: notwithstandyng, O Lord, endue me with thy grace and holy Spirite, that I maye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende and escape the punyshement and peyne of thy moste fierce anger. He that thus repenteth, easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth mercy and forgeuenes. And without doubt Hierusalem had continued vnto thys daye, if the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes woulde haue knowen the tyme of theyr visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and mekely haue sayd vnto God: O Lorde, we haue offended, we haue done wickedly, our synnes are moste heynous: for we haue slayn thy seruauntes, the Prophetes. Notwithstandyng, thou hast now geuen vs thy Gospell to be our helpe and confort, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1416:421"/>
we most humbly thanke thee. O be thou mercyful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and geue vs grace to repent, and to amend that is amysse, that we may become newe creatures, and serue thee in holynesse and ryghteousnes all the dayes of our lyfe. If the Iewes had done this, the Romans although neuer so stronge and myghtie, hadde neuer bene able to doo any thynge agaynste them, yea they had neuer moued warre agaynste them. But seynge they remained and continued in theyr synne obstinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any repentance, and saide: Tushe, there is no ieopardie. What? should God cast away this citie, wher his dwellyng place is? wherin also alone his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; worshyp is maintened, It will neuer come to passe. Because of this vain bosting and vnrepentance God so plagued that their citie, that ther was not one stone left vpon an other, so that it is now vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed and brought to naught, and made an example for all them that obstinatly synne, and wyl not ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that the lyke peynes and plagues shall also chaunce to them: but to other, that receaue the word of God, and repent, it is a comfort and doctrine, that they may lern when God hydeth the payne, it is for their peace, and that God will forgeue them their synnes, if they only cease nowe from their wickednesse, and returne vnto God. For it is no meruayle though we synne.<note place="margin">Synne.</note> But to defende oure synnes, and obstinatly to perseuere and continue in them: Thys by no meanes can GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde: hee wyll rather make hauocke of all togyther, namely, when he commeth on his gracious visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and woulde gladdely call vs vnto repentance.</p>
               <p>Thys Citie therefore was vnhappie,<note place="margin">Securitie des<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>troyeth the citie.</note> neyther dyd any thynge destroye that, but the glorious and noble title, in that it was called the citie of <hi>GOD,</hi> the house
<pb facs="tcp:1416:422"/>
and dwellyng place of God. Thys made the Iewes carelesse, so that they thought on this maner: Shold this citie come to naught? It will neuer com to passe God can not cast it away. Therefore, though all the kyngdomes of the worlde came against it, they shold neuer preuayle. God wyll not suffer his citie &amp; dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place to be destroyed. This title made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so bold, that for the redresse of their synfull lyfe, they regarded not the visitation by the worde. And by this meanes was God compelled, that forasmuche as they refused to be visited vnto peace, they shoulde be visited vnto deathe and destruction. We Englishe men also are at this present daie of speciall grace and mere mercie visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God by his worde: but we in euery condition shewe our selues vnworthy of this syngular goodnes of God. Some impugne the manifest truth of gods worde bothe by wordes and writynges.<note place="margin">Remember this O Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ware betyms</note> Some abuse Gods worde vnto the maintenance of their couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, pride, vnclennesse, excesse, and other moste gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous synnes. It is therfore to be feared, that excepte we spedily repent, some great plague wyl sodeinly fall vpon vs,, whether it be by pestilence or by hunger, by ciuile warre, or by the inuasion of foreyne enemies.</p>
               <p>Therfore let vs not forget this example, that Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem was so miserably destroyed, because it receaued not the word of God, but despised it, that we mai lern gladly to hear the word of God: and though we sinne yet that we should repent and amend And this is the first part of the Gospell. After this, the Euangeliste maketh mention, that Christ wente into the Temple, and did cast out all byers and sellers, and sayde: My house is the house of praier:<note place="margin">The seconde parte of the gospellr</note> but ye haue made it a den of theues. This dyd Christ with a meruailous great
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1416:422"/>
power. and it is to be reckned with his other miracles which we are not able to folow. For except it had ben so, without doubte so many myghtie marchantes or occupiers had easily ben able to withstand Christ, that they shold not geue place vnto him alone, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any weapon, only with a whip, as the Euangelist saith, toke this weightie matter in hande.</p>
               <p>In that they gaue place, and made no resistence, it sheweth euidently, that Christ spake such wordes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iewes, as he dyd to the Iewes in the gardein when they fell backward vnto the ground. But thys act of Christ we Christians shall not folow. Therfore let no man vse the storie to this ende, as thoughe the Eclesiasticall ministers, had any corporall or temporall iurisdiction, as Christ exerciseth here such power. For if Christ had not farre excelled the power of man, hee alone agaynste so many coulde not haue done muche. But we may not haue so great respect vnto the work, as vnto the cause. This expresseth Christ in these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, when he saieth: My house is the house of prayer, but ye haue made it a denne of theues. what cause had Christe, that he should speake suche a fierce and harde sentence to the Iewes? For without doubte they dyd not robbe nor steale in the temple. But this was the matter. The money changers had here their money, &amp; dyd exercise bying and sellyng of shepe, oxen, doues. &amp;c. for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifices. For euery Iewe could not bring with hym from home, that he woulde sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The priests deuised things for their owne aua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papistes did in time of blindnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais be at hande, plentie of cattall, and peraduenture money also for to offer. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple also had her money as histories shew. This semeth a thing more worthi of
<pb facs="tcp:1416:423"/>
praise then of dispraise. For seyng that God appointed and commaunded this seruice. who durst be bolde to condemne this,<note place="margin">The priestes sought not the glorye of god but theyr owne gaynes</note> forasmuche as all these thynges made to auance and sette forth this seruice and worshipping of God, that it myght be moste glorious and goodly? But there was an other matter. The priestes in dede made this pretence, that they dyd all thynges to sette foorth the seruice of God: but they wold not so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue regarded that, if they had not had so great pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fite by it. Therfore what so euer they dyd, they dyd it not for Gods cause, but for theyr owne lucre and gain This couetousnes moued them, that in all theyr doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, they commended nothyng but sacrifices, as our monkes and Priestes commende theyr sacrifice of the Masse,<note place="margin">Masse</note> that by it synnes are put away, and the grace of God obteyned. This made the people to swarme in goyng to Masse, as though they had ben flockes of shepe. But in the mean season while they sought their owne priuate commoditie, and in their doctrine extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Missall sacrifice, they vtterly omitted, and left vntaught the true seruice and acceptable worshipping of God, whiche is to feare God, to beleue in God, and to kepe his worde: and by this meanes they encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged men to go foorth in theyr wicked lyfe, with great securitie, and without any remorse of conscience. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so played the Iewishe priestes. They taughte the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that if they dyd kyll and sacrifice muche, al things shoulde goe well with theym, as we maye gather of the Prophetes, whyche was the cause, that they spake so muche agaynst sacrifices. And this is a very great synne in deede, when suche a robbery is committed, that not the bodies, but the soules are slayne for euer:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1416:423"/>
which is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men are taught to put their confidence and trust in their owne workes, &amp; not in the grace and mercie of god. Thus could Christ by no meanes abide, neither ought we to suffer it, but by the word of god to resiste it vnto the vttermost of our power. For without this, there is no waie vnto saluation. Men must be brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne workes and merites vnto the sacrifice and merite of Christ, &amp; vnto the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of god, &amp; afterwarde they must be exhorted vnto a godly lyfe, that they folowe not their owne imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the worde of god, and frame them selues in all pointes according vnto that. He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth this, vseth the temple &amp; the ministerie aright: he that doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, abuseth them, &amp; is a theif &amp; murderer of soules, as Oseas the Prophet also calleth the priestes in the kyngdom of Israel. As theaues armed, saith he,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Osee.</hi> 6.</note> waite for him that passeth by the waye: such is the councell of the priestes, which with one agreed cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, murder cruelly such as kepe the waye: yea they dare do all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable mischeife. By these his wordes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet describeth the great slaughter, that they made amonge the people with their false doctrine. For wheras their duetie was to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend &amp; set forth to the people the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the sacrifices of beastes.<note place="margin">The false doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine of the Iewishe priestes.</note> For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was for their adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage: that made their kitchin to smoke. For they had alwayes a portion of those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. But by this meanes men were not only pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and pylled of their money, but they were also in daunger of their soules saluation. Christ by no meanes could abide this, and therfore he made hauocke in the Temple. He did cast out such as bought &amp; sold in the temple. He threwe downe &amp; topled ouer the tables of the money chaungers &amp;c. He wold rather do any thing
<pb facs="tcp:1416:424"/>
then suffer, that suche thefte &amp; murder should be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, yea and that vnder the pretence of gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. But as Christ did this at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time by miracle, so is the same exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple exercised diligently by the iudgement of god against Schismatikes. The vngodly Bishops, priests, &amp; monkes, whiche for couetousnes of worldly things defende the wicked sacrifice of the Masse &amp; the other ydolatrie, shall shortly feele this zele and whote indignation of god, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shalbe worthely cast out of the temple &amp; be had in contempt of all men. And this muche haue we spoken of our gospel. God the father of mercies for Christes sake mought vouchesafe to raise vp his holye spirite in our heartes vnto his feare, faith, and loue, and mercifully kepe vs in his worde, and defend vs against all euil both bodely and ghostly to the glory of his blessed name.

In such case holines is made double wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckednes. So doth this hipocrite here w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god.

But I am good, holy, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, righteous, &amp; a very myrroure of goodnes, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vertue, &amp; righteousnes. I fast, I pray, I geue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mose, I do whatsoeuer thy law requireth. O Lorde,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1416:426"/>
how greatlye arte thou indebted vnto me: And what greate rewarde is there layde vp for me in heauen? Consider these thinges, O God, remember that I am not lyke other men.</p>
               <p>O intollerable pride. If this proude hipocrite with suche pride should doe all that euer the lawe of God requireth to be don euen to the vtter moste, yea thoughe he shoulde geue hymselfe to be burnt for the glorie of God, yet could not all this please God, but shoulde be before hym the moste greuous synne and playne abhomination. For God abhorreth all pride, as sainct Peter saith:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</note> Be lowlye and humble in your heartes. For god resisteth the proude, and geueth grace to the humble. Lykewise saith Sainct Iames humble your selues in the sight of the Lorde,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iac.</hi> 4.</note> and he shall lyfte you vp. As our Sauiour <hi>CHRIST</hi> sayth: Euerye one that exalteth hymselfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 18.</note> shall be brought lowe. And who soeuer humbleth hymselfe, shalbe exalted.</p>
               <p>Therfore saith Christ here: If ye will be counted righteous, embrace the true righteousnes, euen that, whiche is agreable to the word of god, and aboue all thinges take hede of pride. Let no pride be ioyned with your righteousnes or holynes. For although the Sainctes and holye men diuerse wayes offende, so that many tymes they fall moste greuously (as we rede of Noe, Lot, Dauid, Peter, Magdalen, &amp;c. Yet God doth not so heauely take that, as he doth, when they lyue moste holyly, and are proud of it, bragge and boaste of it, yea and both contemne and condemne other in comparison of them selues.<note place="margin">What the christen humi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie is.</note> Christe therfore concludeth the gospell on this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: He that exalteth hymselfe, shal be made lowe: and
<pb facs="tcp:1416:427"/>
he that humbleth himselfe, shall be made highe: that euery man maye learne humilitie, and despise no man. For this is the Christian humilitie, for a man to esteme other more then hymselfe, as the Apostle sayth: Let no man stand hye in his owne conceate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</note> more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh him to esteme of himselfe, but so iudge of hym selfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he be modest and sober. Again: In geuing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour go one before an other: Item. Be not high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but make your selues equal to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lower sort. Be not wise in your owne opinions. For he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth himselfe, &amp; lifteth vp his brystles because of his learning, beauty, richesse, holines, righteousnes, &amp;c. Is like to this Phariseye. He beholdeth his fastings, and considereth the true paying of his tenthes, and by this meanes he standeth greatly in his owne conceat. This doth Christ forbydde.<note place="margin">The publican an example of true humilitie</note> In the poore Publican we see no suche thing. All thinges are humble and lowly. He bosteth of nothyng. Only he lamenteth and bewayleth his former wycked lyfe, and with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of hearte besecheth GOD to be mercifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, &amp; to forgeue him his synnes. Learne ye this also, sayth christ, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye may say. I can glory of nothing. For although I would glory of knowledge, richesse, power,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</note> wisedom, righteousnes holynes, &amp;c. Yet god may answer and saye: what hast thou, that thou hast not receaued? If therfore these be my gyftes, why doest thou bragge and boaste of them? Why doest thou reioyce in those things? The right of reioycing is mine, whiche geue thee these gyftes: and not thyne, which only receauest them. It were thy dutie rather to know, that all these gyftes may be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee in a moment, if thou be proude, bragge, and boste of them. So mightest thou well reioyce and triumphe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1416:427"/>
against the deuill, and saye: why should I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that I haue the worde of god, and that I haue bene alwayes redy and at hande to helpe the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched synners, and suche as were in daunger of despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by confortyng, teachyng, and monishing them? Why shoulde I also deny, that of my goods I haue geuen large and liberal almes to the poore and to such as were in necessitie? These thinges, O deuill, thou canst not reprehend or disalow. Thus may a Christen man iustly and without any offence against God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and triumphe against the deuill, for they are not his gyftes, whiche we vse. But against god, of whome we haue all thinges, and from whome euery good gyfte and euery perfecte gyfte cometh down, may we by no meanes reioyce, but towarde hym vse all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and lowlines both of hearte and bodye, meke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with all reuerence confessinge, that they be the gyftes of god, and that therfore we ought not to boste of them, nor to seke oure owne prayse and glory in the exercise of them. But alwayes to magnifye the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of so lyberall a geuer. Moreouer our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour also is not to be despised, but we ought rather to thincke on this maner: for asmuche as all these gyftes that I haue, are properly gods, and all thynges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede and come from him, although I haue moe giftes then my neyghbour hath, yet god with one worde is able sodenly to make such a change, and so to inuerte all things, that my neighbour for one vertue shalbe more commended of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 12.</note> then I for all that euer I haue, as we reade in the gospell of the poore wydowe which did caste into the treasury onelye two mytes, where as the riche men did put in greate sommes of money: and therfore was she praised of Christe this
<pb facs="tcp:1416:428"/>
on this maner: Of a trueth I saye vnto you, that this poore wydowe hath put in more then they all.</p>
               <p>Why shoulde I then glorye and reioyce? Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ought rather to feare for these so many giftes, where with GOD endowed me, lest I shoulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse them vnto the dishonour of god, the hinderaunce of my neyghbour, and the damnation of my soule. We ought alwayes thus to thincke, that God geueth gyftes to his creatures according to his good pleasure to one he geueth much, to an other lytle. And it is possible, that he whiche hath but lytle, may haue God more mercifull vnto hym, then he that hath muche. The reason is this: He that hath muche, shall render an accompte of muche. He that hath but lytle, his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte shalbe the slenderer. But this madde and dotyng proud Phariseye doth the contrary. He is not ashamed to saye: I am not as other menne: no, nor yet lyke this Publicane. I geue tythes: he only polleth &amp; pylleth. I deceaue noman: he spoileth as many as he can. To be short: The opinion of the Phariseye is of himselfe, that he passeth al men, and that he is faultie in nothing. Contrariwise, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Publicane of al naughts is the worste. And that there is not one good qualitie in him. But this hipocrite should rather haue said on this maner: I pay my tithes faithfully &amp; truly: I fast, &amp; do what I can. But for al that I dare not trust to any of these my workes. For whatsoeuer I haue, it is thy gifte, O Lord: &amp; it is possible, that this Publicane doth please thee, more then I. So would he haue set the Publican before him, or at the least iuste by him, &amp; would haue saide. The matter standeth not in this point, whether a man hath receaued much or litle, but to whome god is most merciful. Why then shold I be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1416:428"/>
proud, or despise other, seing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al things consiste in the mercy of god, &amp; not in this, what gyftes euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath receaued? But this doth not the arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; proud pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseye, but he glorieth and reioiceth of his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes when he standeth and praieth before God. The wil of Christe therfore is, that we should not be proude of our righteousnes, as no man also ought to despaire, though he be circumuented and deceaued of the deuill, and so fall into synne. For we all haue one God, which stretcheth forth, as a garment, his mercie vpon vs, euen vpon the righteous and synners,<note place="margin">All our glory ought to be in god alone.</note> vpon the learned and vnlearned, vpon the riche &amp; the poore, For he is the god of all. Therfore all our glorie ought to be taken awaye from all thinges that we do, and onely to be reposed in the mercie of God, that by this meanes we al maye humble our selues before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of God, and not haue respect to this, whether we haue receaued muche or lytle. For god maye be more mercifull to hym that hath but lytle, then to hym that hath much. In the worlde it is necessarie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be differences of persones, of offices, and of gyftes. But there is no suche difference of vs before god. For seing that he accepteth vs only of fauour, there can no man glorie, boste and auaunce hymselfe before God. We all without exception muste nedes humble our selues, that we maye know, that although ther be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference among vs in this worlde, yet before God we are all one, neither is one better then an other. He will none otherwise loke vpon him that hath muche, then vpon hym that hath lytle, that by this meanes we all maye learne to embrace his grace and mercye. For all are gods, righteous, synners, riche, poore, stronge, weake &amp;c. And whatsoeuer they haue:
<pb facs="tcp:1416:429"/>
all come of God. They haue nothing of themselues but synne. Sinne can be to no man cause of pride, but rather of humilitie and feare. Whatsoeuer goodnes remaineth, that is altogether of gods gyfte, so that he hath a cause to glory of his giftes, and not thou. Thy parte and dutie is only, to vse the gyftes of god reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently &amp; with thanckes geuing. For god by no meanes can abide pride and boasting.</p>
               <p>Again, this also is his will when thou felest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenes of thy sinne, that thou doste not therfore des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre, but rather truste to his mercie and saye: If I haue not muche, yet haue I god, yea and hym a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull god. Therfore I wil take this in good parte: I will looke to my vocation and calling, euen with as muche diligence, labour and power, as god hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. I wil despyse no man. I wil not be proude of any thynge that I haue. And suche as haue more then I. I will neuer enuie them, nor disdaine them. For this is ynoughe for me, that we all haue one comon God, and that god therfore wil not be vnequall, because we in this worlde are vnequall.</p>
               <p>Unto this hath Christ respecte, when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth this parable and sayth: He that exalteth hymselfe shal be made lowe: But he that humbleth himselfe, shalbe exalted. As though he should saye: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue gotten suche sainctes or holy persons, that referre all thinges to me, howe muche more they humble and abase them selfes, so muche the more will I geue them. But they that haue, and therfore are proude and puffed vp, I wil take it from them by lytle and lytle, tyll at the last in my anger I cast them downe hedlonge into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastyng damnation. If the Phariseye had not ben proude, but had humbly rehearsed his gyftes vnto
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1416:429"/>
God, and sayd: O Lord, thou hast geuen me muche, in that thou haste geuen me strength to resiste this and that synne. This is thy gyfte: I am glad therof, but yet am I not proude therfore. For thou maist take it again awaye from me, when thy good pleasure shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be: If the Phariseye, I say, had done this, god wolde haue increased his gyftes dayly more &amp; more towarde him. But for asmuche as the gyftes that he hath, he abuseth them vnto his owne pride and glorie, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iudgeth and condemneth other that haue not the lyke gyftes, he is so reiected of god, that there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing in him worthie of prayse and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this is the iudgement of Christ. The Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane went home more righteous then the Phariseye: that is to saye: The Phariseye is vnrighteous, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and geuen ouer alredy to the deuill and hell fyre, what profite hath he now by his bosting &amp; gloryinge? But the Publicane, which sayth: O God be mercifull to me a sinner, is made a Saincte in the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and accordyng to his desire, he hath god merciful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym.</p>
               <p>Christ wil haue this to be the doctrine of vs al, that we may know what we are, and what we haue. If thou be endued with riches,<note place="margin">Howe gods gyftes are to be vsed.</note> with strength and health of bodye, with house, lande &amp; worldly goodes, or with any other gyfte appertayning vnto the body or to the soule, vse it with thanckes to the geuer. Enuy no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and god shall encrease his giftes in thee. Only auoide pride, and despise no man, though his gyftes be not so excellent as thin be. But remember and thinck, when thou seest any man not to haue that thou haste, that he notwithstanding maye haue god as mercifull to him, as thou hast. Therfore despise him not neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
<pb facs="tcp:1416:430"/>
thou to haue him nighe vnto thee: &amp; so shall god be glorified in you both. Moreouer hipocrites disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure God greatly, although they do it not with the mouth &amp; openly. For he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would iudge only according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of the phariseye, he must nedes say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that was not euil spoken, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the phariseye saith here: I tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ck thee, O god. Such wordes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> true sainctes vse in their prayers, but with an other sence, or meaning. For when they geue thanckes to god for any thyng: they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse by this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue receaued that gyfte &amp; bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of god. But the Phariseye thincketh not so, or els he wold haue said thus. That I am not an adulterer, an extorcioner, an vnrighteous persone, &amp;c. I can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it to none other, O lord but to thee alone. As co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerninge my selfe, if thy grace did not assist me, my lyfe should be no better then other mennes. For we be all lyke neyther can one iustly reioyce againste an other. But this Phariseye is not of this minde, &amp; cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he saith: I thancke thee, that I am not, as other men are. And so he chalengeth to himselfe the wholle power, as though he were the author of his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; not god. For if he had not so thought, he wolde haue added these wordes? But this is thy gyfte, o lord, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not of my selfe. But this saith he not, but by his wordes he declareth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that he of himselfe is so copious and abundant in good workes, that he is able also to geue vnto God. Therfore he geueth thanckes not to god in dede, although he nameth him but to hymselfe, to his owne reason, freewill and strengthes, that he hath done so much.</p>
               <p>This is true: whosoeuer hath any thynge geuen him of god? He must acknowledge it, &amp; geue god thanckes for it. For what an absurdititie were this, if thou
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1416:430"/>
shouldest denie thy selfe to be wyser or better learned then an asse or any other brute beast? In lyke maner he that hath goodes &amp; riches geuen him of god, ought not so to playe the dolte, that he shold saye: he is a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and hath nothinge, where as he ought euen with most heartie thanckes to confesse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyftes &amp; benefites of god, &amp; with the same to helpe such as be in necessitie. Again, he that hath done his dutie wel, and serued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently in his office &amp; calling hath holpen his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour both with his substance &amp; councell, geuen almes to the poore, &amp;c. ought not to saye: I haue done no good. This lewde and folishe humilitie is not to be vsed. For the giftes of god are to be acknowledged, celebrated and magnified: &amp; yet true humilitie is to be shewed, &amp; we must say: These thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs are thine, O lord, &amp; not mine. Thou gauest them me: or els I shold haue had no more then other haue. Therfore for these thy giftes I render vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most humble &amp; heartie tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckes. This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true waye of humilitie. The good giftes of god are not to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted as things of nothing, or to be extenuated or abased as matters of smal reputation, but they are to be acknowledged &amp; to be set forth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vttermost: yet may not we be proud of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor despise other, but as I haue oftentimes said, we must speake on this maner &amp; say: O lord, they are thy giftes. Thou gauest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me. That an other hath not the same, it hurteth or hindereth him nothing at all. For he hath thee as merciful god vnto him, as I haue: oh, why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold I despise him? Such humilitie doth christ require in this gospel, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aboue al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs we shold eschew pride (disdainfulnes, arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, &amp; hautinesse of mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de For this is ones decreed: He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> exalteth himselfe, shalbe brought lowe, god did not forgeue his owne peculier people,

but suffred them to be destroyed for their prides sake, Many other greate kyngdomes also haue fallen and come to ruine for the same faulte. Lucifer because of his pride was caste downe from the highe heauens vnto the depe dongeon of hell fyre. Adam and Eue for the same vice were cast out of Paradise. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consider diligently, that it is thy parte thus to saye: O Lorde, whatsoeuer I haue, it is thine. Thou mayst take it again from me at whatsoeuer tyme it pleaseth thee. By this meanes shalte thou eschewe pride, cease to despise other, and leane to a sure ancker. For who will truste vnto that, whiche is vncertein? He that despiseth this order, and lyke a madde man goeth forth to bragge and boste himselfe as though whatsoeuer he hath, were his owne, and came not from GOD: he heareth here his iudgement, which is, that God will take from him all such gyftes as he hath and geue him his portion in that lake that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with fyre and brimstone, from the whiche the Lorde defend vs all. GOD for his mercies sake geue vs grace to acknowledge his gyftes.

He tormenteth not only their bodies, but also their soules, that beyng vtterly dismayed, they may thynk that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to be loked for, and so fall into desperation, and so in fyne, vnto damnation.

For seyng that the deuyl pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sumed to go into Paradyse, to destroy the workes of God there, and to make of righteous and holy perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (I speake of Adam and Eue) disobediente and wicked people: It semed good agayne to God, for to be reuenged of this his enemie.<note place="margin">

Christ came to doo this woorke, and he dothe it styll continually among his Christians, as we shall heraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heare. And thus muche of the miracle &amp; worke of Christ, wherby he hath declared here hymselfe, that he is the healper of all suche as are in myserie, and that he wyll heale all euyls and afflictions, whiche the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll heapeth vpon vs, yea and vtterly putte hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie frome vs.</p>
               <p>Moreouer Christ by this would also shew vnto vs that these two thynges most specially appertayn vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Christian,<note place="margin">Christen men must haue theyr eares o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and theyr tonges losened.</note> that is to saye, that the eares bee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the tongue be losened, and that he exercyseth this worke diligentlye in his congregation or church agaynst the deuyll. For as concernynge the corporall benefite, as the eares and the tongue with the vse of them. he geueth that also to the Heathen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:1416:433"/>But the spirituall benefite is onely amonge the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, when he openeth their eies, and loseneth their tongue. For this is certaine and sure,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Iacob.</hi> 1.</note> that all salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commeth to vs onely by the worde of God.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore this also,<note place="margin">Gladly to heare the worde of god is the gyfte of god.</note> euen in these our dayes is an excedynge great miracle, and a moste hygh benefite, when God geueth to any man such an eare, as gladly heareth his worde, and suche a tongue, as dothe not blaspheme, but blesse and glorifie God.</p>
               <p>Our aduersaries the Papistes are muche more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, and in aworse case then this dumbe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was,<note place="margin">The papistes are both deaff and dumme.</note> For their eares are stopped. And although they heare the worde of God, yet can they not heare it. I meane vnto their profite and edifying. But they heare it, as the Iewes did, when Christ most excellently preached of the forgeuenes of sinnes, and of euerlastynge lyfe: they vnderstode nothyng: they delyted not in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Christ, but contrarywyse they were vtterlye madde, and blasphemed Christ and his doctrine. Suche are all they, that wyll not heare the worde of God. They are deafe and dumbe, and in a farre worse case, then this miserable man was, of whom our gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell maketh mencion. For they can doo nothynge ells with their tongue, then blasphem, and most spitefully rayle vpon the worde of God, that most excellent and precious iewelle. But they that gladdely heare the word of God, and vnto whome Christ saythe, as he sayd to this dumbe man <hi>Ephata,</hi> that is to saye,<note place="margin">God openeth our eares by hys worde.</note> Be opened, and haue the benefit of hearyng: are those, to whom healpe is geuen in dede against the deuyll. For God hath opened vnto vs none other way vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:434"/>
then his word and his holy Gospell. He that glad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly heareth that, diligentely kepeth that, and hath hys chiefe delyght in that, is safe and without all danger. This is one miracle, whiche is euen at this daye in the churche among men, that our eares, whiche the deuyll thorowe synne hadde stopped, are made open by the word, that we may heare the worde of GOD, which is the doctrine of our saluation.</p>
               <p>An other is, that he toucheth the tongue, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to speake,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> as Paule saythe: With the hearte it is beleued vnto righteousnesse, and with the mouthe confession is made vnto saluation. For when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Christ, we obteyn therby remission of our sins. But after this,<note place="margin">We muste bothe beleue and confesse the worde.</note> it is necessary also to confesse and to open by speache that, which is felt and beleued in the heart. And this maketh a christenman. All other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes can not doo it. It is possible, that a Monke may faste, watche, and wearye his bodye more thenne a Christian: but by that hee is not made a Christian manne. For in thys one thynge he fayleth, that he is yet deafe and dumbe: He wyll not heare the worde, and muche lesse confesse it. But a christen manne hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and beleeueth, and afterwarde confessethe. These two thynges make a christian manne. Thus <hi>CHRIST,</hi> exercysethe hys woorke dayely in the Congregation spiritually and by the woorde, which he wroughte thenne corporally, that hee myghte te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifye, howe hee geueth healpe agaynste the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall myschiefe of the deuyll, but specyally agaynste the spyrituall wyckednesse of Sathan the deuyll, that wee myghte stedfastely beleue, and put oure whole truste in hym.</p>
               <p>Nowe muste we consyder thys also, what Christe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1416:434"/>
meaneth by thys ceremonie,<note place="margin">Why Christ vsed so many circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in restoryng thys man to hys healthe.</note> that he vseth about thys deafe and dumbe persone. The people broughte thys wretched man vnto Christe, and desyred hym to lay his handes vppon hym. Christ taketh hym asyde from the people, putteth his fyngers in his eares: he spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and touchethe hys tongue: hee looketh vp to heauen, he mourneth and sayeth: <hi>Ephata.</hi> All thys muste sygnifye some speciall matter, seyng that Christ vseth suche circumstances in doyng this miracle, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng all other that he wrought.</p>
               <p>Nowe therfore, for as muche as we haue declared what it is to be dumbe and deafe: lette vs consyder also, what meruaylous Ceremonye thys is, and why <hi>CHRIST,</hi> woulde specially vse it in thys miracle where as neuerthelesse, hee myghte haue doone it wyth one woorde. For thys is moste eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and playne, that when so euer Christ spake the worde, streyght wayes the woorde tooke effect.</p>
               <p>Ueryly Christe by this soo exquisite a ceremonye hathe respecte to a spirituall miracle. For by thys he wyll shewe, what an harde matter it is, to restore the deaffe to theyr hearynge, and vnto the dumbe their speache. Hee rayseth vppe Lazarus with one woorde.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 11. <hi>Math.</hi> 9.</note> To the manne that was sycke of the palsey hee sayde: Ryse and walke: and he immediatly was made whole. But wyth thys manne, whyche was deafe and dumbe, it pleased hym not to vse suche speede: But hee doothe vse a syngular kynde of proceedynge and order in woorkynge of thys my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. He puttethe hys fyngers into the deafe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes eares. Hee towcheth his tongue wyth spetle. Hee looketh vppe into heauen. He mournethe, and
<pb facs="tcp:1416:435"/>
then at the last he saieth <hi>Ephata</hi>: that is, Be thou ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: that by this he might signifie vnto vs, that yf we will escape the bondes of the deuyll, and haue a redy tong to speake, &amp; open eares to heare, it must be done by the external &amp; outward worde, and by the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the same: agayn, by the outwarde signes or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, that he hath appoynted to bee vsed in hys churche. For the worde is fyrst to be hearde, and then Baptisme and the Lordes supper must be ioyned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:<note place="margin">Note thys well.</note> vnto the whyche thinges the holy ghost commeth, and deliuereth the eares and tongue frome their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, that they may lerne to auoyd all sectaries, which despise the outward word and sacramentes, and loke tyll God talketh with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inwardly. But Christ saith: Thys is my fynger, euen the outward worde. Thys oughte to sounde in mens eares. This is my spettle, wherewith their tongue muste be touched, and made moyste. Then shall my woorke very well and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously procede, as ye may see. For where the outward word is sincerly taught, there are christians: but wher it is not taught, there are none.</p>
               <p>Therefore, lette euery man prouide, that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe these steppes. Let hym gladly heare the worde of God. For God wil not shyne, nor geue the glorious lyght of his Gospell into thy hearte, except thou firste heare his woorde. If thou bee desirous to see and to knowe hym, it must be done onely by the worde and sacramentes. For without this, the holy Ghoste wille not procede to his workynge, as God hymselfe, euen from the very heauens protested vnto vs, whenne hee sayde: This is my derely beloued sonne, in whom I greatly delyte:<note place="margin">

               <p>For what is hee amonge vs all, that woulde not take a long iorney to go vnto suche a churche, wher he might heare God preache? For all men would be glad to heare and to know that voyce. But Christe saieth: I wyll brynge that to passe nerer home, so that thou shalte not nede to trauayle so farre. Heare thy Pastor and thy parentes: and so haste thou hearde me. For these are my disciples, when thou hearest them, I wil sound in thy heart <hi>Ephata,</hi> Be thou opened, as I did to this deafe person, that thy eares maye be opened, &amp; thy tonge set at libertie, and that thou from hensforthe may be no more deafe in thy heryng, nor dombe in thy speaking, as thou wer afore.

And as in families, so lykewyse in common welthes, men are very negligent and slow to obey the officers. What soeuer they ordeyne in a realme or citie,<note place="margin">Disobediente subiectes.</note> ye shall fynde very fewe amonge so greate multitudes, that wyll trewely and syncerely execute the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the magistrates.

And it is apparant also, howe fewe there are, whiche with true zeale and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent desire heare the sermons: whyche is euidentely knowen not onely by their fruictes, but also by thys moste specially, that the men of townes and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yea and of cities also, do moste vnworthyly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle theyr ministers and pastors, not onely by railyng vnreuerently of them,<note place="margin">The vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent handling of the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ministers in these our dayes.</note> but also by takyng awaye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly from them suche tythes and dueties, as by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyke order are apoynted vnto them. Therfore, a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy payne foloweth, euen this, that when the worde of God pronounced by parents, ministers of the churche, and by magistrates is neglected &amp; nothinge set by, the deuill by litle and litle shold stop their eares more and more, and tye theyr tongues streyghter then it was afore, and so set them in suche case, that they can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde either to heare or to speake the worde of God.</p>
               <p>But on the other parte, it maketh their eares wide

For the worlde can abyde and heare all other doctrines, lyes, and heresies: but as for the Gospell, it wyll neyther see it, nor heare it: yea, the worlde blasphemeth it, and persecuteth it moste cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vexeth them with all kynde of tormentes that professe it, as there hath bene great store of examples before certaine yeares (the more pitie) in this realme of Englande, and yet is in dyuers places of the worlde.</p>
               <p>Thys seeth Christe, and therefore hee comfortethe his disciples, and sayth: The world blasphemeth the Gospell, but hee that is so wyse as to heare it, hathe blessed and happy eares, and is most indebtedly boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to geue god thanks therfore, that he is made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker thereof, and so he may worthily magnifye that, whyche the worlde dothe so contemptuously handle, and so spitefully entreate.

               <p>For our state is so miserable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and specially when we are without the Gospell,<note place="margin">They are most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whiche haue not the knowlege of the gospell.</note> that by lytle and litell errors crepe in, yea errour vpon errour is heaped, so that ther is almost no ende of errours and heresies, in so muche that very hardly many tymes we canne defende oure selues agaynst them, as alas (for sorowe) we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hereof to muche in the tyme of the Papacie. For at the last the matter came to this poynt, that the deuyll was taken for a preacher, and credite was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto hym, whatsoeuer he fayned by his busy wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked spirites and moste vayne and lyeng preachers, as touchyng Masse, pylgremages, purgatory, pardons, and suche lyke trumperie. And euen so is at in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where soeuer the worde is not.

But on the contrarye parte, if the Gospell be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, so great madnesse reigneth in the world, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fewe receaue it. Therfore I maye well and truely saye, that the state of vs men is moste myserable and harde. If God denyeth vs his worde, we can not be without the destruction of oure soules. If he geue it vs, all the world refuseth it: so that it were beste for men, that God woulde haste his commynge vnto the iudgement, and shortly make an ende of this wicked, wretched, synnefull worlde.

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:1416:439"/>And this is the fyrste thynge wherof Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth here: which is, that he offereth and geueth to the worlde his worde, and with that remission of synnes: and yet is the worde despised and set naught by. Therfore he turneth hymselfe to his Disciples, and sayth: ye are blessed, whiche haue the worde of God, and heare it, and that ye dyed not before it was reueled &amp; brought to light. I say vnto you, that moste mightie and puissant Kyngs, and most worthie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes also would gladly haue liued in this time, and haue both sene and heard these thinges. And yet (such is the wickednes of the worlde) whereas it may haue now plentie and abundaunce of so noble thynges: it regardeth them not. Let not this wickednes of the worlde trouble you, but so behaue your selues, that ye be not voyde of so greate grace, but that ye maye take fruite therof. Christ in this place (as it manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth) intendeth to commende and set foorth his worde, to make men desirous of it, and not to contemne and despise it, as the maner of the worlde is, and as we see in all degrees both highe and lowe. They that can not persecute the Gospell, despise it. The lessest parte of the worlde receaueth it with thanckes geuinge, and so amende their liues. But they that thus do, are onely blessed and happy. For they haue blessed eares and eyes, whiche is the great and merciful gyfte of God. And this is the firste part of oure Gospell.</p>
               <p>In the other parte <hi>CHRIST</hi> putteth foorth the fruite of the Gospell (that is) good workes, whiche ought to ensue when Gods worde is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. This doth he describe wyth a playne example,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:440"/>
of a certaine man whiche as he descended from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. Chaunced vpon robbers, of the whiche af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he was beaten and robbed he was lefte halfe dead. And it chaunced that a Prieste wente that waye, whiche seynge hym, passed by and was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge moued to helpe hym. Lykewyse the Leuite that came after the Prieste, had no regarde vnto hym. At laste came the Samaritan, whiche had no holye name, but was a gentile, neyther was he any kyn at al to that wretched man that was a Iewe. For he came not of the same stocke as the Prieste and Leuite dyd, but was a stranger. He seeth this miser and is greued with his misfortune, he goeth downe of his beaste, he poureth oyle and wyne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his wondes, he byndeth them vp, and putteth hym on his beaste: He walketh on fote hymselfe, and carrieth the wonded man into an Inne. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he could not tarrie longe ther for his busines, he committeth hym to his hoste, and geueth monye to ouersee hym vntill he retourneth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What maner of men the gospell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kethe.</note>This is the second picture, in the which Christ pein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the frutes of the worde and Christian charitie, (that is) that the worde doth make suche men, as this Samaritan is, that is, gentle, mercifull, whiche despise not other men in their calamitie, but when they see them, bestow their goodes on them, &amp; helpe them with all that they can. I speake here of the poore and nedie, which are not lewde, as the most part of beggars be, that of purpose seketh gaynes after this sorte, and will not take monie to serue, eyther to helpe the sycke, or to do anie other thyng, that they can do: to such must nothing be geuen.

Wherfore I do not wel, if I forsake hym. He embraceth hym as his brother &amp; leaste he shoulde perishe without helpe, he taketh com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>passion of him, as a father.

               <p>But other stonie hearted saintes hath no naturall pitie toward the wretched, but are men of excedynge great chorlishenes. For this they thincke, that God is therwith delighted if he serue them, and therfore they thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are not bounde to helpe other, as this prieste doth.

Wherunto then is it lyke that they truste and maintaine their pride? Truely to no other thynge then their owne holines, wheras they thynke, when they haue sayde Masse, done sacrifice, songe, and suche lyke, that they haue done ynoughe, and that they nede not to do an ynche more then theyr pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripte. Suche are stonie sainctes, yea rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelishe Sainctes, whiche seme to counte GOD for their dettour, and that they owe nothynge to any man.</p>
               <p>Againste this monsterous kynde of sainctes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this parable. For <hi>CHRIST</hi> in this place is moued by the example of a proud hypocrite, which steppeth foorth, to declare howe greate his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
<pb facs="tcp:1416:441"/>
is, and thyncketh this surelye with himselfe, that if <hi>CHRIST</hi> knewe of his righteousnes, he woulde not speake a worde of suche matters in his presence. Which thinge he meaneth, when he saith: Maister what shall I do, to obtayne euerlastynge life? Christe will not aunswere hym, and he sayth, Aske thy selfe, what is written in the lawe? Howe dost thou read? The lawyer hath foorth with to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, and sayth: thou shalte loue GOD wyth all thy hearte, &amp;c. And thy neyghbour as thy selfe. For he counteth, both these thinges an easie matter to do. Christe sayth, do this and thou shalte lyue. By this is the lawyer confounded. For he is not so bold as to saye, he had done it. Wherfore he commeth foorth with an other question &amp; sayth: Who is my neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? As though he should saye: I knowe no man, to whome I owe any succoure: But rather I know very many, whiche ought to do me seruice, because I am an holy man.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer.</note>But here doth <hi>CHRIST</hi> rise against hym with all vehemence, in this parable of the wounded man &amp; sayth.

As though he should say: Thou art holy after the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the priest &amp; Leuite, thou hast no pitie on thy neyghbour althoughe he be in perill of lyfe, and yet thou askest, what thou mayst do to get euerlasting lyfe.

and miserable men thy neyghbours? Is not there mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie and wretchednes ynough in the worlde? And yet dost thou beyng so great a doctour doubt, who is thy neyghbour? away with this trifeling. Yf thou wilt be counted holy, do as this Samaritan dyd. He setteth foorth this boster well in his colours. For the plaine meaning of this is nothing els, then that this lawyer is not yet come to this degree of holines, that this Samaritan had attained vnto.</p>
               <p>Wherefore all the matter hangeth on this,<note place="margin">What it is to loue god.</note> that we learne what it is for a man to loue god, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himselfe. Loue GOD: is no hard sayinge. For he hath no nede of our seruice. And yet, if his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son were present, it woulde then euidently appeare ynough, who loued him, and who woulde put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and al his in danger for his sake. But he sheweth vs not his person to see and to vse our seruice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, as other men do, that are conuersant with vs. Wherfore if thou wilt know who loueth god, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how children honor their parents, howe seruants obey their masters, howe the ministers of the churche are handled, then shal ye vnderstand, who loueth god, and who doth not. For children haue this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; worde from god: Honor thy father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But they say, I let passe my father and mother, and will honour and loue thee,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</note> which art God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Do not God saye, thou hast my commandement set forth, wherfore if thou loue me, thou must loue &amp; honour thy parentes also, and obey them in all things. And this is the true louing of god. But what do they? Children would haue their parents awaye,<note place="margin">To loue god is to kepe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes</note> that they might lyue masterlesse. Wherefore this must nedes be true that they loue not God. So is it also in other
<pb facs="tcp:1416:442"/>
kyndes of life. Princes hath in their offices officers, they charge them to do their deutie diligently. If thou aske whether they loue God, all will say: yea, and that they haue no cause to hate God. Well I graunt that. But answer: why shewest thou no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and fidelitie to thy kynge? If thou louest god with all thy hearte, thou wouldest be more faithfull vnto thy Kyng, and wouldest do thy office with more diligence. So is there no seruaunt in any house so farre paste shame, that will suffer this to be sayed by hym, that he hateth God, and loue hym not. But what doth the louing of god signifie? doth it not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, to kepe Gods commandement and worde? As Christ also saith: If any man loue me he shal kepe my worde. For if thou louest God, thou canst not despise his commandements. But what commandement ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth god to serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts? Or what doth seruantes promise their maisters? doth not GOD require that? And they do promise also meat and drynke with wages,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.</note> and for that cause maketh a couenant, that they shold be faythfull in doynge suche seruice, as belonge to the house, and shew obedience in their seruice. And for this cause also are they called seruants, because they serue the housholde by their seruice, and helpe them that haue families with their labour and seruice. But where be any suche in housholdes? Yea rather there is almost no greater disobedience, negligence, pride, then amongest suche. Ye and here I let passe the pickynge and stealynge of many of them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they loue not GOD, they hate GOD and care not for his worde, or els they woulde shewe more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in their seruice. But at last they shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for theyr vngodlines, and lyue all the tyme
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1416:442"/>
of their lyfe with the curse of GOD in miserie and beggerie.</p>
               <p>But as touchynge the pastours and ministers of the Churche, it is no nede in this place to make longe rehersall. The matter is plaine, howe they are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of rulers, husbandmen and of their neyghbours, craftes men and courtyers, so that almost they that kepe hogges are more set by. But the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD is straight, that they shoulde be counted worthie of loue &amp; honor, and that nothynge should be denied them, that is dewe vnto them. As it appeareth in Malachie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Malach.</hi> 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>Luc.</hi>

                     </gap>0.</note> and Christe hymselfe sayth also: euery workeman is worthie of his wages. Wherfore as thou maiste not denie thy seruant his wages because he is euil: So must not thou defraud thy pastour and curate because he is euill. If Gods commandement moue thee not, be thou sure of this punishement, that thy corne, beastes and other things shall proue ill, and thou shalte louse more therby, than euer thou tokest from thy pastor and minister. Whereby it is euident, that the worlde not onely loueth not GOD, but that it is full of hatered towarde GOD. And the condition semeth almost tollerable, not to loue GOD, if it would not hate hym. But all deny this crime. But in dede this is very hatynge of God, when thou art stubburne against thy parents, Lordes, &amp; Officers, and when thou doste not that, that God commaunde thee. For this is his commaundement, that thou shouldest obey, and by obedience honour them, this commandement doste thou hate. For thou canst not find in thy hearte to do it, and thou doste refuse to hear hit. Who will
<pb facs="tcp:1416:443"/>
say than, but that thou hateste god? This do al men crake that they loue god, but wher as they heare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be gods commandement, that they should flee couetousnes, exercise vpright bargeining, &amp; auoid auarice, the more that these thinges are beaten into them by comon sermons, so muche the more stuburne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they go againste it. What nede that prieste care (say they) what I do with my goodes? Will he take vpon him to rule me? If this belongeth not vnto the prieste, it belongeth to god. He wil surely reuenge it, when he shall see his time, by pestilence, famine, and other mischeifes of fyre and water, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This shall take from thee, neither shall they knowlege any benefite therin: Wheras thou if thou were a Christian, mightest get fauour before God and man, and fele and perceaue all thy goodes to encrease. Wherfore it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe, that the Pope, the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes, and tyraunts, but also townes men, rustikes, noble men and yomen, do not only not heare, but also moue persecution againste gods worde. For they ought to geue honour vnto gods worde, to obey it, to fynde the ministers of the churche that, that is dew vnto them. But they are more redie to catch that from them that they haue, then to geue them more, and then they stande in their owne conceites, as though they did well.</p>
               <p>Wherfore this lesson ought to be borne wel awaye: He that hath the worde, ought also to loue god, (that is) he ought to know, what workes god requireth of hym, and obey hym and say: Lord Iesu Christ, thou hast opened mine eyes to see and know, howe thou hast deliuered men from death and syn by thy death, and hast made me heier of the kyngdome of heauen,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1416:443"/>
&amp; of euerlasting lyfe. I geue thee thanckes for so great, a grace, &amp; will gladly do again all that thou requirest of me. Thou commandest me by thy precepte, that I shall honour my father and mother, and I will do it gladly and with all my heart. Thou gauest me charge that I shold serue my master faythfully and with all my heart. I will do my worke diligently, and with all obedience.

And it is not possible but god must nedes rewarde such Christian men.<note place="margin">To loue god is to loue thy neyghbour.</note> But here let euery man, trye inwardly with hymselfe, how greatly he loueth god. For to loue god consisteth not only in the thoughtes, as the Monkes beleue, but to loue god is as Christe sayth in an other place to loue thy neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For so sayth god: If thou wilt loue me: do this for my sake to thy father and mother, children &amp; wife, husband and Lord: This do I require of thee. And consider diligently whether thou dost so, then shalte thou fynde out, whether thou louest god or hate him. For they are only Christian men, that hath the worde of God, and loue Christ. These do say: I will gladlye and with all my heart do for my neyghbour, that, that thou hast commanded me. But if I shall be now and then preuented with anger, impacience, and such like, then can he not please me, but I will amende. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians do this,<note place="margin">The vnkinde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of the worlde.</note> but they that are not Christians do it not. Wherfore this must nedes be true, that Citizens, husbande men, children, seruantes, officers, subiects,

Wherfore the worlde generally doth shew obedience only to the deuil, which is cheifly delighted with the hatred of God, &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is not done that god hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, this enemie maketh vs subiect to sin &amp; to death.

The Samaritan loueth god, not in that he geueth him any thinge, but because he helpeth the miserable wonded man, for his power. For this saith God. If thou wilt loue me and serue me, do that for thy neyghbour, that hath nede, I haue no nede. Wherfore this Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, is redie to serue God whiche is in heauen with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1416:444"/>
his monie, beast, wine and oyle. Not because God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it for his owne person, or because he doth this for GOD, but he doth it for his neyghbour. But therfore is it taken as done to GOD, because God, commanded it. He commanded not this, to go a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to Rome, or to sainct Iames, or to buylde monasteries, or any suche lyke thynge. But this is his will that we should helpe one an other. It is no nede (saith he) to seeke me at Rome, thou shalte finde me at home, with thy wyfe, children, familie, Lord,<note place="margin">God is euery where and in all places a lyke present.</note> maiestrate, and also in thy neyghbours house, in the stretes, in the market place, and euery wher. And howe can he make hymselfe more nighe vnto thee? But the deuill casteth a darke myste ouer the worlde, that it can not see, what it is to loue God and to hate the deuill. Wherfore we muste learne this with all diligence.</p>
               <p>This Samaritan, loke what care woulde haue done and what beneuolence he would haue shewed to his owne bodye being in lyke perill, the very same he doth to his neyghbour, &amp; hath dew co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, for that he loueth GOD and his neyghbour. This must be learned, to the entent, that thou do it also. For this fruite muste nedes folowe them, that haue the worde. If it do not folowe, they are no Christian men in dede: As this priste and Leuite, whiche are sainctes, without any felynge or affection. For he that passeth by his neyghbour, passeth by GOD. Wherfore beware of the example of the worlde which hateth, both GOD and his neyghbour. But do you for all men. All that ye can. And GOD wil sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompence it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And this is the second doctrine out of this gospell. but Christ by this parable woulde signifie also, what benefit he hath bestowed on vs men, &amp; how we may tast the true frute therof. For we miserable men haue fallen vpon moste cruell robbers by sin, wherby death and the deuill, hath power vpon vs. which hath not only spoyled and rifled vs of all spiritual giftes, which God gaue vs, but hath also beaten and wonded vs: that is to saye, by synne are we cast hedlonge into all kynd of miseries.<note place="margin">

                  </note> In this might we perishe, for any helpe that we can haue of the prieste and Leuite. For they passe by &amp; geue no helpe to that miser. For by the lawe is no man iustified and made righteous, neither deliuered from sinne. But at last co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan euen Christ Iesus our Lord, whome his owne people would not receaue, but counted hym for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan. He is moued with our mischance, he washeth our wondes with wyne, and poureth in the helthfull oyle of his grace, he taketh to cure oure sinnes, and beareth them in his bodye, and bringeth vs into the true Inne, that is, into the holy church, and ther char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the host to take cure of vs. They are the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and teachers of the worde. But manie of them, as it appeareth in the Pope, the Byshoppes and suche like, regarde the charge but litle, that the churche may be an hostrie and Inne, the steward wherof is lewde without faythfulnes &amp; humanitie, and the sicke men are but coursly handled.

               <p>And these are the thynges that make trewe chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, fyrst, that they haue a sure confidence and faith, in Goddes mercy: then if thanke be not rendred vnto them for theyr benefites that other receaued at theyr handes, that they suffer not theyr pacience to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

And yet we see that all the world is oppressed therwith. For all theyr myndes are day and nyght vppon theyr lyuyng. And Auarice dothe specially stirre men to thys, that no man shoulde be content with that lyuelode, that he hath geuen frome god. All men couete more, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth a higher degree.

               <p>Christ wold remedy this wickednes with this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and he setteth forth the matter very hardlye and straightly. No man (saith he) can serue two maisters.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:451"/>
For eyther shall he hate the one, and loue the other, or cleaue vnto one, and despise the other. And hereby it appereth, that the whole care of the Lorde is, that his true seruice and worshyp be not hyndred. And it is a kynde of temptation that causeth Christ to geue thys precept, so that this Gospell is not for youthe. For it hath not yet that care for lyuyng and houshold stuffe, they neuer aske how the market goeth. For thys they thynke for a suretie, that they shall lacke no lyuynge. This sermon appertaineth specially to housholders,<note place="margin">This sermon appertayneth to househol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and to preachers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> &amp; to them that are procurers. Furthermore it belongeth to the preachers of the worde, which haue scant of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng in the worlde, and are constreigned by pouertie and nede to seke some meanes to fynde them, &amp; their familie. This men dothe Christ here comfort most spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially, and studieth to ryd them of their care, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth them to beholde the birdes of the ayre, that syth God prouideth for theym so plentyfully, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers shall not lacke theyr portion, so that they shall not dye for hunger. Wherfore this sermon belongeth to vs, which perceaue our lyfe to bee in perill for lacke of lyuynge, whiche are compelled to prouyde lyuynge bothe for our selfe and also for other, least that whyle we go about the office of preachyng, we fall to vnlau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full and vnhonest shyftes.</p>
               <p>But forasmuche as Christe sayth precisely, that no man can serue God,<note place="margin">What it is to serue,</note> and Mammon, it is necessarye for vs to learne, what it is to serue God. For to serue is nothyng els after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maner of speache, then to doo that thou arte commaunded, and it is as much to saye, I serue a maister: I do that that my maister commaunde me, so that the seruice maye seeme to be referred not so muche to the person, as to the worde &amp;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1416:451"/>
commaundement. For the maisters haue no nede in their housholdes to be fedde wyth meate and drynke of theyr seruants. For they them selues haue store and plentie inough therof: but this haue they nede of, that their seruantes dooe execute theyr woorde and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. But when the seruant seeth to another matter, and regardeth not his maisters commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but careth for that that an other command, this is veryly the seruyng of two maisters.</p>
               <p>After this maner also, we must learne what it is to serue God, that seruynge of God is no other thynge, then to heare what he sayeth, and to do it gladly, and with all our heart. But what dothe God commande vs? before all thynges he byddeth vs to heare Christe, and hyghly to esteeme his Gospell.<note place="margin">What it is to serue god.</note> This is the onely trewe and acceptable seruice whiche we maye doo to God. For here haue we his most assured commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then dothe he commaunde chyldren to honor their father and mother, and the father and mother to nourishe, bring vp, and instruct their children, and the wyfe to loue her husband, to se to her familie: the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to prouide for sustenance and defence. &amp;c. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the chyldren honoure their parentes, they serue God thereby. For it is Goddes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they should do so. Lykewise is it with the seruantes in a housholde, when they doo that that is commaunded theym diligentlye, they dooe this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice not onely to their maister, but also to God. For it is his worde that commaunded this. So is it also, as concernyng other kyndes.<note place="margin">All gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary in the worde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> All should be Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, yf we woulde onely discerne the cause why they shoulde bee so. For as I sayde before, to serue GOD consisteth not in the worke, but in the worde and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement
<pb facs="tcp:1416:452"/>
of God. This is counted a great thyng before the worlde, that a monke doothe renounce all thyngs, and entreth into an abbey, lyueth a hard lyfe, fasteth, watcheth, saieth his prayers. &amp;c. here lackethe no worke, but here lacketh a commandement, for that that God neuer commaunded it by his worde. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this can neuer be counted seruyng of God.</p>
               <p>Contrarily, this semeth a lyttle thynge, whenne a handmayde doothe her woorke that belongeth to the householde by washyng, swepynge. &amp;c. But because there is a commandement of God as touchyng this, be the workes neuer so small,<note place="margin">What the true seruice of god is.</note> yet they haue the name of Gods seruice, and passeth farre all that is holy and deuout, with the monkes and Nunnes. For the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes haue no commaundement of God. But it is com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded, that parentes shold be honored, and that the housholde businesse should be done. So that generally this is the true seruice of God, to do that that GOD commanded, and to eschue that that God forbyddeth. And all foule corners maye bee full of Gods seruice, and not onely churches and temples, but also houses, kytchins, shoppes, cotages. &amp;c. And it may be done of citizens, of men that go to plowe and tylle the field, if we woulde but esteme the matter vprightly. For it is certaine, that God commaunded not onely the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall and ciuile administration, but also the guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of housholdes, and that his will is, that it shold be preserued. Wherfore all that dothe helpe therto, first the parentes, then the chyldren, and laste of all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes and neighbours, all doo serue God. For it is his will and commaundement. If this reason were well pondred, it woulde certifie all men, as well high as lowe, as touching their busynes, that they myght
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1416:452"/>
know, that although that, that they must doo in the house, be very small, yet they serue not men but God. What busines therfore can be peynful vnto them at al when they vnderstande, that all theyr worke is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God? But the deuyll hyndreth mens Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they can haue no suche ioye in doyng theyr worke and vocation, and hee causeth that euery man may haue a singular peyne in doynge their office and executyng Gods commandement, that bothe may be spoyled and defrauded of their commoditie, that is, men of the redy and glad will, and God of his seruice. If it myght be purchased by any money, that a man myght be receiued into that order or colledge, wher as he myght be sure of this, that Gods seruice should be done, men would gladly bestowe all that they haue, that they myght come to this poynt.</p>
               <p>It is a meruailous thynge. What these monkes should meane, when they wold serue God in their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les? But as I sayd before, that thyng was wantyng in them, that was the chief in this matter. For if thou demaunde of them who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded them to go to the cloister, they can not say this, that God commaunded them, but this must they nedes say, that they thought that they myght so please God. But they are worthye of euyll for theyr rashenesse. It is euen as much as if I should commaunde my seruant to fet meate, and he in the meane season make readye a horse. He shoulde not muche please me in doynge thys, and speciallye yf that he woulde defende his dooynge, and boaste thereof, as thoughe that hee hadde doone a harde piece of worke in brydelyng, sadlyng, and currying the horse. Lykewyse is the matter with Mounkes,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:453"/>
they crake of their seruice, and yet God gaue them no commaundement so to doo.</p>
               <p>Whefore if thou purpose to serue God truely, applye thy vocation be it neuer so lowe, and first hearken to Gods worde in the churche, then to the worde of thy maiestrate, maisters, and parents, and this is the true seruyng of God. This must we learne therfore, and beare it well away, what is gods seruice, euen to doo that that God commaundeth by preachers, parentes, and maisters. If thou doest this, thy heart may be at rest before God: neither shall thy worke and labor that thou doest be painfull. And this pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aseth God, and is Gods trewe seruice. And that that thou doest in thy house, is as muche as euen thou hadst done it to god, whych is in heauen. And furthermore this is the chief renoume, wherewith man is adorned aboue all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whiche dothe obey God also. For the sonne, the moone, the earth and all thinges behaue theim selues after Gods commaundement. So lykewyse the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath a commaundemente to bryng foorth fyshes,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> so saieth God in the fyrst boke of Moses. And the wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter dothe euen so among all men, where as men hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not Gods blessyng by theyr synnes. So all creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res are most beautified, when they serue God thorow obedience. And Christ saith so here, that Salomon in all his glorie, was not so apparailed, as one of these li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the fielde. But what dothe the lylie? what com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement hath it?, no other but that it may bryng foorth a shewe and beautyfull fauour, savour, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. If then God doth so much praise this in a floure what a great renoume is this thynkest thou, for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be founde in the commaundement and obedience of God? The maydens are decked to daunce, it is but a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1416:453"/>
toy and a trifle. For this is her chief renoume, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she applieth her worke and vocation, seeth diligentlye to her maysters chyldren, and to suche other seruice. For so doeth the Psalme. 45. extoll Christians, and saieth: In thy honoure commeth the daughters of kynges.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.</note> What honour is this, when it is euident, that christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are poore, nedie, and despised? It is a spirituall honour and renoume, it is not gold, perles, purple, tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, but the commaundement of our God. This ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour shyneth more brighter then the Sonne, for it is Gods honour.</p>
               <p>He then, that walketh in Gods commaundement, walketh in the very honour of God. If I should goe in the Emperours apparell, or a mayde in the apparell of a great Quene, this wold be counted a meruailous noble thynge before the worlde, but in deede all these thinges are but toyes to mocke an ape, and nothynge in comparison of the spirituall ornature, whenne a mayde goeth gaye in the obedience of God and her maister. In respect of suche ornature, all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gorgeous thinges are but nifles and trifles. For that is the trewe ornature and comelynesse, whiche is called Gods worde, Gods commaundemente, Gods obedience. This is the Crowne and verye ouche,<note place="margin">

In thys lyfe thys ornature seemeth a thyng of no greate valuation, but in the lyfe to come, it shall bee moste excellente, whenne God shall saye: Come my sonne, thou haste doone thy duetie in thy vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <hi>GOD</hi> and hys woorde, yea althoughe it be in small matters, geueth more renoume than that that may be most magnificent. And this is sufficient for the firste part, that we may know surely what is gods seruice, and that the bonde seruice of Mammon may not hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs in greater seruice that wee are bounde to doo. Nowe lette vs see a conforte and consolation as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng this,<note place="margin">Nowe coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes maye be auoyded.</note> howe we may cast auarice and couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes from vs. Firste (saieth Christe) that no man can serue two maisters, and he geueth them bothe theyr names. One is God, that is the true lord and master, whome we are wholly bounde to serue and honoure. The other is Mammon, this is not the true maister, where Christe forbyddeth vs to doo hym any seruice, that is to say, to be carefull for the lyfe, howe it maye get his lyuyng, and for the body, howe it may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parailed. And he applieth all his sermon to this end, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we shold caste away suche care, and that because it is not only vnprofitable, wherof we haue no nede, and wherby we nothyng preuayle, but for that it hynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth gods true homage &amp; seruice. Wherfore we muste beware of it, and see diligently that wee serue God, and persuade our selues certaynly, that he doth nowe knowe what we haue nede of, and that he wyll fynd it vs gladly, if we do but onely require it at his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. And it healpeth muche to the attainynge of thys faith, to call to mynde those thinges which God hathe now geuen vs without our helpe. For he made vs, &amp; not we our selues, he gaue vs body and lyfe. Now let the world iudge this,<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:1416:454"/>Is not this then a great madnes and foly, worthy of Goddes wrothe? we can not but confesse, that we haue receaued all these thynges that are chiefe of all from God, and yet doubt we whether he wil geue vs these base and vile thynges? This might well be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a contumelie or reproche, if one that hathe felte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ryche mans liberalitie in a great thinge, would not truste for the same in a littell thing.

But we can not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne frome thys cursed and execrable care. The byrdes haue no landes, no barnes, no storehowse or spence: yet they doo synge, they doo prayse GOD: They reioyce, and bee ioyefull.

His name is, heauenly Father. Why thenne doo not we lykewyse, whyche neuerthelesse are better in this poynte, that wee can woorke, gather in the harueste, laye it vppe in barnes and reekes, and preserue it for other necessarie vses? yet can we not abstaine frome care. Wherefore we oughte neuer to forgette the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aumples of these byrdes. They are merye and chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full without care.

This ought to be a iuste cause to driue vs to fayth, not onely because this care hindereth our faith, but also it causeth a great tormentinge, and yet do we preuayle nothyng therby. But are not these manifest signes of auarice, of cares and of vnbeleife? For these are alway Ioined to gether? Or if we woulde vse but only reason, it behoued vs to hate these vices, and to auoyde them.</p>
               <p>He addeth more besyde this, that this confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be perfect againste couetousnes. He byddeth vs also to consyder the thinges, whiche come before oure eyes, as we walke in the countrie. Ther are flowers of all kyndes, whiche shewe them selues vnto vs with moste beautifull and swete coulours, and doth almoste speake vnto vs and adhort vs to trust in God. For syth that they are decked with such magnificence, that the apparell of mightie kynges can not be compared with flours, muche more doth God take care in appareling and deckyng his owne.

Christ in this place doth pronounce wyth very plaine speache, GOD (sayth he) doth appareill the grasse in the felde. Byrdes fyndeth not their lyuynge be chance. But the father of heauen fedeth them, and geueth to euery one his portion.</p>
               <p>This is it also as concernynge the lylies. For if

gods wisedome were not in the cause, they could not be so like to gether in colour, leaues, number of leaues, rootes and forme &amp;c. Wherfore sith he bestoweth so great care vpon flowers, that are but for pleasure, and that beastes might lyue therbie, is it not an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible incredulitie and mistruste, that we doe yet doubte, whether we also shall haue appareill from God? For as we haue a preferment before all birdes, when we tyll the grounde, mowe, and gather into our barnes, and prouide for certayne tymes, wher as birdes can do no suche thinge, and yet they are fedde: So saith Christe also to vs, that we haue the preeminence also in apparelynge, There is so muche flare, hempe, and suche like herbes brought foorth by tillyng, there is also a greate multitude of shepe, so manie weauers and spinners &amp;c. euery wher, what great madnes is it then, not to thinke, that part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of belongeth vnto vs? And especially whan we spare no labour. For in this place muste we put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. For labour is not onely not forbed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so enioyned,<note place="margin">Not laboure, but careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydden.</note> that we shoulde do all thynges moste studiously and diligentlye, and vtterly flee all slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and slouggyshnes aboue all thynge. But the care of lyuynge and appareill is vtterly forbed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. For suche care is a sure token, that we haue not so muche truste in GOD, as that he will fede vs and prouide other thinges for vs. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that care appertayneth to Gods dishonour and blasphemie. That these two thinges may so be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to gether. First that thou do thy worke diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and spare no labour.<note place="margin">Laboure and fayth must go together.</note> For that dyd God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande man in Paradice, that if he wold eat, he shold labour. The second is, that thou be a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; beleue.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:457"/>
For to beleue is to put thy trust in Christ, that he is our parent, and knoweth what we haue nede of, and that he wil geue vs these thynges liberallie and plenteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Care can not agree with this fayth: but assone as care taketh place, faith departeth.</p>
               <p>Wherfore Christe forbyddeth and sayth: be ye not therfore carefull, labour: for of this ye haue a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. Let care alone for me. For that is mine, that I may be your father. And I can also somwhat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: but so can not ye, Wherfore attempte not a thynge in vaine. Or if ye are not content to be reuled with this my councell, knowe ye, that ye are not my worshippers, but the worshippers of Mammon. Him do ye loue, and me do ye hate, to hym do ye cleaue and me ye do despise, as is the example of the worlde. And if ther were any occasion at this time of aduantage: thou shouldest finde manye, that woulde rather let passe this sermon, than not to regard the aduantage, or at leaste wise to differ the tune therof vntill after sermon. Mammon moueth them so muche, that they fele that the time of it, will neuer returne againe, but the tyme of the sermons not so. Nowe the matter is plaine, that whatsoeuer is done to the worde of god, is done to GOD.<note place="margin">He that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the word of god despy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth god hym selfe.</note> He that despiseth it an prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth monie, the despisynge and contempte therof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to GOD. There is no place for glosis: the worde and speache is to euident: ther can be no other thynge gathered. Wherfore this sermon is belongynge to Christians, that they be not pensiue, nor saye: what shall we eate or drinke, or what clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge shall we weare?

For this should be a signe that ye haue no truste in the heauenly father, or els ye would caste awaye all care, and would be of good hope.</p>
               <p>Wherfore Christ concludeth his sermon and saieth: seeke first the kyngdome of God and the righteousnes therof and al other things shal be cast vnto you.

Looke wher suche fayth is ther is GOD present, and forthwith foloweth righteousnes, and remission of sinnes. Let this (saith Christ) be firste with you.

Ye heare here of a miserable widow, whiche first lost her husbande, and then her sonne which was her only solace in al her trouble. For it was counted the cheif myserie in this people, to haue no sonne to be heyre of the familie. For the trade of this commonaltie was suche, that al was appointed to the heyre. Wherfore this widow was miserable in all pointes, &amp; in great aduersitie, in so muche that this semed sure tokens, that God was displeased with her and againste her, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he tooke awaye first her husband &amp; then her son. And it was no marueill, if she had caste away all her

hope and trust in God. Christe hath respecte to this woman, and hath pitie vpon her, and restoreth her ded chylde to lyfe, and turneth her greate sorow into great ioye.</p>
               <p>This hystorie is therfore to be marked of vs,<note place="margin">A comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst deathe by Christe.</note> that we may confirme our faith. For Christ doth the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes not only of this woman, but he studieth to certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all vs of this what a weake thinge death is, that we should not feare it at all, but that we should do all thinges with a pacient mynde on suche wise that we maye not be put in feare, by death or by anye other things: For that, that we haue such a prince to ayde vs, which hath present and redie helpe againste all euill and death: yea, and in this example he declareth, how soone he can put awaye death. For who would haue thought, that this dead yonge man, that was carried foorth to be buried, coulde haue reliued again? But Christ coming vpon them, when the matter was past cure, speaketh but this: yonge man, I say to thee arise.<note place="margin">Christ is the lorde of death.</note> And the dead rose and began to speake. Wherby ye may vnderstande that death before Christe is euen as lyfe. And all is one with him whether we liue or be dead. For although we be dead, yet are we not dead to our destruction. The reason why is this: with one worde he can cal lyfe again, and put away death, So that hereby we may well vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de Christes saying to be true, euen that god is the god of the lyuynge and of the dead. For although Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, and other holy Patriarkes be dead to vs, yet they be alyue to god.</p>
               <p>This muste we learne out of this Gospell in this widowes son, how great, god will declare his power to be in the last day through Christ, when he with one
<pb facs="tcp:1416:460"/>
worde will call men to life againe, and geue to them that beleue, euerlasting lyfe. This shall be done in a moment, so that we nede not doubt but that both these thinges are in Christ, (that is) power, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth here, and also wil, to do it gladly. For this is an euident proufe and example therof. The widowes son is deade, he is voyde of sence and felynge, but as soone as Christ speaketh with him, he heareth. Is not this a wonderful thynge? He that heareth not, nowe heareth, he that liueth not, nowe liueth, and yet is ther nothynge els done but that Christ speaketh a worde, and byddeth him, Arise. This only worde is of suche force and might, that it putteth awaye death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storeth lyfe.</p>
               <p>But for asmuche as we knowe, that Christ can so soon rydde vs from death, and restore vs to lyfe, let vs se also how redie he is and willing to do it. For there is none amongest them all, that desire this of him, only is he moued with the miserie of the widow, and goeth vnto her without askynge, and restoreth her son vnto her alyue again. Wherfore let vs thinke that this example belongeth vnto vs: that we should not feare death.<note place="margin">We must not feare death.</note> For this was done for our sake. As though he shold say.

                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:461"/>This hope haue Christians, but the Turkes &amp; the Iewes haue it not, neyther the Papistes.

They haue no truste in Christ: But they seeke helpe of their diri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Masses, trentalles, pardons, fastes, &amp; such other thinges. And they take Christe for no other but for a Iudge whiche hath onely the office to iudge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne. This is the greatest wickednes that is, that they Imagin that Christe is crueller then death. Wherfore when they heare of the day of Iudgement, they are afraid, they tremble &amp; quake in their heartes. So do not Christian men. They know that Christe in that day shall iudge them that beleue not, whiche will not receaue the worde, or beleue it.</p>
               <p>And therfore they boldly say: I am baptised and do beleue in Iesu Christe my Lord, that he dyed for my synnes, and that by his resurrection he hath gotten me righteousnes and euerlasting lyfe. Why shold I feare therfore? he is not mine enemie, but my frend and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone with the father. Wherfore although the laste day draweth nigh, or death chanceth vnto me by anye other meanes, al this shall not put me beside my state. My Lord Iesus Christ holdeth himselfe stil for a time, at the iniuries, that death doth vnto me. But when death thinketh that I am wholly opprest, then am I only holden with slepe, and that with such lyght slepe, that Christe can scarselye speake a worde, but I heare and rise vnto euerlastyng life.</p>
               <p>Let this seme a necessarie lesson for vs, that we may feare, neither at death, nor at the laste daye: For Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not to iudge and condemne vs. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as he came in this place to the widow, and to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1416:461"/>
her dead sonne, to rayse vs from death, that we may heare, see, speake again and do other thynges. After this sorte will he come to all vs that beleue and saue vs. But they that beleue not, them will he iudge. Wherfore we must accustome our selues to looke for this our Sauiour, &amp; to beleue in hym, that by a litle &amp; a litle we may be more and more certified of this oure hope and saluation, &amp; that we may feare neither death, neither the laste day. But he that feareth, foloweth the fleshe and the olde man: and not Christe &amp; his worde. For the matter is playne, that Christ shall come, and rayse vs from death. Where Christians bodies reaste in their sepulchres, &amp; slepe vntil Christ come &amp; knocke at the sepulchre, and saith, Arise, arise. Then shall we rise as out of a most quiet and swete slepe, &amp; we shall lyue and reioyce with Christ our Lord for euer. And thus ought Christians to haue other thoughtes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Turkes or Iewes haue, whiche are vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with feare. Yea and the Papistes, &amp; mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes all are dismayd in their heartes. And this chaunceth vnto them worthily. For why come they not to learne this lesson, and beleue that <hi>CHRIST</hi> is the helper of them that beleue, &amp; the iudge of them that beleue not? If thou art a Christian, and hast hope in Christ, he will not take away his helpe, succour and saluation from thee, when deliuerance, &amp; defence shal be requisite for thee against death and the deuill. But if thou trustest for helpe any where els, and despisest his helpe, as the Pope both teacheth, &amp; doth so in dede, looke for no other of Christ, but a very Iudge, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou art the seruant of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil, &amp; the minister of death, and takest that on thee, that is the worke of the deuill and of hell. They hate Christ, and care not for
<pb facs="tcp:1416:462"/>
his kyngdome. Wherfore he can be no other to them then a iudge. But for the good, that put their truste in him, he wil procure them peace and saluation for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>After this lesson &amp; doctrine, which is called the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, must we learne also of Christ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of pitie,<note place="margin">Pytie or com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>passion.</note> merci &amp; compassion. And this ye heare often times in the yeare as touchyng charitie, that we shold remember, that one of vs is bound to helpe an other. But pitie is a thing somwhat greater, as when we are greued with other mens miseries and calamities, no lesse then with our owne: as when I haue a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that is nedie or sycke, I ought not only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to helpe,<note place="margin">Charitie issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethe out of faythe.</note> but I must be sorie for his miserie, and that at my very heart, as though it were min owne euil. As this is put forth to vs in Christ. He is in this place as a foreiner and stranger. But when he seeth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie of this widdow, he is asmuch greued as though it were his owne sonne, he geueth confort and helpe. This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of charitie, which ought to folow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faith, &amp; it doth alwais folow faith, if it be true faith So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ought not to behaue our self after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of certein mercilesse people which hath stonie and yron heartes, &amp; laugh at their neighbours miseries, and are greued at their prosperitie.

Yea but necessitie causeth this to be the beste pitie, that is in this case. For the Physitions must nedes shewe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie vpon some part of the bodie, that the hole bodie maye be saued: and so is it also as concernynge this pitie. For suche chastisements are done, to see to thee, that thou mayst be deliuered from the tyranny of the deuill, &amp; from his kingdome.<note place="margin">Apte and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper simi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litudes.</note> He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is almost drowned in a floude, taketh it for no wronge, if he be plucked out by the heare, although it be done to his great grief and payne.

This is a spiritual medicin, against the disease of the soule, which
<pb facs="tcp:1416:463"/>
is the rebellyng againste the parentes and maisters. Wherfore this is the worke of mercie, when mannes miserie is considered,<note place="margin">Folyshe petie marrethe the citie.</note> and helpe is geuen. This pitie ought parents cheifly to regard in a familie, and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in a communaltie, and to beware diligentlie, that neither y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sufferers impaciens, neither their own negligence make them geue vp this pitie, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe oftentimes. For he that would be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and wil dissemble or winke at syn, he should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit two kindes of crueltie towarde his neyghbour, &amp; should fall into gods high displeasure.

Thou must cut of the snares of the deuill by sharpe discipline, but as touchinge this sorte of pitie I wil intreate more largely in an other place.</p>
               <p>But now is the example of Christ put forth to vs, how he pitied the miserie of this woman, and therby taught vs true pitie. That we shoulde remember that this precepte is set forth to vs, to thinke surely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is oure duetie to helpe, yea with the lssoe of oure goodes, when our neighbour is in bodily necessitie, &amp; so truly to shewe the office of pitie. Whiche thynge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde hath so great renoum, that it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, not as though it were done to our neyghbour only, but also to God hymselfe, whiche promiseth also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit it by a reward. Or if the contagion or disease be spiritual (that is to say) syn, as if our children and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie be stubburne, negligent, wanton in doinge and saying: here must be shewed pitie, that is cruel in sight,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1416:463"/>
and yet for all that, dothe all thynges for the best. But that that is past tamyng &amp; amendement geue it vp as a thyng past cure into the hands of the ministers and officers. For the matter can not scape vnpunyshed. And it is to be counted a parte of pitie to punyshe in suche case with extremitie of death. For they that are paste grace, can bee restrayned by no other meanes. They woulde be the destruction as well of other as theyr selues, yf thys office of pitie were not exercised vppon them by the sworde.<note place="margin">To punishe the wycked is greate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For if it were not for this punyshment and sharp correction, there could be no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minaltie, nor ciuile felowshyp mainteyned. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore let euery man in his vocation shewe pitie not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with affection, but also with discretion, and let him not helpe in bodyly euyls onely, but muche rather in spirituall euyls.</p>
               <p>And these are the two doctrines out of this gospel wherof the one belongeth vnto faith, that we shoulde be without feare in the myddest of all euyll, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the feares and terrors of deth come to sight: And let vs thynke that the almightie healpe of all our saluation is sette in Christ. Wherefore we can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of hym without our hurte. The helpe of man and of vs, is but vayn. For they can not represse deth: Death is valyant agaynst them. But we muste haue all our trust in God, and in his sonne Iesu. For that that wee can not, he can, if we oure selues haue no helpe, yet he hath wherwith to helpe vs, and is ready to doo it with all his heart, as the matter is playne. And wher as is such a mynd which beleueth consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in Christe, it dothe the true seruice, which he requireth
<pb facs="tcp:1416:464"/>
All other that despayre, hate hym, and doo not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge hym for God, or ells they would haue all theyr comfort in hym. The second example is, that we after the example of Christ haue respect to the necessitie of our neighbor, &amp; pitie him. The Lord our God haue mercy on vs, that we may learne bothe these lessons, and that with these men, we maye glorifie Christ for hys benefite. Amen.</p>

And beholde, there was a certayne man before hym whiche had the dropsie. And Iesus aunswered, and spake vnto the lawyers and phariseis, saying: Is it lauful to heale on the Sabbothe day? And they helde theyr peace. And he toke hym and healed hym, and let him go, and aunswered them, saying: Whiche of you shall haue an Asse or an Oxe fallen into a pitte. and wyll not straight way pull hym out on the Sabboth day? And they coulde not aunswere hym a gayne to these thinges. He put forth also a similitude to the geastes, when he marked howe they preacede to be in the highest rowmes, and sayde vnto them: When thou art byd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to a weddyng of any man, sit not downe in the hyghest rowme, lest a more honorable man then thou be bidden of him, and he (that bad hym and the) come and say to the, geue this man rowme, and thou begyne with shame to take the lowest rowme.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N thys Gospelle are two questions. The fyrste belongeth to the seruice of GOD, whyche ought to be done vnto God. The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is, what one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oweth to an other betwene them selues. And here ryseth a question, whether it be better before God to kepe the Sabboth, or to helpe thy neighbour and to doo hym good. For the Phariseys hadde no other matter but to proue and marke what Christ would doo, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the man that was diseased of the dropsye. If he healpe not, he myght bee reproued as hard hearted but yf he helpeth, then is he wycked, and kepeth not hys Sabboth, and maye be reproued in this that hee obeyeth not God and his worde. Therfore what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>CHRIST</hi> doth, he is taken. For they haue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where places to turne vnto. For amongest the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes the ceremonie of the Sabboth was moste holy Wherfore they keepe it straightlye. But what doothe Christ beynge so belayed on euery syde? they thought he had no wayes to scape: He vseth fewe wordes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his maner, and so confuteth his aduersaries with their folyshenes. For this is the summe of all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where as he saieth plainly, that they vnderstande not what it is to sanctify the Sabboth. Thys thinke you (saith he) that to kepe the sabboth wer to be idle, &amp; to do no good. This interpretation is very leude. For sanctifying of the saboth signifieth to hear gods word,<note place="margin">What is the sanctifyeng of the Saboth.</note> and to serue thy neyghbour as muche as thou canste.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:465"/>
For God dothe not so highly esteme the holynes of the Sabboth, that he would that the peryll of the neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour shold therfore be litle regarded. Wherfore when I helpe my neyghbour, althoughe this is doone with labour, yet hereby I haue sanctified my Saboth tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For I haue done a godly woorke therin. So that this doctrine ought chiefly to be referred to this ende, that we may lerne therby to kepe our Sabboth, that is not, to do nothing and to be ydle: but sermons must be heard, &amp; there must be had respect to the workes of charitie. But what doo the sermons teache? do not al thynges therof tende to this very ende, that we shold loue one an other, and be diligent in doyng good one for an other? This dothe God require that thou shold heare and learne in the Sabboth.<note place="margin">Heare and do</note> Wherof it foloweth that thou muste doo the same also on the Sabboth, if thou wylt truely sanctifie it. Wherfore Christ sayeth, you Phariseys are grosse doctours: For ye saye, that the Sabboth is broken, when any good is doone on the Sabboth. Where as this is the chiefe doctrine of the Sabboth to haue mutual loue. What is it to loue This thyng is not done by thynkyng but by true and effectuous affections, whiche stirreth vp the tong, the handes, and other membres, wherby good dedes are done, as Iohn saieth: Chyldren lette vs not loue in woord and tongue, but in dede and truth. Thys hath <hi>GOD</hi> (saieth Christ) commaunded thee to do on the Sabboth.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> yea and that that is more, he ordeined the Sabboth, that thou shouldest heare and learne thys, and that thou sholdest declare al beneuolence in word &amp; dede toward thy neighbor, whensoeuer he hath nede</p>
               <p>Wherfore <hi>CHRIST</hi> reproueth this ouerthwart kind of saints, which depraue and corrupt the word of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1416:465"/>
God, and boast that they kepe the Sabboth, wher as yet they are so out of Charitie, that they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe a worne garment, to the couerynge of a poore naked man. They are false writhers, that inuerte and change the word of God. For where as the worde of God commaundeth: Loue thy neighbour, and do the best for hym that euer thou canst: They answere, this will we not doo, least we violate the Sabboth. But Christe confuteth them by this, that GOD procureth that thyng to be preached on the Sabboth, that in it thou mayst loue thy neighbor, care for him, and helpe him all that thou canst. As it is playn in that example, that no man thynketh it a breakyng of the Sabbothe to delyuer hym by all meanes possible. Now what an vnreasonable waye is this, to excuse it when it is don in the danger of a brute beast, and to affirme that it is a greuous offence to doo the lyke when a manne is in peryll, least any worke of charitie should be done vnto hym in the Saboth: yea, &amp; thus is it mete, that they should stumble, whiche take vpon them to iudge and geue sentence of Gods doinge, that they might entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle them selues, and so betraye their foolishenesse. For this do the Phariseis take vpon them in this place, &amp; presume against Christe, that they maye haue hym in their daunger to trippe hym, whether he helpeth, that then he may seme to violate the Sabboth, or whether he helpeth not, that then he may be reproued for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glectyng of charitie. But Christ doth not only defend and mainteyne his doynge agaynste them, but also layeth the same crime to their charge. For sanctifying of the Sabboth is to heare Gods worde,<note place="margin">What it is to sanctifye the Sabbothe.</note> to doo holy workes, to loue thy neighbour, to help hym at his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, and to shewe obedience, to be mercyful, to help
<pb facs="tcp:1416:466"/>
to geue councell, to conforte, to breake breade to the hungrie. &amp;c. This ought to be done on the Sabboth. For he requirethe noo counterfaited seruice that wee should exercise all the day in syngyng in the Temple, after the example of the papistes. This is his will that the worde should be heard, and that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therby, shoulde be perfourmed in deede. As there is an excellent saying in Osee: For I wyll haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and not sacrifice,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Osee.</hi> 6.</note> and the knowledge of God more then burnt offerynges.</p>
               <p>For the knowledge of God is nothyng els but to heare Gods worde. The reason is, because that with out the worde no man can know any thyng as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng God. But when the word is pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, which saieth: I am the Lorde thy <hi>GOD,</hi> whiche sente my sonne, &amp; deliuered hym to be slayn for thee, which had mercy vpon the at Baptisme. &amp;c. By suche a worde is the knowledge of God communicate vnto vs, that he is fauorable and mercifull, whiche thynge reason can neuer perceaue and know by his owne strengthe.

               <p>The second part teacheth of humilitie. For so dothe Christe expounde the parable in the ende: He that exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth hymselfe shalbe brought lowe, and he that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himselfe, shall be exalted. Which is thus to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded, that men also and not onely God, do vse to hate the proude, and none but lyghte persones and wicked doo hate the humble and lowely. For it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by nature, that all men loue suche. When a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayde sheweth her selfe humble and obediente in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng her busines in the familie, her maistres canne not hate her. To be shorte, Nature it selfe causeth all men to fauor the humble &amp; lowly, &amp; to hate the proude. As sone as the parents perceue disobedience &amp; pride in the children and seruants (for these two vices are always ioyned together) when they answer proudly, that they ar not bound to be obedient at euery word: the paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes can not abide this, and they seeke some meanes to restreigne thys fiercenesse: Or yf that they wyll not bee ruled, to caste theym oute of the house.

Psalme sheweth: Who is as our God, which dwelleth on hygh, and hathe res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect vnto the lowly in heauen and in earth? He raiseth vp the symple out of the duste, and lifteth the poore out of the myre, that he may set hym with princes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with the princes of his people? Thus dothe God deale with the humble. But as for theym that are prowde, and can not refrayne from excesse, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche, agaynst them he setteth hym selfe with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and he neuer ceaseth, vntill they be throwe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe.

this, that I shoulde be obedient, and that I shold not be proude, but walke lowly. Thys wyl I do, neither wyll I care for that I am in suche a lowe and a base state and condition. For this I knowe, that when I doo my duetie, God will regard and care for me, how he may bryng me to a better state.</p>
               <p>Thus came it to passe with Saule,<note place="margin">Saull.</note> whiche when he was obscure, and a keper of mules, and thoughte hym selfe the lowest of the stocke of Beniamyn, hee was aduanced to suche honoure, that the Prophete Samuell receaued a commaundement from God to make hym kynge ouer Israel. For as long as he was humble, God was presente with hym by his mercye and grace.</p>
               <p>But after that he was puffed vp with pride, and began to be hygh mynded, and to despise God and his worde, he perceaued that God had no lesse mynde to caste hym downe, then before he hadde mynde to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce hym, vntill at last he dispeired vtterly, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hymselfe, and all his kynne was destroied.

But God saieth to Samuell: Let passe these stately persones, &amp; annoint hym kyng, whom I shewe vnto thee, for I wyll none of the other. Dauid, when he was nowe exalted of God, is not stately. For if he had ben so, he should haue ben reiected of God, after the example of

Saul. But for as muche as he sheweth modestie and lowlynes, although he be put besyde his kyngedome, yet dothe he recouer it agayne, and is also aduaunced to great renoume of God, for that that hee promiseth, that Christ shall procede of his stocke and kynred.</p>
               <p>All these thynges are written and declared in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to the intente that wee shoulde vse humilitie, and beware of pride, and not saye after the maner of the stately: Who canne abyde thys drudgerie?

the ten commaundementes, which children are wont to learne by heart. Wherfore it were an easy thyng for a chylde to geue them answer: The first and greatest commandement is: Thou shalt haue no other Gods but me. But the phariseys and scribes take it not for the greatest, and they be fallen to suche foly, that they call in question what that commandement should be. One saieth that it is sacrifice, an other to geue almes, an other, to fast and to vse a peculiar kynd of apparell &amp;c. As we see it to come to passe, when men fall from Gods commaundement and worde, and ordeyn and sette vp other workes for them selfe of their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentyng. For this came to passe with oure religious men also, when they became cloysterers, they made their profession, they had no propre goodes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they forgat also what is faithe, and what is cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie.

The rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son is, that they haue only in their syght, their rules of their profession? But a christen man saieth: To be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, signifieth to feare and loue God, &amp; to profite thy neighbour w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al kynd of benefit. For god gaue no other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement.

This moueth the eyes of the rude, and turneth them on them selues. But in the mean tyme the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall workes and commandementes, where as God is commaunded to be loued, and thy neighbour to bee holpen, is cleane left a side, as the example of the pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseys
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1416:469"/>
and Scribes is euident in this place. Wherfore thys is a notable exaumple, where as suche notable learned menne were in so great blyndnesse, that they knewe not, whiche was the greatest or smallest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte. And yet if a man may say the truthe, they were doctours, whiche oughte to make declaration to the people, howe God was to be worshypped truely As oure religious menne bee also: If a man shoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde of them, as touchynge good woorkes, and what is to be doone, they woulde not putte foorthe the tenne commaundementes, but aunswere, that he must become a religious man, and bye Masses, go on pilgrimage, faste. &amp;c.

By suche are menne deceaued, so that they haue no more respecte to the tenne commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, but doo let them wholly passe. For yf it were not for that, it would not haue ben harde for them to answere, that that is the greatest precepte that God commanded. But the phariseys, Scribes, priests, and monkes knewe not that. Wherefore this erroure is to bee auoyded, and your owne foolyshe deuotion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be eschued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But contrarily, the Catechisme and Christian discipline is not lightly to be regarded, yf that menne woulde be instructed to know what is theyr duetie to doo. For here we doo learne that GOD is to bee loued, and that we muste haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods (that is) we oughte to preferre nothyng before the loue of God. but rather to lette all thyngs passe, and to suffer all thynges for his sake. And thou
<pb facs="tcp:1416:470"/>
art in the state of perfection when thou doest thys: But they say, that this is the duetie of euery common Christian, but they will doo some peculiar thyng, that euery man doothe not: whiche rise not in the nyght, whiche eate fleshe, and are apparailed after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort, where as they bestowe the nyghte in holye seruice, and eate fyshe, and vse a kynd of apparaile by them selues: And so at laste the matter commeth to that poynt, that mans traditions kepe them so occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, that they can haue no respect to Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes. Wherfore it is no small doctrine, where as Christ saieth, that it is the chiefest precept, to loue god, and that the second is lyke to the fyrst, to loue the nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghbour as hym selfe.</p>
               <p>For of these two depende all thynges that maye be taught as touchyng good workes. Out of this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ought all thinges to procede, and to this ought they to be referred agayne· For this is decreed, if thou thynkest how thou mayst serue God, that can be done by no other meanes, then that thou loue God and thy neighbour. This doctrine will cause a straight iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be had in the last day. For what was done in the Papacie euery manne knoweth.<note place="margin">The blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of seruing god in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecie.</note> He that would serue GOD, became a cloysterer, he went to Rome, or to Saincte Iames.

But telle me, is not thys trewe, that thou ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest God, when thou doest that, that thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded? Wherfore to serue God, can be no other thyng,<note place="margin">What it is to serue God.</note> than to doo that, which God hathe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not that whiche ye thynke beste youre selfe.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1416:470"/>
But what hath God commaunded? truely, as Christ reherseth here: If thou thinkest to doo Gods seruice, thou must not go farre for that cause, or bestowe any great coste or charge. Loue God and thy neighbour. Howe can gods seruice be more nere vnto thee, or bee done better cheape, then by this meanes, that when thou louest thy neyghbour, and doest all kynde of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite for hym, God will accept it as thoughe it were doone to hymselfe? This is verily a meruailous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that this seruice is Gods, and done to God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou doest good to thy neighbour. And this as I said before, shalbe the cause of a harde and greuous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the laste daye. For thus (saith Christ) that the wycked shall saye:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> When dyd we see thee hungry or thirstie? But Christ shall answere: That ye haue not doone to any of the leaste of myne, that haue ye not doone to mee. Soo that thow mayest bee sure hereof, that whenne thou healpest a poore Christian wyth rayemente and meate, it seemeth to bee doone vnto <hi>CHRIST.</hi> And it is euen all one. But is not thys a greuous thyng, that wee lette passe suche an easye and ready occasion to serue God? We think that yf we coulde tell where Christe myght be found, that there we would gladdely doo, and bestowe all that wee coulde. But it is no nede to thynke so. Wee do heare here, that the seconde precepte is lyke to the fyrste. There canne bee noo other meanynge thereof, thenne that GOD wyll take it as done vnto hym selfe, what soeuer is doone to the neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure. But thow wylte saye, that God is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. This maketh no matter, he is also here in earth. Wherfore, whenne thou seeste a Christian in perylle,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:471"/>
thynke this, that it is Christe that suffreth it, and that he hath nede of thy healpe, as he saieth hymselfe, that in the laste daye he will make suche complayntes, that we haue not cared for his hunger and thyrst.</p>
               <p>It was a common facion in the popedom, that the olde souldiours, which had ben horsmen and fotemen in warre, and also lawyers and such like, which were thought to haue liued in a prophan &amp; an vnholy kynde of life, wold say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had serued the world hitherto, &amp; that now euer after they wold serue god,<note place="margin">Monkery is against chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and the true seruice of god.</note> &amp; so thei we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to som monasterie, wher they wer made monkes and heremites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this is a fals and peruers way. For he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil serue god must not seke solitarie places &amp; corners but must be conuersant amongest men, and help them all that he can. For by so doing is seruice doone vnto god, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded it. By monkerie is not gods ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uice fulfilled. For it is not only a thing vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded of god, but also al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trade therof is against charitie &amp; the true seruice of god, wherof Christ in this place speketh nothynge. This was vsed also amongest the Iewes. They hurted their neighbors diuersly, &amp; thoughte that if they offered muche burnt offerynge, that all thyngs pleased god highly. But what saieth God also psal. 50. I wyll not argue with thee for thy Sacrifyces. Thy burnte offerynges are alwayes in my syghte. I wyll not take calues out of thy house, neyther kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des out of thy heardes. For myne are all the wylde beastes of the woddes, and thousand beastes in thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sandes vppon the mountaynes. In an other place he sayeth also, that hee hathe noo nede of theyr golde and Temple: But yf thou studyest to do me true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice go thy waye vnto thy neyghbour. Thou haste a wyfe, chyldren, a famyly, neyghbours, rulers, lordes,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1416:471"/>
maisters, and many other states. These shall fynde the busines inough. Therin do me seruice. If ther be any stubburne in thy familie or children, wynke not at it, but see it duely punished. If thy neyghbour be nedie, sorowfull or sycke, helpe hym, se vnto hym, conforte him. Obey thy gouernour, and thinke that all this is done vnto me.</p>
               <p>But it is greatly to be lamented that these thinges can by no meanes moue vs. For whatsoeuer we haue trespassed against god, all that doth god forgeue vs of his owne free will, so that we wil only be beneficiall vnto our neighbour, which thing god wil so take, as though it were done vnto himselfe. He therfore that were ignorant what the worlde were, and howe it handleth God, might learne hereby. For what other thing do al men of all degrees, then through wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; folie daylye buffet god &amp; treade him vnder fete? For this is all mens desyre how they may waxe riche them selues, how they may heape vp their owne, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing, how it goeth with their neyghbour. He that could thinke this with himselfe surely, that what soeuer he doth to his neighbour, is done to god, might worthelie abhorre &amp; tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble at the fashion and maners of the worlde. But ther is no man that thinketh this to be true. As Christ saith also. That the wicked shall say in the last day: Lord,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 25.</note> when saw we thee hungrie and thirstie? But this shal nothing preuayle them. For as Christ sayth here. The second is like to the first: So shal he say then: That, that ye haue not done to one of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> least of mine, haue ye not done vnto me. This is the first doctrine out of this Gospell. God graunt, that we maye be moued therewith, and let euery man so consider his neyghbour when he doth hym good, that
<pb facs="tcp:1416:472"/>
god may take it as done vnto hymselfe. Then is ther nothyng in the worlde so vile &amp; base, with which God may not be serued. The seruant in the stable. The mayde in the dayrie or kitchyn, the child in the schole, yea all shoulde be the Lordes seruantes, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, if they woulde do that diligently that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande. So shoulde houses be made churches, where as nothyng is kepte but gods seruice. But no man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be persuaded to care for this. No man will serue his neyghbour. All men endeuer to serue them selues &amp; to seke their owne commoditie. Wherfore euen as by doing good to our neyghbour we may worke a thing acceptable to god: So the world doth alway gratifie and please the deuill in that it regard not Charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his neyghbour. But the ende therof will be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull. For how can this please God, wher as god hath ordayned his seruice to be done so nigh, that with out in the felde, within in the house, &amp; whersoeuer thou doest the workes of thy vocation, thou art occupied as it were in an holy temple, wher moste acceptable seruice may be done to god. And yet we regard it not, but despise it, and had rather serue the deuil than hym.</p>
               <p>Wherfore learne this, that he that geueth a benefite to his neyghbour, doth it not only to his neyghbour, but to his heauenly father also. For there is a sayinge in this place, that God will take this to be done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him euen as though it were done to hym in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 25.</note> For els woulde not Christ haue sayde: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is lyke the first.

For euen as thou mayest make thee here a Paradise and an heauen,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1416:472"/>
when thou doest good to thy neyghboure (for therin thou doest good to God whiche is in heauen) so when thou doest not good to thy neyghboure, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest a hell and damnation for thy selfe. For thou doest gratifie the deuill, whiche is appointed to hell. Neither doth it skyll, if thou doest not yet see it and fele it. For the tyme shall come when thou shall both fele it and see it, when thou shalte accuse thy selfe for thy stubburnes and great folye.</p>
               <p>Wherfore it were very necessarie for vs to learne to exercise oure selues to doe good vnto our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.<note place="margin">Why god ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uethe vs hys gyftes, and to what ende.</note> For all thynges are geuen to vs from god to this entent, hole and perfect senses, riches, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandynge, and suche other, that we myght ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obey this commaundement, and do to hym this seruice.

               <p>For if Christe were no more but the sonne of Dauid,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:473"/>
he must nedes die, as Dauid dyd, and should he haue only a corporal kyngdome. But Christ hath an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall kyngdome. And Dauid his father calleth hym father in spirite. Howe doth this agree that Christ should be both Dauides sonne and Lorde? This is a question, to the whiche, the Phariseyes can make no answer, neither can any of the Iewes at this present time answere therto. In this question is nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to thy neighbour, to charitie, &amp; to good workes.

Wherfore Christ doth so put forth the question, and byddeth them to make answere, whose sonne Christe is, which after the flesh was Dauids sonne? But for as muche as Dauid calleth him not son but his Lord, yea and such a Lord, that sitteth at the right hande of god, &amp; to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god wil make all his enemies his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole. By this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ mindeth to stirre vp the Iewes and all vs, to haue a more hygher iudgement of Christ, &amp; to beholde him with other maner of eyes, than with suche as see hym only to be the son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. For he is Dauids Lorde also, that is, he is not only a man, but also very God borne eternallie out of the father. Or els would not Dauid haue called him Lorde, if he had not ben more then a man, and if he had only byn Dauids sonne. For Dauid was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent holy man, and a most learned Kyng, and yet
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1416:473"/>
he calleth Christ, which is his sonne, lorde. As though he should say and openly confesse-My son passeth me farre. I am a Kyng, and beare the name of his father, but yet he is my lord, and such a Lord, that sitteth at the right hand of God, and by gods commandement beareth rule ouer all his enemies. For wher as he is a man it is easie to iudge what maner of enemies he hath, euen the deuill &amp; death, as Paule gathereth out of this very psalme.<note place="margin">

For without this vertue he coulde do nothyng against death and the deuill, no more then other men can. By this meanes than doth Christ bringe vs to the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, declaring the way to euerlasting lyfe.

Howe be it neuerthelesse euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man hath this power, when thou felest despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through sinne, to say vnto thee: why art thou so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful? I as a Christian man say vnto thee, that thou doest wrong to thy selfe. For god is not angrie with thee. These wordes ought to haue no lesse estimation with him that his greued than if Christe hymselfe had pronounced them out of heauen, neyther ought they to be any thyng lesse estemed, for the person that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth them. For all the effecte consisteth herein, that thy hearte shoulde apprehende and beleue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, and thinke it to be moste certaine, that GOD will be mercifull vnto thee for Christes sake, as is the example of this man that was sycke of the palsie. Christ doth first adhort this man to fayth: be of good confort, saith he, and doubt not, Thy synnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen thee. As soone as the sycke of the palsie beleued this worde, his synnes were without doubt forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hym. So doubtelesse do we obtayne remission of our synnes in the congregation, when the minister or any other Christian saith vnto thee: GOD is not angrie with thee. Beware that thou do no wronge to thy selfe. For he hath forgeuen thee all thy synnes for Iesus <hi>CHRIST</hi> his sonnes sake. Now is it thy duetie, to beleue this promise with all thy heart,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1416:476"/>
and rather to suffer all euill and harme than to doubt of it. For if thou boubte, absolution doth thee no good, no althoughe GOD hymselfe with his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell should pronounce it ouer thee. For wher as fayth is not, there is god reproued as a light &amp; vaine person, as though it were not true that he promiseth. God saue vs from suche vnbeleife and mistrust, whiche is the most greuouse sinne. How be it, the deuil is a very subtill craftesman to brynge vs to this that we might counte God a lyer, that is, that we shoulde be loth to beleue gods promise.</p>
               <p>But when the heart doth embrace the promise, God is glorified with the greatest glorie whiche plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him most. For he is affirmed to be true, &amp; that he can not deceaue, although he promise all thinges that are vnpossible. Wherfore this pleaseth Christ speciallie in this man, and therfore he speaketh so gentilly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, my sonne. Thou art vexed wyth syckenes, the deuill hath endamaged thee with the palsei, and God for thy sin hath suffered it so to be done, ther ensueth vpon this also a dread and an euill conscience, so that thou thynkest that Christ is angrie with thee, &amp; that thou hast no way to escape. For it is naturallie geuen, when the punishment of God is on a man, to feare &amp; dread in conscience, but thou must not geue place to this feare. Thou must not thynke this: that God hath no regard of thee, and that thou canste not tell whether he wyll haue mercie on thee or no, and that no sinner ought to be brought to GOD, al these thoughtes are wycked? Thou muste not haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to sinne or to the punishement of synne, but to that, that <hi>CHRIST</hi> speaketh: euen that thy synnes are forgeuen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:477"/>Wherfore the sycke of the palsie must thinke this, that althoughe he suffereth the palsei for his sins, yet that his sinnes are forgeuen. Such a fayth can be hindred neither by the palsei neither by any disease.</p>
               <p>On this wise ought faith and the worde to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to gether.<note place="margin">The worde and faythe muste be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together.</note> For none of them both can be without the other. He that beleueth and hath not the word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth as the Turke &amp; as the Iew doth. They thinke that god is merciful and fauorable. But they lacke a promesse. For out of Christ god will not be mercifull. If any man hath the worde, &amp; is without faith, there also is the worde of no efficacie:<note place="margin">Gods mercie is to be found in Christe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> so that faith and the word are knit to gether with suche a sure knot, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they can not be sundered by no meanes. A pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son beleueth that the ende of the world shal be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this moneth, but this is but a counterfayted faith. For it is without the worde. The Turke beleueth that he may hope to be saued through Mahomet, but it is a lye. For ther is no worde for the profe therof. The Pope beleueth that Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may get righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and saluation by their owne workes, but this is a fayned faith. For there is no such worde or promesse. So is it possible that there should be a fayth, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no worde, therfore can it not be a true fayth.</p>
               <p>But we Christians lacke not the worde. For we haue the pure and syncere worde. But we fele a want in our fayth. In that we can not so beleue the word, as we ought. This doth the deuill and original sinne worke in vs, and withdraweth vs from the word vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lies. For all we are naturallie borne with this sin, that we are glad to geue credence to lies. Wherfore it is a hard pece of worke to shake of this vnbeleife, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1416:477"/>
we haue this worde present. For the fleshe and the deuil withdraweth vs alwaye from the word. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider thou this with thy selfe, if I could trulye and perfectly beleue this, which Christe speaketh here to the sycke of the palsie, and also that, that is spoken to euery one of vs in baptisme, In absolution &amp; also in common sermons, how that ther is no wrath of God to be feared, no indignation lefte to be dreadded, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest thou not that it would be an excedyng ioye vnto me, and that all thinges shoulde seme full of ioy and pleasure? But for as much as we do not so, it is a sure token,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> that the olde man and the deuil do all that they can continually to hinder our faith. Wherfore thinke this for a suretie, that both of them be necessarie. First the worde must be heard, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must it also be beleued &amp; that without al doubting as much as is possible:<note place="margin">With out the worde it is an easye thing to beleue lyes.</note> and after al this, must all those thinges be hoped for, which the gospell promiseth, that are necessarie either for the spiritual or for the temporall lyfe. And they that haue no worde may easelie beleue. The reason is. Because this vice is geuen by nature, that we are glad to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue lies, for because our heart is proue therto. By this meanes the Pope and his sectaries beleue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly in the masse, and in the seruice and intercession of sainctes, in monasticall vowes, ceremonies, fastes, &amp;c. But it is a false and fayned fayth, and by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence ful of whoredome &amp; baudrie. The heart is full of fornication. False faith causeth spiritual whoredom. But on the contrari part we which (thankes be vnto god) haue the pure and chaste spowse (for the word is doubtlesse sincere and true) do not beleue constantly, wher as neuerthelesse we sholde beleue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly. But they can not beleue so constantly, seing they haue not
<pb facs="tcp:1416:478"/>
the worde. All the cause therof is in oure olde man &amp; in the deuill, for that, that we thorow originall sinne depart from the worde and truth vnto lyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What things are to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of this gospell.</note>Out of this gospell we must first learne, that we haue nede of the worde.

And that afterwarde doth therof ensue remission of sin and euerlastyng lyfe, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are surely ridde from all difficulties and dangers both in this life and in the life euerlasting. But when the worde is lackyng, ther is a faith also, as the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes, Arrians, Turkes, Iewes &amp; Papistes haue a fayth. But it is a faith without the worde, which is ingenerat in vs by nature through the fall of Adam. This is a lying fayth, which by nature we may kepe more surely then the worde of God.</p>
               <p>After that Christe had preached this to the sicke of the Palsye, and forgaue his sinnes: The scribes thinke that Christ blasphemeth God, in that he forgeueth sin. This part is necessarie also and of greate wayght. For this is euident by the example of all phantasticall persons, that all are in this errour, that they know not howe synnes be forgeuen. Demaunde this of the Pope and of his doctours, add they can not tell thee. what absolution doth. For all the Popedome holdeth fast by this doctrine, and it is surely holden vp ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that grace is powred into them, &amp; that he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would obtaine it, hath nede of contrition, confession, &amp; satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But when it is demanded, what is the office of absolution and of the keies: they answere that it is an exterial administration, which is obserued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church. So saye the Anabaptistes also: what shall baptisme preuayle to the obtayning of remission of sinnes, sith it is but a litle water? The spirit is requisite.</p>

                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:1416:478"/>To be short, no secte maker, no monke, no priest could see this, that remission of sinne, is a power geuen to man. As it is here in the gospell.

There doth the minister pronounce: I in the stede of GOD declare vnto thee through Iesus the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all thy synnes. And here mayste thou surely truste, that thy synnes are forgeuen, For bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time and the worde will not deceaue thee.</p>
               <p>This dyd they not teache in the Popedome, neither doth any of their preachers vnderstand this. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore geue you thankes to God for this benefite &amp; light, and learne diligently that God alone forgeueth sinne. But how? verely no otherwise then it is here: in that he hath geuen men such power: As Christ begynneth
<pb facs="tcp:1416:479"/>
that in this place, and afterwarde geueth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henceforth it shold alwayes be obserued and kepte in the congregation vnto the ende of the worlde, that repentaunce &amp; remission of sinnes sholde be preached in his name. So is remission of sinnes amongest men to be required, or in the worde, and no wher els.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 4.</note> For ther only may it be founde. This suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thee not to ascend into heauen therfore: But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou desirest remission of synne, receaue baptisme if thou be not yet Christined, or if thou be, see that thou doest call to minde that promesse, and be not harde of of belife. Go also, and be at one with thy neyghbour, &amp; then aske absolution. And as thou hearest, that remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinne is pronounced vnto thee in the name of Iesu, so beleue, and thou shalt obtaine thy desire: So that baptisme absolution, the publike worde, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament maye not seme a lyght thing vnto thee, but that remission of sin may be asked and required therby. For to this intent God hath called and ordained thy Pastour and Curate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 5.</note> thy father and mother, thy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian neyghbour, &amp; hath put his word in their mouth, that thou shouldest aske confort and remission of syn of them, so that this maye so be counted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and ordinance of god, that we shold geue credence to the wordes of men, when they according to Christes worde and commandement, vse their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration and office. For these are not the wordes of men but of God. Wherfore these wordes are to be beleued constantly and not to be despised. When the minister baptiseth a childe accordyng to Christes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement There thou hearest the wordes pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced of a man,<note place="margin">

For <hi>GOD</hi> hym selfe pronounceth this sentence, that thy synnes maye be forgeuen thee. Wherefore learne in this place the waye howe to aunswere these phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall persons, when they crie on this wyse: What is water but water? We know thys also.<note place="margin">Of the water of Baptisme. Note.</note> But they are ignorant hereof, that the worde of God is ioyned with suche water. Wherfore it is no longer pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but diuine water, whyche the mynister geueth not of hymselfe, but God commaunded it so to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to the intente that by it we myghte haue a new byrthe to enter into the kyngdome of God, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myssion of all oure synnes.

For bothe of them are the gyftes of God, Faithe and the worde.<note place="margin">Fayth an the worde are both the gifts of god.</note> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Remyssion of synnes is the woorke of GOD although God woorketh it by man. Thus then must Remission of synnes be required in the worde, which is put in mans mouthe: and in the Sacramentes, whiche are ministred by men, and no where els. For it can be found no where ells.</p>
               <p>Who can not vnderstande this, that my woorkes are farre otherwyse, whyche I doo, than the worde and woorkes of God? What madnesse thenne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Papists, to attribute the Remission of their synnes to theyr workes? Wherefore, whenne they in the laste daye shall comme foorth with their workes, <hi>CHRIST</hi> shall aske theym, and saye: Where is my worde then? I ordeyned in my Congregation, Baptisme, the Sacramente of my body and bloode,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:480"/>
absolution, the open preachyng of my word, that men myght by them obteyne remission of their synnes, and be partakers of my grace. Why haue not ye vsed this way and trade? Here might ye haue had a sure way of remission of synnes, but in your workes, there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayntie. Wherfore you must marke this doctrine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, what is proprely the remission of sin, &amp; how we may be assured therof, &amp; wherof we muste aske it &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue it.<note place="margin">In the true churche of Christe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of synnes and no where ells.</note> Uerily in this ye must haue respect only vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy church, wher the word &amp; sacraments are: ther is it found, &amp; not in heauen, as the Phariseis thynk, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posyng that Christ blasphemeth God, because he remit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth syn. But beware thou of that, and say: God hath bestowed remission of synne in Baptisme,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 18.</note> and in the worde, yea he hath put it in euery Christian mannes mouthe, when he conforteth thee, and sheweth to the the grace of God, that thou mayste receaue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue it, no otherwyse then yf Christ hym selfe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it by hys owne mouthe, as he pronouncethe to the man that was sycke of the palseye. Wherefore these heretikes are greately deceaued, where as they sunder the woorde frome Remission of synne. Thys myght be doone yf it were the woorde of man, but it is Gods worde, and Gods water. He that goeth about to take that frome man, and to defraude hym of it, takethe awaye frome manne also remission of synnes, neyther is there any remedye agaynste it. Wherefore the Anabaptistes and other heretikes do loose also the Remyssion of synnes, Baptisme, the Sacramente, the holye Congregation, and all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian woorkes, because they caste awaye the worde, that they heare of theyr mynister, and care no more for

it, then yf it were the voyce of a beast. God spake ones by an asse, and yf he should yet speake by an oxe, or by any other beast, he ought to be hearde. Why should it not preuayle than, when men speake by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God? For althoughe thou doest heare the voyce of a manne, yet doste thou heare God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauest for a suretie Remission of thy synnes frome GOD, if thou embrace it onely with Faithe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numer.</hi> 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I thought it good to make mention of this matter in thys place, that ye myght make stronge your selues agaynste sectes, and that ye myghte bee prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst theyr assaultes. For as I said, in the Popedom they knewe nothyng lesse then this doctrine. For this they thynk in the popedome, that baptisme came to an ende nowe longe agone. But if they haue nede of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of synne, then that contrition, confession, and satisfaction are requisite. For thus dydde they describe penaunce. But thys diuinitie is suche, that the dyuell canne well awaye therewith. For it hurteth not hys kyngedome. This is trewe, that contrition is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, and that we must be sorie for our synnes, but we obteyne not remission of synne thereby. For Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of synnes commeth onely hereby, yf that I haue respecte to the worde, and promyse of God, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that with a stronge faithe. But they inuert this and turne it vp syde downe. They omytte the worde, they regarde not what the Minister pronounceth by the commandement of Iesu <hi>CHRIST</hi>: they haue respecte onely to theyr contrition and penaunce. But by this meanes they lese bothe Christe, and all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefyttes. Neyther is it possyble,<note place="margin">Contricion.</note> that they shoulde conforte or solace as much as one troubled conscience.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:481"/>
For they lette passe the woorde, in the whiche onelye remayneth all hope of saluation, and bryngeth menne to contrition and rightuousnesse. But lerne you this, as concernyng Remission of synnes, to conforte both youre selues and other also. For as muche as God in Baptisme, in absolution, in the open preaching of his word, in the sacrament, doth talke with vs by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and by al other christians, to this must credence be geuen, and then for a suretie we obteyn remission of our synnes, whiche remission in the Popedome was dead and buried. For as touchynge it, there is not a woorde mentioned in all the Popes bulles, onely they make rehersall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of contrition, and referre the remission of synnes vnto it. And thus haue we remit synne.</p>
               <p>Now let vs briefly touche the hystorie. The sycke of the palsey is an example of all synners. For this is the propretie of this disease.<note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seye.</note> The members can not do their offices: and when a man goeth aboute to drawe his fete or his handes to hym, the farther they falle frome hym. Wherefore Aristotle in his Ethikes compareth suche a man to wylde and fierce youthe, whyche can by no meanes be tamed. But he that wyll wel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande this disease, muste take it to be spoken of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites that wyll be iustified by theyr woorkes. For the more that these labour to drawe nyghe vnto God, and to pacifie hym, the farther they ar cast from him. And when they thynke that they do hym moste pleasure, they displease hym most. For they haue no Faythe. He therfore that coueteth to be ridde of this euyll, let hym come to this man, which deliuereth on this wise when he saith: My sonne, be of good comfort, thy synnes ar forgeuen thee. By such a worde is strengthe restored to the membres, that they maye healpe one an other.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1416:481"/>
For where as is remission of synnes, there shall ensue very true good workes, for sinne is taken away. This was Christes especial meaning with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sick of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palsey. He laye downe sicke in his bed, for his disease woulde suffer hym to do no otherwise, he was as a killed hog and vnprofitable in all his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers But when Christ biddeth him to rise, he riseth and is strong and lustie, &amp; where as he was wont to be caried from home, now he beareth home his owne couche.</p>
               <p>This wold Christ that we herof shold take and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold an example and signe of that that he hath power in earth to forgeue synne. He speaketh playnely in the earth, that we shold not loke for it from heauen, or as the Pope taught to hope for remission of syns in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, by other mens workes and merites. For so it is in this place, that remission of synnes is a power, which is geuen to men in earth at Baptisme, at mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stryng of the sacramente, in absolution, and in open preachyng. Contrarywise, whatsoeuer is bound (that is) is excluded from Baptisme, the sacrament and the worde, is bounde also in heauen.</p>
               <p>By this power that we men in earthe doo lose and bynd sinnes, god is not spoiled of his glorie,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> neyther ar we made Gods therby, as the prophane and wicked mynded men doo oftentymes say of this matter. For we haue no more than the ministerie and office. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore God hath coupled vs together by this ministerie, that alwaies one of vs shoulde conforte and confirme an other: And that the other shoulde thynke hym selfe bounde to beleue as farre as the worde is purely preached vnto hym, that is to say, remission of synnes in the name of Christ. And this is the very bryngyng vnto God and remission of syns. He that dieth in thys
<pb facs="tcp:1416:482"/>
beliefe dieth to his saluation. But hee that dyeth, as he is taught in the Popedome, with a confidence and trust of the intercession of Sainctes, dyeth euyll, and to his destruction. For hee lackethe those defenders whiche God ordeyned agaynst the violence of death, (that is) the trewe pastor, the pure worde, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. So great miserie the deuyll brought in by the Pope, yea and nowe begynneth to bee the author of an other infection by the sectaries. For they can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde the worde. This offendeth his eyes. Wherefore the Pope toke it clean away, and in his place brought in the monkes rules, masses, pilgremages, pardons, and suche other. This can the dyuel well away with. For it hyndreth his kyngdom nothyng. The Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes furder the matter, which speake very contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously of the water of Baptisme. The Swenckfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians also mooste vilely and wickedly contemne the outward preachynge of the worde. All haue loste the worde, wherfore they are to be auoyded, and this is to be learned, that remission is no where els, but there as the woorde is. That woorde is in Baptisme, in the Supper of the Lorde, in absolution, in publike preachyng. Wherfore remission of synne is there also, and let hym be accursed, that sayeth otherwise. But wher as the word is, there is faith requisite. And then the membres begyn to be fastned which the syck of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palsey could before moue by no means. But loke wher the worde is not, the palsey is neuer taken away: and it is vnpossible, that any true mouyng should ioyn the membres together. This wold I the more earnestly dryue into you, because the Pope and sectes are the authors of suche great disorder in the Congregation. The Pope bryngeth neyther to the worde nor sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1416:482"/>
The sectaries can not but speake contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously of the worde, and sacrament, and nothynge preuayleth with them, but the holy Ghoste. And we knowe thys, that the holye ghoste wyll not doo hys worke without the woorde and sacramentes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can not despise the woorde and sacramentes, but we wyll obserue them for the chiefe thynges that we haue. God graunte his grace, that we maye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue this pure doctrine, and continue in it to the end and be saued. Amen.</p>

               <p>For the state of the Christians that are in this lyfe is suche, that they are halfe in the kyngdome of God, that is in soule and spirite, and after theyr fayth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore when thou heareste of the kyngdome of heauen, thou must not loke to heauen, but thou must seke after it in the earth amongest men, and that in all the world where soeuer the Gospel is beleued, and the true vse of the sacraments ministred. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> proprely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyngdom
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1416:483"/>
of heauen is nothyng els, then the kyngdom of Christ, the kyngdome of the Gospell, and of faith. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Gospell is, there is Christ. And wher Christ is, there is the holy ghost, and his kyngdome, whiche is the true kyngdom of heauen. For the which cause, all that haue the word and sacramentes, and beleue &amp; continue in Christ by faith: they are heauenly princes and sonnes of God. And onely this remayneth, that God moue away the half wall, which is put betwene, that is, that we die: then shall all thynges be heauen and saluation.</p>
               <p>This therfore must be lerned first, that the kingdome of heauen is the kyngdome of Christe, where as the worde &amp; Faith is. For in this kyngdome we haue lyfe in hope, and are cleane from synnes, free from death &amp; hell: Sauyng that the body of synne is lefte, whiche is not yet abolyshed, and yet shalbe abolished when al thinges shalbe lyfe, saluation, and heauen.</p>
               <p>To this mariage (sayeth Christ) God hathe called the Iewes his people, dyuers tymes before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge, by his holy Prophets. For it was their office specially, bycause they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the Iewes to waite for the mariage, that is, they put this people in a sure hope, that Christ would set foorth the gospel through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the worlde: and procure that remission of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and euerlastyng life shold be preached in his name To this ought men to be exhorted, and they shoulde waite for the gospell, and trust in it, that they myghte be saued by Christ. But Christ saieth here, they wold not come, as the Iewes in the desert would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into Egypt. After that, he sent other seruantes when the tyme of Christes comyng was, whych shold open hymself with teachyng, with myracles and great

They regarded not, saythe Christ, and one went to his farme, an other to his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synesse and merchandise. &amp;c. It is a very vnworthye thyng to despise this feaste, euen remission of synnes and euerlasting lyfe, and yet to hope for saluation. For if it were not so, they woulde neuer so gredilye haue gone to their farme or merchandise, and vtterly set at naught so noble a mariage.</p>
               <p>But this is alwaies the state of the Gospel, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it is preached, the world waxeth worse then it was before. They vsed no suche merchandyse before.

               <p>Wherfore lette no manne be offended for these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent maners, for that they geue them selfe so to coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse bothe in the citie, and also in the countrey, for that they bee so insolente and prowde, and handle their shepheardes and curates, whyche call theym to this feast, more vnwoorthily then they handle other men. Lett no man thynke, that this peruerse maner shall haue good successe. Neither wil I hope for much better state then other haue. Let not this offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce moue thee muche.

               <p>Some of them that were byd, were so bolde, that they tooke the seruauntes, reuyled theym, and kyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them.

And yet it is the moste common synne. To bee geuen to auarice, to steale, to committe whoredome and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication are not so common synnes. For all the world is in danger of this synne, the citizens and husbande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med sette not this muche by the gospell. All sleape at this seruice, as a man may se in the churche. When one loketh this way, an other that waye, and in so great a multitude scarsely ten or twelue come to thintente to learne any thynge.</p>
               <p>Yea, and furthermore besyde all this, this encreseth the matter also, that it is such a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon synne, so death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke, so greuous, so hellyshe and diuellyshe, that it can not be noted, as other synnes bee. All count this for a lyght matter, to be presente at a sermon, and to take no hede, yea rather a great parte geue them selues to bousyng and bybbyng in tyme of the sermon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not, and thinke it no matter at all. No man is moued with this, no man is greued therfore, that men are so coldly affected with the worde, but it is not so in other synnes. For other synnes as slaughter, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, theft. &amp;c. dothe make men oftentymes contrite
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1416:485"/>
and sorowfull, so that they wold wishe it vndone. For no man can counte these thynges well done. But not to heare the word diligently, to despise it, to persecute it: no man count these, matters of conscience.<note place="margin">Note and take hede.</note> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is suche a synne, for the whiche imperies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalties, and cities must be destroyed. For when it is not acknowledged, nor receaued, no repentance or amendement of lyfe can ensue. So chanced it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to all kyngedomes and to Ierusalem. And En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland also shall greuously be punyshed for this synne. For this synne cryeth daiely to God, neyther dothe it suffer God to rest before he saith in his wroth: I gaue you my sonne the highest price that I had, and wold gladly haue had communication with you, to teache and instruct you to euerlastyng life, but there is none that is desyrous to heare. Wherefore I can not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe the punyshment, as it is in Iohn.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> This is dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation, that lyght came into the world, and men loue darkenes more then lyght. For theyr workes ar euyl. As though he would saie: I would gladly wynke at the other syns, but this is damnation, that the worlde condemneth that I haue sent, euen my worde, and it careth not for it. This greueth me, they are full of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and I would healpee theym by my worde, and they wyll not. Therfore if they wil not hear my word let them heare the deuyls worde, and let them perishe also in the kyngdome of confusion.</p>
               <p>Thus hath it chaunced to the congregations of the east, and to the mooste flouryshynge communalties,<note place="margin">The Easte churches.</note> and to greate regions, whyche are nowe vnder the Turke. Hungarie also is almoste vndoone vtterlye. In other places they wyll not heare the gospel. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a punyshment they are constreigned to heare
<pb facs="tcp:1416:486"/>
the Anabaptistes and other diuelyshe doctoures. This is the punishement where as Gods worde is despised and not hearde. For it is the greattest and moste hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous synne, and therefore the moste greatest and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousest punishemente is prouided for it. This is gods will, that we should embrace the worde most louyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not onely write it in fine letters in our bookes, but also in our heartes. But the world will not grant hym this place, and it scarcely suffereth it to be in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes &amp; sermons, it had rather haue the dyuel in the hert and it shall haue hym at length. Wherfore learne this also, that God hath cause inough to punishe other syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of oures. But this synne passeth all, whenne his worde is set at naught, and when they are yll ordered that call men to this mariage. He therfore that is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wyth thys synne, lette hym learne to see vnto hym selfe by thys doctrine, that he may know that it is no lyttle synne, but the moste greatest and most greuous of all synnes, whiche God canne not suffer, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysheth it most greuously. All men crye out agaynste periurie and auarice, that they beare such route in the worlde.</p>
               <p>And thus is trewe, that these thynges canne not longe escape vnpunyshed. But in that we haue the Gospell, and care soo lyghtely for it, and in the meane tyme sette our myndes idelly vppon trifles, whyle that the woorde is preached, this is a synne passynge all other synnes, and doubtlesse shall so bee punyshed of GOD, that errours and lewde teachers maye enter in wyth all power, to take awaye all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. As it is in Grece and in other Regyons, where as nowe Mahomette reygneth, whych at thys time
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1416:486"/>
dryuethe theym to the abhominations of the dyuell, whyche before hadde the worde of GOD, but wold not beleue it.</p>
               <p>In the Popedome it chaunced thus also. There was first the trewe doctrine. When menne were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde, and despysed the doctrine, God punyshed that synne on thys wyse, that they allowed monkery, and mooste impudente lyes. Nowe also is thys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge to passe agayn. (For there must nedes chance to thys synne bothe corporall and spirituall punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes) where as the dyuell castethe amongest vs Arrians and Anabaptistes. For why is not Goddes woorde regarded? Why is it not receaued thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye?</p>
               <p>Remember ye therefore, that we muste beware of thys synne, and magnyfye the woorde of GOD, and heare it dylygently. For although we had none other cause to doo it, yet this were a sufficient cause, that <hi>GOD</hi> hathe commaunded it, for that it is a mooste acceptable seruice vnto hym. For it is no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell matter, that we doo serue suche a greate Lorde, Hee canne requite and recompence it moste lyberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. Wherefore thys seruyce oughte to be moste ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to all Christian men, that they might thynk: Trewely yf my Lorde and my GOD requyre thys that I shoulde heare hys worde, I wyll gladly doo hym thys seruyce, that I may boaste of this that I haue bestowed an hower of a daye in Goddes ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
               <p>This shoulde be a sufficient cause for vs to regarde Gods word. But besydes these, there are other causes also more euidente. For thys doth GOD promyse to
<pb facs="tcp:1416:487"/>
the also, yf thou wylt heare my woorde, and kepe it. Thou shalt subdue the deuyll,<note place="margin">Causes that oughte to moue vs to heare Gods worde.</note> so that he wyll not be so bolde as to come nere vnto thee. For where my word is, there am I. And where I am, the deuyll can haue no place. And besyde all this profite, thou shalt haue all thy synnes forgeuen thee, and thy hearte inflamed to the true study of religion and obedience towarde God and man: and to be short, thou shalte obtayne at last lyfe euerlasting. For I poynt and prescribe to thee suche seruice to do, as for the whiche great profit may redounde vnto thee. For if there were no profite for thee at all, yet were thou bounde to doo it, because it is my will, that it should be doone. But now I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde thee to do such seruice, as is moste for thy pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fite. As we proue by experience, when we do nothing but repete the ten commaundementes and the Lords prayer, there commeth always therof a newe profite, that we may vnderstande some thyng that came not to our mynde before. And this commoditie is specially therwith, that the dyuell therby is dryuen frome thee that he may not hurt thee. Wherfore lette no christian be so arrogant, that he thynke that hee vnderstandeth now the Lordes prayer, and the ten commandemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And if any suche thynge come in mynde, iudge it to be a temptation, and say: If I haue sayd it to day, nowe wille I saye it agayne, that thou mayest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes repelle and put awaye the deuyll frome thee, and so shalte thou doo vnto GOD moste profyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seruice. If thou doest not so, thou shalte offende God greatly. But who would gladly proue and fele so greate wrathe of God?</p>
               <p>But alas, thus goeth the matter: A great parte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng regardeth the worde. But yet nothyng is more
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1416:487"/>
certaine, then that if for sinnes pestilence and warre befalleth, that God will not regarde thee, but that he will stoppe his eares at thy crie. Euen as thou also hast deafe eares at his worde. As it is in Salomon: Because sayth he, I haue called, and ye haue refused,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.</note> I haue put forth my hand, and there was none that would see, ye haue despised all my councell, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected my discipline, I also will laugh and scorne you, when that, that ye feared is chaunced vnto you: When sodein miserie shall fal vpon you, and destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a tempest breake in on you. When tribulation and anguishe shall come vpon you. Then shall they call m to e and I will not heare them, in the morning they shall ryse and shall not fynde me, because they hated to be reformed, and receaued not the feare of the Lorde, and obeyed not my councell, but did caste of all my correction.</p>
               <p>This shalbe the punishement of this synne, when thou shalte at thy appointed tyme be bytterlye pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, euen then thou shalte haue GOD to laugh thee to scorne, which shall say, that this chaunced wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely vnto thee, because that wheras he put forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the doctrine of sincere councell, thou despisedst it, now therfore it chaunceth worthely vnto thee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hearest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil. If thou wilt not heare him that saith: Come vnto me all that labour and are heuie burdened &amp; I wil refresh you: heare thou the vngodly souldier, which first curseth and banneth, and afterward thrust thee through with a speare. Thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st not refuse this as wrongfullye done. For why diddest thou so despise the word of God, which thou sholdest haue heard and taken for thy cheif salfegarde? But thou settest more by thy feldes &amp; possessions then by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearing of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:488"/>
Thinkest thou that God will not take it greuously? Six dayes hath he appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to thee for labour: and to exercise husbandrie, he requireth no more for himselfe then the seuenth daye, that then thou sholdest do hym seruice also, and yet shall he not obtayne that of thee? Wherfore learne this, it is an horrible and dreadfulll sermon against the Iewes, because they despised this mariage, that is the preachyng of the Gospell, and reuiled and killed vp his seruantes. This kynge can not abide this. And therfore he sendeth his warriors euen the Romains, and destroyeth these murtherers, and burneth vp ther citie. Who can say that god doth any wronge in this? If a great prince should sende his son to certain bound in prison,<note place="margin">Note.</note> to deliuer them, &amp; they would not only receaue that deliuerer tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckfully, but also woulde kyll hym, and mocke the father also, how wold the father take this, thinkest thou. He wold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy both the prisoners and the prison also. So doth our god. He sendeth his sonne to deliuer vs from syn, death and hel, &amp; to geue vs euerlasting lyfe. He oughte to be heard of vs, and to be receaued by fayth. But we cast hym behinde, and go to our landes and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. These thinges seme much better to vs. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the plage and punishments of God breake out vpon vs by heapes and swarmes, in pestilence in the Turke, and other warres, whome can we blame but our selues? And if we come vnto him then with mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and lamenting, it shall not preuayle. For thynke thou how muche thou hast displeased God, in that so longe time thou hast denied him his true seruice. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy faulte with this wrath of GOD, and thou shalte thynke it well, that he differreth so longe the euerlastynge paynes of hell. And by this temporall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1416:488"/>
paynes he calleth thee to repentance, that thou mayst amende, and cease from sin at last.</p>
               <p>This is it in this gospell, that the kyng destroyed the murtherers and burned vp their citie, to geue vs an example, that these despisers in the feldes and cities seduce vs not to folow their maners. For it wil be no otherwise in the worlde: it can not be persuaded to care for the worde. They alwayes set more by their feldes and merchandise. But they shall greuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be punished. For what Iudgement they shal abide, the Iewes shewe by their example. Wherfore let vs not folow it, but let vs rather heare the worde dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with deuotion. And before all thinges let vs honorably receaue the seruantes that cal vs for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lords sake, from whome they are sent. Then shall we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue god to be our helper in all thinges of difficultie, which shalbe present with vs and defend vs, and at length shall geue vs life euerlasting through his son, our bridgrome Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>This is the first part as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Iewes. They are now gon. And now herken what he sayth to the Gentils. These were w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out, hauing no law nor worde of god. They were not within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wales, but in an open place, through y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the deuil might ronne at his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. These also commandeth this kynge to be called, that they might come al without any exception, men, women, olde, yonge, poore, rich. As we se at this daye, how god hath set forth baptisme, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supper, that all might take part, that will. Wherfore that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is nothing els: then that Christ is preached to all men, we are baptised, that we might be gestes, and make mery in this mariage, that is, that we might haue remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes &amp; life euerlasting against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil &amp; hel gates. All we are bydden to this mariage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:489"/>And now whan the number of the gestes is fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (for it is plaine here that both euell and good were called) the kyng himselfe commeth in and seeth what gestes he hath, and perceaueth some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be with out their mariage garment. For so will it alwayes be amongest Christians, that all are not true Christians, some are faultie &amp; vicious, &amp; yet haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, because they were baptised, vse the sacrament, &amp; heare sermons, &amp; yet they haue no more but the name. For they thinke not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter to be earnest &amp; true. This must a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accustome to know. For it wil neuer come to passe by teaching, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a whole Citie or vilage, yea or a hole house shold truly ensue after godlines. This will not come to passe, but as the maner is, ther commeth both good and euill. This must we abyde, &amp; as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the name to suffer them to be called Christians. For we are al bydden, but al come not with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mariage garment. This will be euen so vnto the last day. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at last ther shalbe made an other difference.</p>
               <p>For thus is it surely decreed, that this king wil not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue all called to the mariage of his son, but also he will see this, whether they that be called, come wyth their mariage garment. If any man should come to a mariage feaste fowle &amp; sluttishe out of their working shoppe, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would gladly receaue such vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they wer bide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feaste, yea &amp; specially y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome wold be greued therw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if he shold perceaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he were mocked of this or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mad or proude person. For they must come to the feaste w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the mariage garment.</p>
               <p>So saith Christ y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it shal come to passe here also like wise. Although thou be Christened, hearest sermons, vsest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrement, &amp; yet art without the mariage gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, (that is) beleuest not, carest not earnestly for the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1416:489"/>
gospel, and wouldest vse but only the name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, as the Pope and his doe, that thou mightest get commodities and prebendes therby: Thou art not a Christian for gods sake, neither for thy owne saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for then thou wouldest take greater pleasure therof. And truly thou must not thynke that thou mayst lye hyd there with thy hypocrisie.<note place="margin">No hipocrite can hyde him selfe from the face of god.</note> The kynge at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, will see thee, &amp; pluck the forth in the middest, or els in that last common day, or when thou shalt die, and will say: What makest thou here, syth thou hast but the name, &amp; not the propertie of a Christian, thou beleuedst not, as it behoueth a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Thou diddest neuer earnestly regard religion and godlines, howe thou mightest be deliuered from syn in dede, &amp; obtaine righteousnes and saluation, Thou diddest onlie aspire to substance, thou gapedst howe thou mightest get &amp; heape vp that. Wherfore now thou art come, with out the mariage garment. Get the hence. Ther is no rome for thee amongest them, that were goodly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked against the mariage.</p>
               <p>When this (saith Christ) shalbe layd to these hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites charge, eyther in the later day, or at their death, they shalbe dombe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, they shalbe able to alleage no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge for their defence. For what can they bringe? God made all thinges, he gaue vnto them the moste holy baptisme: He put the gospell yea all most in thy mouth, he gaue his supper &amp; communion euerie wher, and absolution. He ordayned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ministers, thou haddest at home both parentes and maisters, which should teach the what thou sholdest beleue and what godlines thou sholdest shewe in thy liuing. Wherfore thou canst not lay for thy excuse that thou were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the articles of thy beleife: but thou shalt nedes
<pb facs="tcp:1416:490"/>
be constrained to confesse: I was baptised. The gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was sufficiently preached vnto me, But I cared not for it. I did sett more by wordlye thinges. This doth that signifie in this place, wher as he that lacked the mariage garment, is done. For what could he an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swere to this, wherto we must beare record, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gaue vnto vs his sonne and shewed all maner of grace in baptisme and in the gospel? so that this only remained: that we shoulde receaue with embracing armes, that which he offereth so willingly vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Wherfore an horrible iudgement shall be geuen to these hypocrites, euen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be caste, bound hand and foote into the vtter darkenes, (that is) that they may be damned with the deuil in hell vnto euerlasting chaines. For their handes and feete are bounde, so that they can not deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues by theyr workes, and they shall abyde their damnation in darkenes, They shall lacke the light of god (that is) his confort for euer, being alwaye in perpetuall miserie, anguishe, and tormentes, so that they shall neuer come vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so muche as a sparke of light. This is an horrible mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie. Oh, that we could be moued therby, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a dolful paine it is, to lyue miserablye in hel in chaynes with weping and gnashinge of teeth. The gnashinge of teeth shalbe through frost and colde, the wepinge and waylinge for heate, as the doctours haue expounded it. Albeit Christ wolde signifie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all maner of torments, that may be inuented. This shalbe their punishement, because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of their visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not knowen &amp; receaued, wheras we were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, had the sacrament, baptisme, the gospel and absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; yet we beleued not, we vsed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not. And Christ would teach vs, and bringe vs to this, that we might
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1416:490"/>
know, how great felicitie hath chaunced to vs, in that we are called to such a magnificent noble &amp; glorious mariage, where at we may be sure to find a recoueri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin, deuil, death, hell &amp; euerlasting wayling. But he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will not knowlege so great grace, but counteth these things of no estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath worthely for his reward eternal death. For one of these two must nedes be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man either receaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospell &amp; beleue &amp; get euerlasting saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or not beleue &amp; so get euerlasting da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gospel may iustly say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paule sayd to the Iewes, which spake against him &amp; blasphemed: your blud be vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your owne head, I fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this time forth go giltlesse to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils.

And for as much as it is come to vs, this only remaineth, as it is describe here, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god wil cast out all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue not their mariage garment. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord will partly by alluring &amp; partly by fearing, bring vs to that point,<note place="margin">

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was a certayne ruler, whose sonne was sicke at Capernaum. As sone as the same heard that Iesus was come out of Iurye into Galile, he wente vnto hym, and besoughte hym that he woulde come downe and heale his sonne, for he was euen at the poynt of deathe. Then sayde Iesus vnto hym: Excepte ye see signes and wonders, ye wyll not beleue. The ruler sayd vnto hym: Sir, come down or euer that my sonne dye. Iesus saithe vnto him: Go thy way, thy sonne lyuethe. The man beleued the worde that Iesus had spoken vnto hym, and he went his way: And as he was going downe, the seruauntes mett him, and tolde hym, saying thy sonne lyuethe. Then enquired he of them the houre when he began to amende? And they sayde vnto hym: Yester day at the seuenthe houre the feuer left him. So the father knewe that it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same houre in the which Iesus sayde vnto hym, they sonne liueth: and he beleued and all his householde.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two thinges in this gospell, whiche are very profitable and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moste worthie to be had in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. The first is the miracle that Christ sheweth to the child that was in perill, wheras he healeth him and yet commeth not at hym, onely he saith to the father:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1416:491"/>
Go thy waye, thy son lyueth, and forthwith by this worde the childe is recouered, whiche was many a mile from thence, and knew nothinge of this worde. This is a great miracle, which declareth vnto vs how mightie the word of our lord Iesus Christ is,<note place="margin">The power of gods word.</note> and that whatsoeuer it setteth vpon, it bringeth it to passe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the deuill be neuer so muche against it. For this disease is no otherwise to be estemed of vs, than the other workes, wherwith the deuill vexe vs moste miserable men. To the destroying of this worke of the deuill is nothing els requisite, but the worde of Christ, and then is health gotten. For the deuil muste geue place whether he will or no, as soone as the worde of this man Christ soundeth, As we see here.</p>
               <p>Wherfore this miracle pertayneth specially to this ende, that we maye well knowe Christ, which is not only a man as other be that lyue a bodilye lyfe, but he is also almightie god, for as much as he is the Lorde ouer death and the deuill, yea such a Lord, which with a worde can helpe againste all euill. Therfore we also in our peril and necessitie must seeke helpe at hym, As this prince doth. And speciallye we oughte to make muche of his worde, as we wolde of a power that is almightie. For he that hath that, hath all, and can doe all thynges. And he that hath it not, can do nothynge againste synne, death and the deuill. For loke what Christ doth here with the sonne of the ruler,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom</hi> 1· <hi>Iac.</hi> 1.</note> wher as he defendeth him by his worde againste death &amp; that lyfe shold not be oppressed of death: the very same doth he make to worke in vs all by his worde, if we do but receaue it, and purposeth not only to deliuer vs from corporall euils, but also from sin and eternall death. Wherfore we muste folow the example of this ruler,
<pb facs="tcp:1416:492"/>
that in our peril &amp; euilles we may here require health, wheras the almightie worde, hath so redie and present power and wil to helpe vs. For wher as this ruler maketh haste, &amp; hateth all delay, Christ maketh muche more haste, and differreth not the helpinge vnto the comming of the father, but rather in this very houre and moment he wil haue the sycke child made whole. So we also must not doubte, but that Christ will be most redie to helpe vs: if we do but aske it of him, and trust surely for it of him.<note place="margin">Why christe was sent into thys worlde.</note> For to this inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was he sent, and came into the earth, to deliuer vs from sin &amp; death, to destroye the tyranny of the deuill, and to open the kyngdome of god for vs. For this very cause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, our most merciful god sent him, for this cause he came into the earth. Wherfore he that asketh helpe of hym, shal not depart without helpe, as we see in this ruler, which only intreateth for bodelye helth. Howe much more redie shall his wil be, wheras is more perill, and where as helpe is more necessary for vs, wher as the matter of euerlastyng lyf is in hande?</p>
               <p>This is the first, as touching the which, it is the vse to instructe, and teache when suche kynde of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles be taught. For therfore dyd Christ worke them, and afterward they were preserued in monuments &amp; bookes that we might know the power and will of Christe, and haue our refuge vnto him in all trouble and perill.</p>
               <p>The second, whereof we must teach in this history, is, that a notable example is sett forth vnto vs, in the whiche we may know certainly &amp; truly what is faith. Our aduersaries the Papistes teache none otherwise as touching faith, then that it is a certein knowledge concerninge Christ and what he hath don.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:1416:492"/>But in this y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true Christians haue no more than the deuil &amp; hipocrites haue. For these also know of Christ &amp; of his miracles, &amp; actes. But as concerninge Christian faith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture speaketh on this wise, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by it we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine remission of sinnes, righteousnes,<note place="margin">Of the christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Faythe.</note> &amp; euerlastinge life. For this saith Paule, we suppose y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is iustified by faith, without the workes of the law.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>Abacuc.</hi> 2. <hi>Luc.</hi> 7.</note> And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Abacuk saith: The righteous lyueth by faith. And Christ saith to Mary, whose sinnes were forgeuen: Go thy wayes, thy faith hath saued thee. Wherfore this faith, is no faith of the deuil &amp; of hypocrites in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, whiche know only the history, &amp; holde it as purely &amp; sincerely as Christians do. For this could not be hid priuie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deuil, what he dyd &amp; suffered in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth. But although this is necessary for a Christian to knowe, yet this is not the true faith by the whiche we obtayne remission of sinnes, and life euerlastinge. But in this place it is described by an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple what is true faith, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thinke surely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, that Christ speaketh &amp; promiseth, is most certaine, &amp; without all faulte. For these two are ioyned together,<note place="margin">What the true fayth is.</note> when god promiseth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we shold e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brace it with faith, &amp; doubt nothing but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is most true: And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is most certaine, although we do not perceaue it or see it. And loke wher y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promise is, &amp; we embrace it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faith, that is a true &amp; Christian faith, as we see in this ruler. He commeth to Christe and desyreth him, to go downe with him, and to helpe his son. The ruler tooke it very heuily and was greatlye afrayd. For he dreaded greatly, least y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if he brough not christ betimes, his son shold die, &amp; afterward ther shold be no hope of helpe. By this he declareth what maner of faith he hath, wher as he knowledgeth christ for his helper. For without this meaninge, he woulde neuer haue come to Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:493"/>Wherfore this ought to be counted a greate thynge, that wher as by nature he despeired of recoueringe of lyfe (for men had no longer hope of lyfe in hym.) Yet he taketh a longe iorney to Christ, with that hope, that if he myght bring Christe to him before he was deade, he should not be past cure. But yet could not Christe take this for faith, because that although this was a certaine knowledge of Christ, yet was it not such, as for the setting forth wherof, he came into this worlde. For he will not be taken and acknowledged onely for an helper in bodilie necessities, yea and that, so he be present but such worde is set forth as touching him in the promise and reuelacion of the gospel, that we may fele, that his godly power is present against all euill, but speciallie againste spirirual euill. If he hath diuine and godlyke power, them must his worde be thought almighty. And to this point doth he adhorte this ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, that he might rather haue respect to the cause of the miracles then the miracles themselues, and that he mighte begine at last to hope for saluation out of the word, although ther had ben no miracle shewed. For in the miracles is ther alwayes present ayde required.</p>
               <p>But this is true faith, that despeireth not of the promise of the worde, although ther be no signe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent ayde and succoure. And this must be the fayth of al sainctes, that god may be glorified and not our will. And that if god sheweth not himselfe appliant vnto vs as soone as we will, and after what way we wil, yet that we shoulde not ceasse from praisyng hym, as the hypocrites doe. Wherfore he requireth such a faith, that can abide patiently, althoughe gods miracles be not done at his becke. But this faith can not be, excepte there be respecte had, to this word as touching Christ,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1416:493"/>
whiche is that the deadly malediction and curse is by hym taken awaye, so that al that are incombred with bodilie euils and with death, although they are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of other signes in their deliuerance, yet should not despeire as touching the final &amp; last deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce through the death and resurrection of Christe. And Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that all shold loke &amp; seeke for this signe, and as for the other he wold not haue vs careful for them. For as touchyng this cheif signe, he hath put forth his expresse worde, and that without any condition,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 12.</note> that al might certainly beleue to haue remission of synnes, deliuerance from death, &amp; life euerlasting, for Christes sake. And he wold that all his other miracles &amp; signes should serue &amp; geue place to this that is cheif. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these thinges must be loked for in none other, then in them, which know that God is to be praised in this great signe aboue all, and doth so vse this, that neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse they may cheifly regarde the first and cheifest signe. And if it pleaseth God to omitt the inferiour signes, for the true procuring of that cheif signe, let vs beware that we be not importune, and that we thinke not, that they must be done of necessitie. For God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that the cheife should be counted such amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest vs al, that al shold beleue surely that they shalbe saued, for the most euident and pure couenant of God. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse in the meane season god doth not suspend and prolonge the ende &amp; successe of these present temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations &amp; specially amonge the weake, but yet so that they strenghthen themselues by litle &amp; litle to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vse, and learne to obey god in al thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> please hym, and put his worde before them. And althoughe the promise of this is to be loked for without a signe &amp; sensuall feling for a time, yet let them not faint and
<pb facs="tcp:1416:494"/>
geue vp, but vse the holy ghost as a president and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortour although Christ departe with his signes and miracles.</p>
               <p>And this is the true faith, as I said before, whiche stycketh vnto the word of Christ as touching saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; euerlasting life, &amp; also as concerning the sure preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the church, &amp; also of euery one of vs all, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it be done without the temptation of God, and we wholly depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of his wil, which therfore hath so bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d himselfe, to the principal saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is certaine, that he might haue all other thinges depending on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> faith and trust therof, and that he may be iudged to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister them wel vnto vs, although he fulfil not our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirs in all pointes. And betwene these two, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe to the common ecclesiasticall trade, he graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, as a man would saye, personal priuileges to this kyng, euen a peculiaer word as touchinge the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his son. The which syth it is put forth so plaine &amp; euident, it ought to be embraced with as sure faith, as that, that is put forth to all, as concernyng remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinne and euerlasting life in the name of Christ. For loke of what thing the word is put forth? with a promise that it shall certeinly come to passe, that must certainelye be beleued. For as GOD is tempted, whan that a signe of a determined and appointed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is required: So is he not truly glorified when the appointed worde is not beleued, as it was in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas but this ruler doth glorifie GOD, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth the determined word of <hi>CHRIST,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 16 <hi>Esa.</hi> 7.</note> and forthwith obtayneth helth for his sonne, as he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of his familie at his retournyng home.</p>
               <p>Learne therfore in this place what is true fayth, euen to doubt nothing of the word of Christe &amp; of his
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1416:494"/>
promise, but to beleue surely, that as the worde promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, so shall it come to passe,<note place="margin">The nature of Faythe.</note> although it be not sene &amp; perceaued. For this is the cheif nature of faith, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and beleue that, that is not present. For thinges present are not beleued, but are seen &amp; felte. The riche man although he beleueth that he shal not die for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger this yere, yet is this no faith. But he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath no store nor substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; yet sticketh surely to gods word, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god as a father wil prouide for his liuing, but yet so that he caste not away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of god, but serue his owne vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he beleueth truly, and it is not possible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such a faith shold deceaue him. For it is grounded on gods word, which is almighti &amp; promiseth, that if fyrst we seeke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyngdome of God &amp; the righteousnes therof, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all other things shallbe cast vnto vs. So all we do proue this, that we are so corrupted by sin,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 6.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we lyue voyde of all righteousnes. But when the worde prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto vs remission of sinnes and righteousnes, this can none otherwise be apprehended, but by faith. Wherfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> state of a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is such, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although he sustaineth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of sin, yet he is pure &amp; righteous &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out sin through faith &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde. And this doth fayth worke in him, the worke ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer do it as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brainlesse papistes teach. For as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes, althoughe they be neuer so good yet are we vnprofitable serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as Christ saith.</p>
               <p>And as I haue said as touching righteousnes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.</note> so is it also as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning lyfe. We are so infected by synne, and drowned vp in it, that we can not be sure of lyfe for the space of a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this may truly be said with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wise Paynimes and Ethnickes: that nothing is more certaine to a man then death. As we proue that to be true not only by our examples, but also by the example of others also, that is, how soone men are
<pb facs="tcp:1416:495"/>
inuegled and enuironed with sycknes and other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. And yet haue we y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word set forth to vs which putteth vs in hope not only of lyfe, but also of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life. This do not we, that beleue, touche with our handes, we fele it not, we grope it not, but it is promised to vs in the worde, and we beleue it. And it is sure that this faith shall not deceaue vs. For it is grounded on gods worde, whiche is omnipotent and euerlastynge.</p>
               <p>To be shorte, this is the nature of faith, As the worde doth promise thinges that are vnuisible and thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs to come, so doth faith beleue these inuisible thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs and surely loketh for them to come. The reason is. It knoweth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of god is almightie, &amp; that god is true, and without lyinge, wherfore fayth hath dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent respect vnto the worde. If it perceaue the word, it embrace it boldlye, and careth nothinge eyther for the worlde or for the deuil. For it is sure of the end and what shal befalle, although the deuil the fleshe and the worlde make neuer so muche a do. But wher as it perceaueth, that the worde is lackyng, it setteth not this much by the outward appera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> threates, nor by any violence, whiche is done of the worlde, so that it maye perceaue that to be true, and will suffer all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, rather then to be constrained to receaue any falshod. And if in the Popedome we had had suche respecte vnto true faith, we had neuer fallen into such horrible Idolatries and errours.</p>
               <p>Wherfore it is a very necessarie and profitable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for vs, to be taught and certifyed as touchinge true faith, that is, that we should haue the worde of god and promise, and stycke surely therunto, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that it shall surely come to passe? For to beleue
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1416:495"/>
any thyng without the worde of God, is no Faythe, but a vaine opinion, which can neuer well escape.<note place="margin">Where the worde is not ther can be no Faythe.</note> As if thou shouldest beleue, that thou shouldest be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Rome. Thou mayst this persuade thy selfe, but yet so that thou perceauest not how it should come to passe. But when Dauid, which was of no high blud heard the word of God by Samuell the prophete, as touchyng the kyngdome of Israell, the ende and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse therof could not be voyde or frustrate, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Saules frendes dyd to the contrarie.</p>
               <p>So is it here also. This Ruler, where as he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a signe and present ayde of Christe somwhat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately, is by Christ wholly dryuen to the worde: And although that Christ woulde nowe also shewe a signe, and healpe the Ruler out of hande, yet he wold haue hym endewed with Faith before he fele healpe. And when the woorde appoynteth hym so to doo: Go thy wayes, thy sonne lyueth. There doothe the Ruler beleeue, as concernynge the lyfe of hys sonne by the worde. And as Faithe foloweth the woorde: so doth lyfe folowe Fayth thorough the woorde. As we also haue the worde and promyse, where as God doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally confort all the worlde, and saieth: He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth in me, shall neuer see deathe. Likewise (sayeth Iohn Baptist of hym:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.</note>) Beholde the Lambe of God that taketh away the synnes of the world. These are vniuersall and generall sermons,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.</note> whiche pertayne to all men. For he saythe not, when he or this man shall beleue. But he speaketh generally: He that beleue the in me, shall neuer see death. Likewise Iohn saieth not, that Christ the Lambe sent from God, shal take away the synnes of this man or that man, but the synnes of all the worlde. Wherfore if thou bee a synner,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and
<pb facs="tcp:1416:496"/>
art in the worlde, thynke that it appertaynethe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and doubt not but that thy matter is in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, and that it is done for thy sake. This is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherin our Faith, as muche as belongeth to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of synnes and euerlastyng lyfe, ought to leane: And shall no more deceaue vs that doo sticke thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, then the ruler was deceaued by his Faith.</p>
               <p>For we must not thinke that it was an easier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for so great a ruler than it is for vs, when Christe puttethe foorthe vnto hym suche a certayne woorde, where as hee sayeth: Go thy way, thy sonne lyueth But it is an harder matter for vs, because there is noo suche certayne woorde putte foorthe vnto vs, but generallye to vs all. For <hi>CHRISTE</hi> hym selfe, althoughe he putte foorthe a generall worde, yet as hee speaketh it here priuatly to the Ruler, sayinge: Go thy way thy sonne lyueth: So doth he speake this to euery man by himselfe: Sonne, thy synnes be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen thee: thyne is that life euerlastyng. For to what other man dothe he speake thys, but to euery one of vs, that are baptised? Dothe not baptisme belonge to euery man? If other wil be partakers of baptisme they muste take it for them selues. But what dothe God saye to thee, and to all that are baptised? Is not the promise, that who soeuer beleeueth, and is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, shall bee saued? Lykewise thou arte baptised to dye with Christe, because he dyed for thee, and by his deathe redemed thee frome synne and deathe.

Wherefore, this is not lacking, as though God spake not with vs, but the fault is in this, that we folow not the example of the ruler, &amp; that we receue not, neither beleue it to be true, whatsoeuer Christ speketh vnto vs priuately.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:497"/>
The Ruler also had occasion not to beleue, yf he wold haue folowed his reason, and hadde no respect to the worde. For howe coulde hee beleue, that thys lyttell worde woulde haue ben so effectuous so farre of, and brought suche a greate thyng to passe? He might haue sayde: It is not vnknowen to me, in what case I haue lefte my sonne. Seynge there is no hope of lyfe agaynst so great perill, so small a woorde can be of no efficacitie. He must nedes come more nere, and do gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thynges, if he will bryng to passe so great a thing. But the Ruler omitteth all these thynges, and onely embraceth the woorde, and geueth so greate credence therto, as thoughe hee sawe the healthe of his sonne presently before his face. For except he had ben of this mynde, hee woulde not haue departed, as contente with this word. But he was content, as Iohn saith very well: The man beleued the woorde that Iesus spake vnto him, and went his waie.</p>
               <p>And here doest thou knowe what Faith is proprely, if thou seekest the definition thereof,<note place="margin">What faythe is.</note> euen no other thynge, than to beleue that, that Christe promyseth. Gette thee therfore acquaynted with it, and first lerne whenne God promyseth to thee in Baptisme, Christe in the Gospell, and in his Supper. Embrace that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse with all thy heart, and lette nothyng hynder thee therin, although thou shalt haue many lettes. We fele synne and deathe, whyche offer them selues alwayes to our syght and sence. And if thou let passe the word in thys case, synne and deathe wyll oppresse thee, and caste thee headlong into destruction. But what doth a Christian? he confesseth his synne, neyther is he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne of deathe. But yet hee despaireth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1416:497"/>
But hee taketh holde of the worde as muche as he canne, and saythe: <hi>CHRIST</hi> dyed for me, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am I free frome synne, and I canne not dye, neyther hathe death nor synne any power vppon me. For Christe hathe made satisfaction for all thynges that I shod pay. This is true faith, neither is it possible that he should be deceaued of this hope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sticketh to the word on this wise, This is true, it is not yet sene, or felte, but yet it is trewe, and the tyme shall surely comme, whenne it shalbe opened. The ruler dyd euen so, and sticked surely to the woorde. He perceyued not the thynge, but because he beleued the woorde, hys seruauntes come on the nexte daye with ioyefull ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynges, that hys sonne was alyue. At lengthe also, he seeth it wyth hys eyes. Then is Faithe no longer requisite, it is come to passe as he beleued. Thus is it wyth vs also. We haue remission of oure synnes and euerlastynge lyfe. We heare the Gospel, we beleue the absolution, we vse the supper of the Lorde, yet do we styll fele always deathe and synne, neyther can wee remoue thys sence and feelynge frome vs, whyle we lyue in thys lyfe.

               <p>But here muste we especially marke howe Christe saieth: That the kyngdome of God is lyke a kynge, whiche purposeth to make a reckenynge and accompt with his seruantes. For this commaundement as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching remission of sinne, is not to be applied to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance of a comminaltie, where as are seuerall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and diuersities of persons, &amp; therfore all thynges there consist in the varieties of rulynge and obeyeng, that licence may not be geuen to the lustes and vices of men, but that a discipline and honest order maye be

hadde for the restraynynge of the lewde and wicked. Wherefore it is not ment, that parentes should geue theyr chylderne all lycencious libertie. They ought to vse a certayne kynde of reuengyng, and by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to couete and desyre the name of facilitie and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylnesse.

               <p>Wherfore, this commandement is not to be vsed in a common welth, but in the kyngdom of God. where all we are equall, and are subiecte but onely to God, whiche is the head of the lyfe of vs all.

In thys churche thou must obserue this trade, if it be not thy peculiar office to reuenge synne, that there may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way be pardonyng one an other, and no reuengynge, that al things may be done toward thy neighbor with mercy &amp; gentlenes whersoeuer he hath nede, althoughe by reason we might seme to haue a iust cause to do the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. Why Christ requireth this, he sheweth sure causes in the parable of the two seruants, and of the king. The first is, that Christ requireth, that the christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans should thynk with themselues howe great mercie God hathe shewed vnto them, which also if he would deale extremely with vs, had many and great causes to be reuenged of vs, and to vexe vs, with moste gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous euyls. But seyng that we obteined mercy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

our desert, we must shew mercy and gentlenes to our neighbor. And this must be obserued with great diligence. For by this Christ declareth, what is the true way to obteyn remission of synne, and sheweth vs to our selues what we are, as it were with a fynger, and what God is: agayne, what is our merite before God, and yet what we obtaine.</p>
               <p>For as concernyng the parable of the seruaunt that ought ten thousand talentes, Christ putteth it forth to thys ende, that he maye teache vs, what oure cause is before the Iudgemente of God.

For yf syn were not, we shold neuer dye. Whyther therfore shall we turne vs? The debte is certayne, we can not denye it, and the Lorde requireth the debte, but wee are not hable to paye it.</p>
               <p>And here nowe is set foorthe vnto vs a moste ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and luckye thyng, whyche we ought to imbrace, as they saye,<note place="margin">Synne with all humilitie muste be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cye craued.</note> with metyng armes, that by this means we are delyuered from our debt, and so escape deathe.

of Gods moste mercyfull bowels, as the testimonie of Christe is here, that the bowels of God yearne and are moued, when synners are driuen by the lawe and synne to destruction and euerlasting bondage. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thou feelest thy debt, haue thy recourse with this seruaunt to the mercye of God, and thynke for a suertie, that it is Goddes will, that thou sholdest not dye, but haue euerlastyng lyfe.</p>
               <p>And what is the meane by the whiche God would haue mercy vpon vs, the Gospel sheweth in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, euen that the sonne of God Iesus Christ is becom man for vs synners, and toke our syns vpon him, and satisfied for them by his death. Loke where this faith is, as touchyng Christ &amp; his deathe, there is the wrath of God ouercome, so that he suffreth himselfe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to man, and is no more angry with him. For he hath declared in Iesu Christe, that he hathe a verye prompt &amp; redy mynd to mercy, whiche hath mercy on vs, as the father on his chyldren. For he forthwith as soone as the kyngdom of death and of synne was set vp by Adam and Eue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</note> set forth a hope of saluation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst thys kyngdome by the promyse as touchynge the seede of the woman.</p>
               <p>And thys is oure doctrine, which thanks be to god in our Churche is sette foorth syncerely and withoute fault, that remission of sinnes cometh vnto vs only by the grace and mercy of God: As it is described in thys place by the seruant, which oweth such a great summe but yet obtaineth a quittance of it, not by merite and desert, but onely by mercy and grace, and that only for this, that he sticketh sure to grace, and prayeth for the mercy of God. Wherfore the doctrine of the Papistes is erronious, false, and blasphemous, whenne they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1416:502"/>
preache as concernynge remission of synnes. For they caste menne with theyr vnpayable dettes vnto theyr owne workes. But when we teache, that remyssion of synne is onely to be asked of God by Christe, they condemne it as heresie and false. But iudge thou thys by the true meanyng of the Gospell, which of vs both do preache more truly as touching remission of sinnes whether we that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the mercy of God in Christ, or they that persuade me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to works and satisfactions? To be brief, al this sermon tendeth to this end, that we shold learn that God hath mercy on vs freely, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geueth all our debt for naught.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esa.</hi> 43</note> Christ admonisheth vs here, as touching this grace, that we also by this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shold behaue our selues likewise, &amp; shew no cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towarde our neighbour, for that we haue receaued the remittyng of so great debtes from God. For other wise can they not do, that acknowledge truly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes before GOD. And this is the fyrst cause the whyche Christe hath set foorthe, and in the meane tyme hee doothe teache, what is the way vnto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, whereby we myght obteyne grace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of synnes.</p>
               <p>The seconde cause is, when Christ requireth of vs, to consyder well the wronge and damage doone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. For yf that wee trye all thynges by a iust ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launce, we shall perceaue that oure debtes to God be alwayes tenne myllions of talentes, in compary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the debte of the hundred pence, that our neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour dooth owe vnto vs. If thys bee welle consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it wylle admonyshe vs, where as GOD hathe forgeuen vs so greate a summe, that we shold not to straightly require our minute, but iudge al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gs according to equitie. For what are a hundred pens
<pb facs="tcp:1416:503"/>
in respecte of tenne millyons of talentes? Wherfore these thynges wyll make vs ashamed, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a iuste cause, yf that wee, whyche haue gotten Remission of so greate thynges, wyll not pardon our neighbours in lytle thyngs. They do not well esteme the mercy of God, that are so strait to their neighbors.</p>
               <p>The third cause is, that Christe in this Parable cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs all seruauntes. Thys seruant (sayeth he) went foorth, and chaunced vppon one of his fellowe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes that owed vnto hym an hundred pence. Thys also might worthily adhort vs vnto mercyfulnes, and withdraw vs from reuengyng. For we are but felow seruauntes, and all we haue one Lorde, whose propre office it is to reuenge all trespasses, whose maiestie is not to be resisted, nor hys power to be mynished: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he suffer thee, if thou do so: as he saith in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> Leaue to me the reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging, &amp; I wil reward (saieth the Lorde:) For without thy reuengyng it is Gods office to punyshe syn. And to thys ministration he hath not onely the deuyll, that vexeth the body and goodes, when GOD permytteth hym so to doo, but he hath also certayne powers in the earthe, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye one for theyr parte shoulde punyshe and reuenge, that is, the parentes, and officers. All these are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be a terrour and feare to euyll woorkes. To these reuengers must al flee vnto, that suffer wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g eyther in Cities, or in housholdes. For they are all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low seruantes, and ought not to reuenge their owne wronges. If any haue an office to punyshe, and yet punysheth not, GOD wyll not leaue hym vnpuny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. For hee doothe not onely challenge thys for his owne office: But hee hym selfe also, whenne these reuengers appoynted of hym, ceasse frome dooynge
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1416:503"/>
their dutie, exerciseth reuenging for the oppressed and vexed. Wherfore all men must beware y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they reuenge not their owne wronge. This is the meaninge of Christes saying, wheras he sayth in the parable: This seruant fell vpon one of his felow seruants.</p>
               <p>The fowerth cause is. He that will not also thinke vpon the greatnes of Gods mercie, and the litle and small debt of his felowe seruant, in whom he hath no power but is only a felow seruant, and would require his right rigorously of hym, he shall do nothynge els by this meanes then cause, that this rigorousnes and cruell bytternes can not longe lye hid. Other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians will take this greuously, and will bringe this crueltie of this seruant to the lords eares: That is to say, that vniust pride and vnmercifulnes, will geue and moue the holye spirite in Christians, that they in their sorowe wyll make their pitiful complaint vnto the Lord. And let no man thinke, that this complaint shall fall voyde. For although that god wolde of hym selfe neglecte this wrong yet shoulde he be constrained by Christian mennes prayers, not to neglecte it. Therfore as the prayers of the righteous are not voide, so shal not the common curses of the people, and the crying out for reuenginge, fall voyd and frustrat. And therfore Christ will not haue vs neglecte them, but for feare of this perill to shew our selues gentle to our felow seruants.</p>
               <p>Then shalt thou perceaue in dede y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be some, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for this thy gentlenes, wyll wishe all prosperitie and successe to thee again. Wherfore these men can neuer thriue, that regarde not the cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ngs and blessyngs of of the people. As it is to see in time of dearth. The miserable multitude curseth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couetous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

as Salomon sayth in his Prouerbes: The people curse hym that hydeth his grayne,<note place="margin">

But consider thou, whether this curse be not effectuous, wheras they with all their goods are compassed about with all troubles and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series. Wherfore this is not to be estemed lightly, wheras Christ in this place sheweth howe we should beware, that we geue no occasion to make our felow seruantes to complaine vnto the Lorde, and shewe what they haue seen in Iudgementes. For it is an horrible thing that foloweth. The lord, saith he, called the seruant vnto him.</p>
               <p>And this is the fyfte cause, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou mightest thinke wel vpon this end. For if thou wilt shewe no mercie vnto thy felow seruaunt, but requirest thy right rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, thinke not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god wil winke at it, &amp; lay nothing to thy charge for it. But he will declare this his reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging both at other times &amp; specially in the latter Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shal geue his greuous sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce against thee. Euen that thou be deliuered to the tormenters, vntil thou payst the whole debte. What speciall thing shalt y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haue then for thy stubburnes? Wheras thou with thy gentlenes &amp; mercy to the neyghbour sholdest haue god mercifull vnto thee, and shouldest haue esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped scotfree from all thy debtes: Nowe shalt thou fele him vnmerciful, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no part of thy debtes And this is nothing els the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prouerbe, to take vp the stalke &amp; let go the eare, wheras thou castest awaie many thousand, to winne one halfpeny: Although this parable is farre beneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the which a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not obtaine remission of sins, but is constrained to sustaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euerlasting wrath of god.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:1416:504"/>Wherfore Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth &amp; saith: thus shal my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father deale with you also, if you forgeue not euery man his brother fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bottom of your heart al their offences. He sayth, that we are brothers, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ought to be no enmitie and hatred among vs. Howbeit our infirmitie is so great, that we shal neuer liue without offending eche other. But what doth god require of vs? euen that we shold not liue in hatred and strife, but from our heartes forgeue one an other, and thynke this: he is my brother, why shold I be so cruell against him? Seing God is so good vnto me, and forgeueth me suche a great summe freely for Christes sake, what should I estime my selfe so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and disdaine to forgeue my brother suche triflynge debtes? If I maye come to that point, that he will forgeue me. I will be right glad to suffer my neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours debte to be stricken out of my counting booke. Yea and will thancke god also for that he of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie hath pardoned me, wheras he might haue requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of me vnnumerable debtes and caste me to be bounde in euerlasting chaynes.</p>
               <p>And this is the doctrine, whiche the Lorde Iesus Christe putteth forth to his people this day, euen that we should refraine our selues from wrath and reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, &amp; forgeue our neygbour gladlie, that so we may be sure that god forgeueth vs.</p>
               <p>But daylie experience teacheth, howe disobedient we are in this behalfe, and howe obedient we are in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the deuil, whansoeuer he moueth vs to wrath, to reuenge, and to all that he requireth of vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe it be to our greate damaige. For Christes saying is true. If thou forgeuest, thou mayeste
<pb facs="tcp:1416:505"/>
be sure god will forgeue thee, so that if thou be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, thou shalt still obtaine gods mercie. If not, loke for asuretie, that God wilbe mercifull vnto thee. If thou hast a pleasure to reuenge, then muste GOD do likewise vnto thee. And yet thou canst reuenge and hurt for a time, but gods reuenging and wrath, which thou procurest by thy folishe and impotent wrath, hath no end. And this reuengynge of thine hath no iust cause. For all power of reuengyng belongeth to God and not to thee. And thou mayst be sure, that if thou resigne thy right of reuenginge to god, and preuentest him not through thy hastie wrath, then he wil reuenge and punishe it muche more greuouslye, then thou woldest desire.</p>
               <p>But howe it goeth with them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are so desirous to reuenge, may wel be perceaued, if men wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider but this, how synne is punished by him. For they that are geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wrath &amp; desire of vengeance, are so fare out of Charitie through ire, that at last they cease from saying of the Lords prayer.

Then wheras they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded therin to pray vnto god for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuinge of their trespaces, as they forgeue other that trespace against them.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not obtaine forgeuenes of their owne trespaces, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they forgeue other, that then they shall neuer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne it. Wherfore lest they shoulde by this meanes geue iudgement, to their owne damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they neuer say that prayer. And what thynge maye we thyncke that the deuil can deuise more greuously and cruellye against a man:<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> than to brynge hym in suche case by wrath and anger, that he dare not pray?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:1416:505"/>And what shal a Christian man do if he can not pray?

For why should ye not geue that to Cesar, whiche ye your selfe saye, that it is his. This could none otherwise be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, that they had receaued Cesar to be their Lord, ruler, and gouernour.

shold not take that awaye from Cesar, that was Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars in dede, euen by the confession of them, that put forth the question. And this is the cause of this gospel, a moste wise and prudent stratageme, or a politique subtilitie or subtile policie of warre, wherby he casteth his aduersaries into that snare, which they had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him. Their desier was to snarle him in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. For they thought, that Christ durste neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme nor denie the matter.

               <p>In this historie two thinges are dilgently to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

We gladly complaine, when we are oppressed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thincke that we haue wrong done vs. And it is true, if we consider the state of the worlde, we are many times iniured and wronged. And afterwarde we thincke, that we haue a iuste and sufficient cause to set forth our right, and to accuse the violence &amp; ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of other, so that there is no end of complaining, as here the Iewes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romains for vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their kingdom. For what iuste cause had the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains against the Iewes?

But yet there was a fault in the Iewes. For although thy neyghbour doth the wrong, yet must thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the matter more depely, and thincke on this maner: what if I haue moste greuously offended the Lorde my

For this semed very greuous to the Iewes, to be subiectes to an heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperour. They thought thus with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues: We are the people of God. The heathen know nothing of god.

For they perceaued right well that they had deserued that plague, if it had ben much greater.

But Christ teacheth the contrary, because that no manne shoulde thynke, that he wyth hys doctrine and Gospelle, taketh awaye any Ciuile ordinaunce and politique regiment. Therefore abyde in thy state. Continue in thy vocation and callynge. Geue to Cesar, that is due to Cesar: And geue to god

As concernyng thynges belongynge to thy body, to thy householde, to thy state or condition of lyfe, lette all these thynges bee subiecte to Cesar: A Christian may serue God and Cesar together. But the truthe is, the Iewes woulde neyther haue geuen to God that was due to God, nor to Cesar, that belon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged vnto Cesar.</p>
               <p>And here muste we diligently note, that as GOD geueth to Cesar his imperie and regimente perfecte, whole, and sounde.

As whenne they forbydde the trewe doctrine of the Gospell to bee taughte in theyr countreys, and punyshe theyr subiectes, whenne they receaue the Sacrament of the body and blood of <hi>CHRIST</hi> vnder bothe kyndes, accordynge to Christes institution: Agayne, whenne they enforce and by compulsion dryue men vnto Idolatrie, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippyng of images, goynge on pylgremage, inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Sainctes, byenge of the Popes pardons, Masses for soules departed, and suche other abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.

The true religion of God they forbid. They wyl not suffer their subiects to resort vnto such places, where the woorde of God is truely taughte. They forbyd bothe the bokes of holy Scripture, and also all other good and godly woorkes, that their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes shold not rede them, and so come vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of their saluation.

As though it were here thus commanded: Geue all thynges to Cesar, and to God nothyng. For in matters of religion to obeye Cesar, and not the word of God, is to set Cesar aboue God, to robbe God of all thynges, and to geue to Cesar all thynges. But so ought we not to do.<note place="margin">Sedicion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste the Magistrate neuer esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vnpuny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> God dothe not onely graunt to Cesar the obedience of his subiectes, but he also stablysheth the same with his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and defendeth the same so earnestly, that no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition agaynst the magistrate dyd euer escape vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshed, as examples bothe diuine and prophane doo euidently declare. But in the meane while God also requireth his obedience. He willeth body and goodes to be subiect to Cesar: only this he requireth, that the hearte and conscience be kept for God, that he by his worde and by his holy spirite maye gouerne there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. But whenne GOD may not thus doo, for as
<pb facs="tcp:1416:515"/>
muche as Cesar contrarye to ryghte, chalengeth also that is none of his, euen to bee Lorde of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that menne should haue no other opinion of religion, then it pleaseth hym, and not as God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in hys worde: the ende of this violence, tyranny, and wyckednes can not be good. For God by no mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes canne abyde, that hys kyngdome shoulde bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, or that his worshyppynge and seruice, which he hath commaunded in hys worde, shoulde be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshed.

               <p>Therefore this is woorthy here to be remembred, that Christe hath appoynted certayne lymittes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde the whyche Cesars power ought not to go, namely, that he rule in hys courte, and that he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not wyth Gods kyngdome. Geue to Cesar saieth he, the thynges that belonge to Cesar. As though he shoulde say: That whyche is Gods, and not Cesars, looke ye geue it not to Cesar, leste ye fall away from me, and obeye Cesar to muche, whyche peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wyll rewarde you for a tyme: but notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge whosoeuer shall thus disobeye me, eyther for feare, or for fauoure, eyther for rewarde or otherwise he shall surely suffer the paynes of hell fyre.

               <p>But a Godly and lawfull magistrate knowethe, that hee is appoynted of GOD for the healthe and preseruation of hys subiectes, and not to oppresse and to destroye them, whyche Christe also declarethe by thys, in that he maketh a difference betwene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye priuate mannes goodes and possessions, and betwene that whyche is dewe to Cesar, or to the Magistrate. The temporall ruler therefore doothe not hys office, whenne thorough hys pollynge and pyllyng, he dryueth hys subiectes vnto slauerye and beggery.

Marke in his Gospell dothe testifie.</p>
               <p>And this also is diligently to be noted, that Christe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1416:517"/>
not haue thys miracle of healyng the woman, kepte secrete, but he demaundeth, who touched hym? The Apostles also thought, that it was a matter almoste worthy to be laughed at, that Christ shoulde aske this question, who touched hym, seyng there was so great a thro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of people about him on euery side. But Christ felt that, which they knew not.<note place="margin">How the wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man touched Christe.</note> For there was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the touchyng of handes, but also of heart, and of a certayn and sure faithe, confidence and trust in Christ whiche was the cause that so great power wente out of Christ, so that he hym selfe perceyued it. And Christ would not haue that touchyng hyd, yea and that for our sake. By askynge the question, who touched him he vrged, and as it were enforced the woman to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>foorth, and to declare openly al thyngs before so many as were presente, what hadde chanced, that he myghte haue an occasion to commende thys womans Faith. For this is the moste acceptable and hyghest honoure, that we can geue vnto Christ, euen to beleue in him and to looke for all good thynges at hys hande. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prayseth the womanne, and speaketh vnto her moste curteously, sayenge: Be of good confort daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter: Thy Faithe hath made thee whole. Go in peace, and be whole frome thy disease. And here now must the disciples needes confesse, that it was not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, that Christ asked, who touched hym? Agayn, that it was no common touchynge, but some notable and excellent thynge, seynge that Christe so greately co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth the woman, &amp; calleth her daughter, ye &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so maketh her whole, with no small praise of her faith.</p>
               <p>But this is a meruailous sayeng of Christ, yf wee wyll weygh the matter aryghte. He confessethe that power proceded from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when the woman co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
<pb facs="tcp:1416:518"/>
the matter openly before hym, he doothe not impute it to hym selfe, but to the fayth of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that so greate vertue and power goeth frome hym, when notwithstandyng thys healthe proceded not frome the womanne, but frome Christe. But Christ doothe this to thys ende, that hee maye shewe vnto vs, how greatly this thyng pleaseth hym, when the Faythe is suche, as moste certainely hopeth and looketh for health and helpe of hym alone. As though he shoulde saye: onely prouide thys, that ye may bee well endewed with Faythe, in what soeuer daunger ye bee. For my mynde is muche more ready to helpe, then your desyre is to craue it. I doo much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyly delyuer you from death, then ye desyre lyfe. This to bee true, Christe declareth it plainely in this place, seyng that he so bothe liberally and gladly suffreth ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue and power to procede from him in healpynge this woman.</p>
               <p>Therfore we ought to learne by this example, that in all peryls and daungers we shold set our Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon Christ,<note place="margin">From christ alone muste we looke for all healpe, in oure aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> and looke for all healpe at his hande onely. But what doo we? We heare this at sermons in the temples: we are put in remembrance therof at home, neyther doo wee wante his miracles at thys daye: yet canne not our Faithe be excited and stirred vp to beleue hym. Menne wyll not beleue, tyll they haue great abundance of all necessarye thynges. As long as we are in healthe, we hope and beleue well, of the helpe of God. But if pouertie and sycknesses ones come, we haue no Faithe at all. We lament, we crye, we complayne, as though there were no healpe to be had neither in heauen, nor in earth, although we heare dayly both in sermons and otherwise, that God
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1416:518"/>
wil haue mercy on vs for Christes sake, and deliuer vs from all euill, if we flee vnto hym with strong Faithe, and doubt nothyng of his mercifull promise made vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to vs in the blood of Christ. But how doth this agre with the womans act? whiche peraduenture ones or twise had heard of Christe, and of his myracles, and yet commeth she with so stoute and strong faith vnto Christ, that if Christ had ben in the highest part of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">The force of faythe.</note> this Faith would haue brast thorowe all thynges yea and haue brought Christ downe into the earth for to haue holpen her. For as we haue oftentymes sayd: God can not there deny helpe, where he is truely and with a right faith sought and called vpon.</p>
               <p>Wherfore we are (alas for sorowe) to muche wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whiche hauyng the worde of God so playnly, yet suffer not our faith therby to be excited, stirred vp and confirmed. But all the faulte of this matter is in the diuell, and in oure corrupte and wycked fleshe. For if thys were not, we shoulde neuer be so vntowarde to beleue, that Christ would helpe vs in all our neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities and combraunces, were they neuer so great and many. For as it is sayde, Faythe can not deceaue vs. Therefore Christ dooth here ascribe it to Faithe, that he made thys woman whole. Thy Fayth (sayeth he) hathe made thee whole: Go in peace, &amp; be thou whole from thy disease. So lykewise shall faithe in Christe rayse vp from death vnto lyfe, vanquyshe the deuyll, destroye synne, and bryng euerlastyng saluation. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>CHRIST</hi> doothe suche woorkes, yet are they the works of Fayth: for without faith such wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes are not wrought, as ye know, that neither Christ nor the sacramentes, nor the word of God profite any thyng without Faith. Faith muste doo all thynges,

                     </gap>4.</note> For what soeuer is not of Faith, is synne. And thus much of the first miracle.</p>
               <p>The second miracle is of the rulers daughter, that was dead. Luke recordeth, that thys mayde was so olde in yeres,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 8.</note> as the woman was diseased of the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy issue, that is to saye, she was .xij. yeres olde: for so long had the woman be troubled with her sycknesse. All thynges were prepared for the funerall The min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strelles, whyche by theyr syngyng and playinge (as the maner of that people was) gaue tokens of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryall, were there present. There was a great noyse of them that wept, &amp; cried, as the maner is in preparation for so noble a buriall. In the meane season, the Father of the mayde, when all thynges were paste hope (for what hope can there bee, when lyfe is gone out of the body?) maketh haste vnto Christe, nothyng doubting, but if Christe were present, the mayde myght easylye be restored vnto her lyfe. For so declare his wordes: He fell downe at the feete of Iesus (sayth the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, and sayd: My daughter is dead: I pray thee, come, and lay thy hand vpon her, that she may be safe and lyue. For although Marke and Luke saye, that he came to Iesus, when hys daughter laye a dyenge, yet they also declare, that before Christe came to the rulers house, the mayde had geuen vp the Ghost, and notwithstandyng they signifie, that the father dydde not caste awaye his Faithe, but surely beleeued, that <hi>CHRIST</hi> woulde restore vnto her bothe lyfe and healthe. Who hathe euer sene or hearde of suche meruaylous people? A woman whyche in no place of the worlde coulde fynde healpe, conceaued suche a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1416:519"/>
fayth, hope, truste, and confidence in Christ, that if she might but touche the hemme of his garment, she should be healed. And this her persuasion was not so farre out of the waye, but that as she beleued, so came it to passe in very dede. In like maner the maides fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when his daughter was dead, was certeinly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, that if Christe did but laye his hande vpon the dead mayd, she should receaue her lyfe againe. It is easie to be beleued, that a man by his hande may rayse vp one that is fallen a sleape: But to rayse vp one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, no hande, no diligence, no paine taking, no noise &amp;c. Is able to do it. Would not reason thus thincke? But the ruler thought not so: for if he had, he would haue tarried at home, and neuer haue taken that iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vnto Christ but he surely beleued, that Christ both was able and also wold restore his dead daughter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life. And here may we see, how acceptable &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faith is to Christ, which faith notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reason &amp; the worlde iudgeth plaine folishnes. For although Christ was occupied about necessary busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; was in disputation with the disciples of Iohn, yet all these things set a part, when he perceaued this faith of the ruler, he turneth vnto him, foloweth him, &amp; satisfieth his desire according to his faith: in somuch that when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth into the house, &amp; seeth all things prepared for the burial fearinge lest that present sight shold tourne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers minde, &amp; that the example and incredulitie of the men that were there present, should cause him to fall from his faith, he straightwayes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fathers faith bydding him to be of good cheare, and not to feare, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth also the people, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were present, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany the corps vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burial, for to depart &amp; to go
<pb facs="tcp:1416:520"/>
out of the house, where the dead maid lay. As though he should say: what haue ye to do here? Do ye thincke to cary out the dead? ye are deceaued, ye muste seke a dead corps in an other place. Here is none for you. This maide onely sleapeth. But they laughed him to scorne, knowing right wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she was dead. But Christ affirmeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she is not dead, so that now this only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he proue his sentence to be true be shewing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she lyueth. And amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g al that were there present, ther was none of that minde with Christ, but the father of the mayde, &amp; Christ was content therwith, so that for him, that is to say, for his faith sake, he worcketh this miracle and sheweth euidently, that the mayd liueth. If it had not bene for the fathers faith, the mayd had neuer reuiued, nor had lyfe again before the great day of the generall resurrection, but had remained styl not in sleape, but in death: so noble a thing before God is faith, which loketh for health and helpe at the hande of Christ only. Therfore Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto the mayde, taketh her by the hand, and by the power of his worde he calleth her again vnto lyfe: and streightwayes the mayde rose vp, euen as though she had bene waken out of a swete sleape. We ought to note diligently these wordes, that Christe sayeth here: The mayde is not deade, but she sleapeth. For they are wordes right wel worthie to be remembred, yea and if it were possible, all that we haue, were to be geuen, so that we might kepe, vnderstand, and beleue these wordes, euen so as Christ meaneth. For he that knew this, when he beholdeth a dead corps of a man, he wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider and right wel vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the man is not dead, but slea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth. He that could so chaunge his iudgement, that he woulde counte him that is dead to be but as one a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1416:520"/>
sleape: he might worthely reioyce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath learned a most excellent art. But this we learne by experience both in our selfes and in other, that the more any man excelleth in reason, the lesse doth he beleue this,<note place="margin">Reason can not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the maste<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reis of god.</note> and the more laughe it to scorne as a drousie dreame and mere madnes, as it appeareth here, when they deride the Lorde Christ, and laugh him to scorne, and thincke on this maner: what, will this felow rayse vp dead folke vnto life? Is it not to be thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is madde? But so goeth the worlde: So high is the wisedome of God, that reason cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth it plaine folishnes. For thinck this with thy selfe: yf thy child were dead, &amp; I should saye to the: He is not dead, but sleapeth onely, and he maye be waken and raysed vp from his sleape wyth this litle finger of mine: woldest thou not take it for a plaine mocke, and a plaine laughing to scorne of thy calamitie and mishappe? Euen so Christ in this place is in like maner handled, that is to saye, laughed to scorne, and taken for a foole.</p>
               <p>Wherfore learne thou this of this gospel, that death before Christ is but a sleape, as likewise sicknes before him is health, as we see here: He rayseth vp the dead mayde with his finger, as one that weare a slepe. The woman was deseased, but when she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ones vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, she is diseased no more. So likewise of other. The blynd, when they come to hym, receaue their sight, synners are iustified: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> condemned are saued, so wonderfully can he deale with vs, &amp; farre otherwise then either reason can ymagine, or beleue. This mayd before all men is dead. But before mine eyes, sayeth Christ, she lyueth, and only slepeth. Dauid before his owne, and before all mens eyes is a shepehearde and keper of shepe, but before me he is a Kyng.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1416:521"/>All ye that beleue in me, before your selues are sinners, but before me ye are holy and as the Angels of God. For I do no more but speake the word, and sin, death, disease, &amp;c. streightwayes geueth place, and in their steade commeth righteousnes, lyfe, health, &amp;c. As I speake the worde, so must the matter be.</p>
               <p>Therfore god in this place speaketh so maruelous a worde, &amp; so against all reason after the iudgement of the worlde, when he saith of the maide, that she is not dead. If he had sayd only, she sleapeth: me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue said according to the comon prouerbe, yea she sleapeth S. Michaels sleape, which continueth till the daye of iudgement. But he sayeth expresly: she is not dead, other saye: Surely she is not aliue. It is true before their eyes, but before Christ she liueth: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this to be true, he rayseth her vp only with his finger, as one child vseth to rayse vp an other, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is a sleape. To be short all these things tend to this ende, that we should not consyder our mishappes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the iudgement of reason,<note place="margin">with Christen eies must wee consider all thinges.</note> but with Christen eyes &amp; after the sentence of faith. For the Christen eyes are suche, that when they loke vpon synne, hel &amp; death: they saye. I see not death: I fele no sinne: I perceaue no damnation: but I see thorow Christ lyfe, holines, &amp; saluation, In lyke maner when I am poore, I feele no pouertie, but I perceaue that I haue ynough euen to the vttermost. For I haue Christ, which in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is able to geue vnto me, whatsoeuer I haue nede of, although I haue nothing presently. He that coulde get suche eyes, he might truly glorie of the Christen eyes, &amp; he should farre otherwise iudge of thinges in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of dearth, pestilence, &amp;c. Then the world vseth to iudge. All men behold &amp; loke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the present abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1416:521"/>
and as the store is, so is their hope concerning the life. If there be muche, then are they of good confort. If there be but lytle: Then they despaire. So lykewise whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the plague is, they that are able, prouide for them selues by fleing,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and thinke they may be sure in other places. But a Christian man althoughe he be neuer so greatly diseased and infected with the plague shall notwithstanding thinke thus: I haue Christ: If it so please hym, this disease can not hurt me. And vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, yf we had suche faythe, what so euer aduersitie came, it shoulde neuer trouble vs, but we shoulde be without all feare, yea mery and quiet. But when we beleue not, neyther haue suche eyes, but beholde all thinges with carnall eyes: herof cometh vnto vs so greate feare and tremblyng, that we thincke that the vengeaunce of god will fall vpon vs out of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, and that we by no meanes can auoyde it.</p>

But the eyes of the Christians see those thinges, which they see not, &amp; only heare in the worde, as here Christ and the father do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the dead mayd.

This word must be beleued that it is true: and although I fele &amp; see the contrary, yet is there no credit to be geuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. In like maner when thou seest a Christen man dyinge, thy eyes beholde the dead man, but thou must shutte and close vp those eyes, and open suche eyes as beholde the word, and so shalt thou see that the man is not dead, but that he lyueth before god. For the word of Christ is:<note place="margin">

                  </note> He that beleueth in me, shal neuer se death. And this must we learne of this gospell, that all that is before our eyes, be it neuer so plaine &amp; euident, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so wide and open. Yet is it nothing. For if death in a Christian is to be reputed and taken for nothyng: Uerely blindnes, deafnes, leprosie, pestilence, and other diseases are to be counted lesse then nothinge. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when pouertie, sicknes, syn, &amp;c. offer them selues to thy eyes, be not therfore troubled, but shut thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eyes, and open thy Christen eyes, and saye: I am a Christian and haue a Lord. Whiche is able to rule all these thinges with a worde. Why then should I vexe my selfe? For this is certein: loke how easely Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth this mayd from corporal death: euen so easely also wil he deliuer vs, if we only beleue, &amp; haue a sure hope to be relieued and holpen by him. For this also must we consider here, that this mayd was not resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to life by her owne faith. For he that is dead, bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not no more then he seeth or heareth, but her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1416:522"/>
beleueth and this his faith is so mightie, that the maide receaueth life again. Again. For as Christ saith: All thinges are possible to him that beleueth.</p>
               <p>So mightie is faith. Be the matter neuer so great, if thou canst beleue, and haue sure hope in Christ, thou shalt neuer be deceaued of thy desire, neither shall the deuill or death be able to preuaile any thyng at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, as both these miracles testifie, whiche are set forth to vs for this purpose, and the faith both of the woman and of the dead maydes father commended of Christ, that he might prouoke vs also to beleue, and that we shold otherwise beholde creatures before god, and otherwise before vs. Therfore although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our selues we be poore and dead, subiecte to syn, and afflicted with pouertie, pestilence, or any other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases yet must we beleue, that it is otherwise before god, &amp; boldly say on this maner: Although pouertie, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, sin, death, do now trouble me, yet this as a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian I know, that there is no pouertie, no pestilence, no sinne no death at hand. For before Christ al thinges are wealth, health, righteousnes &amp; life. And althoughe I see not this presently, yet if the worde should come, I should see it with these my carnall eyes. And this is true, and by no meanes to be doubted of. God graunt vs for his son Iesu Christes sake our alon Sauiour and redemer thorow the holy ghost, such eyes, as may behold all calamities and mishappes otherwise, then the worlde beholdeth them, and kepe suche conforte &amp; light vnto the ende, that in this worlde we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue ioye and pleasure and in the worlde to come euerlasting lyfe.

He that wil be ryche, all to sone, hath an euyll eye, and consydereth not, that pouertie shall come vpon hym.</p>
               <p>Here we see, by this testimonie of Salomon, that the blessyng of GOD is graunted to the faythefulle manne: but contrarywyse, to hym that is vnfayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and couetous, pouertie and the curse of GOD is threatened, accordynge to our common prouerbe: Haste maketh waste. Agayn: Soone rype, soone rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: Lette vs not therfore thorough infidelitie make

to muche haste vniustly to be ryche, but lette vs paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and with a faithfull mynde looke for all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thynges at the hande of God: and so vndou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly shall all thynges succede and come to passe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to our desyre.</p>
               <p>But yf we truste not God, nor cast all our care v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym, but walke in infidelitie and vnrightousnes: then shall we not onely labour in vayne, but also tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe our incredulitie, wee shall prouoke the whotte wrathe, fierse anger, and the vnquenchable displeasure of almyghty God against vs. For God is most highly offended, when we beleue not his promises, but doubt of his fatherly care and bounteous liberalitie toward vs, whiche he hath confirmed, declared &amp; shewed with so many signes tokens and miracles. Therfore Christ in a certayne place of the Gospell dyd vpbrayd his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by theyr incredulitie and vnbelefe, sayeng: Why take ye thought,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 8.</note> because ye haue no bread? Perceaue ye not yet, neyther doo ye vnderstande? Haue ye your heartes yet blynded? Haue ye eyes, and see not? And haue ye eares and heare not? Doo ye not remembre, when I brake fyue loaues among fyue thousand men howe many baskets full of broken meate toke ye vp? They sayde vnto hym, twelue. When I brake seuen loaues among foure thousande: Howe many baskets of the leauynges of the broken meat toke ye vp? They sayd seuen. And he sayd vnto them: How happeneth it then, that ye do not vnderstande? Here may we see howe greatly the slownesse and vnbeliefe of the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples greued Christ, and how sharply he reproued them that by this meanes he myght heale and redresse their infirmitie. If we also wyll not caste away our vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, surely we shal worthyly deserue the wrath of god

and moste greuous punyshement. Therefore blessed Paule dothe dehorte and dissuade vs from increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or vnbelefe, saying: Let vs not tempt Christe, as some of them tempted hym,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> and were slain of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes: neyther murmure ye, as some of them murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and were destroyed of the destroyer. The apostle in this place very wittily fraieth vs away from incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie by the example of other, that is to saie, the old Israelites. It is a faire thing to beware by an other mans madnes. Hitherto pertaineth an other exaum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wherin we reade, that a certayn noble man was troden downe of the people euen vnto deathe, because he woulde not beleue the promise of Helizeus the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg...</hi>
                  </note> whiche he prophecied concerning the deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce frome famyn to be at hande. This present fact threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth also to the vnfaithfull the vengeaunce of GOD whiche shall fall vppon them that beleue not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse of God. Therfore that we may not so wretched<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly peryshe with them: let vs caste the care of our lyfe on God, beleue his promyse, and loke for all good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at his mercyfull hand.</p>
               <p>Ye haue heard (derely beloued) howe Christe euen of his owne free wyl was moued with fatherly pitie and tender compassion towarde the people, whyche folowed hym, to heare his doctrine, and to se his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and howe miraculously and meruailously hee fedde so great a multitude in the wyldernes, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we shoulde haue a sure argumente and an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble token of his fatherly care towarde vs, and so com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mytte our lyfe vnto hym. Ueryly this so ready care and goodnes of Christ toward the people, oughte of ryght to moue vs, that we shold geue ouer our selues wholly vnto hym. This requireth of vs also the fyrst com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.
<pb facs="tcp:1416:530"/>
And that we should thus doo, we are prouoked with many and noble promyses of GOD, which he hath also confirmed with so many noble and notable miracles. To ende, yf we worshyppe GOD with a true faith, and caste all the care of our lyfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym: thenne vndoubtedly wyll God geue vs all thynges that we haue neede of for the sustentation of this present lyfe, and delyuer vs from a greate multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of cares, wherwith the heartes of the vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are continually mooste myserably vexed and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. For there is no surer nor more easy waye to get richesse, then to truste in God, and with a faithful and constant mynde to looke for his blessynge, and to hope for to receyue of hym all thynges, wherof soeuer we haue nede. If we will not thus doo, then thorow our incredulitie shall we deserue the wrathe of GOD and haue our porcion with the Idolaters and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in that lake, that burneth with fyre and brym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.
