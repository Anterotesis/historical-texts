         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Being requested lately by my
kinde Frends, the Wardens of the
Worshipfull Companie of Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
to assist them in their Visitation of the
free Schole at <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> founded long since
by that worthy Knight, of blessed memorie,
Sir <hi>Andrew Iudde,</hi> your Grand-father, and
committed to the charge and ouer-sight of that
well-deseruing Society; I made choise of such a
portion of Scripture there to entreat of, as
<pb facs="tcp:3037:3"/>
seemed not altogither vnfitting an occasion of
that kinde. After the handling whereof, being
then presently solicited by some, and since
further importuned by others, to make these my
weake labors more publike, as not vnlikely (so
they deemed) to doe some further good; I was
at length drawne, regarding more their opinion,
then mine owne conceipt thereof, as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be but a tumultuary worke, amids many
distractions hastily peiced togither; and to giue
them satisfaction therein, that seemed so desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of it; to let it goe abroad, and make tryall
what benefit either Teacher, or Scholler, or
other might make of it. This resolued on, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to bethinke my selfe, obseruing the vsuall
manner of the times, whom I should make
choise of for the patronizing of it. In all respects
none seemed so fit as your Selfe, whom I haue
therefore made bold to addresse it vnto. The
Schole was first erected and endowed by your
Worships Ancestor. And you haue worthily
built vpon his foundation, and added liberally
to his gift. So that through your munificence it
is very likely to flourish, and not to come behind
some of those that be of cheife note. Your bounty
herein, and in other works of the like nature, is
<pb facs="tcp:3037:3"/>
the rather to be regarded; for that you do not,
(as the manner is of the most, vnwilling to part
with ought, till they must needs leaue all;) defer
wholy your well-doing to your deaths-bed, or
your dying day; but bend your selfe thereunto,
while you may yet surviving your owne dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
your selfe see things setled in a due course,
and receiue comfort by view of the fruit and
benefit that may therby redound both to Church
and Common-weale. And certainly, to omit,

the seruice and worship of God; God
thereby intimating what Parents &amp; others should

Heathen and Infidels, or meere Ciuill and naturall

their Children, to forbeare and abhorre lying, and
stealing, and loosenes of life, and surfeting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
and the like; because such things may make

not Heathen euen the same? As the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
