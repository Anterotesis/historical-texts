            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eerely belo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved Young-men, that this Sermon (in effect) was preached by mee, among you, you know, and the occaſion you know too When I preachd it, it cam to your eares, &amp; it wrought ſomething in ſome of your eyes, but I little thought
<pb facs="tcp:23670:3"/>
to have preſented it to your eyes againe. Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities from abroad, and at home, have preſſed mee to make this adventure. And now it is come, to whom ſhould it come, but unto you? It is true, my love to that dead Young-man, made me willing to ſatisfie his deſire: and your deſires to have it, have not made mee willing thus to ſend it unto you. Yet your courſes being the occaſion of it, and your welfare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of it; you may juſtly chalenge it, and ſhall not by mee bee robbed of your right. Who knowes whether God may leave a bleſſing behind? I cannot bee aſſured, that, for the
<pb facs="tcp:23670:3"/>
word of God handled in it, or for me the poore inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is uſed in it, ye will make much uſe of it for your good; becauſe (I feare) ye ſo often prefer an ale-houſe before the houſe of God. It may be, ye had rather be without it, than have it; becauſe the ſight of it, to you, will be a ſting; the ſight of it, to others, will bee but a remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to them, to call upon you ſtill to forſake thoſe courſes which ye love. Yet herein have I hope, that you will love to ſee the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of him being dead, whom yee loved and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as your Doctor while he lived. If it be not drawne to life, my eyes,
<pb facs="tcp:23670:4"/>
eares, and underſtanding much faile me, beſides, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witneſſes will not faile to ſay, that all is true. I am ſure, it is ſo for ſubſtance: and if it be coloured other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, even at the firſt it was rudely drawne, it is for your ſakes, that you may ſtill ſee him the more perfectly, and know your owne eſtate.</p>
                  <p>You have had (in your daies) many examples, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that there is no bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to be had in a wicked way; it is folly to lay out your ſilver, and not for bread. But to have two in one yeere, layes the axe to the root of the trees of the Wood, and preacheth, that except ye amend, <hi>yee ſhall

likewiſe periſh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Not onely as they but worſe.</note> Yee have ſeene two Apothecaries different in their courſe. The one ſo many wayes looking home-ward,<note place="margin">So he was accounted of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us ſome years before he dyed.</note> that he <hi>died miſerably rich</hi>; the other ſo laſhing outward, that hee dyed miſerably poore.

The other, as if hee would prevent
<pb facs="tcp:23670:5"/>
Chriſt, condemning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to hell for ever, and ever. The one (being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich, and having no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) was preſſed by me, <hi>while hee was in peace, and before his laſt Will was ſettled,</hi> of his thouſands to give but one hundred pounds, for the repairing of the Church, or other pious workes. But if hee were worth ten thouſand (as he ſaid) he would not give a penny, beſide what he had given by will; that is, twenty Marks to the poor, ten pounds to me, and ſome other petty Legacies.<note place="margin">I meane an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable death, not judging his eternall eſtate.</note> If I were rich, I ſhould be loth <hi>to pay ſo deare</hi> for ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall, as he did in the end, full of horror to the laſt.
<pb facs="tcp:23670:5"/>
The other (being very poore) was preſſed by me againe and againe, <hi>but to beleeve in Chriſt for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But I could not (for ought I ſaw) prevaile nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The one had lived well, except his miſery: the other had lived ill, and ſo in miſery worſe. I know you feare not the danger of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he firſt example: for you are out of the way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too rich. If you have enough to goe like gallant Blades, it is all you deſire: yet if you have not, your credite muſt bee good till the quarter day, or the good market comes. But may you not feare the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the ſecond? Him ye loved enough, his courſes
<pb facs="tcp:23670:6"/>
yee love too well. The Ale-houſe muſt bee your Chappell, Kitchin, Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe: the firſt draught is your prayer, the next your breakfaſt, and the laſt your worke. Yet if ye had but a Prieſt that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Wine and ſtrong drinke, and ſay, Come let us fill our ſelves with Wine and ſtrong drinke, to morrow ſhall be as this d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y, and much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant, hee were the only man, and you the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people of the world I know you think yourſelv's very familiar with Chriſt, as if hee would paſſe by theſe ſlips of youth, and imbrace you in the armes of his mercy upon the leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:23670:6"/>
call. But you forget that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath now taken ſtate upon him. He was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant crying in the Cratch, and then he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by wicked Prieſts, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by an Aſſe into Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Hee was a Preacher in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and then he was preſſed upon by all, and ſought to be intangled by his enemies. Hee was a worker of miracles here, and then ſicke ſoules and bodies troubled him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was under arreſts and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then <hi>Iudas</hi> did kiſſe, Souldiers buffeted and ſpit upon him, and <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> killed him. But now the caſe is altered, his preſent ſtate admits no ſuch neere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
<pb facs="tcp:23670:7"/>
Will you ſay hee is my ſweet Saviour ſtill? Go then and tell him ſo: ſay; Lord, I am idle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and luxurio<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

He hath redeemd you that ye might ſerve him in righteouſneſſe and holines all the daies of your life. He hath bought you with a price, that yee
<pb facs="tcp:23670:7"/>
might glorifie God in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule, and (by the grace of God) ſave your ſelves from the midſt of this wicked generation wherein ye live. Perhaps you may think your ſinnes not to be ſo great, but that you may keep your fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the ſalvation of Chriſt too. But they are not worthy of pitty who wilfully deceive their own ſoules: For in foure caſes your leaſt ſins prove dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the iſſue. If they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
be committed againſt your conſciences. Conſcience is in Gods roome to guard you, and if that be affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is given to God, and ſo you build downeward to hell. Then if they bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:23670:8"/>
committed with pleaſure and delight; there is no ſin ſo ſmall, which ſmels not unſavorily if it pleaſeth. It pleaſed the man to gather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſticks, and he died for it. It pleaſed <hi>Lots</hi> Wife to look backe, and ſhe was turned into a pillar of Salt. Next, if ſmall ſins diſpoſe you to greater. For he that hath avoided the great Rockes, may be ſwallow'd up in the ſand: and he that can keep out great Theeves, may have his houſe opened by a little Boy who creeps in at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the window. Laſtly, if the ſmalleſt ſinnes have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, and go on. A little ball of ſnow, rowled, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and many drops make a floud. Can you ſay
<pb facs="tcp:23670:8"/>
that you ſin not when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience checks, and ſaith, Doe it not? Or that you have not taken pleaſure in what you have done? Or that you have not bin diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed by your houres of error, to ſcandalize others, and neglect God and his worſhip? Or that your lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſins have not multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo long, as that they may (for any thing you are ſure to the contrary) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Ocean to drowne your ſoules in eternall hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? What now is to bee done, but that you ſee your wickedneſſe, and amend all? I am ſure it would bring comfort to your friends, to ſee you in the way to Heaven. I am more
<pb facs="tcp:23670:9"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>In this ſtate he ſtood one, or two yeares, or more. At laſt, as one cloathed with the ſcales of a Leviathan, hee kicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prickes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all admonitions (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which cuſtome in ſinne had now armed him) he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forſooke the Church, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Prayers, Word, Sacraments. Thus hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued about a yeare and three quarters. In this ſpace (as I could ſlide into his company,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23670:16"/>
or as he fell into mine) I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed him ſtill, wiſhed him to beware leſt the juſt ſentence of GOD went not out againſt him, <hi>that he ſhould never ſee</hi> GODS <hi>face in the congregation more:</hi> I told him that he truſted his flatterers and drunken companions, more than mee, who loved his ſoule: and yet withall, that I would proceed againſt him by Articles and Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which would end in excommunication, which was a forerunner of GODS ſhutting him out of Heaven, without his willing and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Repentance. He anſwered mildly ſtill, <hi>that hee would come to the Church, receive the Sacrament, and change his courſe.</hi> He gave mee day, and day, and day, and yet his place was empty. Vpon ſome of the promiſed dayes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, I ſent ſecretly to

his houſe, to call upon him to be as good as his word: he would make ſome idle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or other, and ſo ſtill perſiſted. At the length, the Church Officers preſented him for his neglect of the Church, and Sacrament, an whole yeare. Halfe a yeare after they preſented him againe, for his neglect a yeare and a halfe. In this time I ſtill told him what was done, which yet (ſaid I) ſhall eaſily be taken off with an admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, if you will reforme. Hee ſtill mildly promiſed amendment. At laſt, aſcited he was to anſwer; and hee knew that I had perſonally appeared againſt him to the Iudge of the ſpirituall Court: for I told him ſo, (as I remember;) and that it would not bee ſo eaſie for him to get off without mee. Hereupon he was more hearty
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23670:17"/>
(as I thought) to come to the houſe of GOD againe, and he ſet his utmoſt day,<note place="margin">Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſeday. 1635.</note> and yet hee failed. At my inſtance, and fearing the dreadfull ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of excommunication, which now (after his many ſhifts) was thundering out upon him, hee peremptorily ſet another day, which was the LORDS-Day ſeven-night after, and a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Day. Then he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to come to the Church, and to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to give ſatisfaction to the Pariſh and Court, and in the meane time to prepare himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The Lords-Day before this, in the morning, when (as he ſaid) hee was ready to come to the Church, hee was taken ſicke, and betooke himſelfe to his bed. It was but as the fit of an Ague, which being over hee was the next morning
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23670:18"/>
in his old courſe againe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the weeke after the meſſenger of death came, and I heard of it. I forthwith addreſſed my ſelfe to him, came up into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber unawares, and ſaid, <hi>Oh, how often have you deceived God, your owne ſoule, and mee! what is now to bee done? I feare you will die, and then what will become of you? I expect your excommunication, and then you will bee cut off from the Church of</hi> GOD <hi>by Iustice, which you have cut your ſelfe from by wantonneſſe.</hi> Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, hee had but a ſurfet of cold: and, if I would be pleaſed but to write to the Court, to ſuſpend the ſending forth of his excommunication till the Court day following, he would the next Lords-Day come to the Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, and then goe up with my Certificate,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23670:18"/>
and ſatisfie the Court. I did it, and prevailed: but his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe prevailed that Thurſday, Friday, and Saturday upon him. It had emptied him of hope of life: and no hope of life had filled him with thoughts of this preſent guilt, and future judgement before that great God who is a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, you,<note place="margin">And next his owne apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon it.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ground of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of his owne miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſhall ſee how hee opened it, and made it knowne both to me and others. There was too great a fire within to bee ſmothered: it burned in his owne ſoule, and lightned from his heart and lippes, into the eares, and hearts, of thoſe friends that were about him.</p>
                  <p>One while he cries out of his ſinnes,<note place="margin">Manifeſted by many fearefull ſpeeches.</note> I have beene a fearefull drunkard, <hi>powring in one draught after another,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23670:19"/>
till one draught could not keepe downe another:</hi> and now I would be glad if I could take the leaſt of GODS Creatures which I have abuſed. <hi>I have neglected my Patients, who have put their lives into my hands, and how many ſoules have I thus murthered?</hi> I have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglected Gods Houſe, ſervice, and worſhip, and now though I have purpoſed, God <hi>ſtrikes me thus, before the day of my promiſe comes; becauſe I am unworthy to come among Gods people againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another while hee falls to wiſhing, <hi>O that I might burne along time in that fire, (poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the fire before him,) ſo I might not burne in Hell</hi>! Oh that GOD would grant me to live but one yeare, or but a moneth, that the world might ſee with what an heart I have promiſed to GOD my amendment! Oh that GOD
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23670:19"/>
would try me a little! but I am unworthy.</p>
                  <p>Another while he plyes his companions, praying that all may be warned by him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their wicked wayes, leſt they goe to hell as he muſt do. He forgat not his ſervant who was young: He calls him to him, tells him that he had bin a wicked maſter to him: but be warned by me. You have a friend that hath an Iron fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace which burnes hot, a long time: <hi>but if you give your ſelfe to my ſinnes, you ſhall be burned in the furnace of Hell, an hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter furnace, millions of milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ages.</hi> Therefore looke to your ſelfe, and be warned by my (your Maſters) exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who muſt bee burned in hell for ever.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, all his cryes againſt ſinne (to his ſee<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing) would not ſufficiently ſet forth his eſtate, nor all his wiſhes,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23670:20"/>
nor all his warning of others: but he comes to a plaine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">And plaine judgments againſt himſelfe.</note> and condemnation, and leaves nothing for after times, but execution. Hence againe and againe hee doubles it; <hi>I have had a little pleaſure, and now I muſt goe to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell for ever.</hi> And having ſometimes (being preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by others) prayed to God that hee would forgive his ſinnes, and have mercy upon him: hee would adde, <hi>but I know GOD will not doe it, I muſt goe to Hell for evermore</hi> Whatſoever came betweene whiles, this was the cloſe, <hi>I muſt bee burned in Hell, I muſt to the furnace of Hell, millions of millions of ages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus hee fearefully wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed out the moſt part of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, both day and night. Early on the Lords-day (that day appointed) I went to him againe. I found him deepely
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23670:20"/>
mudded in horrour and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. I asked him then whether ſome great ſinne (not yet thought of) did not lye behind, to hinder the beames of Gods ſweet grace from ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon him? And becauſe he was ſuſpected of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and uſing cruell meanes for the covering of it, I layed it befor him, and asked him in the ſight of GOD, and his owne Conſcience now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were not guilty? He conſtantly denyed it both to mee, and three godly friends before, ſeverally: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I heartily believe him to be not guilty: eſpecially hee conſtantly profeſſing it when his Conſcience was moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and nimble. I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan againe to offer unto him the comforts of the Goſpell. I opened to him the promiſes of the largeſt ſize. I ſhewed him <hi>that</hi> GOD <hi>was delighted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23670:21"/>
to ſave ſoules, and not to deſtroy them: and that his ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were without exception of time, place, perſon, or ſin,</hi> except that againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which I aſſured him, was not committed by him.</p>
                  <p>All this could not faſten (ſo farre as I ſaw) I could heare nothing but <hi>that it is too late, I muſt be burned in Hell.</hi> Yet then was hee willing that I ſhould pray for him, (and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was not without hope,) and I did. In which hee was carefull to goe along with mee many times with ſighs.

                  <p>Sometimes GOD gives an example of his juſtice which begins here,<note place="margin">And how they ſhould from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral waies of Gods ſhewing Iuſtice.</note> and continues for ever and ever: as in many of the drowned firſt world, and roaſted Sodomites. God never made mee ſo skilfull in his Throne buſineſſe, as to define peremptorily, that every ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and infant of thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ones were caſt into the bottomeleſſe hell. Hee onely ſayes that the floud did ſweepe them away, and they were burned with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and there leaves us to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23670:58"/>
leave the reſt to GOD. They were not in the Arke indeed, nor was <hi>Iob</hi> in the viſible Church, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarchs were, yet might the <hi>All-eye</hi> looke upon them as he pleaſed, and judge, or ſpare.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God gives an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his juſtice which dies here, and (for ought wee know) may end in glory. Thus we are ſaid <hi>to bee judged that wee might not bee condemned by the world.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.32.</note> No man will judge <hi>Ioſiah</hi> or <hi>Ionathan</hi> for their untimely deaths. They died in peace, though they died in warre; in peace with God, in warre with men. Nor will they reſolvedly reprobate the ſoules of <hi>Er,</hi> and <hi>Onan, Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> or their likes. Their ſins were great, and grievous, yea dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and therefore GOD brought fearefull judgements upon them: and as hee hath
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:23670:58"/>
ſaid, ſo hath hee done,<note place="margin">Pſal. 55.23.</note> 
                     <hi>bloudy and deceitfull men ſhall not live out halfe their dayes.</hi> But for their ſoules, and how farre his juſtice extended to them, is among the ſecrets of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and paſt our cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance. It is an old leſſon never to bee forgotten,<note place="margin">Deut. 29.29</note> 
                     <hi>That ſecret things belong to the Lord our God, but thoſe things that are revealed, to us, and to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is all this to our examples in this Warning-peece?<note place="margin">The Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the uſe of examples to this War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-peece.</note> If you apply it aright you ſhall know how to uſe them to your good. Bee ſure therefore to ſee Gods hand in both, and his anger againſt ſin in both; without that, ſuch judgings could not ordinarily come into the world. Bee ſure alſo not to extend GODS ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice further than what you ſee or heare. Thus farre God hath gone, goe you no further. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                  <p>Indeed you ſee or heare that one of them had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched and wicked life. God ſaw it, and thruſt him downe to the gates of hell, and ſo he did fearefully judge him in this world. Yet withall hee had ſuch remorſe, confeſſion, ſelfe condemnation, deſire of others good, and of his owne (<hi>though with deſpaire,</hi>) that God hath given us reaſons of charity to his ſoule, and kept the rule of certainty to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe onely. Notwithſtanding, let no man of ſuch a courſe preſume; God comes as a ſwift witneſſe againſt ſuch, and will make his ſword drunke with their bloud.<note place="margin">Pſal. 68 21.</note> For <hi>hee will wound the hairy ſcalpe of every one

that goes on ſtill in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee alſo, or heare, that the other of them had a great deale better life. It is true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that (thus much being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed) hee cloſed too long and too much with the world, as all that knew him well, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. He was alſo unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to a pariſh who had beene loving to a poore father of his (in a free gift of a good main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from them,) when hee would not bee perſwaded (<hi>both befor the ſetling of any Will, and before the ſetling of his laſt</hi>) to give a poore pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance out of his great eſtate to that loving Pariſh for pious uſes, hee having no children of his owne. God ſaw this too, and whipt him to the purpoſe, before hee went hence and was no more ſeene.</p>
                  <p>Would not GOD have an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious world ſee how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary

it is to <hi>breake off a wicked life by Repentance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 4.27.</note> and how uſefull to <hi>honour GOD with our riches?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 3.9.</note> It would make a good mans heart to bleed, that the world ſhould have a ſecond floud of ſinne by ſome, and that, by others, pious and publike workes ſhould bee neglected, oppoſed and grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at, as if mens riches were their owne, and they might doe with them what they liſt, as if they were gods. Shall private perſons and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires (<hi>not worth a dunghill to the buſineſſes of</hi> GOD) bee the onely object of bounty and munificence? If in ſuch a caſe GOD withdraw his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and frowne, is it not worthy our notice? Let God bee GOD, and doe his owne worke, in ſparing their ſoules for ever as hee pleaſeth: yet let him ſhew us examples too of what wee ought to doe, or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:23670:60"/>
what wee ſhall ſuffer. For if wee doe not amend (for ought I know) he may, and will doe according to our patternes, take away our comforts here, and our comforts for ever and ever, which is infinitely more:</p>
                  <p>I ſhut up all in a word. Looke upon your examples and feare and tremble.

Yet look upon them ſo, as you leave not Charitie behinde. Yee may have hope to conceive well of them (<hi>who were judged in this world,</hi>) becauſe yee knew not their hearts.

in accuſing others to juſtifie your ſelves too farre. Neither of theſe can doe well in the day of your account, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may bee comfortable unto you in the day of our LORD IESUS CHRIST.</p>
