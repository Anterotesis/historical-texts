            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>At length arrived with great joy,</l>
               <l>to mighty <hi>Carthage</hi> walls was brought;</l>
               <l>Where <hi>Dido</hi> Queen, with ſumptuous feaſt,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>And then anon this worthy Knight,</l>

               <l>Of his unhappy ten years wars</l>
               <l>ſo true a tale began to tell;</l>
               <l>With words ſo ſweet, and ſighs ſo deep,</l>

               <l>That where he ſat the place was wet,</l>
               <l>as if he had ſeen thoſe wars again:</l>
               <l>So that the Queen with truth therefore,</l>

               <l>The darkſome night apace grew on,</l>
               <l>and twinkling ſtars i'th' sky was ſpread,</l>
               <l>And he his doleful tale had told,</l>
               <l>as every one lay in their bed,</l>
               <l>Where they full ſweetly took their reſt,</l>

               <l>As one unhappy always kept,</l>
               <l>unto the wall ſhe made her moan,</l>
               <l>That ſhe ſhould ſtill deſire in vain,</l>
               <l>The thing that ſhe could not obtain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And thus in grief ſhe ſpent the night,</l>
               <l>till twinkling ſtars from skies were fled,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Phoebus</hi> with his glimering beams</l>
               <l>through miſty clouds appeared red:</l>
               <l>Then tydings came to her anon,</l>
               <l>That all the Trojan ſhips were gone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And then the Queen with bloody knife,</l>
               <l>did arm her heart as hard as ſtone,</l>
               <l>Yet ſomewhat loath to loſe her life,</l>
               <l>in woful caſe ſhe made her moan;</l>
               <l>And rouling on her careful bed,</l>
               <l>With ſighs and ſobs theſe words ſhe ſaid,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O wretched <hi>Dido,</hi> Queen! <hi>quoth ſhe,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I ſee thy end approacheth near;</l>
               <l>For he is gone away from thee,</l>
               <l>whom thou didſt love and hold ſo dear:</l>
               <l>Is he then gone, and paſſed by?</l>
               <l>O heart, prepare thy ſelf to dye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Though reaſon would thou ſhouldſt forbear,</l>
               <l>to ſtop thy hand from bloody ſtroak;</l>
               <l>Yet fancy ſaid thou ſhoulſt not fear,</l>
               <l>who fettered thee in <hi>Cupid</hi>'s yoak.</l>
               <l>Come Death, <hi>quoth ſhe,</hi> and end the ſmart;</l>
               <l>And with theſe words ſhe pierc'd her heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When Death had pierc'd the tender heart</l>
               <l>of <hi>Dido,</hi> Carthagenian Queen,</l>
               <l>And bloody knife did end the ſmart,</l>
               <l>which ſhe ſuſtain'd in woful teen:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eneas</hi> being ſhipt and gone,</l>
               <l>Whoſe flattery cauſed all her moan.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Her funeral moſt coſtly made,</l>
               <l>and all things finiſht mournfully,</l>
               <l>Her body fine in mould was laid,</l>
               <l>where it conſumed ſpeedily;</l>
               <l>Her Siſter's tears her tomb beſtrew'd,</l>
               <l>Her Subjects grief their kindneſs ſhew'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then was <hi>Aeneas</hi> in an Iſle</l>
               <l>in <hi>Greece,</hi> where he liv'd long ſpace;</l>
               <l>Whereas her Siſter in ſhort time</l>
               <l>writ to him to his foul diſgrace;</l>
               <l>In phraſe of letter to her mind,</l>
               <l>She told him plain he was unkind:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Falſe-hearted Wretch, <hi>quoth ſhe,</hi> thou art,</l>
               <l>and treacherouſly thou haſt betray'd</l>
               <l>Vnto thy lure a gentle Heart,</l>
               <l>which unto thee ſuch welcome made:</l>
               <l>My Siſter dear, and <hi>Carthage</hi> Joy,</l>
               <l>Whoſe folly wrought her dire annoy.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet on her death-bed when ſhe lay,</l>
               <l>ſhe prayed for thy proſperity,</l>
               <l>Beſeeching God, that every day</l>
               <l>might breed thee great felicity.</l>
               <l>Thus by thy means I loſt a Friend;</l>
               <l>Heavens ſend thee untimely end.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When he theſe lines, full fraught with gaull,</l>
               <l>peruſed had, and weigh'd them right,</l>
               <l>His lofty courage then did fall,</l>
               <l>and ſtraight appeared in his ſight</l>
               <l>Queen <hi>Dido</hi>'s Ghoſt, both grim and pale,</l>
               <l>Which made this valiant Soldier quail.</l>
