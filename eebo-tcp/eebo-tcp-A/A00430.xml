         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

then that great King your father, the nurſ-father of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
Who I ſay, more fit for this great buſineſſe then Hee, as
well for his eminent dignitie, power, credite and authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Chriſtian Princes of the Weſt, as alſo for the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
which he hath in the managing of the like affaires, hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already well nigh pacified thoſe diuiſions, which the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

had brought into the Church of England; vnto the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
he hath alſo moſt happily reduced the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
to be conioyned and re-vnited both in diſcipline, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies;
that he may attainne to that marke which he aimes
at, that is, a holy and ſtrict vnion, as well in the religion, as in
the ſtate of all the people and Countries vnder his obedience?
Who I ſay, can with more hope of good ſucceſſe vndertake ſo
excellent a peece of worke, then he, whom the heauens haue
ſo richly endowed with ſuch rare qualities, as I haue ſayed, and
other perfections truely heroique, and admirable! And you my
renowned Lord, after him, and with him for to ſecond him in
ſuch a goodly and honourable enterpriſe, ſeeing that already
by reaſon of the generoſity of your ſpirit, the happy education
of your youth, the imitation of ſo rare an example, and that at
home, and of your owne Father: and aboue all the reſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the bountie and courage of your nature; you are the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
hope of great Britane, and make men expect great and
mighty deſſeignes at your hands, and ſuch ſhal be profitable to
all Chriſtendome: and (if it pleaſe God) to be one day a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
inſtrument to tame theſe damnable Monſters of wicked
factions and pernitious ſects, which haue almoſt made a ſpoile
of the body of Chriſt his Church; yet not ſo much doubtleſſe
through the diuerſity of beleefes in the matter of faith, which
is the ſoule and eſſence of religion (for the which we are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to praiſe God) As for the differences of Eccleſiaſticall rytes
and ceremonies, whereof your highneſſe ſhall ſee here a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
or plat-forme, eſtabliſhed only to ſhew to the world, that
in the three other Clymates, yea euen among the blind Pagans
and impious Mahometiſts, the name of the Sonne of God is
<pb facs="tcp:1878:3"/>
knowne and called vpon, if not with ſo much puritie, yet ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with more pietie (although that their doctrine is not ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly
expounded) then amongſt vs: and ſhall be more and more
(God willing) toward the end of the world, according to the
Propheticall and Euangelicall promiſes; and in the iſſue to
conuince and confound thoſe which doe empale and encloſe
the Church of Ieſus Chriſt, within the circuite of their walles,
or within the limits of one Prouince, or elſe within the regions
of thoſe people, who hold one ſelfe ſame opinion, and are obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to one chiefe or head aboue all other. Ieſus Chriſt is
the grand Soueraigne, and vniuerſal Patriarch of al his Church:
and the holy Ghoſt ſaith, that it neither hath, nor ſhall haue
any other bounds or limits, then the whole compaſſe of the
round world: and which is more, that it ſhall haue his preſence
and aſſiſtance for euer; although (for the ingratitude of men)
not at all times, nor in all places with like glorie, and efficacie.
The Sunne neuer ceaſeth to ſhine vpon the earth, but not euery
day and in euery place, with the like brightneſſe. This enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
of Reconciliation (my gratious Lord) hath been attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
not once or twice, but often in ages paſt, as well by calling
of Councells, as by publicke conferences; as for example, that
with the Donatiſts, through the mediation of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> at
Carthage, where the end was happie enough, and might in
ſome ſort ſerue for a paterne in the differences of this age; as
alſo the conference at Ratisbon, vnder the authority of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Charles</hi> the fift, for Germanie: and for Fraunce that
at Poiſi in the raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth.</p>
            <p>And beſides theſe publicke meetings and conferences, there
haue beene found learned, iudicious and moderate men, not a
a few from time to time, who bearing a great zeale to the
peace of the Church, haue opened and ſhewed certaine meanes
and wayes, euery one according to his knowledge and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
But theſe diſcoueries of the trueth, haue found no place
in the hearts of them that were lead with paſſion; but will (by
all poſſibilitie) bring foorth better fruit hereafter in their due
ſeaſon; that is to ſay. When as God being firſt ouercomeby
<pb facs="tcp:1878:4"/>
our Repentance, Cries and Prayers, ſhall cauſe that lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Schiſme to ceaſe, being one of the greateſt Plagues that
euer happned or could happen among Chriſtians. Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhal ſee by marking that which I haue here compiled out
of them and their writings, how the difficultie of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
for a great part of our controuerſies, whether it be with
the Eaſt or South Churches, or between our ſelues of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne
Churches, lies not ſo much in the things themſelues
which fall in queſtion, as in the peruerſe opinion of the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants:
and that thoſe things wherein we agree, are a thouſand
times of more importance, to the glorie of God, and our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then thoſe things wherein we varie and diſagree; and
ſhall haue farre more reaſon to loue vs for thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we agree, then for to hate and perſecute vs cruelly for thoſe
things, which remaine as yet to be auoided from among vs:
yea ſeeing the greater part of our diſputations, happen for
want of vnderſtanding the ſtate of the controuerſies in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
or els by reaſon of our termes and faſhion of ſpeaking:
but farre more for want of conceiuing the true ſenſe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture; which alſo ſome great men of our time haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
manifeſtly, in certain points of doctrine, which were iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
irreconcileable: wherein was manifeſted Gods iuſtice againſt
our ſinnes of preſumption, curioſity, vaine-glory, enuie, auarice
and ambition. I ſay the more, becauſe Princes and Soueraigne
Magiſtrates ſhould beare ſole authority, and by their abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
commaundement ſhould teſtifie their good will therein,
and employ the prudent aduiſe of their Eccleſiaſticall ſubiects,
not the wiſeſt onely, but the beſt and godlieſt alſo, not ſo much
to diſpute and winne the victory, as to conferre, and amiably
to agree: The God of peace will giue the fruit of peace, to his
glory and our good. But I know not by what Inchantment or
deſtinie, Kings for the moſt part know not their forces, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
do diſpoyle themſelues of a greate part of their owne
Authoritie, and many times perceiue it too late. As for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
many doe know and ſee the euill, but doe perſwade
themſelues, that the remedie is moſt dangerous of all: or elſe
<pb facs="tcp:1878:4"/>
for feare, will not bee ſingular in opinion, be it neuer ſo good,
louing rather to ſuffer themſelues to bee caried away with the
torrent and ſtreame of diuiſion, and to be of the common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
that they may the better follow their priuate affaires. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one doth bragge and vaunt himſelfe of his faith, but few
or none will practiſe charitie, and what is faith without chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
more then a tree without fruite? or a body without a ſoule?
I haue beene here emboldened to addreſſe my ſelfe to your
Highneſſe, for the reaſons aboue ſaid; and to the end that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the luſtre of your name, this little Treatiſe, written onely
for the publike vtilitie, might be the more fauourably receiued
and reſpected of all men, eſpecially of the ſubiects of the kings
Maieſtie your father; amongſt whom are more learned Diuines
well practiſed in the art of diſputation, in the reading of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and in all the Hiſtories of the Church, then (peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
in three or foure other as great Countries. Their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
doe teſtifie it, inſomuch that wee doe admire thereat in
theſe parts; and the Engliſh Liturgie gathered according to
the modell of the Auncients, the pureſt of them; in the which
through the aduiſe of ſo many excellent men in learning and
pietie, Engliſh men and others, hath beene reſerued for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Antiquitie, all which might be left with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
Alſo it is very likely that it ſhall endure perpetually,
and ſerue for a patterne or example for thoſe which are not
as yet reformed: The praiſe whereof (next vnto God) ſhall be
to the good and wiſe Kings of Great Britane; the Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
whereof haue receiued and embraced with the firſt, the
faith of Ieſus Chriſt, and not with the laſt, the Reformation
which was neceſſary in the Church: The principal cauſe truely,
or rather the only cauſe of this long peace &amp; proſperity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God hath bleſſed the Kingdomes of your Iland, beſides
many benedictions wherewith he hath fauoured your Royall
houſe, and your Highneſſe in particular, who haue after his
Maieſtie the firſt place in age, in valour, and dignitie, and who
for the gratious reſpect which naturally you doe ſhew vnto all
<pb facs="tcp:1878:5"/>
men, which through any merite or ſeruice doe ſeeke the honor
of your fauour, will mooue you (I am aſſured) to receiue

him through his power: And in like maner the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Grecians by the permiſſion of GOD, and
the Aſtronomers of Perſia and of Greece, did foretell
of him. The ſecond, becauſe the holy Scriptures is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
conformable to our Faith; for that thoſe which
did write them, had all one teacher; to wit, the grace of
God: for if the ſame had not beene, they had differed
and varied in ſome point. The third, becauſe that

with great care, among all nations, and in great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
And not onely the fooliſh, but alſo the wiſe and
prudent:<note place="margin">The Sybils.</note> and all Diabolicke deceit was perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed

faith contayneth nothing that is impoſſible, and which
diſagreeth with it ſelfe: and that there is no corporall
thing therein, but rather ſpirituall, and it is the way
which leadeth the ſoule to the loue of God, and to the

according to the loue of Chriſt, haue receiued
great gifts of God, and haue wrought many miracles:
the which could not haue beene done, had not the faith

The ſeuenth, becauſe that the Kings of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme
Countries, haue made Warres againſt this faith
with infinite power and cruelties during many ages,
and haue profited nothing at all, but rather the faith
hath preuailed ſo well, inſomuch that it doth perſiſt

that which is neceſſarie to ſaluation. As for ceremonies or
curious Queſtions, it matters not, if euery one of them doeth
make, or beleeue that which ſeemeth him beſt: That which is
worſt of all, is the diuiſion, which proceedeth of zeale, but with

to read diuers authors, eſpecially the Greeke and Latin, Thoſe
alſo that ſearch diſcourſes garniſhed and painted out, with
all ſorts of flowers and coulers, ſhall not bee here ſatisfied.
This ſubiect cannot permit any rhetoricall ſentences, and
the faſhion of the Treatiſe is farre wide from it, here is

but a Collection of diuerſe paſſages, Coppies and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

The breuity is, to the end that the ſimplicity ſhould

both to the matter and argument: In like manner
becauſe that which is moſt plainely ſpoken, ſhould haue leſt
ſuſpicion and be more intelligible. I doe not doubt that this

inquired whether we doe obay all that which the Pope
commaunded vs; I anſwered him, that we doe, and
that we were obliged therunto, by the Article of our
holy faith, which confeſſeth one holy Catholicke
Church. Whereupon hee replied, that if the Pope
would vſurpe ſo great prerogatiue, as to vſe towards
them an vnlawfull commaundement, they would not
make any reckoning of it: And if by ſuch meanes their

                  <p>This opinion of the Romane Church, is ſo particular,

                  <p>Neuertheles this is the ground &amp; foundation of the others.
For when one makes profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie

To wit, whether to the holy Scripture, expounded by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

erre, in the things which he pronounceth in the quality of
the head thereof, although that one whole Councell was of a
contrary opinion: But the councel of Baſil (wherin was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

Catholicke Romane Doctors doe mainetaine it in their
writings: <hi>Concilium eſſe ſupra Pontificem</hi> (ſaith Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine)

Panormitanus, Cardinalis Florentinus, Abulenſis.</hi>
Moreouer it is the voice of the people, that it be ſo, and if one
doe aske a Romaine Catholicke wherefore he belieueth; or
doth ſuch and ſuch things, he anſwereth preſently, that the
Church hath ſo ordained it. In ſaying ſo hee confeſſeth that
the Soueraigntie belongs to the Church. For were not that a
haynous crime ſo to obſcure the Maieſtie of a Monarch, as
to ſay that the Eſtates doe make Lawes and Edicts? And it is
manifeſt that the Romane Catholickes, in ſoe doing, doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the Pope and the Church of Rome of errour, to the

                  <p>
                     <hi>SAint Peter</hi> ought to be conſidered foure manner of
wayes: firſt, in the quality of an Apoſtle, ſent by God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1878:16"/>
as ſuch a one that had no ſucceſſor. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
place as an Apoſtle ſimply, hauing charge to plant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Churches: in ſuch manner S. <hi>Marke</hi> and other Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes
(their Subſtitutes, which alſo are called Apoſtles) were
his Succeſſors. In the third place, as a Biſhoppe and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in euery Church, where he was: that is to ſay, in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,
Rome, Ieruſalem: as <hi>Euodias</hi> did ſucceede him in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,
<hi>Clement</hi> in Rome, S. <hi>Iames</hi> the Apoſtle, and S. <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in Ieruſalem. Fourthly, S. <hi>Peter</hi> is to be conſidered as
Primate in the Catholike Church: in ſuch manner S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Apoſtle (entirely beloued of the Lord) ſucceeded him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
hauing out-liued S. <hi>Peter</hi> fiue and twenty, or thirty yeares:
Moreouer, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was preferred before all the Biſhops
of the world, is apparent by that, that he was taken for one of
the three pillers of the Church, and was one of the twelue
foundations, vpon which the ordinarie Biſhoppes of cities
were conſtituted. And withall, Tradition confirmeth this:
for there is no Church in the world which nameth not the
Apoſtles before the Biſhops: yea the Church of Rome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
the Apoſtles before the Popes. It remaineth then
for vs to ſearch, who was the ſucceſſor of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Primacy, whether <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was his ſucceſſor in
Epheſus, or <hi>Simeon</hi> ſucceſſor to S. <hi>Peter</hi> in Ieruſalem, or
<hi>Albinus</hi> of Alexandria ſucceſſor of S. <hi>Marke,</hi> ſucceſſor and
choſen of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſucceſſor of <hi>Euodias,</hi> and of
S. <hi>Peter</hi> in Antioch: or <hi>Euariſtus</hi> ſucceſſor of <hi>Clement,</hi>
and of <hi>Linus,</hi> and of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in Rome.</p>
                  <p>There are two Churches which haue contended herein,
more then eight hundred yeeres, that is to ſay, that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,
and that of Rome. The Romane Church ſaith,
that S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath ordained, is from God, that Rome ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1878:16"/>
haue the Primacie and power to command, and that for euer.
They of Conſtantinople ſay on the contrarie ſide, that our
Lord neuer ſpoke any ſuch words, much leſſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
himſelf, and if any ſuch thing had been, ſome one of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
would haue written of it, this Article being the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all the doctrine, and gouernement of the Church.
Moreouer Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe would haue Preached the
ſame, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> who ſucceeded and out-liued S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
would not haue ſtayed in Epheſus. Well then, you ſee that all
the Churches planted by the Apoſtles not excepting any one,
doe teſtifie after many ages, that neither they, nor their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
neuer beleeued nor held, that the Primacie by diuine
power, was due to the Church of Rome, but rather that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth
to whoſoeuer ſhall bee choſen and elected by the
greater part of the Churches: and that the Biſhop of Rome
alone ought not to be q beleeued, much leſſe in his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
cauſe. In like maner many learned men of the Latine
Church doe confeſſe, that the reaſon wherefore Rome is helde
to haue the Primacie in diuine affaires, is an opinion of
the vulgar ſort. So that rather to Conſtantinople appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the Primacie, ſeeing it was giuen her by the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
Churches, which they gaue not then to Rome, being one
of the laſt ſeates of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> but onely in regard of the
Imperiall ſeate. Well then, to make this the more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
it is neceſſarie to know how it happeneth, that the Citie
of Rome now a dayes, pretendeth that the Primacie is due to
her by diuine right. The aboue mentioned Apoſtolicke Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
doe ſurmiſe, as followeth, and ſay.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had the firſt place among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
for he was oftentimes demanded many things by the
Lord, and he anſwered in the name of his fellowes, ouer
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1878:17"/>
whom neuertheleſſe he had no iuriſdiction nor authority:
although that ſome doe thinke, that he reſigned it to Saint
<hi>Iames,</hi> when they were together at Hieruſalem: after that
S. <hi>Iames</hi> was inſtituted Biſhoppe, that is to ſay, after that hee
was ſtaied, that hee ſhould make his ordinarie reſidence
there.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> during his life, after the time
of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> had the firſt place amongſt all the Euangeliſts and
Biſhoppes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he neuer taught that Rome by Diuine right,
ought to be the Miſtreſſe of the other Churches: if he had,
S. <hi>Polycarpus</hi> his Diſciple, and others his ſucceſſors in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus
had not debated ſo earneſtly and obſtinately againſt
the Roman Church touching the feaſt of Eaſter.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that after S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Biſhop of Rome obtained
by iust title, the firſt place among the Biſhops which were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Romane Empire: for ſeeing that the Citizens of
Rome then raigned ouer the Inhabitants of other Cities: hee
had been both proud, audacious and vnreaſonable, which
would haue preferred himſelfe before their Biſhop, eſpecially
without any ordinance of a Councell.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that the churches of <hi>Italy,</hi> and other their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
through the laps of time gaue to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
not only the firſt place, but alſo the ſuperintendancie ouer the
Biſhops neare them, in particular, for to giue his aduice in
matters that happened, till a Synode might be had.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, that the councell of <hi>Nice</hi> approued the ſame, and
ordained that <hi>Alexandria</hi>
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria was the greateſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Empire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rome. <hi>Ioſeph. l. 4. c. 42.</hi>
                     </note> ſhould in like manner, haue the

                     <hi>Antioch</hi> ſhould ouer-ſee thoſe of the eaſt. And
after a certaine time, becauſe the Emperiall ſeate was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1878:17"/>
vnto Conſtantinople, it was ordained that that Biſhop
ſhould be ouer-ſeer of the Greeke Churches, and the Biſhop
of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhould be admitted to be one of the fiue, for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina:
and thoſe fiue were called Patriarches.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> all this while had the
firſt ſeat, but yet without any vniuerſall iuriſdiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
rather euery one of the foreſaid fiue Patriarches, iudged or

that they call themſelues <hi>Oecumenicke</hi>) are ſubiect to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes,
but yet of Greece onely.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, that <hi>Maurice</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
would haue taken away the primacie from<note n="u" place="margin">The Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians doe call him Gregorie Dialoger.</note>

who for a Marke of his place, deſired to haue the
Title of a generall<note n="y" place="margin">Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos.</note> Biſhoppe: and that <hi>Gregorie</hi> did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
himſelfe againſt him, leaſt he ſhould looſe his place, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
how inſolent that Title was, and ſaying, that <hi>Iohn</hi>
would vſurpe Dominion ouer the other Biſhops, (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
was not the intention of <hi>Iohn:</hi>) but he on the
contrary ſide, to ſhew that he was contented with the ranke or
place of his predeceſſors, called himſelfe <hi>Seruus ſeruorum
Dei.</hi> The ſeruant of the ſeruants of God.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, that <hi>Phocas</hi> hauing ſlaine <hi>Maurice</hi> gaue to
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (which was then <hi>Boniface</hi>) the firſt
ſeate and Title of Generall or Vniuerſall Biſhop, and yet
without any iuriſdiction or Dominion ouer the other patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches:
which notwithſtanding, the churches acknowledged
him not in that quality.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, that <hi>Charles</hi> the great, King of <hi>France,</hi> hauing
ſubdued with armes a great part of <hi>Europe:</hi> The citie of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1878:18"/>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> craued his ayde againſt the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who being
ouer come by the ſame King, the <hi>Romanes</hi> proclaimed him
their Emperour.</p>
                  <p>11 That then the Emperors of the Eaſt with the conſent
of the Patriarchall and Apoſtolicke Churches tooke from
<hi>Rome</hi> the primacy, and gaue it to the ſaid Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12 That then the Romanes ſeeing that by the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
law they ſhould looſe the primacie, began to ſay that
the primacy belonged as of Diuine right to them, and to their
Biſhop: and conſequently, that the whole Church together
could not take away from them the firſt ranke, becauſe that
<hi>Rome</hi> is the Sea of <hi>S. Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13 That after that they of the Eaſt had rightly ſaid,
that hee is ſucceſſor of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> which is elected, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and approued by the greateſt part of the Churches, in
what place ſoeuer he maketh his reſidence, and that imitateth
<hi>S. Peter</hi> in doctrine and humilitie. That the Biſhoppes of
<hi>Rome</hi> haue brought into their church many errours, and
haue innouated many things without and againſt the decrees
of the councels, withall they haue added to the Symbole of
<hi>Nice</hi> of their priuate authority, that the holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from the Sonne, euen as from the Father. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that the vniuerſall councell hath giuen the firſt
ſeate to the biſhoppe of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet did not they beleeue that
the church in future time could not take from him this
place: eſpecially if the church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould fall into any
errour, as they ſay ſhe is already fallen.</p>
                  <p>14 That in the meane while the prouinces of the Empire
of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, to wit, <hi>Fraunce, Italy, Germanie</hi> and
<hi>Spaine</hi> remained vnder the biſhoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> as being
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1878:18"/>
their neareſt Patriark, which is the reaſon that they now go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to perſwade men, that the Primacie appertaineth vnto
him by Gods Law, but this ſhould bee no preiudice to other
Churches, nor to the trueth.</p>
                  <p>15. That the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> enriched with the gifts
and Donations of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and per aduenture
beleeuing themſelues to be that which was repated of them,
haue ouerthrowne both Spirituall and Temporall Monarkes,
and haue cauſed to bee receiued, in places vnder obedience to
them, as well the Lawes of their predeceſſors the Popes, made
by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo thoſe Lawes which they
themſelues from time to time doe adde thereunto, in ſomuch
that the Churches of the Eaſt, South, and North, with good
reaſon haue oppoſed themſelues againſt theſe enterpriſes.
The confeſsion and beliefe of the Apoſtolicke Churches about
this Queſtion here in controuerſie, is this.</p>
                  <p>That the firſt ſeate (which is by diuine Law, ſo farr as
is neceſſarie for the order of Councels, and is meete to
ſhew<note n="z" place="margin">S. Cypr. de ſimpl. cl.</note> vnitie) is by the Eccleſiaſticall Law, as alſo the

and notwithſtanding the <hi>Anathemes</hi> and inforcements of

that the Pope gaue him the Empire of the Weſt, which is moſt

willingly yeelded themſelues vnto him. If hee ſubmitted
himſelfe to the Pope, it was of curteſie and deuotion, and not
of any duetie. As for the Chriſtians of the Eaſt they haue
beene called <hi>Melchites,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Royaliſts</hi> or<note n="l" place="margin">Melech a King.</note> 
                     <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts,</hi>
becauſe that they haue neuer acknowledged none, no

In like manner the Chriſtians of <hi>Affrica</hi> are alſo
<hi>Melchites.</hi> The auncient Catholike Church was <hi>Melchite</hi>
more then ſeuen hundred yeares: for there was neuer any
Councell where the Emperour had not the higheſt place, or
that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> yeelded not their due obedience. The

                  </p>
                  <p>Likewiſe in the eſtate of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> an eſtate ordained

the high Prieſt vnder Emperours and Kings, are Royaliſts
and Emperialiſts, in like manner in our time the reformed
Chriſtians haue called thoſe of the contrary opinion <hi>Papiſts:</hi>
as who would ſay, ſubiects of a Prieſt, for in Greeke, <hi>Papa</hi>
ſignifieth a Prieſt: a name neuertheleſſe which doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong but to thoſe that beleeue, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath
power to iudge and depoſe Kings. By this which hath bene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
a man may ſee that the Imperialiſts are Catholikely
ſpread through the foure quarters of the world, and that
their beliefe in this point hath bene from the beginning:
therefore he that is a <hi>Melchite,</hi> is a <hi>Catholike:</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
holdeth a contrary opinion is an Hereticke. It is this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1878:28"/>
hereſie, that keepeth the kingdome of <hi>Nauarre</hi> vnder the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> yoke. It is this hereſie that brought that frowning

her great and inuincible <hi>Melech</hi> ſeconded by faithfull <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites,</hi>
otherwiſe called Polititians, had not preſerued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
her, with the grace and aſsiſtance of him, which is the
onely giuer and tranſlater of Monarchies. It is this Hereſie
that the moſt Puiſſant and mightie King of Great <hi>Britaine,</hi>
indeuoreth to quench &amp; aboliſh in the hearts of his ſubiects,
a hereſie which for a while lyeth hid vnder aſhes, but mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

Euery one may here ſee, that the moſt part of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

                  <p>

                  <p>FIrſt, the Romane Catholickes (eſpecially) when they would
ſerue their turnes with the ſayings of the Fathers againſt
the Proteſtants, doe not diſtinguiſh the doctrine of faith,
from Eccleſiaſticall policie, which the Grecians call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
The Proteſtants doe beleeue that all matters of
<hi>Faith</hi> may bee ſufficiently taken out of the holy Scripture:
And that, that which belongs to <hi>Policie, Ceremonie,</hi> and
<hi>Circumſtances,</hi> hath bene let go by Tradition not written;
ſuch Tradition which may bee changed by the Catholicke
Church, that is to ſay, by the mutuall conſent &amp; good will of all
Chriſtian people; in like manner by the particular Churches,
vnder the conſent and good liking of the Catholicke Church.
In ſum, that the Scripture is the rule of the faith of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Church, as the Catholicke Church is the rule of the
members thereof, in that which concernes Policie or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the foreſaid <hi>Maior</hi> is deceiued in ſaying, that
the Scripture prohibiteth not, to ordaine women Preſts: the
prohibition is in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 11.</note> as for the orders or inferiour
offices of Prieſthood,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 34.</note> they are of meere Policie. And as
touching the ſoueraigntie of the Biſhop or Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> it
is certaine that the Scripture maketh no mention of it, alſo
Tradition of the Catholicke Churches doth contradict it. It
is obiected that the Scripture maketh no mention of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
virginitie of the Mother of our Sauiour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto

Scripture, and that whereas the holy virgine is called bleſſed
among all women, if ſhe had not beene alwayes a virgine,

                     <hi>He that marrieth doth well</hi> (ſaith Saint<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 38.</note>

will reſtraine her felicity in regard that ſhee bore our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
he muſt giue an account of that reſtraint.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Cardinall of<note n="c" place="margin">Contra Tillenum.</note> Perron ſaith that the holy
Scripture is ſufficient to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe it doth ſend vs back
vnto the Church, and the Church teacheth that which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
is wanting in the Scripture: But if that were ſo, the
holy Scripture ſhould bee manifeſtly imperfect and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
for if the Scripture teacheth vs not, where is the head,
(as <hi>Maior</hi> auoucheth) how may one know by it the body of
the Church? And for to deſcant vpon the compariſon of
the ſame Cardinall, if the King ſhould ſay to one, my Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
ſhall tell you the reſt, and then many ſhould ariſe for to
ſpeake; vnto whom ſhould hee hearken? whom ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
to be the true Chauncellour? Our Sauiour neuer
ſaid, that the Church ſhould continue in <hi>Italy</hi> or in <hi>France;</hi>
and that it ſhould faile in other Countries. Moreouer, it is
certaine, that our Sauiour knew all things, yet not as a bare
man, but by participation of the heauenly wiſedome: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
he reuealed not all things to his Apoſtles. And the
Apoſtles knew things which were not lawfull for them to
declare: but they might happily declare farre more to their
Diſciples, then they haue written, to wit, many diſcourſes,
miracles, and other particularities of the life and doctrine
of the Lord, which got them a farre more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great and perfect
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1878:31"/>
knowledge in Diuinitie. Moreouer there haue beene very
many profitable things for the gouernment of the Church,
which were not written, but are come to their ſucceſſors by
Tradition. But as concerning that which is properly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to faith, and neceſſary as well for the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
as for the particulars thereof, the Catholicke Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth,

(much leſſe the <hi>Romane</hi>) cannot make newe Articles of
Faith. To affirme, that the Auncient Church knewe not

which is called the Tranſlation of the ſeuentie, or of
<hi>Ptolomeus.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, they hold it not for a certainty,
that thoſe be altogether the tranſlation of the ſeuenty, which
carry that name. It is thought that the Apoſtles did vſe
the Tranſlation of the ſaid ſeuenty, the which neuertheleſſe
was not altogether comformable with the Hebrew: but if
they haue approued it, then it followeth, that there was not
any errour, in that they haue alledged it: Moreouer the
Hebrew text is preferred before all other Tranſlations.</p>
                  <p>The Latines doe obiect, that it is not reaſonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Hebrew Bible of the Iewes. The Greekes doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,

Bible, and that they left the ſame to their ſucceſſors, from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1878:35"/>
whom thoſe of this preſent time haue receiued it from hand

it is harder to find out the Authours: Neuertheleſſe
they haue receiued ſome of the Greekes and Latines in

                  <p>That which brought moſt nouelties into the Latine

Pope would leaue ſome remembrance of faith: from
hence do proceed ſo many canonized ſaints, and faſhions to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
them, feaſts, pilgrimages, Religions, or orders of monks
and friars, and ſuch like blind deuotion, wherein the Latins
haue ſurpaſſed all people: who accuſe the foreſaid Latines of
preſumption, becauſe they would make to paſſe for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
thoſe cuſtomes which were neuer ordained by the ſeuen
vniuerſall Councels. They of the Eaſt Church require the
obſeruation of thoſe of the generall Councels, but not of any
particular. The Reformed Chriſtians doe proteſt, that they
diſpute not againſt Catholike cuſtomes,<note n="g" place="margin">Melanchton ad Lang.</note> but againſt abuſe and
ſuperſtition: or if any thing diſpleaſeth them, it is the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of ceremonies, rather then any one of them conſidered
in particular. It is true, that in reiecting thoſe that haue
beene brought onely in by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they haue
not ſpared the Catholike ceremonies.<note n="h" place="margin">De con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilijs.</note> 
                     <hi>Luther</hi> thought
that all Chriſtian nations would reforme themſelues, the one
after the other, and alſo that, that which ſeemed to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
attempt, would be corroborated and confirmed by a
Catholike approbation. Howſoeuer it be, the learned and
greateſt men amongſt them doe proteſt to ſubmit themſelues
to a generall and free Councell. The Frenchmen likewiſe
who haue of late time begun, and had leſſe means giuen them
to errect or inſtitute ſuch an eſtate and forme of Church, as is
to be ſeene in other Countries, haue neuertheleſſe proteſted
in like manner in the conference at <hi>Poiſſy,</hi> that it would be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1878:38"/>
eaſier for them to fall into accord in ceremonies, if the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in doctrine were once appeaſed. So it is, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Catholicke Gouernment doth get the ſaid <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
Chriſtians an euill opinion among other Chriſtians.
And that produceth two effects, the one, that the ſaid Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
conſidering ceremonies, but as outward ſhewes, (and
the Romane Catholickes<note n="i" place="margin">Matth. hiſtoriogr. 1. 6 diſc. 5.</note> doe confeſſe that ceremonies haue
iuſtly that name) doe condemne the cuſtomes of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
without diſcerning thoſe that are Catholike from other
more particular; or that are profitable and tollerable from
thoſe that are euill and naught. And the other ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
diſpiſed and contemned without reaſon, perſwade
themſelues that it is all one, when one reprehendeth them in
a matter concerning faith. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that ſuch cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
haue appearance of holines, in that they ſpare not the
body, and haue no regard to cloath or feede the ſame: but hee
ſaid not, that they ſhould abandon all Ceremonies, rather (ſayd
he) he that eateth doth well, and he that eateth not, doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
well: much leſſe hath he approued that one ſhould rent
aſunder, or condemne the Catholike Church.</p>
                  <p>The other effect of condemning the Catholicke Church is,
that a man cannot (now a dayes) read the writings of the
ancient Fathers, nor the Hiſtories of the Apoſtolicke Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
no not the holy Scripture it ſelfe, without finding very
many ceremonies and faſhions of ſpeaking not vſed amongſt
the Proteſtants of France: from whence it happeneth that
many doe change their beleefe, being offended at the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Councels, as it is ſeene by their writings and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations:
and on the other ſide they of the Romane Church
which doe relie too much vpon outward ceremonies, are more
and more confirmed in their opinion, preſuming that they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1878:38"/>
follow and ymitate in all things the holy Scriptures and the
Fathers: nay the moſt learned and thoſe that approue not in
all points the Romane Church, doe not thinke it in any wiſe
reaſonable to preferre the aduiſe or opinion of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and new writers, before the iudgement of auncient
Councels, in that which concernes the Policie of the Church.
Heere it is to bee marked, that the moderne Chronicles in
writing the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie, doe cauſe the readers very
often to erre. They write the names of the auncient Biſhops of
Romein Capitall letters, naming them alone, and recounting
their actes &amp; liues, &amp; they gather their lawes, ordinances, &amp;
decrees, and make no mention of the Canons which the other
Biſhops haue made in their Churches: from thence grew the
opinion, that the ſaid Biſhops of Rome were Monarchs of all
the world, as the Emperours haue bene in temporall matters
of their Empire: and that ſuch Lawes, Traditions, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
(which were but onely for the Church of Rome) were
lawes giuen to the Catholicke Church, which is not ſo. For it
hath bene but of very late yeeres, that France, Spaine, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie
and England haue receiued them, that is to ſay, three
or foure hundreth yeres ſince: as for other nations they haue
not receiued and approued the ſame as yet, but haue inuented
others. In fine the reformed Chriſtians<note n="k" place="margin">Daneus in lib. de haere.</note> ſay, that the eſtate
of the Church hath bene tollerable, during the fiue firſt ages,
and they approue not Aerius, and ſuch like, which in times
paſt troubled the Church in reiecting the Eccleſiaſticall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes:
and from thence it followeth, that the Cuſtomes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
during thoſe firſt ages, are not thoſe which haue
brought, or doe nouriſh the Schiſme in Chriſtendome, and
therefore all nations doe auowe,</p>
                  <p>That Catholicke Traditions ought to be receiued, if

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
between the Grecians and the Latins in this queſtion.</hi> The
Grecians ſay that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
only, and not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Son: which they hold, becauſe
that the truth in the Goſpel, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth wholy the
faith, ſpeaking of the proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
mention onely of the Father, and alſo that in the
principalleſt Councels which were celebrated with
them, their Symbols or Credes haue bene ſo fortified
by the <hi>Anathemaes</hi> added, that it is not lawfull for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man to teach any thing touching the Trinitie other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then is therein contained: in which Symbole or
Creede, the holy Ghoſt is fayd to proceede from the
Father, and not from the Sonne: And therfore (ſay they)
all thoſe are Anathema, that doe affirme that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from the Sonne: and a little after. Wee doe
conclude that the Grecians doe accord with the Latins
in the matter it ſelfe, although that they differ in
words.</p>
                  <p>Behold here the opinion of the Maſter of ſentences, who
to ſhew that there is no difference betweene the Greekes and
the Latins in that point, doth onely report the ſayings and
ſentences of the ancient Grecians, who ſay: that the holy
Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne. But that
hath not ſatisfied his followers, which thinke that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Gretians hold not the beleefe of the ancient: beſids ſome
of the Latin Doctors doe confeſſe, that they vnderſtand not
well the intention and meaning of the Grecians, others doe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1878:40"/>
call them Heretickes and Schiſmatikes. The reformed
Churches doe leaue this queſtion with the ſame irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We reiect</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tilenus) the errour, or as others

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>of the moderne Grecians.</hi> This
difference hath beene the cauſe, or at leaſt wiſe the pretext of
the Schiſme betwixt the East Churches and the VVeſt. The
Eaſt Churches who would tranſport the Primacie to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
pretending that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> abuſeth the
Church, doe take occaſion to accuſe the Pope vpon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
(that Pope, was <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt, by the report of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
who alledgeth<note n="r" place="margin">De Chriſto l. 2. c. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Anthoninus</hi> or <hi>Adrianus</hi> as ſome
will haue it) becauſe that he had beene ſo bolde as to adde of
his owne authoritie to the Symbole of <hi>Nice,</hi> that the holy
Ghoſt proceedeth from the ſonne: and becauſe (peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
he hath not expounded it fully, they of the Eaſt haue
accuſed the Latines of conſtituting two principles: and the
Latines laying the fault vpon them, doe impute vnto them
blaſphemie, ſaying, that they did derogate from the Diuinity
of the Sonne of God. <hi>Lombard</hi> and others ſay, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is in words, and not in the matter it ſelfe. Peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the <hi>Grecians</hi> doe denie the proceſsion of the holy Ghoſt
to be from the ſonne in one conſideration, and the Latines do
affirme it in another: for to know if it be ſo, wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to enter into very curious conſiderations of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
It is therefore neceſſary to marke, that the ſonne is
conſidered three manner of waies:</p>
                  <p>Firſt as being the Diuine eſſence, and the very ſame
eſſence with the Father: <hi>hoc ſenſu filius non ſpirat:</hi> for
the actions are of the perſons, and not of the eſſence conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
apart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1878:41"/>
Secondly, the Sonne is to be conſidered as a Sonne, and that
formally; So the Sonne produceth not the holy Ghoſt; for he
which is produced, ſo farre as hee is produced, produceth
not.</p>
                  <p>In the third place the Sonne is to be conſidered as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
and that is it which S. <hi>Auſten</hi> regarded, when he ſaide,
that the Sonne hath from the father, not onely to be ſonne,
but alſo to be, or his being: that is to ſay, to be a diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
not to be ſimply the Diuine eſſence: for the Sonne hath
the ſame of<note n="ſ" place="margin">Bellar. de Chriſto lib. 2. cap. 19.</note> himſelfe, and the perſon begetteth not the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
but the eſſence begetteth the perſon: and if the ſonne
produce not in this maner (that is to ſay) as a perſon, then the
holy Ghoſt proceedes not from the Sonne in any wiſe: for as
it hath beene ſaid, the holy Ghoſt proceeds not from the Sonn,
eyther as an eſſence, or as a Sonne.</p>
                  <p>Well then, if the Grecians ſay not that he (to wit the holy
Ghoſt) proceedeth from the eſſence of the Sonne, being ſimply
taken, neyther from the Sonne as a Sonne, the Latines ſhould
not take occaſion to condemne them, ſeeing that they ſay the
ſame.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the Grecians ſay, and that according to the
Goſpell, that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father: it
is manifeſt, that they denie not the proceſsion of the holy
Ghoſt to be from the Sonne, becauſe he proceedeth not from
him, either as an eſſence, or as a Sonne: for if that were
ſo, they ſhould denie in like manner his proceſsion to be from
the father: for the father produced not the holy Ghoſt as an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
ſimply (for the eſſence produceth not:) neither as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for if he had produced him as a father, the holy Ghoſt
ſhould be then his ſonne.</p>
                  <p>The Grecians doe hold, that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1878:41"/>
from the father in ſuch a ſort as he cannot be ſaide to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
from the ſonne. And they haue reaſon to ſay ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the holy Ghoſt is in the perſon, and from the perſon of
the Sonne, the which the father hath begotten as a ſonne: and
the father begot not a Sonne, which had not the holy Ghoſt,
and his productiue grace and fertility: Likewiſe the father
is the cauſe (the Greeke Doctors do vſe this word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) of the
holy Ghoſt, both as a perſon <hi>primo &amp; per ſe,</hi> and as a father
<hi>per filium.</hi> But the Sonne inſpireth not as a ſonne, <hi>primo
&amp; per ſe,</hi> neyther in producing another perſon, which ſhould
produce the holy Ghoſt. This obſeruation remaineth obſcure,
if it be taken without diſtinction, that the holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from the Father and from the Sonne: alſo the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
ſhould ſeeme to ſpeake more properly then the Latines.
The auncient Doctors confeſſe that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth
from the father <hi>proprie:</hi> as hee ſpeaketh more properly,
which ſaith, the King commandeth, then he that ſaith, the
King goeth: for the commandement proceedeth from the
King, as a King, but the King goeth as he is a man. If then
the Sonne be an inſpirer, the Father is the cauſe, euen as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But becauſe that the Grecians do abſolutely denie that
the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Sonne, denying thereby
that his perſon is an inſpirer: a man muſt take heede leaſt he
fall into a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: for if by the word <hi>proceede,</hi> they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
to haue his originall or beginning, they ſay not ill,
conſidering the Father alone is the beginning. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
doe confeſſe as much, when they call the Sonne <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium
quaſi Secundarium.</hi> This word <hi>Secundarium</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroieth
the name of <hi>Principium,</hi> and the word <hi>quaſi,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that it is to ſpeake improperly. Yet here one cannot
ſpeake properly enough. Therefore you may ſee that the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1878:42"/>
holy Ghoſt is ſayd to proceed from the Father alone in diuers
ſorts, the which the Churches of the Eaſt doe regard. But
they regard not the reaſons, wherefore he may be ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Sonne: as alſo it is very hard to expreſſe how
the perſon of the Sonne is an inſpirer without conſidering
him either as an <hi>eſſence</hi> ſimply, or as begotten, for in this
perſon is conſidered but the <hi>eſſence,</hi> and the relation, as thoſe
ſchoole diuines affirme; the which relation hath the place of
forme from, which the action ought to proceed.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe very hard to ſay, how the Father inſpireth as
a perſon, without inſpiring neither as a Father nor as an
<hi>Eſſence:</hi> Neuertheleſſe we muſt ſo ſay, ſeeing the ſonne of
God himſelfe hath ſayd and taught ſo, as his beloued Diſciple
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> teſtifieth vnto vs, which heard it of himſelfe:
But becauſe he hath not ſaid that the holy Ghoſt proceeds
from himſelfe, the Churches of the Eaſt will not ſay ſo: but do
conſider the Father as Father, and the Sonne as Sonne, and
they ſay with their great Doctor Saint <hi>Damaſcenus:</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Orth. fid. li. 1. ca. 13.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Father alone is the cauſe and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as well of the Sonne as of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>That which moueth the Latins to be ſo obſtinate, and to
ſay that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the perſon of the
Sonne, is becauſe they feare that otherwiſe men would feigne
or imagine inequallitie in the perſons: And if the Father
did not communicate to the Sonne the inſpiratiue power, he
communicated not vnto him all, that is in him: but hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
vnto him all, except the conſtitutiue propertie of
his perſon. Neuertheleſſe the truth is, that the Grecians
confeſſe conſtantly the equality of the perſons, &amp; they ſay that
the Father did communicate all to the ſonne: but they ſeeme
to denie that that production is the action of the Sonne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1878:42"/>
that the Son doth not inſpire, but the perſon already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
and reſident in himſelfe: and they ſay moreouer, that
there is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <note n="u" place="margin">Damaſc. ibid.</note> that is, that the inſpiration is one and the
very ſelfe ſame action of them both, the which neuertheleſſe
onght to be attributed to the Father alone, becauſe that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is the beginning. The Latins do confeſſe all this, that
is to ſay, that there is one ſelfe ſame inſpiratiue vertue, and
conſequently one ſelfe ſame inſpiration which proceedeth
from the Father, yea euen in that, that it is the action of the
Sonne, and that the Father and the Sonne doe inſpire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are both one, for the eſſence is the foundation of
the power, although that it is the Perſons that doe produce
it. It is as if one would ſearch to know, whether the light
which ſhineth ſometimes in the night time, doth proceede
onely from the Sunne, or elſe, as well from the Sunne, as
from the Moone A man ſhould not doe amiſſe to maintaine
both the one and the other, I ſpeake this, yet not comparing
the moſt holy myſteries with creatures, as ſome for want of a
more ſolid diſcourſe are wont, and would make men beleeue
ſo. I ſay this onely, that there may be found <hi>Logomachies</hi>
as well in the one, as in the other. The concluſion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the intention of all the Churches ſeemeth to be, that,</p>
                  <p>The Father as a perſon produceth the holy Ghoſt, and
as a Father begot the Sonne, who through the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
vertue communicated, produceth alſo the holy
Ghoſt: in ſuch ſort that the holy Ghoſt is ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
from the Sonne, if one conſider the action of the
Sonne ſimply, but if one haue regard to the beginning
of the ſame, he proceedeth from the Father only.</p>

which ſaying preuenteth two miſchiefes, the one
that no man exalt himſelfe, for graunt ſaith he, that
thou runneſt, or that thou doeſt endeuour, yet thinke
not, that which is well done is thine, for if thou art not
inſpired from aboue, all is in vaine. It is neuertheleſſe

thou laboureſt: For he ſaid not ſimply that wee
runne in vaine, but that we runne in vaine, if we thinke
that all is of vs, and make not God the principall partie
for God would not, that all ſhould be from him, leaſt
he ſhould ſeeme to crowne vs for no ſeruice, neither
that all ſhould be of our ſelues, leaſt we ſhould happen
to fall into a fooliſh opinion of our ſelues: for if we be

                  <head>ANNOTATION.</head>
                  <p>SOme men doe thinke that the difference touching free-wil
conſiſteth all in wordes, which may be graunted, becauſe
that the Romane Catholikes doe not hold any thing to be in
a man that is regenerated, which the proteſtants doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
with them, that is, that it proceedeth either in all, or in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1878:46"/>
part from free-will. But the difference is in this, that the
Proteſtants doe thinke it neceſſary that a man ſhould haue an
aſſured faith, the which (ſay they) proceedeth in no wiſe from
free-will, nor by conſequent from the workes that doe proceed
from this faith: for if it proceede totally from God, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
that the effects ought to be imputed to him onely. If
the Latines would confeſſe that God giueth this confidence,
they ſhould approue the opinion of the Proteſtants; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
many doe ſo, and therein are true Catholickes. The
Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> which affirme, that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ſaluation, to haue this confidence: do alſo confeſſe, that
it commeth from God, and therefore begge it of him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
denie therein free-will, as the Proteſtants doe, and
are contrary to the Latines, although that they doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
with them about it, and (though they know it not) agree
with the Proteſtants: thoſe Proteſtants (I ſay) which beleeue
that the Grecians do contrary them, as much or more then
the Latines: and ſo it is certaine that the fault is for want of
vnderſtanding the matter.</p>
                  <p>Now to comprehend well this thing, a man muſt marke
the propoſitions of the Patriarch <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and explane them,
to the end he may gather his meaning by his owne diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he ſaith, that a man hath power or ability to chuſe
the good as well as the euill. Theſe termes are ſtrange to the
<note n="m" place="margin">Reſp. 2. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. de l. arb.</note> Protestants. Neuertheleſſe they are true, becauſe that hee
ſpeaketh of the ſoule, which is the inward man, and the chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
part of a man (for ſo he expoundeth himſelfe.) This
ſoule is of it ſelfe apt to iudge and chuſe the good (that is to
ſay, that good which belongeth to morall vertue:) but the
bodie which is the ſoules inſtrument, doth ſuggeſt vnto it
without ceaſing thoſe obiects, which haue appearance of good,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1878:47"/>
in ſuch ſort that the ſoule cannot reſiſt but very hardly; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as a ſhippe, which of it ſelfe is apt to be conducted any
way, is oftentimes carried by the winde againſt the will of
the Pilot.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſaith, that a man attempteth, and that
God effecteth. The Proteſtants doe confeſſe the ſame like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
ſaying, that a man may by his free-will doe a ciuil worke
of<note n="n" place="margin">The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid confeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion of Ausburg.</note> iuſtice, and ſuch as is commanded by God: But becauſe that
of it ſelfe it profiteth nothing to ſaluation, the ſame <hi>Ieremie</hi>
addeth, that God effecteth, by beſtowing that which is his own,
that is to ſay, <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Neuertheleſſe the Proteſtants ſay, that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from God: The ſame Authour ſaith ſo alſo, and in
the very ſame termes, and ſheweth that the morall worke is
but as the matter: euen a matter vnprofitable, to the which
God giueth a forme, that is to ſay, <hi>faith.</hi> Euen as an Houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which would build, prouideth the matter, but the Maſter
workeman maketh the houſe or building, in ſuch ſort that
all the commoditie of inhabiting, which is the vſe of the
houſe, is attributed to him that builded it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſaith, that God dooth cooperate. It is
neceſſary here to marke, that two cauſes may concurre to one
effect. Reaſon leadeth a man to a worke of iuſtice, the holy
Ghoſt doth likewiſe driue him: And a man fortified with
ſpecial grace, executeth it better, then if he were caried alone
by naturall reaſon: Neuertheleſſe all is attributed to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that the ſoule being illuminated, employeth her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
faculties to a good end, the which it would neuer do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God: and for this cauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that it is not in him
that willeth, nor that runneth: wherein he teacheth, that a
man may will and runne, but becauſe that in running he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1878:47"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> addeth to it, that God muſt needs giue his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which he doth, when he purifieth the heart through faith;
faith (I ſay) which not onely maketh the Morall works good,
which proceede of reaſon, but alſo bringeth forth a farre
greater number, and maketh the righteouſneſſe of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſies:
for a man loueth God according to that proportion, that hee
beleeueth in him; and a man doth good workes according to
that meaſure, that hee loueth him; and it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
for in all our willingneſſe the principall part, or all
proceedes from inſpiration, and in this conſideration it is
ſayd, that God giueth the will and the deede.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>When a man ſpeaketh of faith, it is neceſſary to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
it: for the want of this, is the cauſe of the ſtrife about
words. The Latins neuer ſpeake but of that faith, which</hi>
Bellarmine <hi>defineth thus:</hi> Catech. cap. 11. Faith is a
Theologicall vertue, whoſe office is to illuminate the
vnderſtanding, and to raiſe it vp to a firme beleefe of all
that, which God hath reuealed vnto vs by the meanes
of his Church, although it be a hard thing, and farre
paſſing naturall reaſon.</p>
                  <p>6. The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaith, that this faith dependeth
partly vpon free will, that is to ſay, in as much as a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
himſelfe to receaue it, and may reiect it, when it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him. The Proteſtants doe call this faith hiſtoricall,
and do confeſſe that a man may furder himſelfe in receiuing
of it. For the authoritie of the Church may moue a man to
beleeue that the Goſpell is a true hiſtorie: likewiſe the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of the Apoſtles, who are vnreproueable Authors, and
the predictions of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and the Sybils: yet ſo
that all this would be weake, if God ſhould not illuminate the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1878:48"/>
vnderſtanding to beleeue firmely. The Proteſtants doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
alſo that one may reiect this faith, and fall into diſpaire
for this faith hath her ſeat in the vnderſtanding (as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Catholickes ſay very well) but in ſuch ſort that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
draweth not the will to accept and reſt in it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that by this faith a man is not aſſured, whether any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
be giuen to himſelfe, but onely he beleeueth that it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
to ſome men, in ſuch ſort that if he loueth God, it is of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
proportionable to this faith. Hee loueth him as the Author
of nature, and as a benefactor to them that pleaſe him. If he
keepe in ſome ſort his commaundements, it is more <hi>formidine
paenae,</hi> then <hi>virtutis amore:</hi> rather of ſeruice feare
then of filiall loue. It is impoſsible for a man to loue him
withall his heart, whom he miſtruſteth.</p>
                  <p>6. This is the cauſe that the Church of the Eaſt &amp; South;
together with the reformed Church of the Weſt (and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>) doe hold that a man muſt haue
confidence and aſſurance. The confeſsion of <hi>Saxonie</hi> ſaith
as followeth:<note n="p" place="margin">De remiſſ. art. 3.</note> Faith ſignifieth not onely to know the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
as the diuels themſelues doe, which beleeue and tremble
but alſo ſignifieth to imbrace all the Articles of the faith,
and amongſt the reſt this alſo: I beleeue the forgiueneſſe of
ſinnes, and doe beleeue that they are forgiuen, not only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others, but alſo vnto me.</p>
                  <p>7. Behold here the true knot of the queſtion of free-will.
The Proteſtants affirme that this faith of aſſurance, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not at all vpon free will: this is not to ſay, that it is not
a man, which beleeueth and which willeth, but that he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not, nor willeth not, if God of his extraordinary and
eſpecial grace would not, that a man beleeued &amp; were willing.
Moreouer this is not to ſay, that naturally the actuall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1878:48"/>
cannot beleeue all that which is credible, and that
the will naturally accepteth not all, that which the iudgement
propoſeth to be good: but man is ſayd not to helpe himſelfe
by his free will to receiue this faith, becauſe that nature doth
not ſhew to the iudgement of man any reaſon, whereby hee
might conclude that God loueth him, &amp; would faine be fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
&amp; merciful vnto him, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> very learnedly ſaith
in his ſecond anſwere: <hi>all that which is proued by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is examined very profoundly by earneſt inquirie
or ſearch: but the ſimplicitie of faith is more firme then
the demonſtrations which reaſon doth deuiſe.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
man cannot reiect this faith when it is offered him,
becauſe that God hath ſo ordered, that a man iudgeth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
without any precedent debating. And withall, a man
cannot haue a will to reiect it at ſuch time as it is in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
becauſe that the wil naturally &amp; neceſſarily, but
freely (for otherwiſe it ſhould be no will) yeeldeth it ſelfe to
that which the iudgement eſteemeth to bee good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
The Proteſtants in the confeſsion of <hi>Saxonie</hi> and
<hi>Ausburg,</hi> and others doe confeſſe alſo, that it may be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the vnderſtanding, by reaſon of other ſucceeding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
as the cauſe that vice raigneth in man; for man
hath his free will to euill, and God hath not promiſed ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them which ſinne willingly and notoriouſly.</p>
                  <p>8. As touching the Chriſtians of the South, although
that this queſtion is not found handled in their writings, yet
they ſpeake very ſufficiently. They ſay that aſſurance of faith
is a guift of God, and therefore they begge it at his hands, and
they confeſſe that a man cannot doe any good in the world, to
wit, by his free will. Moreouer the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
that this<note n="q" place="margin">Seſſ. 6. 9.</note> faith proceedeth not at all from free will:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1878:49"/>
Euery man (<hi>ſaith the Councell</hi>) when he hath regard to
himſelfe, and to his owne indignity and indiſpoſition,
may haue ſome feare and doubt of Gods grace: ſeeing
a man cannot know by any certainety of faith, that hee
hath obtained the grace of God. <hi>Out of this confeſſion
of the Councell a man may conclude, that if God giueth this
confidence (as the Apoſtolike Churches doe beleeue againſt the
ſaid Councell) then it is a ſupernaturall gift, and dependeth
no way on freewill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. But the Reformed ſtay not on ſo faire a way, They ſay
that we cannot doe any good workes through free-will: They
would ſay, in as much as theſe workes proceede of faith:
for in that they proceede from naturall all reaſon (which is no
leſſe in the faithfull then in the vnfaithfull) the free-will
doth cooperate alſo, neuertheleſſe they are not therefore true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good, that is to ſay, rewardable: but they are, in that they
proceede of faith, or that they are addreſſed to a true end
through faith: and therfore the Catholike Church beleeueth,</p>
                  <p>That God giueth a kind of faith, called confidence,
which proceedeth not in any wiſe from free-will, nor
by conſequent works conſidered as effects of this faith.</p>

in one ſenſe, and another in another ſenſe. In
ſuch ſort that both the one and the other ſaie true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken according to their meaning, although that
they differ in words.</hi> We haue ſaid in the queſtion precedent,
that the Latins and the Reformed agree vpon the point of
free will, if all the Latins would confeſſe, that the <hi>Faith</hi> of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1878:51"/>
the Elect is a full aſſurance; wee ſay the very ſame in this
point of Iuſtification: but to ſhew where the difference is, we
ought not to vſe the word <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> without
diſtinguiſhing of what faith, or what iuſtification we ſpeake</p>
                  <p>The Councell of Trent ſaith foure things, Firſt, that
faith (that is to ſay, that which is without confidence, which
the Proteſtants call hiſtoricall, for the Councell acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
none other) is the beginning of mans ſaluation: and that
this faith commeth from God. The Proteſtants doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
both the one and the other: to wit, that it is neceſſary
firſt that one beleeue that the Goſpell is a true hiſtorie,
and then that one cannot beleeue perfecty, and as he ought,
without the grace of God, as the ſame Councell ſaith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that this hiſtoricall faith, is the beginning and
root of Iuſtification, that is to ſay, that it bringeth forth good
workes which God doth approue, and for which God iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a man, that is to ſay, he holdeth and declareth him iuſt.
The Proteſtants ſay that this faith may bring forth a certain
inherent iuſtice, through the which a man is<note n="c" place="margin">Danaus Eth. Chriſt.</note> iuſtified, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condum
quid,</hi> that is in a ſort, but not abſolutely, for a man
that doth one good worke, doth a thouſand bad workes, which
doe make him vniuſt: ſo that the ſame man is good and bad,
iuſt and vniuſt, approued of God, and condemned of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
God were vniuſt if he ſhould not hold himiuſt whom
he himſelfe hath iuſtified; well then he iuſtifieth men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to ciuill righteouſneſſe, in giuing this hiſtoricall faith,
and in ſtirring vp in them charity, ſuch as it is, that is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to this faith. <hi>One cannot</hi> (ſaith Bellarmine)
<note n="d" place="margin">De Crana lib. 64.</note> 
                     <hi>loue God himſelfe, as the Author of nature, if it bee
not by the helpe of ſpeciall grace. And ſo there is no
difference in this point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:1878:52"/>
In the third place the Councel ſaith, that through this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall
faith a man is not abſolued of his former ſinnes. The
Proteſtants doe confeſſe as much, and adde withall, that no
more is he through good works, which proceed from thence,
which (ſay they) are not good, but for humane ſocieties ſake.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place the Councell ſaith, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
and S. <hi>Iames,</hi> ſpeaking of this faith in the example which
they alleadge of <hi>Abraham:</hi> the which (ſaith the Councell)
was iuſtified, that is to ſay, found iuſt, in that he beleeued
God; but plainely iuſtified, that is to ſay, held iuſt of all, when
he effected the commandement of God. The Churches of the
Eaſt doe approue this opinion, but it is not needfull to debate
much, touching the intention and meaning of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> The
Scripture may receiue diuerſe expoſitions and al orthodox. It
is certaine that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified in that he beleeued:
and more iuſt in that he laid his hands to the worke.</p>
                  <p>But there are two concluſions wherein the Apoſtolicke
Churches, and the Reformed Church are contrary in the ſayd
Councell. The firſt is that the ſaid Councell doth hold that
through the workes which proceede of this hiſtoricall faith a
man obtaineth (others ſay a man meriteth) that God ſhould
pardon his former ſinnes, in imputing vnto them, that doe
thoſe good workes, the merite of the paſsion of our Sauiour.
The Proteſtants on the contrary ſide ſay, that ſuch works pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from ſuch hiſtoricall faith ſerue not to ſaluation.
Hereunto the Churches of the Eaſt do agree, who ſay that the
workes which proceede from a true faith, are truely good:
and they call this faith <hi>Confidence,</hi> which ought to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to the end that none ſhould doubt the truth of the hiſtory,
for they declare ſufficiently, that they meane, that it is not
needfull that a repentant man ſhould doubt of his ſaluation.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1878:52"/>
That is alſo ſeene more plainely in that, that they of the Eaſt
haue written before, to the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> who
preſſe very hard this point of Confidence, wherein they of the
Eaſt doe approue and confirme their ſaying.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond difference is in that the Proteſtants ſay, that a
man is abſolued (they call it iuſtified) at that inſtant, that he
receiueth this confidence by diuine inſpiration, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any conſideration of precedent workes (otherwiſe grace
ſhould be no grace) as alſo without conſideration of any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
workes: for it happeneth ſometimes (as it did to the
good thiefe) that a man ſhall haue no time to doe good works:
and if the faith of confidence ſufficeth as ſoone as it is in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
yea and ſufficeth as an inſtrumentall cauſe to put a man
in poſſeſsion of the paſsion of the Lord, which is the formall
cauſe of abſolution, it followeth, that during all the tearme
of a mans life, he neede not ſeeke any other inſtrumental
cauſe of this application. For when our Sauiour healed the
ſicke, he ſayed not vnto them, loueſt thou me? although it was
neceſſary that they ſhould haue loued him, but he ſaid to them
beleeueſt thou? for by this beleefe they were healed. And
that the Churches of the Eaſt doe beleeue, that this confidence
putteth a man in poſſeſsion of the grace of God, they ſhew in
that which their Patriarch ſayth, that his confidence vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
things ſeparated, and that diſtruſt doth diſ-vnite and
ſeperate them: for what vnion can there be with God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remiſsion of ſinnes? Moreouer the Grecians confeſſe that
God inſpireth this confidence: If it be ſo, it followeth, that at
that very inſtant a man obtaineth pardon: otherwiſe God
ſhould be the Authour of deceitfull and vaine confidence. But
ſome will then demaund, to what end ſerue good workes?
The Grecians and the Proteſtants with one conſent doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1878:53"/>
that without them one cannot be ſaued: and if there
be no good workes, a man falleth from the abſolution already
receiued: and looke how much force confidence hath to put a
man in poſſeſsion of the merite of the paſsion of the Lord,
ſo much euill workes haue (that is to ſay, ſo long as they
remaine and raigne in the ſoule) to breake the vnion that
faith had contracted. In like manner good workes are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<hi>ſine quibus non,</hi> of this iuſtification, or elſe may be ſaid
to be cauſes <hi>per accidens:</hi> Neither the Chriſtian Churches
of this time, nor the fathers, nor the holy Scripture, doe
ſet downe the order of euery one of theſe cauſes, according to
the termes of Philoſophers, neyther is it neceſſary: It ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
that euery one haue faith, and that euery one giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to good works, and that he know that both the one and the
other is neceſſary. The difference betweene the foreſaid peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the Proteſtants is: that the Proteſtants ſeeing that
the Latines doe not attribute enough to faith, or rather doe
not acknowledge this faith of confidence, to the which they
attribute ſo much, cannot endure to haue this faith diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced:
And other Chriſtians hearing of the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of this faith, doe perſwade themſelues, that it makes
to the preiudice of good workes; for which cauſe they cannot
by any meanes hold their peace.</p>
                  <p>Well then, becauſe that wee haue ſaid, that euill workes
cauſe men to fall from iuſtification, that is to ſay, from abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
(which is the beleefe receiued, without any contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in all times, and by all Christian people) It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
that amongſt the Proteſtants there are ſome found
(for all doe not ſo, as is to be ſeene in the confeſsions of <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,
Bohemia, Saxonie,</hi> and <hi>Wirtenberg</hi>) which ſay, that
he that hath this iuſtifying faith cannot fall. From whence
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1878:53"/>
it followeth according to their ſayings, that hee which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
himſelfe to be iuſtified, may giue himſelfe to all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>To this may be anſwered, that thoſe which hold this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
eyther doe not explane themſelues well, or elſe their
explication is not well vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>For they ſay not ſimply that euery one ought to beleeue that
he is iuſtified, but only he that is repentant ought ſo to beleeue.
Alſo that repentance (whereof euery one may iudge in his
owne ſoule) ſheweth, whether his faith be a iuſtifying faith.
And that he that ſhall ſay, I will doe euill, is not at all repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant:
for theſe are quite contrary.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer thoſe which are ſaid to hold this opinion, ſay
ordinarily that none ought to commit ſinn, in hope to repent:
for none can or ought to promiſe himſelfe, that God will
giue him time and meanes to accompliſh it: Thoſe which doe
haunt their Sermons, can beare witneſſe if this be not an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
leſſon. Well then, what is this but to ſay that none
can haue this confidence at ſuch time as vice and ſinne dooth
raigne in him? And if one cannot haue it, is not this as
much as to ſay, that if one had it, he may looſe it, in giuing
himſelfe to wickedneſſe? But behold here how their ſaying
is true: forſooth becauſe confidence of faith doeth coutaine in
it Hiſtoricall faith which remaineth in him, in whom vice
doth raigne, as the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> alſo ſaith: And this
faith, if he be elected will moue him to repentance, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not in diſpaire, as in the reprobate, but in a full confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and all by the aſsiſtance of God. The Catholicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
is:</p>
                  <p>That a man receiueth remiſſion of his ſinnes at the
very inſtant that the aſſurance of faith is infuſed into
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1878:54"/>
his ſoule, and that without any conſideration of former
or future workes.</p>

                     </gap>, <hi>becauſe of the
ambiguity of the word</hi> Merite, <hi>which in the writings

Bohemia <hi>doth well note, in the which ſenſe the Proteſtants
of</hi> Ausburge<note n="l" place="margin">Confeſſ. art. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>haue made no ſcruple to vſe it. But becauſe
that the Councell ſaith that a man doth truely merite, wee
muſt confeſſe that it ſpeaketh of a merite which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
admit not of. And euen ſo Cardinall</hi> Bellarmine
<hi>ſheweth, when he ſaith thus.</hi> Some men doe imagine that
there is but one ſatisfaction, to wit that of Chriſt, and
that we doe not properly ſatisfie: but that we doe ſome
things, in conſideration whereof God doth applie vnto
vs the ſatisfaction of Chriſt: that is to ſay, that our good
workes are but conditions, without the which the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Chriſt ſhould not be applied vnto vs, or at
the moſt, but a diſpoſition; ſo ſaith <hi>Michael Bauius,</hi> the
which opinion ſeemeth vnto me erronious: for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture and the Fathers, ordinarily doe call our
workes, ſatisfactions, and redemptions of ſinnes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
if a man may by his good workes merite <hi>De Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digno,</hi>
Life Euerlaſting, wherefore may hee not ſatisfie
for temporall paine which is leſſe? <hi>From this diſcourſe of</hi>
Bellarmine <hi>may be gathered two things. The firſt is, that
in the Romane Catholicke Church, there are ſome which hold
the opinion of the Proteſtants. The other is, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
by theſe words,</hi> To merite truely euerlaſting life, <hi>doeth
meane that one may merite it,</hi> De condigno, <hi>and not that
works are onely cauſes,</hi> Sine quibus non, <hi>or only diſpoſitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants doe oppoſe themſelues against that very
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1878:56"/>
ſtrongly and firmely, and doe maintaine that merite taken
after the meaning of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> preſuppoſeth a man
hath beene profitable to him of whom hee meriteth: but
men euen when they are moſt perfect are vnprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
(to wit to God, and not to themſelues or to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours)
as our Sauiour ſaith. God doth excell both men and
Angels from all eternity, and in perfect beatitude. And if
he had appointed to bring them all to naught, euen as he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
them of nothing, he ſhould not be vniuſt: If hee doe a
deede of mercy in eternizing them, it is becauſe hee doth it
according to his promiſe, freely and not of merite. For if a
man by his good workes hath not obliged God to promiſe, he
obligeth him not neither to effect the ſame. If a begger by
asking almes doth get tenne crownes, no man will ſay that he
merited them <hi>de Condigno:</hi> no although the giuer had
made him a promiſe. Well then, to pray to God and to faſt,
is to begge his mercy.</p>
                  <p>As touching the Churches of the Eaſt, they vſe not the
word Merite, but vſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is to ſay, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
or to carry away a recompence, which is a phraſe of
Scripture. Therefore good workes are recompenceable, that
is to ſay, they diſpoſe or make a man fit to receiue a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
but yet as a gratuitie. The ſame Churches doe holde
alſo that opinion which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> condemneth, that is to
ſay, that good workes are cauſes <hi>ſine quibus non:</hi> without
the which (ſaith their anſwere) one cannot obtaine ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer the benefite of good workes is recyted: vice is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
decent nor profitable, &amp; nothing elſe but the depriuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of al goodnes. Good works do ſhew what we are, to wit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we be in grace. In fine, good workes are the cauſe of our
ſaluation (but by accident) ſeeing that the omiſsion of good
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1878:56"/>
workes, and the commiſsion of euill, doe ſtrange a man much
from God.</p>
                  <p>As touching the Chriſtians of the South, there hath not
beene any diſputations among them touching this queſtion,
but they agree with vs therein. They call themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
ſeruants, and confeſſe that they haue not done any
good in the world. It would be a great iniurie to the pure
ſimplicitie of thoſe Chriſtians, if one ſhould ſuſpect them to
hide a diſſembling ſoule vnder thoſe words.</p>
                  <p>It is to be noted, that the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> doth make two
ſorts of recompence, that is to ſay, euerlaſting life, and diuers
degrees of beatitude. As concerning life euerlaſting, one
would thinke it were thus by ſearching the cauſe, to wit, that
God loueth himſelfe perfectly, becauſe that he is the louer of
perfect goodneſſe and Iuſtice. And that the perſon of his
Sonne, which is the very ſame eſſence with the Father, hath
taken in perſonal vnion, the ſonne of the Virgin, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
is perfectly loued, that is to ſay, hee hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
righteouſneſſe, the which the Diety hath communicated
vnto him: Therefore it cannot be but that God gaue to this
humanitie all the felicity whereof it was capable. Well then,
this loue and felicity ſhould not be perfect, if it did not extend
to the myſticall bodie of this <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God and man, that
is to ſay, to all them that are one with him, as he is one with
the Father. In like manner all thoſe that are of that bodie,
are capable of that felicity by reaſon of the loue that God bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to them in his Sonne: yea when they haue not the
meanes to doe any good workes: as it is ſeene in little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
which if they be ſaued (as it is confeſſed) it is onely for
the vnion which they haue with the ſon of God, whoſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
is recompenced in them. Then if this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1878:57"/>
of Chriſt be ſufficient to make them happy: it followeth,
that the ſame is alſo ſufficient to make thoſe happy, which are
grownein yeares, who by the very ſame meanes haue eternal
life, that is to ſay, by reaſon of his perfect righteouſnes.</p>
                  <p>But as God loueth his ſonne, being a man in regard of his
actions that are perfectly good, by reaſon whereof God hath
giuen him a name aboue all names: In like manner loueth
he thoſe which God hath giuen him, by reaſon of their good
workes, although vnperfect: and therefore in conſideration
and according to the proportion of them, he recompenceth
them with ſundry degrees of felicity: Not that their workes
were the cauſe of euerlaſting life, which was not abſolutely
promiſed, but to thoſe which haue perfect righteouſneſſe
The Catholike concluſion in this Queſtion is,</p>
                  <p>That a man meriteth not properly eternall life by
his good workes, although that they be worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that is to ſay, that they make a man fit to receiue
a recompence through the grace of God.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1878:59"/>
will intreat in that queſtion, where it ſhall be debated whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be lawfull to praie for the Saints which are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Onely it is to be noted, that the Councelle of <hi>Trent</hi> doth
faine that the holy Scriptures doe warrant Purgatorie:
which the Churches of the Eaſt doe denie: And if the true
Interpretations of Scripture ought to be taken out of the
Apoſtolicke Churches which haue retained it from hand to
hand from their Fathers: it followeth, that thoſe places of
Scripture, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth alleadge to proue
Purgatorie, are wreſted by them to another ſenſe, as the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
haue ſhewed in their Apologie, in the Councell of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil.</hi>
And the Author of the Treatiſe of the fire of Purgatory
before alleadged, doth proue it very ſlenderly. Moreouer
many Romane Catholike Doctors, and of very good eſtimation
doe confeſſe, that Purgatorie cannot be proued by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Amongſt the reſt <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro</hi> auoucheth,
not onely that it is not proued by the Scripture, but alſo that
the Fathers doe ſeldome make mention of it, eſpecially the
Greeke Fathers: From thence (ſaith he) it commeth that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vntill this preſent time the Grecians doe denie Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.
The Catholicke Concluſion thererefore here

                  <p>That there is no fire of Purgatorie, nor any other

                  <p>THe Proteſtants ſay that the cuſtome in times paſt was,
to appoint to repentant ſinners a certaine terme, during
which by their good workes, they might giue the Church te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of their repentance. The ſame is as yet practiſed in
the Eaſt and South Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ieremie</hi> Patriarcke of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> diſcourſeth
hereupon as followeth. Satisfactions are profitable, if they be
impoſed as a medicine by the ſpiritual miniſters, that is to ſay,
for thoſe that are Proude, Couetous, Gluttonous, Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
Enuious, Quarrelous, or giuen to ſuch like vices: Who
if they would conuert and repent, ought to ſubmit themſelues
to the rules made according to the aduiſe of the holy Fathers.
But if thoſe ſatisfactions bee tranſlated to the gaine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of thoſe that giue them, and not to the true end, which is
to prouide for the ſaluation of the Soule, and to heale each
ſinne, which is the intention, for the which they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted:
In that faſhion we doe reiect them, and doe ſay that
they were ordained in vaine, which cannot by any meanes
be denied. And we doe pronounce remiſsion of ſinnes, with
ſome puniſhment adioyned for many conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt to the end, that a man for voluntarie affliction,
might eſcape the ineuitable paine of an other life. <hi>Bring
forth fruites worthy of Repentance,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Iohn, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
tree that beareth not good fruit ſhall be cut down,
and throwne into the fire,</hi> to wit, <hi>Euerlaſting.</hi> For God is
not ſo much pleaſed with any thing, as with affliction, and
therefore <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> ſaith, <hi>Teares are recompenſed
with mercie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, to the end that the inclination of the fleſh to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1878:61"/>
which is the cauſe of vice, ſhould be taken away.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to the end that that puniſhment ſhould be a ſtay to
the ſoule, to the end it fall not into ſuch like ſinne, or worſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to the end that a man ſhould accuſtome himſelfe
to take paines, for vertue is gotten with trauaile.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, to the end that a man might bee aſſured, whether
he perfectly hateth euill. Neuertheleſſe we doe leaue all theſe
things in thoſe that depart: For we doe count that it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
if in him that repenteth, there bee a true conuerſion.
Therefore we doe pronounce remiſsion of ſinnes according to
the power of him that ſaid, <hi>If you remit ſinnes, they ſhall
be Pardoned.</hi> We beleeue that by the ſame meanes the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
is pardoned, for aſſurance whereof, we doe giue the
diuine gift of the Euchariſt. For repentance hath his ſeate
in the ſoule of the ſinner, but not to vndergoe puniſhment,
is in the handes of God, which for this cauſe hath really
by his owne humanitie, giuen remiſsion, as to the thiefe who
did but deſire of the Lord, that hee would remember him
when he came to his Kingdome. See here the Doctrine of
the Churches of the Eaſt touching ſatisfaction. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
doe proceede more compendiouſly, they are content
that in regard of vnknowen ſinnes, euery one doe apply ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his diſcretion, the ſaying of S. <hi>Iohn, Bring forth
fruits worthy of repentance.</hi> As concerning ſinnes kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
by the moſt part of the Church, ſatisfaction ſufficeth not
vnleſſe it make a reparation or publike acknowledgment, in
asking pardon of God, and the Church for the ſcandale: and
if the offence be knowne but to a few, the ſame acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
is made in their Conſiſtories. Thoſe that refuſe
doe remaine ſuſpended or excommunicated, vntill that they
doe obey, and they giue no Indulgence. There is alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1878:61"/>
to the repentant a time of ſuſpenſion from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
more or leſſe, according to the fault; as well for
a puniſhment, as alſo to the end that the Church may ſee,
whether ſuch repentance be true or fained by the fruits ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
The auncient Church impoſed puniſhments, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſo hard, that they were conſtrained to releaſe the rigor
of them, and that relaxation was called Indulgence. The
Churches of the South doe releaſe or mittigate nothing at
all, and alſo reiect Indulgences in what ſort ſoeuer they are
taken: for this euill proceedeth from appointing puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſo hard, that they are conſtrained afterwards to reuoke
them. But if ſatisfaction doe conſiſt in doing good workes:
It is very il done to diſpence with men, for doing all the good
that is poſsible for them to doe. The people of the Eaſt and of
the South allow not of this abuſe, but they condemne rather
the opinion of the Romane Church, which ordaine ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to auoide certaine paines of Purgatorie, and teach, that by
Indulgences the ſaid paines are eſcaped, without performing
or making of any ſatisfaction: yea as if by Indulgences a man
might be deliuered from the obligation whereby he is bound
to God, to doe all that is poſsible to obtaine pardon of him.
Alſo the Apoſtolicke Churches doe beleeue, that there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pope nor any other perſon, which by Indulgences can
deliuer men from the puniſhments that God inflicteth:
which if it be ſo, that Indulgences do not deliuer a man from
temporall puniſhments of this life, as pouertie, ſickeneſſe, and
death it ſelfe, how can they deliuer him from the paines of
Purgatory? For there is the ſame reaſon for the one as for
the other. It followeth vpon the premiſes, that the Church
cannot diſpence with times and workes lawfully ordained
for proofe and diſproofe, but may well releaſe for iuſt and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1878:62"/>
reaſonable cauſes the cuſtome of confeſsing ſecret ſinnes, and
may pronounce remiſsion without any confeſsing, as they of
the Eaſt Churches doe to this day by their <hi>Synchoreſes,</hi> as
we will relate in his due place. We will then make this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
concluſion, that</p>
                  <p>The Pope cannot by his Indulgences deliuer aniy
from thoſe temporall puniſhments which God inflicts:
neither ought he to diſpence with the doing of al thoſe
workes of repentance that are poſſible.</p>

                  <p>THe auncient Catholike Church beleeued, that the ſoules
of the Fathers in the old Teſtament went to a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Hebrew <hi>Scheol,</hi> in Greeke <hi>Ades,</hi> in Engliſh <hi>Hell.</hi>
And all Chriſtians for the moſt part doe beleeue, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
haue taught ſo likewiſe, ſeeing that there is not any
one particular man knowen, that ſhould be the author of this
opinion. And although that this Article was not in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
in the Creede of the Apoſtles (as it is not in the
Creed of <hi>Nice</hi>) neuertheleſſe hauing beene receiued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
contradiction, the ſame doth argue that the beleefe was
ſuch before time. And which is more, the Scripture of the
old Teſtament makes no mention in any place, that the ſoules
ſhould aſcend into heauen, but very often it maketh mention
of <hi>Scheol,</hi> or Hell, and to deſcend. <hi>I will deſcend into
Scheol, with ſorrow for my ſonne,</hi> ſayd that good man
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1878:63"/>
                     <hi>Iacob:</hi> and to deſcend ſignifieth to go to ſome lowe place. It is
true that the word <hi>Scheol</hi> ſignifieth ſometimes a graue, but
the Catholike Church takes it here for Hell: for the Greeke
tranſlator approued by the Apoſtles, taketh it ſo, as alſo Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> in this ſentence of the Pſalmes, cited by S. <hi>Peter, Thou
wilt not leaue my ſoule in Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For to vnderſtand well this queſtion, you muſt note firſt,
that it doth not appertaine to ſaluation, to know whether the
ſoules of the Fathers were aboue or belowe, prouided alwayes
that one doe not call the holy Scripture into doubt, which it
is not done by and by, although a man doe not alwayes attaine
to the true ſenſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are two places that the moſt learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines,

fit otherwiſe to agree vpon it: And haue written that the
ſoule of the Lord went really vnto the true Paradice, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
not into Hell, but by efficacie or vertue. On the other
ſide, amongſt the Protestants, <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beozo,</hi> haue
thought more to the purpoſe, to referre this word Hell to the
torments that our Sauiour ſuffered; to the end, that that
which the Scripture ſaith (that our Sauiour went to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe)
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1878:64"/>
ſhould be beleeued without running to any falſe or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Expoſition.</p>
                  <p>Alſo there are learned men amongſt the Latines and the
Proteſtants, which doe decline from the common opinion
herein, becauſe that it ſeemeth very abſurd vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Neuertheleſſe, becauſe that none of the three is receiued
without contradiction, it ſheweth that there is difficultie in
them all. For to ſay that the Lord deſcended not into Hell, but
by his efficacie or vertue, is to wreſt that place of Scripture,
<hi>Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To ſay that Hell, whereof mention is made in the
Creede,</hi> is the torments which the Lord ſuffered vpon the
Croſſe: is an Expoſition altogether vnknowen to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and againſt the intention and meaning of thoſe which
added that clauſe to the Creede, and thoſe Proteſtants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
for whom this ſerueth, are ready to receiue one more
proper, as is to bee ſeene in that ſentence before alleadged of
<hi>Vrſinus.</hi> As for the reſt, one may giue many Expoſitions;
and all Orthodoxall of one ſelfe ſame place of Scripture,
when one is not aſſured of the intent and meaning of the
Authour, ſo is it likewiſe in the Creede.</p>
                  <p>But about theſe difficulties, the Apoſtolicke Churches in the
Eaſt doe furniſh vs with a fourth Expoſition, and that moſt
ancient of all: They hold with <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> a very true
Catholicke teacher, that the ſoules of the Fathers were in
<hi>Ades</hi> (the Latines call that place <hi>Infernum &amp; Lymbus:</hi>
but improperly) and that our Sauiour deſcended thither:
And that he was the very ſame day in Paradiſe, and that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe
is no other place, but the ſame which the thiefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
and meant, for if our Sauiour had ſpoken of one place,
and the Thiefe had conceiued and meant another, his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1878:64"/>
had beene deceaued. Now the Thiefe meant no
other Paradiſe but that earthly Paradiſe: for hee could not
know what Paradiſe it was, but by the Scripture of the old
Teſtament, which ſpeaketh not of any other Paradiſe. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
then, that our Sauior was that ſame day in that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
and his ſoule was not left in hell. It is there alſo, whether
the Fathers were conducted, wherof ſome roſe with the Lord,
and were ſeene in Ieruſalem.</p>
                  <p>It is in this Paradiſe (ſay they) that <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
were placed in their bodies, and peraduenture <hi>Moſes,</hi> who
appeared at the transfiguration of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt:
and all the Fathers were rapt vp into heauen, ſome in their
bodies when our Sauiour aſcended, the other onely in ſoule,
when he roſe from the dead as the ſame Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
ſaith,<note n="l" place="margin">Serm. de deſc.</note> And this opinion is not onely held by the Apoſtolicke
Churches of the Eaſt, as we haue vnderſtood by themſelues:
But it is very true by all likelihoode, that the Chriſtians of
Africke doe conſent thereunto: for they are <hi>Cophites,</hi> and
of the ſame faith and Religion as the <hi>Cophites, Syrians,</hi>
and <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> are: for in all the Churches, the ſayd booke of

his Authors before alleaged, and others denie it. Secondly,
<hi>Zaga</hi> a Biſhop of Aethiop ſayth plainely, that there is no
oyle amongſt them, that is held for a Sacrament. Thirdly,
the foreſaid Churches do not hold the vſe of oyle in Baptiſme
by the inſtitution and commaundement of God, but by the
ordinance of the Church, which (ſay they) hath inuented ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things: (ſo ſpeakes the Patriarch <hi>Ieremie;</hi> touching the

permit the Biſhops onely, to adminiſter the ſayd oyle of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.
Fiftly, They adminiſter this oyle, only to ſhew that in
Baptiſme the Infant receiueth grace to beare the name of a

both the one and the other, they vſe oyle in Baptiſme as the
other Apoſtolicke Churches: but beſides in particular, they
make it a Sacrament. Moreouer if they will haue vnction
to be a Sacrament a part, it followes then vpon that that, the
foreſaid Churches haue Baptiſme well nigh in the ſame ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
or puritie wherein it was ordained by our Sauiour:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1878:69"/>

all the Apoſtolicke Churches for theſe two Articles:
firſt becauſe they hold not, beſides the vnction in Baptiſme,
a Sacrament of the vnction of confirmation: Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſay, that although it were a Sacrament, yet the

                  <p>The <hi>Iacobites</hi> confeſſe not their ſinnes, but onely to God,

<hi>Cophites.</hi> The Proteſtants in <hi>Fraunce</hi> confeſſe their

and there receiue abſolution: and their doctrine declareth,
that it is very good for the eaſing of a troubled conſcience, to
confeſſe ſinnes particularly: but none can learne when and
how the ſame is practiſed. The Reformed Proteſtants of

vnleſſe it be in caſe of ſcandall: but it is no ſcandall to

how the Churches of the Eaſt doe proceed in pronouncing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
without any confeſsion made, we are aduertiſed, that
the Popes, that is to ſay, the Prieſts, doe it in particular: But
becauſe that in that Church of the Eaſt, there is a Patriarch
which gouerneth, it ſeemes vnto them (hauing regard vnto
all the Churches, to whom the keyes were giuen) that if hee
declareth that abſolution, it is more authenticke, and giueth

many things touching the ſame, the which agree

beleeueth that the bread after the ſanctification is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into the body of Chriſt, and the wine into his
blood by the holy Ghoſt: prouided that the bread bee
leauened, not without leauen. For the Lord in that

giuen thankes, broke it, and ſayd, <hi>Take eate, this is</hi> (ſayd

<hi>was not giuen</hi> to the Apoſtles to eate, nor his blood to

for it were a blaſphemie to ſay ſo: but both then
and now by the inuocation and grace of the Almighty
Spirit, the beginner or Author of this myſterie, the
bread is conuerted and changed into the body of the
Lord, and the wine into his blood. <hi>And in another
place he ſayth thus:</hi> And from thence it commeth, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1878:73"/>
the Maſſe or Lumpe of bread is broken in peeces, &amp; it is
not offered entyer or whole: which figureth the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Sauiour. And at the time that this bread is
offered, it is Common Bread, offered onely to God,
but afterwards it is made extraordinary bread, and is
chaunged in deede: but if wee would by reaſons, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and effectes, debate and reſolue thereof, we ſhould
neede a thouſand tongues, and yet they would not bee
ſufficient. But our Sauiour hath commaunded to doe
this in remembrance of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And a little after, he ſaith,</hi> that the Church is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in myſteries, and not as in Symboles; but as the
members depend on the heart, and as the boughes on
the roote of the plant: and (as the Lord ſaid) in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
that the branch is in the ſtocke of the vine. For
here is not only a Communion of name, or a ſimilitude
of Analogie, but the identitie of the things themſelues.
For the body and blood of the Lord are true myſteries,
which are not changed into any humane bodie, but we
are changed into them: for the better things haue euer
the preheminence. Euen as Iron being vnited with
fire becommeth fire, but the fire neuer becomes Iron.
And euen as whe the Iron is glowing hot, wee ſee not

ſaid, to haue receiued the Goſpell by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea:</hi>
Yet neuertheleſſe the Romanes doe bragge that they conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Engliſh men fiue hundred yeares after. Howſoeuer it
be, the Liturgie of the Ethiopians came vnto them from the
Sea of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as appeareth by the Greeke names which
are inſerted therein. <hi>Aluares</hi> ſaith, that they haue another
ſo briefe, that it was no ſooner begun, but it preſently ended:
One might doubt whether this were not the auncienteſt. If
we had the bookes which the ſaid <hi>Aluares</hi> ſaith that they
haue in great number, one might know whether they differ.
But howſoeuer it be, it appeareth not, that this beleefe of
Tranſmutation was receiued in any place of the world as a
new thing. Now a daies it is a queſtion whether the Fathers
haue beleeued it, or whether it be ſlipt in by little and little.
If the Latines and Greekes do alleadge proofes out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
the Proteſtants doe thinke them to be Hyperbolicall
tearmes, for to lift or moue mens ſoules to the worſhipping
of the Sacrament. If the Proteſtants doe bring on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſide other proofes: ſome will anſwere them that the
Fathers did keepe cloſe that beleefe, for feare of giuing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Pagans to mocke them. We will leaue theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties:
the Fathers are not in the worlde now to reſolue
vs: But the Churches ſcattered through the vniuerſall
world, are as yet to beare witneſſe of the Tradition in this
point as well as in others, and to declare and explane their
meaning to thoſe that vnderſtand it not. Well then, ſeeing
that the bread and wine in the Sacrament are changed, wee
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1878:76"/>
muſt examine their diſcourſe to find who doth ſwarue from
the Catholike faith.</p>
                  <p>There are foure things in a true bodie, Firſt the matter,
Secondly the accidents and eſſentiall properties, Thirdly the
forme, which the Philoſophers hold to giue life or being to a
thing, Fourthly the hidden properties which depend vpon
the forme.</p>
                  <p>As touching the accidents and eſſentiall properties of
the body of the Lord, all doe confeſſe that they are not in the
Sacrament: but rather the accidents and properties of the
bread.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the matter of the ſaid body: the Latins
doe beleeue that it is inuiſibly contained vnder the accidents
of bread, and that the matter of the bread becomes nothing:
but the beleefe of the Churches of the Eaſt and South ſeemeth
to be quite contrary to that. Firſt the Patriarch <hi>Ieremie</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
ſaith, that the fleſh of our Sauiour which he carried,
was not giuen to his Apoſtles to eate. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that they did eate ſome other matter, which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
was alſo the body of Chriſt. Moreouer hee expoundeth
it, ſaying, that it is as Iron or Wood burnt, which is called
fire, becauſe that the fire ſurmounteth or ouercommeth: and
the mater of the Iron is not reduced to nothing. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the third, he ſaith in like manner, that thoſe that doe
communicate the Sacrament, are chaunged into the body of
Chriſt, and that the Church is the true body of Chriſt: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
euery one confeſſeth, that the matter of humane
bodies is not reduced or brought to nothing. Likewiſe one
may ſee that the Church is called the true body of Chriſt, or
elſe if the bread be called the true body of Chriſt: this word
<hi>True,</hi> is put as oppoſite, (euen as the ſame Author doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1878:76"/>
it) to the bare ſimilitude, figure, or proportion, and
not as referred to the identitie of the matter. The Churches
of the South ſay the very ſame: they do pray in their Liturgie
or ſeruice, that God would chaunge the bread and wine of
the Sacrament, as he changed the water into wine in <hi>Cana:</hi>
for the matter of the water was not reduced to nothing, to
giue place to other wine created a new, but the water loſt his
forme, and that matter which was before water, receiued the
internall forme, and all the qualities and properties of wine.
Theſe conſiderations and many others, the which would bee
too tedious to recite, doe make ſome Latin writers (and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the reſt <hi>Durandus</hi>) to beleeue, that the bread loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
his forme, and not his matter, no more then the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and properties thereof. It is alſo to be noted, what the
foreſaid <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſaith againſt conſubſtantiation, that there
is not two things in the holy Sacrament, to wit, the bread and
the body of Chriſt: but one onely, to wit, the body of Chriſt,
giuing to note thereby, that that matter which remaineth
is no more the matter of bread, but the matter of the body of
Chriſt: as in the miracle of <hi>Cana,</hi> that matter which was
then the matter of water, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it had the forme of water, was
the matter of wine, when it had the form of wine. And which
is more, there was no chaunge wherin the matter continued
not the ſame. And if one well waigh the ſayings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who beleeued ſome miracle to be in the Sacrament, hee
ſhall find that they doe accord heerein: alſo they ſay, that the
ſubſtance of our fleſh is augmented by the Euchariſt, and that
there be two ſorts of the fleſh of Chriſt. We muſt then obſerue,
how they conceiue that the bread is chaunged into the body of
Chriſt. It ſeemes that they would onely haue it a matter, (be
it that it looſed his forme, as <hi>Durandus</hi> ſaith, or looſed it
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1878:77"/>
not) which ſhould receiue the forme of the body of Chriſt, and
the hidden properties which doe proceede from that forme:
and that that forme being ioyned to the matter, it is no more
bread, neither the matter of bread; but it is the bodie of
Chriſt; and the matter of the body of Chriſt: for as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
ſay, <hi>forma dat eſſe rei.</hi> Some wil ſay it is a dangerous
curioſitie to ſound theſe myſteries: but I aunſwere that of
two inconueniences, the leſſer is to be choſen, and that it is a
moſt dangerous careleſneſſe to leaue the Church in diuiſion,
and to cauſe Chriſtians to be wounded and ſlaine, for want of
teaching, that the difference is not ſo great as it is imagined.
Moreouer, the learned men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> haue a
thouſand times more curiouſly ſearched this point, and haue
left themſelues nothing to ſay, in ſuch ſort that that will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to make vp a peace, which they haue ſearched out by debate
amongſt themſelues. This then may likely bee gathered out
of the Liturgie of Chriſtian people, that the bread taketh the
forme of the body of the Lord, which (for the matter and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
thereof) is but onely in heauen: or that it receiueth
the hidden properties of the forme of the body of Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that this forme be not without his matter. Theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and properties ſerue (as the ſaid <hi>Ieremie</hi> noteth) to
ſanctifie a man, and to make him capable of euerlaſting life.
If it be demaunded what this forme is? The Prince of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
anſwereth, that mans vnderſtanding is as fitly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for the knowledge of naturall things, as the eyes of an
Owle to behold the brightneſſe of the ſunne. And that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Fernelius</hi> beginneth his booke of Phyſicke thus: <hi>When
the Spirit is free and vnbound, ſeeing the naked and
cleere ſubſtances of things, it enioyeth a moſt perfect
and cleere knowledge, but whileſt it is wrapped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1878:77"/>
the body, it remaines in extreame ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Philoſophers and Phiſitians ſeeing in nature ſundry
admirable effects, haue iudged that they could not proceede
from the matter which is one in all things, but haue beene
conſtrained to confeſſe that the forme or eſſence, was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and foundation of thoſe effects. But if they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
mans vnderſtanding, vnfit to iudge of thoſe formes:
much leſſe can Diuines determine this effect, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
to proceede of the body of Ieſus Chriſt. Alſo that which
we doe attribute to the Chriſtians of the Eaſt and South, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the forme of the body of the Lord comming vpon the
matter of the bread, we cannot determine that their beleefe
is ſuch, for they reſolue vpon nothing, ſaying, <hi>That a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
heads are not able to expreſſe it:</hi> which is nothing
elſe but to ſignifie, that the Sacrament may bee ſayd to bee the
true bodie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, although it be graunted,
that the matter of the bodie of Chriſt is onely in heauen. For
it ſufficeth for a change, euen in things praeexiſtent, that
there be an identitie of form, or elſe of qualities and hidden
vertues.</p>
                  <p>As for the Proteſtants, though they hold not the beleefe of
the ſame people, yet they haue not written againſt them, but
much againſt the Latins, who doe conſtitute accidents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſubiect, one matter in many places, a body without his
eſſentiall properties, one God and man liuing in the hoſt or
bread, who heareth not, ſeeth not, feeleth not, nor taſteth
not, which is (ſay the Proteſtants) an opinion contrary to the
holy Scripture, and neuer entred into the imaginations or
hearts of the auncient Fathers, or of the Diuines of the Eaſt
and South Churches, who neuer yeelded or gaue place to the
Latins, either in quickeneſſe of ſpirit or in curioſitie: and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1878:78"/>
who haue had no want of heretickes to giue them occaſion, to
exerciſe themſelues in theſe difficulties, whereinto ſome one
amongſt ſo many learned men as they haue had, in ſo many
ages, and ſuch as haue written ſo many volumes, muſt haue
neceſſarily fallen, if that they beleeued that the body of the
Lord is materially in the hoſt or bread</p>
                  <p>Now wee muſt ſee how farre the beleefe of the Proteſtants
differs from thoſe of the Eaſt and other people: which to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
we muſt enter into the conſideration of ſecret or hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
faculties and proprieties. There are two ſorts of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
touching ſupernaturall operations: ſome thinke that
God worketh immediatly in the place where the thing is,
from whence it ſeemeth that the effect proceedeth: euen as
when the water of the poole of <hi>Siloe</hi> being mooued or ſtirred
by the Angell, did ſeeme to heale, they ſay that God healed of
himſelfe and by himſelfe, euen then after the touching of
the water. Others doe beleeue that this ſupernaturall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is giuen to the things themſelues, ſo that the ſayd water
receiues of God ſuch a vertue, as ſome medicines or ſalues
haue in ſome diſeaſes. For it is as eaſie for God to giue thoſe
properties to a forme, as it was for him to giue them to thoſe
that haue them euer ſince the creation of the world. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
this is not thus done by the diuels, who cannot cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
eſſences or beings, neither indue them with admirable
faculties, ſo that the diuels doe worke the like by illuſions.</p>
                  <p>Behold here then the difference: The foreſaid Chriſtians
doe beleeue that the matter of bread receiueth the forme of
the body of the Lord, or that the forme of bread obtaineth
the hidden properties thereof, or that there is ſome ſpirituall
thing which hath the place of forme in that matter, and
that thereupon dependeth the Myſticall vnion, whereof S.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1878:78"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh. But the Proteſtants, whom ſome call Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
doe hold, that the body of the Lord is onely in heauen, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his quickning forme and vertue, and that a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
proceedeth from<note n="g" place="margin">Confeſſ. of Coyer.</note> him, and is applyed to the ſoules of
men by the vertue of the holy Ghoſt, and that immediately:
which certainly is a very ſlender diſputation, and of ſmall
eſtimation, in compariſon of the report which is made of it:
conſidering that all doe confeſſe, that the bread is really the
communion of the body of Chriſt, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. Alſo
theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> being referred to the whole,
ſhould be ſpoken without figure, but referred to that which
one ſeeth, that is to ſay, to the accidents, and to the matter
through the accidents, they are figuratiue. This conſideration
hath cauſed that thoſe who are called <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> and <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi>
and ſome <hi>Grecians</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> haue treated of ſome
means of agreement, imagining that the difference is not <hi>in
re,</hi> but <hi>in modo rei.</hi> This vnion hath beene hitherto hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by two opinions, which fall into extremities: <hi>Brenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Smidlin,</hi> and others, for the better prouing of the reall,
yea materiall preſence, haue had recourſe to vbiquitie: And
on the other ſide (as <hi>Iurguieius</hi> findeth fault) there are
ſome who ſpeake in ſuch ſort of the receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they haue deſtroyed by their contrary tearmes,
that which they thought to haue built vp, ſaying, that the
faithfull vnder the old Teſtament receiued Ieſus Chriſt, as
they receiue him now a daies: from whence it ſhould follow,
that if there be any myſticall vnion made, it ſhould bee
wrought onely by the Diuinitie, as in times paſt, and not by
the humanity, whereof the holy Scripture alwaies beareth
witnes, that it hath life in it ſelfe, and that it quickeneth. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſay alſo, that a man doth participate of the body of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1878:79"/>
Lord without the Sacrament, in the ſame manner as with the
Sacrament: So that one receiueth but the ſigne at the moſt.
Theſe men ſeeme not to ſpeake properly, for one is not ſaid
to receiue that, which he hath ordinarily. See heere the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
termes that are vſed. But the truth is, that <hi>Vbiquitie</hi>
is reiected in the body by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and the reall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
by the others in the body, as it was reſolued in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
at <hi>Rochell</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and at <hi>Torun</hi> in <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We will bring in here two ſimilitudes, by the which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
others, Proteſtants doe cauſe their meaning to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
and doe ſhewe that the communion which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
is reall, and neuertheleſſe hath no abſurdity in it. The
body of the Sunne (ſaith <hi>Caluin</hi>) is onely in heauen, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the light thereof is here vpon earth. Therefore
many doe hold that light is a ſubſtance, otherwiſe it ſhould
not be found out of his proper ſubiect. Moreouer the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
ſaith, that <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem:</hi>
Wherefore then ſhould not the Sunne of righteouſneſſe haue
power to regenerate a man, though his body be not on earth?
The Adamant ſtone (ſaith <hi>Beza</hi>) draweth Iron, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
it ſelfe with the Iron, through an admirable vertue,
without mingling his matter therewith: In like manner
the body of the Lorde vniteth it ſelfe with a mans ſoule,
though the matter of his body be no where elſe but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Hereupon that is to be noted, which <hi>Gilbertus</hi> a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Phyſition obſerued, that is to ſay, that the forme of the
Adamant is carried out of the limits of his owne matter,
and is found in the Load-ſtones ſubiect, and not in the ayre
betweene both. It may be ſaid likewiſe, that the body of the
Lord doth communicate it ſelfe from heauen without exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1878:79"/>
multiplication, or any mixture of matter. If a man
hold himſelfe firmely to theſe ſimilitudes, he ſhall neuer ſet
his imagination or thoughts vpon the place of Realitie: for
theſe effects of nature are reall and true.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, a man may ſee by that which hath beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that the Churches of the Eaſt and thoſe of the South doe
not approue this laſt opinion, neither that of the Lutherans:
withall, as it ſeemeth, they hold not that of the Latines, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the reall eating of the matter of the body of the Lord:
neyther the abſurdities that followe thereupon; for they
doe openly denie that the Apoſtles did eate the fleſh, that our
Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt did carry about him. This then is
their ſaying or opinion:</p>
                  <p>That the body of the Lord, as touching the matter
and accidents, is onely in heauen, yet notwithſtanding
the bread and wine in the Sacrament are changed into
the body and blood of the Lord, in ſuch a faſhion as
none can vtter or comprehend; in like manner as the
faithfull, which receiue it, are ſaid to be changed into
the true body of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>IN the Liturgie of the Churches of the Eaſt and South,
there are three principall parts, as wee haue beene inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by thoſe of that Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The firſt conſiſteth in the hiſtorie or narration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the holy Sacrament: at that time (ſay they) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
one doth pronounce theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi>
it maketh not the conſecration.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part is the prayer or prayers, wherein they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
God that the ſignes may be changed: then ſay they, is the
conſecration made. For by prayers a man obtaineth that
which he demaundeth: and our Sauiour did the ſame after
that he had taken bread, for it is ſayd that he bleſſed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1878:81"/>
The third part is, when they addreſſe their wordes to the
people, ſaying, <hi>Take, eate, this is the body of the Lord:</hi>
Words which declare vnto the people, and teach them, that
it is that, which is preſented vnto them. In like manner our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſpake to his Apoſtles, not to the bread, when
he ſayd, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body.</hi> The Proteſtants doe
ſay (as the foreſaid people) that they doe bleſſe the bread and
wine principally through prayers, and not through thoſe
words, to the which God hath not giuen any intrinſecall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

                  <p>The difference betweene the Church of <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and

that the bread bee changed into the body of Chriſt:
but do aske and obtaine that that body may be giuen them in
the Communion, which they ought to ſue for. All men alike,
doe condemne the opinion of the Latins, who beleeue that
tranſubſtantiation is made by theſe words, <hi>Hoc eſt enim

great difficulties and doubts amongſt themſelues, in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                  <p>That the conſecration and Communion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

man will aske, whether Chriſtian people doe beleeue or haue
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1878:82"/>
beleeued, that after the vſage of the Sacrament, the body of
the Lord be in the reſt of the bread and wine conſecrated, and
whether the reſt of the bread and wine bee holy things, or
whether they haue no holineſſe in them, euen as the water of
Baptiſme, which is not ſcrupulouſly kept, after it is once v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
The Romane Church holdeth the affirmatiue, that is to
ſay, that the bread being loſt, the wine being ſhed or ſoaked
into wood, are and ſtill remaine the true bodie of Chriſt, as is
to be ſeene by the cautions of the Canon before alleadged. But
ſeeing that other people take not ſuch care to keepe the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and to gather them vp religiouſly; it followeth, that
they beleeue not that it is in any wiſe the body of our Sauiour
Ieſus Chriſt. When we ſpeake of the remnants, we meane not
that which is pretended to be kept for the ſicke: for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
is thought to abide ſtill chaunged in thoſe places
where that cuſtome is, to wit, in the Eaſt: but not in the
Churches of the <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> or <hi>Aethiopians.</hi> The <hi>Maronites</hi>
of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> who ſucke the Sacrament of blood with a pipe,
cannot draw out all. Thoſe that doe eate with little reuerence,
and doe caſt away the rest of the ſacred bread, attribute no
more to it. The <hi>Abyſſins</hi> although that they waſh the baſen
wherein the Sacramentall bread was, and doe drinke the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

ſeeing that they cauſe the little children perforce
to eate this ſacred bread, it cannot be otherwiſe, but they muſt
needs looſe ſome of it. As touching that which is practiſed
amongſt other nations, to vſe wooden Chalices, that ſheweth
manifeſtly that they attribute not, or that their Anceſtors
haue not attributed any diuine vertue to the leauings which
ſoaketh into the wood. Howſoeuer the law of <hi>Pope Pius</hi> be,
it is not obſerued: for the wooden Chalices nor the pipes are

From thence may be gathered,</p>

worſhip not the Sacrament, or Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament;

doe all that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> requireth.</p>

Chriſtians of the world, who (ſaith he) doe worſhippe or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, euery one <hi>Suo modo.</hi>
And if one can ſhew that the Proteſtants doe the ſame alſo,
<hi>Suo modo:</hi> thoſe that ſearch out occaſion to complaine, ſhall
they not haue reaſon to be content? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaketh of
the worſhipping of the ſignes, and of the worſhipping of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt ſignified In both theſe the Proteſtants doe vſe
ſuch adoration as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe doth paint out. Thoſe
that honoured our Sauiour being in his Clothes, had not any
intention or meaning to honour or adore his cloathes: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
following the example of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> be it that a man
haue no intention to honour the Sacrament, he is blameleſſe.
If <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doe ſay, that the Cloathes of the Lorde were
worſhipped <hi>per accidens:</hi> I doe anſwere him, that in like
manner the Proteſtants doe honour the ſignes <hi>per accidens</hi>
In Germany they receiue the Sacrament vpon their knees:
The conſtitutions of<note n="g" place="margin">Can. 23.</note> England do ordain the like. In ſo doing
they doe adore Ieſus Chriſt before the Sacrament, that is to
ſay, the Sacrament <hi>per accidens,</hi> with a more humble cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
then the Chriſtians of the Eaſt doe, who (as <hi>Vilamont</hi>
ſaith) receiue it not vpon their knees. The Churches of
the South doe the like. If the Frenchmen doe follow their

                  </p>
                  <p>The Romane Catholikes themſelues doe not kneele alwaies
when they pray or adore, as it is ſeene in the benediction of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1878:90"/>
the table, it ſufficeth then in adoring to haue the head vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
according to the ordinance of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> As for the
reſt, thoſe of the Eaſt doe eleuate or lift vp the Chalice in
ſaying to the people <hi>Proſchomen, agia tois, agiois:</hi> let vs
prepare our ſelues, holy things are for holy people. Theſe words
doe ſhewe that this eleuation of the Cup is not to require a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
adoration, nor to be a ſigne of a ſacrifice: but it is done
after the example of Ieſus Chriſt, who ſaid to his Apoſtles,
<hi>Take, eate.</hi> In like manner it is very well ſpoken to all the
people, that they may prepare themſelues to take it, yea, our
Sauiour did ſhew it to his Apoſtles, when he ſaid <hi>Take,</hi> and
the Apoſtles ſaw it. And when there bee many people in
a Church, and the Altar is low, it cannot be ſeene of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
without eleuation: but there needeth not any ceremonie
of inclination or bowing then (for the eleuation is not to
that end) it is good at the very inſtant of receiuing. If the
queſtion be of the adoration of Ieſus Chriſt, there is none that
will not confeſſe, but that he ought to bee worſhipped properly
and with that honour called Latria, in the Sacrament. But
the Proteſtants ſay that to doe this, men muſt lift vp their
hearts on high, as it is ſaid in all the <hi>Syrian, Grecian, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
and <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Liturgies.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words <hi>Surſum Corda,</hi> doe declare that we muſt
worſhip him in heauen, and ſuch as he is: in ſo doing we ſhall
not deceiue our ſelues. But he ſhall deceiue himſelfe that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gith
him to be vnder the figures: for if he doth honour him
vnder them, as if he were there in ſuch manner as he is in
heauen, that is to ſay, hauing his diſtinct parts, he is deceiued,
for it is not ſo: and on the other ſide, one cannot imagine
ſuch a humane body, as it is ſaid that hee is; to wit, without
dimenſions, taking vp no place, without order of parts: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1878:90"/>
the leaſt part of his feet and armes, with the leaſt part of
his head, without ſeeing, hearing, feeling, or mouing &amp; yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
A man cannot comprehend ſuch things, he conceiueth
that which preſenteth it ſelfe before his eyes, that is to ſay the
<hi>Figures,</hi> and erreth in the fact, although that he had no euill
intention (thinking that it had bene materially.) Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
a man cannot know whether the Prieſt hath had a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to conſecrate, and ſo, either one deceiueth himſelfe, or
elſe cannot know whether he be deceiued or no. But one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deceiued, if hee remember <hi>Surſum Corda:</hi> for ſo a
man adoreth both Ieſus Chriſt, with true worſhip, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
<hi>Per accidens,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will haue it. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
alſo of the eleuation ſerueth to auoid an important
queſtion, that is to ſay, <hi>Whether the ceremonie of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
ſacrifice bee made in the very body of Ieſus
Chriſt.</hi> It appeareth here not to be ſo, for if it be not made
by the eleuation (as it is certaine that the foreſaid people doe
beleeue, ſeeing they make no eleuation) it is not made nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the breaking of the bread, for the bodie of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
cannot be really broken: nor in the diſtribution, for that
belonges not to the eſſence of the Sacrifice, but rather to the
Sacrament: It followeth then, that the Ceremonie of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
is not made outwardly in the proper perſon of Ieſus
Chriſt, and conſequently it is a Sacrifice purely mentall and
ſpirituall. From this aboue written, and from the practiſe
of the Apoſtolicke Churches it followes:</p>
                  <p>That none ought to eleuate the Sacrament, neither
with an intention to cauſe it to be adored, nor to offer
it to God: vnleſſe (peraduenture) that he doe it to ſhew

                  <p>THis is a very hard point to be vnderſtood: Firſt it may
be demaunded, whether the Euchariſt be a ſacrifice: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what that is that is offered: Thirdly, whether it be
expiatorie: Fourthly, whether it profite them that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
not: Fiftly, whether it may ſerue to obtaine the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion
of Saints.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, All Chriſtian people doe hold it for a ſacrifice, yea
the Proteſtants, <hi>Marcyr, Beza,</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius: Bucanus</hi>
calleth it (with the Catholicke Church) <hi>a Sacrifice not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1878:94"/>
bloudie:</hi> Euery one ſeeth plainely that it is ſo. If therefore
the Auncient Fathers haue aſcribed vnto this holy Sacrifice
the propheſies of <hi>Malachie,</hi> and others, they are not perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
farre wide from the intention of the Prophets. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
if the principall end of this action is to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
the name of Sacrament is more fit and conuenient
for it. In a Sacrifice one offereth, at the Sacrament one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth:
here one receiueth not, becauſe he hath not firſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but one offereth, to the end he may receiue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. The difference is not ſuch in the thing which is
offered: One cannot offer but either gifts, or Ieſus Chriſt: But
he explanes not his meaning, which ſpeakes on this faſhion,
that is, to offer Ieſus Chriſt: he was offered onely once, when
vpon the Croſſe he beſought God, that hee would receiue his
paſsion, then preſented in ſatisfaction for al the ſinnes of the
world. Moreouer he is a continuall interceſſor for men,
and preſenteth to God, not a new paſsion, which might be
the formall cauſe of expiation: for that was once done, and
cannot be done againe, vnleſſe he ſhould die againe: but hee
offereth a continuall ſacrifice of that paſsion, in that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly
intreateth, that God would receiue that very ſame
paſsion: And to deſire of God to receiue or accept a thing, is
to offer it to him. Well then, if men doe beſeech him, that hee
would accept and receiue the paſsion of Ieſus Chriſt, they offer
it him, euen as Ieſus Chriſt offred it him: but with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that Ieſus Chriſt offred it by himſelfe alone, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly;
and men doe it by the meanes and interceſsion of
the great Sacrificer, and by ſeconding his ſacrifice, and adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their owne vowes. But ſome man will ſay, hereupon it
followeth, that in all praiers Ieſus Chriſt is offered. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerere
is, that there are foure ſortes of offering: the firſt is,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1878:94"/>
that by the which Ieſus Chriſt offered himſelfe in ſuffering
on the Croſſe: then he beſought God either by expreſſe words
or in ſilence, that God would receiue his paſsion there preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Secondly, Ieſus Chriſt at his laſt ſupper by the breaking
of the bread, and by the diſtributing thereof, repreſented his
Paſsion, and obtained of God that the Apoſtles might receiue
that expiation, which was to be merited by his then appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
paſsion. In like manner he is offered in the Euchariſt,
and that faſhion of offering by ſignes is called Sacrifice.<note n="x" place="margin">We ſpeak with the voice, the heart, &amp; by ſignes, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in his 2. booke and 30. Chap. <hi>De Imag.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, vnder the Law they offered ſacrifices, which figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the paſsion of the Lord, and his onely Sacrifice: but thoſe
were bare figures. For the Fathers, although that they knew
that they ſhould be ſaued by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> yet they knew not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
or at leaſt cleerely, that the ſame ſhould be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
by his ſacrifice vpon the Croſſe and paſsion of our
Sauiour: It is to be ſeene, that the Apoſtles themſelues, euen
after that they had beene inſtructed, could not conceiue this
in their hearts and ſoules. So that the auncients in ſacrifiſing
intended not to offer the onely ſacrifice of the Paſsion of
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is a mentall ſacrifice, which is made euery
time, that one beſeecheth God to receiue the ſacrifice of Ieſus
Chriſt: But becauſe that there is no viſible thing therein,
neither the Paſsion of Ieſus Chriſt, nor the repreſentatiue ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie
thereof: therfore it is not properly called a ſacrifice.
It ſeemes that this before may be agreed vpon, as well by the
Latins, as by the Proteſtants: but behold here the difference.
The Liturgies, and amongſt the reſt that of the Romane
Church, doe not explicate this point cleerely: but ſay indiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly,
that God receiueth Ieſus Chriſt: ſo that one cannot know
whether it muſt be vnderſtood, that God is intreated to re
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1878:95"/>
receiue or except the action preſented by the Prieſt being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
in himſelfe; or whether one deſireth that God would
receiue the ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt repreſented by the action
of the Prieſt. Moreouer one cannot know whether he ought
to vnderſtand, that God receiueth Ieſus Chriſt conſidered in
his Paſsion; or conſidered as he is beleeued to be in the hands
of the Prieſt. For if a man pretend to offer him in this laſt
faſhion, that will not be to preſent or repreſent the auncient
and only ſacrifice, but to make another, and of another quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
although that it be the very ſame hoſt. And it is this
very point, that the Epiſtle to the Hebrews doth contradict,
ſaying,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 5. to the 15.</note> 
                     <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt offreth not himſelf again,</hi> That
is to ſay, conſidered in the eſtate wherein he is at this preſent;
but yet he offereth himſelfe, as hee is conſidered in the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of his Paſsion alwayes preſented before God. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
(which of other men might haue bene better expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
being well and truely diſtinguiſhed, may take away the
offence riſen thereupon. But it is not in theſe dayes that theſe
words of offering Ieſus Chriſt, haue troubled the Chriſtian

dead. Some men doe diſpute of the Canon of the
Greekes, which ſpeaketh more ſtrictly then the Latins,
that is to ſay, that in the Maſſe the Sonne of God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
himſelfe to his Father, and is offered by the hands
of the Prieſt, and whoſoeuer contradicted that fiction
was depoſed and baniſhed.</hi> Hereby a man may ſee that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1878:95"/>
haue beleeued that the meaning of the Liturgie is, that
Ieſus Chriſt is offered, being conſidered ſo, as he is beleeued to
be there: which being taken in that ſenſe, cannot bee true.
And it is nothing to the purpoſe, to ſay that becauſe hee is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
therefore it is neceſſary that he ſhould be there really
and materially: for Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">Aduer. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. cap. 34.</note> ſaith, that <hi>Altare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum
eſt in coelis:</hi> Our Altar is in heauen, and likewiſe the
hoſt. Ieſus Chriſt is alſo very neare to God, and the ſame
Chriſt conſidered in his onely ſacrifice, is in heauen, as he was
on the earth. Say it bee true, that all the foreſaid Chriſtians
doe thinke (as it hath bene ſaid) that the matter which was
the matter of bread, is the matter of the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt,
in this faſhion it may bee ſaid to bee preſent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but that is not of the eſſence of that ſacrifice, ſo as the
Church pretendeth. When I name the Church, I doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the Doctors and Teachers thereof, if they haue not
well explaned themſelues, will doe it better hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is no great difficultie in the demaund, that
is, whether that ſacrifice be expiatory and propitiatory. If it
be meant in that ſenſe, as prayers are called propitiatorie,
there is no danger. The Publicane ſaid, <hi>Be mercifull (O
God) vnto me a poore ſinner.</hi> This was done, God was
mercifull vnto him, he receiued remiſsion and forgiueneſſe
of his ſinnes, and obtained all this by his prayers: a man obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
no leſſe in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some man may aske whether the Liturgie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth
them that Communicate not. The <hi>Africanes</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
for the Proteſtants: for they ſay no Maſſe, neither
for the liuing, nor for the dead. As for the <hi>Grecians</hi> they
make no great matter for thoſe that communicate not: but
admit that they ſay for them particularly, or that they doe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1878:96"/>
comprehend them in the publike Liturgie: they diſtinguiſh,
and that very well, ſaying, that in the Liturgie there muſt be
two things conſidered. Firſt the praiers and gifts which are
preſented, that (ſay they) doth profite thoſe which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
not. The Proteſtants confeſſe the ſame, for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in the prayers of the Liturgie, doe pray for men: well
then to pray, giue and offer in the Church, to obtaine Gods
grace for another, is a deede which cannot be euill: all which
is graunted for thoſe that are aliue and Communicate not:
for as concerning the dead, the Grecians meane thoſe that are
in Paradiſe, as hereafter ſhall bee declared: therein they are
not approued, neither by the Romane Catholicks, nor by the
Proteſtants: ſeeing neither the one nor the other pray for the
Saints which are in Paradiſe. Now remaineth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
point, yea all the Sacrament, to wit, the breaking and
the receiuing thereof. The Grecians doe ſecretly confeſſe,
that it was not inſtituted, to the end that thoſe which eat and
drinke thereof, ſhould obtaine by that eating and drinking
any benefit, for thoſe that did neither eate nor drinke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
which is as much as to ſay, that priuate Maſſes are abuſes,
being conſidered as a ſacrifice and Sacrament: but yet that
they profite thoſe for whom they are ſaid, in conſideration of
the prayers and gifts. Neuertheleſſe, leſt all ſhould ſeeme to
be attributed vnto this holy Sacrament: they ſay, that the
ſame doth verily profite, but God knoweth how. Their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
being ioyned with the practiſe of the Churches of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi>
and of <hi>India,</hi> doth giue vs good occaſion to gather, that
the greateſt part doe hold, that ſuch Liturgies profite thoſe
nothing which Communicate not, whether liuing or dead:
vnleſſe onely in conſideration of the prayers which there are
made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:1878:96"/>
Fiftly, the queſtion is, to know whether the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Sacrifice was inſtituted to obtaine the interceſsion
of Saints, the healing of diſeaſes, and ſuch like. If all this be
beſides and againſt the intention of Ieſus Chrriſt, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that it were an abuſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert it to other vſes. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Trent doth excommunicate thoſe that hold this to be
euill: it would be knowen, whether this Councell bee allowed
by the Apoſtolicke Churches. The <hi>Grecians</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">1. Reſp. c. 13</note> ſay, that in
their Liturgie they make mention and remembrance of the
Saints: but this is not to ſay, that they thinke that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
was ordained to that end. Likewiſe, although that
the <hi>Armenians</hi> doe kiſſe and ſalute one another in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie;
yet no man will impute vnto them, that they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that it was inſtituted for to kiſſe &amp; ſalute one another.
If the Romane Catholikes cannot ſhew, that the foreſaid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
doe ſay their Liturgies of purpoſe for to obtaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the interceſsion of Saints: It is a hazard but they will be
found alone in that opinion: attending to ſee if that will be,
we will here conclude, as well vpon this laſt Article as vpon
the precedents, and will ſay,</p>
                  <p>That the Liturgie which the Latines call the Maſſe,
and the Proteſtants the Lords Supper, is a Sacrifice
wherein the Communicants, by the receiuing of the
Sacrament and Prayers, doe obtaine forgiueneſſe of
their ſinnes: and by their prayers and offerings, and not
by the Communion, doe profite thoſe that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
not: but this Sacrifice is not inſtituted to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the interceſſion of the Saints, nor for any other
vſes.</p>

authoritie to the Patriarkes and Metropolitanes to ordaine
other Biſhops. Alſo the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople, Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
Antiochia, Alexandria,</hi> and others haue equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
euery one in his owne quarter, and they are inſtalled
into their charges by thoſe of their quarter without incroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
one vpon another.</p>
                  <p>Alſo thoſe of the Clergie of England haue their odinay
and lawfull ordination: for if the Church of England did
voluntarily ſubmit it ſelfe to receiue Ordination and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
from the Church of Rome, ſhe might challenge her
auncient right. Touching the Paſtors and Euangelicall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of other places, the Romane Catholikes doe thinke them
as much, or rather more, intruded without vocation, ſeeing
that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> themſelues, and others were no
Biſhops, and conſequently excluded by their Canons from the
power to ordaine. But the anſwere is, that indeed a Prieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
as a Prieſt, cannot ordaine, but a Prieſt authoriſed by a
companie of Prieſts, may: for he hath the place and power of
the body of the Presbetery. If a companie of Prieſts cannot
make a Prieſt a Biſhop, the <hi>Pope</hi> could not be a lawfull Biſhop
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1878:100"/>
of Rome: for he is not made Biſhop of Rome, but by Prieſts and
Cardinall Deacons, that is to ſay, the principalleſt of the
Church of Rome; it followeth therefore,</p>
                  <p>That Ordination dependeth not vpon an vniuerſall

vs, that they holde it not neceſſary, and therefore it is not
vſed, although they holde it as a Myſterie, to fill vp the tale
of the ſeuen holy numbers. <hi>Sacranus</hi> witneſſeth, that in his
time (which is but a hundred yeares ſince) the Moſcouites,
and conſequently the Grecians did beleeue, that this oile was
onely to heale diſeaſes. But becauſe that <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſayth, that
it ſerueth for the body and the ſoule, and alleadgeth for it the

                  <p>HEre is a queſtion concerning the wordes <hi>Sacrament</hi>
and <hi>Myſterie.</hi> As touching the word Sacrament, noe
Chriſtian Nation is holden to vſe it: for it is grounded nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vpon Diuine law, nor Eccleſiaſticall Catholicke law. The
word is Latine, and the Catholike Church neuer ſpeaketh La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
but onely Greeke in the vniuerſall Councels. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Proteſtants will call none Sacraments, but Baptiſme
and the Euchariſt, they doe nothing either againſt God, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Church. But theſe two Ceremonies are by them
eſteemed ſo holy, and ſo authenticall, and to haue ſuch preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
that they thinke it meete and reaſonable to cal them by
ſome peculiar name: firſt becauſe that they are common to
all thoſe of the Church: ſecondly, becauſe that they haue a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſubſtance or matter, ordained by Ieſus Chriſt: and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe that the holy Scripture doth attribute very much
vnto them.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, the Proteſtants are contrarie to the Eaſt
Church, both in the name and in the thing it ſelfe: for that
Church beleeueth that there are ſeuen Myſteries. Here is
to be noted, that as concerning the word Myſterie, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
haue not as yet put it in vſe, and haue not defined
what that is, which may be called Myſterie. That word with
them is further extended then the word Sacrament: and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1878:107"/>
which is yet more, they confeſſe that the word Sacrament may
be taken more largely, and they proteſt, that they will neuer
be ſuperſtitious about words. <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſaith, that it was
neuer yet ſtood vpon, but that abſolution of Penitents might
be called a Sacrament. <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaith, that Impoſition of
hands in anie Ordination, may be called a Sacrament. And
the Apologie of the Confeſsion of Ausburg ſaith the verie
ſame. Confirmation is commaunded in the Canons of the
Engliſh Church: and <hi>Caluin</hi> deſireth that it might be vſed
and practiſed. The Annointing or Vnction of the ſicke is
likewiſe a Sacrament, yea euen at this time, as <hi>Monſieur de
Moulin</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">In his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the demands.</note> ſaith: for the reaſon wherefore it is not vſed, is,
becauſe that men ſee not the effects of thoſe daies. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Marriage, if it be likewiſe taken ſimplie, they neuer
call it a Sacrament: It is common both to the Iewes, Turkes,
and Pagans; but if one ſpeake of the marriage of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
conſidered as it is contracted, and bleſſed in the face of
the Church, it may be called, as the Patriarch <hi>Ieremie</hi> calleth
it, a Myſterie or a Myſterious action, and a holy celebration.
And if all, or the moſt part of Eccleſiaſticall actions may bee
called Sacraments, then more properlie may they by them be
called <hi>Myſteries:</hi> for although that the word of God in it
ſelfe be alſo called a Myſterie, yet more particularly when it
is emploied in ſome holy action. The Churches of Affrica
hold not for Sacraments, neither the <hi>Chriſme</hi> nor the oile of
Extreame Vnction, as <hi>Zaga-Zabo</hi> one of their owne Biſhops
and <hi>Aluares,</hi> who dwelt many yeares in <hi>Aethiope,</hi> doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Theſe men are more credible then <hi>Titelman,</hi> and
ſuch like, who neuer were there. Peraduenture the Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins

words, it will be no inconuenience to make this concluſion,</p>

that there are none there but the Virgine Marie, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture)

their errors (ſaith <hi>Villamont</hi>) are not ſo great as theſe
of the <hi>Grecians:</hi> for they beleeue that the righteous are in

                  <p>BEhold here two queſtions: the one concerning faith or
beleefe, the other concerning the practiſe of the Church.
Firſt, A man may demaund, Whether the Saints doe
vnderſtand our praiers? The Romane Catholik Church doth
anſwere, that they vnderſtand them in the viſion or ſight of
God, as in a glaſſe. The beleefe of the Eaſt Church is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which ſaith, that the Saints doe not vnderſtand anie
thing at all: and indeede, as it hath beene ſaid in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
queſtion, they beleeue not that the Saints doe enioy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
felicity in the viſion of God. But rather they hold with
the Reformed Churches, which doe abhorre this Inuocation
of Saints, eſpecially becauſe the Church of Rome doth attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
vnto them, that which appertaineth to God, and which
God neuer communicated to any creature whatſoeuer, to wit,
to haue an habituall knowledge of the thoughts of men: for
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1878:111"/>
if any Prophet hath had by reuelation any knowledge, the
ſame was by an extraordinarie diſpenſation. S.<note n="o" place="margin">De cura pre mort.</note> 
                     <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
ſaith, that if the Saints haue any care of the liuing, it is
euen as the liuing haue care of them, to wit, the one not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any particular knowledge of the eſtate of the other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The other queſtion is, to know whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for a man to recommend himſelfe to the praiers of the
Saints. Here they commit three <hi>Logomachies:</hi> The firſt
is in the word to <hi>Inuocate</hi> or <hi>Inuocation,</hi> which ſound ſo il
in the eares of the Proteſtants, that they therfore doe abhorre
all other Chriſtians. <hi>Ieremie</hi> Biſhoppe of Conſtantinople,
auoucheth, that this word is improper: It reſts onely then to
finde out a word more pleaſing and fit.</p>
                  <p>Well then thus it muſt be, to recommend a mans ſelfe to
the praiers of Saints, is to attribute vnto them ſome diuine
matter; but on the contrarie ſide it confeſſeth them to bee
creatures, ſubiect to the Creator, nay it is to debaſe them,
when a man doth deſire them to pray for him, which is as
much as to endeuour to ſtirre vp their piety and charity.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>Logomachia</hi> is in the word <hi>Interceſſor,</hi>
which they vſe for want of another, to ſignifie him that prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for another. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, that Ieſus
Chriſt is the onely Interceſſor, and therefore if the Saints
are heard, it is by reaſon of Ieſus Chriſt the Interceſſor, as
well for the liuing as for the dead. In like maner, the Saints
dead and liuing are in the ſame ranke, and the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
are Interceſſors vnto Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe for the
liuing.</p>
                  <p>The third variance in words is, in that the Grecians and
the Latins doe pray thus, <hi>Saint</hi> Peter helpe vs, our Lady haue
pittie vpon vs vs. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith that this is, as if one
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1878:111"/>
ſhould ſay, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> helpe vs through thy prayers: but the
Protestants would that men ſhould ſpeake plainely, and they
are as farre from receiuing theſe tearmes, as the Latines are
little diſpoſed to correct their <hi>Howers,</hi> or the Grecians
their <hi>Horologe,</hi> (for ſo they call their bookes of prayers). It
appeareth not that the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> vſe this manner of
ſpeech: yea <hi>Hondius</hi> in his Coſmographicall Cart or Map,
ſaith that they do in no wiſe call vpon the Saints. <hi>Aluares</hi>
neither ſaith not that they doe, which he would hardly haue
forgotten, if it had bene ſo: ſo that if they haue no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
but that which is found in their Liturgie, a man
may thinke that theſe are rather <hi>Apoſtrophes</hi> and <hi>Proſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popaeaes,</hi>
to ſtirre them vp to deuotion, then true inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
as alſo the Proteſtants doe ſing with the Pſalmiſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prayſe God yee Angels of great power, yee Angels
of God, which doe all that he commaundeth, as ſoone
as you heare his voice.</hi> As for other matters, two things
are obiected againſt this inuocation or exhortation of Saints
practiſed by the Grecians, Armenians, &amp; other of the Eaſt: the
one, that it is an idle &amp; vnprofitable interpellation, ſeeing
that the Saints vnderſtand not at al thoſe that pray vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Whereunto they aunſwere, that the ſpirit of Charitie, which
they haue, vnderſtandeth the Prayers, and knoweth the
thoughts of men, and that this ſpirit was promiſed them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the end of the world: It ſeemes that by this word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
which they vſe, they meane the holy Ghoſt, dwelling in the
faithfull: for the Patriarch <hi>Gennade</hi> taketh it in this ſenſe,
in that place of Scripture which wee haue alleadged in the
Preface of this Treatiſe, where it is ſaid, that all the Apoſtles
had one ſelfe ſame teacher, to wit, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. So that the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Grecians ſhould be this, that it is good to recommend
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1878:112"/>
our ſoules to the prayers of Saints, becauſe that the holy Ghoſt
which dwelleth in them, and which vnderſtandeth the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of them that are liuing, doth moue the Saints to pray for
them. The other obiection is, that there is no commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God to recommend a mans ſelfe to the Prayers of the
dead. They anſwere, that God commanded the friends of <hi>Iob,</hi>
to goe vnto <hi>Iob</hi> to pray him, to pray to God for them, and
that there is no impediment, why a man may not doe the like
to the Saints that are dead. The greateſt argument herein,
is the cuſtome receiued from antiquitie in the Catholike
Church. The intention or meaning thereof now a dayes is,</p>
                  <p>That the Saints doe not vnderſtand the Prayers of
the liuing, neuertheleſſe it is lawfull for vs to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
our ſelues to their Prayers, becauſe that the holy
Ghoſt, the ſpirit of Charitie, which dwelleth in them,
doth induce them to pray for the liuing, either in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
or in particular for thoſe that recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to their prayers.</p>

namely in the Canonizing of<note n="x" place="margin">Bellar. de Sanct. beat. lib. 1. cap. 18.</note> Saints: and by tradition
of the Catholike Church: the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ought to bee
held for a particular Church. This aboue written doth ſhew
that the moſt part of Chriſtians doe not hold for Saints thoſe
which the Pope hath canonized. If any man ſay that the
Church cannot erre: I will anſwere, that from thence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that it cannot be, that ſhe can vndertake to Canonize
them, whom ſhe neuer did while they were in their bodies.
The Church cannot make a new article of Faith. Pope <hi>Leo</hi>

Saints; before they were honoured by cuſtome, and not

where they name none Saints, but thoſe auncients which liued

the falſhood of their Legends: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth, that

                  <head>ANNOTATION.</head>
                  <p>THere are diuers and ſundry opinions touching Images.
Firſt the Mahometiſts will haue none at all. Secondly,
the Iconomaques do thinke it vnlawfull to haue any in their
Churches. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> held this opinion, ſaying, that it is
againſt the authoritie of holy Scripture, that the Image of a
man ſhould hang in a Church, but hee citeth not the place of
Scripture: Alſo the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> doe not beleeue
that ſo learned a man did write the Epiſtle, where the ſame is
found. Thirdly many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> now a dayes doe ſay, that
it is not expedient to place Images in Churches, confeſsing
thereby that the ſame is a thing of it ſelfe indifferent.
Fourthly <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſaith that Images are profitable in
regard of the hiſtorie, and decent for the Ornament of
Churches: and that the abuſe maybe auoided by the preaching
of true Doctrine. Fiftlie, the ſecond Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> after
Saint <hi>Baſill</hi> and others (followed by the Churches of the Eaſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1878:115"/>
and <hi>Africa</hi>) doth teach that it is lawfull to bow downe before
Images: and becauſe that the law of God is by ſome oppoſed
thereunto, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down to them,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
aunſwereth by diſtinguiſhing, that there are two faſhions
of inclining or bowing. The one <hi>Latria,</hi> which is to haue
truſt and confidence in that thing, before which a man bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
or to proſtrate himſelfe altogether before it. The other
is the inclination called <hi>Dulia,</hi> which a man vſeth when hee
meeteth with one of his friends: (for in the Eaſt Countreys,
the cuſtome is to bow their heads in ſaluting one another, as
they doe put off their hats in Fraunce) in this faſhion ſaith
the Councell, it is lawfull to bowe or incline before Images:
And which is more, the ſame Councell ſaith, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
or bowing, doth altogether tend to the thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented:
the meaning of the Councell was explaned in this
verſe, <hi>Hanc videas, ſed mente colas, quod cernis in ipſa.</hi>
Behold the Image, but honour in thy heart, that which it doth
repreſent.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, to the end that none ſhould thinke that this
is ſome particular Ceremonie belonging to Images onely, the
Councell and the <hi>Grecians</hi> doe hold to this day, that paſsing
before any Church or Croſſe, or in taking vp the holy Bible, a
man ought to encline or bow his head, which is as much as
for a man in France <hi>to put off his hat:</hi> and that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
ſaith the Councell, that is to ſay, hauing the heart eleuated vp
to God. The <hi>Abyſſins</hi> doe not paſſe beyond theſe limits. They
haue pictures in their Churches, but the people very ſeldome
enter into the place where they are: they are not vpon the
Altars, towards the which they turne themſelues in praying.
Alſo if they doe incline or bowe their heads, it is in paſsing
before Churches, Croſſes, or the ſtones of the Altar. The Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1878:116"/>
perſons enter not into the Church with their hoſe
and ſhooes on, according to that which God ſpake to <hi>Moyſes,
Put off thy ſhooes, for the place where thou ſtandeſt is
holy ground.</hi> He that commeth by a Church, if he be a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
will alight, vntill he be paſt it. Behold here the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the <hi>Africanes.</hi> They of the Eaſt doe paſſe theſe
limits; eſpecially the leſſer, for they ſtand ſtill, while they
pray and bow their head before the images, but they kneele
not downe. <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſaith, that it is not in fauour of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages:
for all the honour is carried to the patterne; as if
he ſhould haue ſaid, that they are honoured onely by accident,
as when a man ſaluteth any one, he putteth off his hat, before
his habite, without hauing any meaning or intention, to doe
it in honour of his habite. So that wheras they pray before the
pourtraict or Image, it is, (ſay they) to ſtirre vp themſelues
to deuotion, and to ſhew how much they honour the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.
All theſe exceptions take no place amongſt the
Proteſtants. <hi>We ought not</hi> (ſay they)<note n="h" place="margin">Obſ. in harm. Conf. Sect. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>attribute to the
Images of Saints any kind of worſhip, either Ciuill or
Religious, for the ſame cannot be done without dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
ſuperſtition.</hi> It ſeemes that this is the greateſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the Proteſtants haue againſt the Churches of the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> Neuertheleſſe this cuſtome is not now a
dayes, the auncient doctors which deſtroied the Pagane ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
haue approued it: their deuotion did lead them to it.
Peraduenture no man will thinke it ſtrange, if he conſider
the perſons, time, and place. Thoſe Fathers might defend
themſelues, as hauing the Spirit reſting vpon them inſignes,
which is not granted to the meaner ſort of people. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
of the Eaſt haue beene alwayes giuen to ceremonies. It
was the cuſtome to bowe the head before the Images of
Kings and Princes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:1878:116"/>
                     <hi>Artabanus king of Perſia</hi> (ſaith <hi>Suetonius) worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the Eagles and the Images of the Emperous.</hi> The
Grecians at this time doe argue thus: If it be lawfull to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the head, in paſsing by the Image of a King, why not in
like manner by the Image of Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>They of theſe Countries doe anſwere, that it is not the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
amongſt them, to vncouer their heads before the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
of<note n="i" place="margin">2. Reſp. ad Gre.</note> Kings: whoſoeuer ſhould doe it, would be held ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.
In like manner, if a man ſhould doe ſo before the
Image of a Saint, the Proteſtants would call it ſuperſtition.
The <hi>Romane</hi> Catholikes doe paſſe very often by Churches,
and Images, without once mouing their hats, or bowing their
bodies: Neither doe they ſo, when they take in hand their
<hi>Howers,</hi> or the holy Bible. The cuſtome in theſe parts is, to
put off the hat, when in publik acts the King is named: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
the Proteſtants in England doe ordaine, that men put
off their hats at Sermons, when they heare the name of<note n="k" place="margin">Can. 18.</note> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.
In like manner all countries haue their cuſtomes: that
which is ridiculous and ſuperſtitious in one place, is held and
eſteemed comely and religious in another. The moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
way would be, in ſtead of calling one another Idolaters
and Heretickes, to exhort one another charitably, to doe all to
edification; to auoid the appeareance of euill, and exceſſe, and
not to ſcandalize the Infidels and vnbeleeuers. <hi>If any Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell
doe enter into the Church</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) will not
he ſay, that you are out of your wits?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner, when an Infidell or vnbeleeuer doth ſee a
Chriſtian praying, with his eies fixed vpon an Image: will
not he ſay, that he ſpeaketh to the Image? Intreaties, obteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and mutuall demonſtrations doe ſerue ſometimes to
procure the peace of the Church, but iniurious ſpeeches will
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1878:117"/>
neuer take away ſchiſmes, and the paſſages or places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which are alledged, to make that ſeeme vnlawfull, which
is but vndecent: do not cauſe eyther the ſuperſtitious to leaue
their ſuperſtition, or the leſſe deuout their irreligion. The
ſtrife founded vpon the Equiuocation of the Greeke word
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> edifies as little. A great part of the Church will
neuer conſent to a manifeſt alteration. Thoſe that gouerne
the Church, doe ſweare at their entrance, to follow the tract
of their Predeceſſors: but it happeneth very often that euill
cuſtomes doe ware away by laps of time, although not ſo faſt
as thoſe which are good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>neuer ſtaieth vpon theſe termes, as</hi>

produce the teſtimony of the Primitiue Church, by the
which the vſe of the interceſſion of Saints is corobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But as I doe affirme this, ſo I alſo confeſſe, that it
doth greeue me, that vnder pretext of I know not what
<hi>Dulia,</hi> it is affirmed, that one may and ought to honour
with adoration the Saints and their Images? The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
of the auncient Church haue preached to the
people, that they muſt honour, but not worſhippe or
adore the Saints: Well then, if they haue truely ſpoken
thus of the Saints, what thinke you, would they haue
ſaid of the Statues and Images of Saints worſhipped
in <hi>Appearance,</hi> and honored with the manner of Diuine
worſhippe? Thoſe who in Churches adore Images
through any appearance, ſeeme not much vnlike thoſe,
which in times paſt worſhipped Gods and Goddeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Where is the ſobrietie of our vnderſtanding, to bow
or ſtoope before carued or molten Images, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1878:117"/>
to the law of God? vnleſſe peraduenture wee
would offend the Iewes, the Saraſins, and thoſe which
are parted from vs, through ſuch like enormities? The
ſtrange nations, of whom we haue ſpoken (to wit the
Chriſtians of the Eaſt and South) haue very holily kept
and obſerued the law of God touching adoration, and
haue honoured the ſoules of the Saints, in rendering to
God that which appertaineth to God, and to the Saints
that which appertaineth to the Saints: for who can
find colours alwaies to excuſe himſelfe if he daily being
too much giuen to vice, doe fooliſhly ſearch out extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
by miſtaking the meane?</p>
                  <p>From this diſcourſe of <hi>Wicelius</hi> a man may learne two
things: Firſt, that the Churches of the Eaſt, and of Affrica,
are not fallen into the errour of the Latines. Secondly, that
in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there are good people, which will not
be Idolaters, no not in outward appeareance, They are to be
well aduiſed, whether it be tollerable for them to ſtay in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to call her Mother and Miſtreſſe, and
to hold them for heretickes which doe depart from her, and
yet withall to call her Mother and Miſtreſſe of Idolatrie.
For it is certaine, that ſhe approueth not onely the appeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of euill, which <hi>Wicelius</hi> condemneth, but alſo the euill
it ſelfe. And for the ſame cauſe <hi>Thomas of Aquin.</hi> hath
beene canoniſed by her, yea honoured by a ſolemne feaſt, as a
Saint and a true Teacher: and it is he that maintaineth,
that a man ought to adore and worſhippe Images with the
ſame adoration or worſhippe as the thing repreſented; to
wit, the Image of Ieſus Chriſt with <hi>Latria,</hi> and thoſe of the
Saints with <hi>Dulia,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that the Images are alſo the
obiect of adoration: againſt which doctrine, the learned Earle
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1878:118"/>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">In Apol. de im.</note> 
                     <hi>Picus</hi> hath written, who neuertheleſſe denieth not, that a
man ought to adore Images: but not, ſaith he, with that
adoration which <hi>Thomas</hi> maintaineth.</p>
                  <p>Some man may aske, if <hi>Thomas</hi> went beyond the meane,
in the adoration of Images, how ſhall we call that errour and
vice? The Image adored with <hi>Latria,</hi> ſhal it not be an Idole?
and he that adoreth it in like maner, ſhal he not be called an
Idolater? But this opinion is not yet forgone in the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> their great Doctor main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
it. <hi>We muſt not</hi> (ſaith hee) adore the Images
onely by accident or improperly (as the Grecians ſay) <hi>but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
properly, and in themſelues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The foreſaid Chriſtian people are alſo contrarie to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that they will not haue the Diuine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
painted, eſpecially in the Churches: and follow the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their Doctor <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> although that there are
ſome Grecians in places neare to Italy, which take libertie
herein, as may be ſeene in their <hi>Horologies,</hi> printed at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
Moreouer they abhorre Images of Gould, Siluer, wood
and ſtone, as ſmelling of Paganiſh idolatry, and haue none but
pictures. The concluſion of this queſtion, according to the
opinion of the foreſaid people, is,</p>
                  <p>That it is lawfull, but not neceſſary, neither (perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture)
profitable to bow, or vncouer the head before
Churches, Altars, Croſſes, Pourtraitures, or Images of
Saints, or in handling holy Reliques, or the bookes of
the holy Scripture. That it is ſome appearance of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie
to paſſe theſe limits. That it is plaine Idolatry
to adore Images properly. That it is an imitation of
the Pagans to haue Images of releefe in Churches. That
it is follie, and impiety to make an image of God.</p>

                  <p>THere are three things to bee regarded in a Monaſticall
life. Firſt, the will to liue in a Chaſte ſingle life, ioyned
with the deede. Ieſus Christ approueth this will and this<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 19. 11</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.
That is the cauſe that the <hi>Grecians</hi> did extoll it, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> but with hyperbolicall termes, as may bee ſeene
in their anſwere to the Diuines of <hi>Wittemberg:</hi> They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that if it be a Diuine and ſupernaturall guift, then it
ought not to bee eſteemed vnprofitable, neither as a humane
inuention. The hate which a man beareth to the abuſe of a
thing, ought not to preiudice the true vſe of it. They call
that life Angelicall: Acertaine <hi>Grecian</hi> expounding that
word, hath told vs, that they beleeue that the life of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loiers</hi>
is Angelicall, as long as they doe good, but diabolicall
as long as they doe euill. Secondly, is to be noted the Cuſtome
of thoſe that will follow this inſtitution, to aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in Colledges. The Proteſtants condemne not that. The
Monaſteries (ſay they) were in times paſt houſes, where ſome
did labour and worke with their hands, others did exerciſe
themſelues to ſerue in the Church. The third thing to bee
noted is the <hi>Vow.</hi> The Proteſtants likewiſe do not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemne it, but in that (ſaith<note n="c" place="margin">Inſtit. lib. 4. cap. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Caluin</hi>) it is made by
thoſe that haue not the power to accompliſh that which they
haue vowed; the ſame Author doth thinke that a Vow may
be taken at threeſcore yeeres of age: For S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let
not a widdow be taken into the number vnder that age.</hi>
That Canon of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath not beene obſerued by his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
for afterward were they receiued at fiftie yeeres of
<note n="d" place="margin">Nouel. 6.</note> age, and after<note n="e" place="margin">Nouel. 123.</note> that at fortie. Neuertheleſſe, the ſame is
continued, and is as yet held in the Eaſt Churches, becauſe it
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1878:120"/>
is neceſſarie that he that Voweth, ſhould haue knowledge by
long experience, that he hath receiued of God power to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
and performe that which hee hath vowed, contrarie to
which the doctrine of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> is, which ſaith,
that a Vowe may be made at ſixteene yeeres of age. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Churches would not allow of diuers Sects of Munkes and
Friers: and therein are differing from the Latine Church, or
rather contrarie to it. As touching the begging of Munkes,
the proofes before alleadged doe ſhew that theſe Churches ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
it not. Amongst the Latines themſelues, there were
many which haue condemned it, as Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the third
<note n="f" place="margin">De uerb. ſig<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 2.</note> ſaith. In the Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> the ſolemne vowes of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie,
Pouertie &amp; Obedience, are not vſed, as in the Church
of Rome. Therfore the beliefe of the foreſaid Churches is,</p>
                  <p>That ſuch may vow Chaſtitie, as know by ſufficient
experience, that they haue power to accompliſh &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

beare the name of diuers Sects, nor conſume by their

becauſe that there are too many ſcrupulous
people, which take more heede to the externall ſeruice of God,
then to the truth of beliefe, it ſhall not bee much beſides the
purpoſe, to giue here aduertiſement touching Feaſtes and
faſting. It is therefore to be vnderſtood, that the Apoſtles
neuer made in common any order touching Feasts and Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
If they had, it would haue beene knowne, for the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
would haue beene alike amongſt all Nations, which is
not, nor neuer was. Incontinently after the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> gouerned, yea,
where S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught, were found to differ from
the Church of Rome, touching the Feaſt of Eaſter. There is
no doubt, but that the Feaſts of the Apoſtles were ordained
a long time after their deceaſe. As touching faſting, there
are two ſorts: The one (which is truely and properly faſting)
is abſtinence from all kind of meate: this faſting is obſerued
and very much vſed in <hi>Aethiop,</hi> and amongſt all the <hi>Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites.</hi>
The other kind of Faſting, is an abſtinence from the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1878:123"/>
moſt delicate and delicious meates. Againſt which Faſting,
the Proteſtants doe bring this ſentence out of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>The

ſhall giue heede vnto the ſpirits of errour, and doctrine
of Diuels, which teach lies through hypocriſie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
to abſtaine from meates, which GOD hath
created, to bee receiued with giuing of thankes.</hi> Some
will demaund whether the Proteſtants doe pretend, that this
place of Scripture is abſolutely againſt Lent and obſeruation
of Fridayes: <hi>Zanchius</hi> anſwereth no. Lent was inſtituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the yeere 139. and the Author is not knowne: For the
conſtitution of <hi>Teleſphorus</hi> ſerued but to confirme that,
which was then already receiued: So that if ſome of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were not the inuenters thereof, yet it is certaine that it
was ſome of their Diſciples, all the reſt conſenting thereunto.
The ſaying alſo of S. <hi>Paul</hi> cannot be applied to that inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that this forbidding ſhould bee in the
latter dayes. The ſame <hi>Zanchius</hi> ſaith, that Lent was free
vntill the time of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth, that is to ſay,
vntill the yeare 1075. And that this Pope did forbid (in
the Latine Church) to eate fleſh, vpon paine of mortall ſinne:
And that this prohibition ſo abſolute and exact, is that
whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh: For otherwiſe it is not a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
or forbidding. The Romane Catholikes do bring
other exceptions, to wit, that theſe meates are not forbidden
as euill of themſelues: Another anſwereth them, that Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the vſe of them muſt not be forbidden, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the ſame ſort of Marriage, which is not forbidden,
but onely to thoſe which haue vowed neuer to marrie. Alſo
vnleſſe one doe vow not to eate fleſh, the vſe ought not to be
abſolutely forbidden him. The Latines ſay alſo, that they
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1878:123"/>
forbid it not, but for certaine times. The contrary part doth
reply, that it is euer a forbidding. <hi>That which is white
for one day</hi> (ſaith<note n="r" place="margin">Eth. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle) is no leſſe white, then if it
had beene ſo a whole yeare.</hi> As for the Chriſtians of the
Eaſt, they are more exact obſeruers of Faſting and abſtinence
then the Latines are, although that their Church hath not
this doctrine, that it ſhould be vnto them a mortall ſinne:
Zeale and deuotion is many times imitated by ſuperſtition.
The Reformed Churches haue their Faſts, and do keepe them
ſtraightly, and the common people amongſt them might fall
into ſome ſcruple of conſcience, but that they are oftentimes
aduertiſed of their Chriſtian libertie.</p>
                  <p>It hath beene ſaid before, that the Ethiopians doe beleeue,
that the commandements of the Church doe not binde a man
vpon paine of mortall ſinne. And in that point they are
manifeſtly on the Proteſtants ſide, as the Grecians alſo are,
if they hold that which their aunceſtors held: all alike doe
beleeue, that the Biſhoppes may both make lawes, vſe their
cenſures, and impoſe certaine puniſhments vpon the infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
or breakers of them: but not forbidde as God, <hi>If thou
doſt eate of this fruit, thou ſhalt die the death, both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
and eternall.</hi> So that ſome ſcruple is noted among
Chriſtians, but the doctrine which they confeſſe, is,</p>
                  <p>That the Church may ordaine holy or feſtiual daies,
together with abſtinence of all or ſome kind of meats:
neuertheleſſe not ſo as to bind the conſcience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
contempt or ſcandall: and the diuers practiſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
doth ſhew, that there is no Catholike eccleſiaſticall
law, which hath ordained either feſtiuall daies, or faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
daies, or the manner of keeping thoſe feaſts or faſts.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Councell of <hi>Baſil</hi> hath declared the Pope
to bee ſubiect vnto the Church. If the ſame
were beleeued at this day by the Latines, as it
is by all other Chriſtians, it were ſufficient to
make a peace. If the Pope may tranſport that
Sea out of Rome, the Church may doe it farre better; yea the
Eaſt Church might haue done it at ſuch time, as it was greater
then the Latine. It followeth alſo, that all that the Popes haue
ordained, approued, or tollerated, is vnder correction. If there
had not beene ambition in him, or in his Clergie of Rome, hee
would haue heard the Catholike voyce of the Church: This
ambition is the cauſe, wherefore the Grecians doe call him an
Arch-hereticke, the Indians a reprobate Biſhoppe, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
the ſonne of perdition. Thoſe that liue vnder him vſe
not theſe termes: Neuertheleſſe they are not farre wide from
this beleefe. If the Duke of Venice ſhould preſume to call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
Monarch, and that the moſt part tooke armes againſt him,
calling him Tyrant, Capitall and Principall enemy of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
and that there were others more patient then
they, which confeſſed that in truth he was not ſuch a one, as he
counted himſelfe to be: neuertheleſſe beleeued that he ought
to be ſupported: I pray you would not all theſe Cittizens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
together in the principall point, although they were of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
opinions in the manner of proceeding?</p>
            <p>Father<note n="a" place="margin">De Sacr.</note> 
               <hi>Coton</hi> after many others, maketh an argument here,
which he thinketh to be inuincible: The Sonne of Perdition
(ſaith he) muſt ſit in the Temple of God according to Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> that is to ſay, in the Church of God, according to<note n="b" place="margin">Vpon the 2. Epiſtle to the Theſſ. cap 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome:</hi>
And we muſt not goe out of the Church, for out of
it there is no ſaluation; therefore we muſt continue vnder the
ſonne of perdition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The Temple of God is all the earth: in this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
there are many Epiſcopall Chaires, which (as Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi>
ſaith) are one nuptiall bed of Chriſt, that is to ſay, which make
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1878:124"/>
but one Church, which begetteth children to God by baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
Well then, if hee that ſitteth in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire teacheth
not at all, who will gaine-ſay, but that without forſaking the
Church, one may goe to heare him which ſittes in Saint <hi>Peters</hi>

<hi>Andrew</hi> in Conſtantinople? Some will ſay that the Proteſtants
doe not take this way: But we haue ſhewed that if ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
were laid apart, and that <hi>Logomachies</hi> were eſchued, there
would want but little of agreement: and ſcarce would there be
any diſcord, but onely in theſe foure points: Firſt, about Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
Secondly, praiers to Saints: Thirdly, the time of making
Monaſticall vows: Fourthly, about the conuerſion of Bread and
Wine in the Euchariſt, and peraduenture not ſo great as is
imagined.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, it is decreed in the ſecond Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> that
one ſhould put off his Hat in paſſing before a Church, a Croſſe,
an Altar, an Image or portraict of a Saint, hauing the heart lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vp to God. The Proteſtants doe call the ſame ſuperſtition.
See, here is a great hereſie, a trimme ſubiect to diuide Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie!
<hi>Panigarolas</hi> confeſſeth that one may altogether let paſſe
Images, why not then this ceremonie? The Catholicke Romans
know well enough, that ſometimes they were not vſed at all.
And <hi>Wicelius</hi> ſaith that wee ought to eſchew all appearance of
euill. In the time of S. <hi>Baſil</hi> there was tolleration herein. <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius</hi>
brake the peace, peraduenture his iniurious ſpeeches
haue beene the cauſe, why men did more in hate of him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Queſtion, whether one ought to recommend
himſelfe to the Prayers of the Saints, is of the ſame nature.
They of the Eaſt Churches doe confeſſe, that the Saints doe not
vnderſtand our Prayers: Neuertheleſſe, that the holy Ghoſt
which they haue, doeth induce them to pray and to crie <hi>Abba</hi>
father, (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) that is to ſay, in generall, for thoſe that
recommend themſelues to their Prayers. The Proteſtants doe
confeſſe that the Saints doe pray, and that one may wiſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
that they would ſo doe; notwithſtanding, they hold it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
to addreſſe our Prayers vnto them, ſeeing that wee doe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1878:125"/>
know that they vnderſtand vs not. <hi>Melancton</hi> thinketh that one
might peraduenture vſe the ancient maner, that is, to direct
our Prayers to God, in making mention of the Prayers which
the Saints doe make: So that all doe tend to the ſame end, but
doe differ in termes.</p>
            <p>The third difference is of leſſer importance. It is certaine
that in the time of the Apoſtles, the widowes were receiued,
without any regard to their age: If there had beene no abuſe, S.
<hi>Paul</hi> would not haue made mention of Reformation. If the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loiers</hi>
of the Eaſt, and the <hi>Antonians</hi> or <hi>Eſtafarus</hi> of Aethiop, are
not good people, it is for the Biſhops of thoſe Prouinces to
prouide and ſee to it, as alſo they ought not to thinke much,
that other Nations haue found out a lawfull remedie.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt point, is the Queſtion ſo much diſputed
vpon now a dayes, touching the changing of the Euchariſt.
Here without doubt is a difference in mens beliefe. But the
Reformed Churches haue not debated againſt the Catholike
Church, and are not ſeperated from them of the Eaſt and the
<hi>Africans,</hi> for they were not in their vnion. Moreouer, thoſe
that denie it, ſhewe themſelues ready to communicate with
them that beleeue Conſubſtantiation, which not withſtanding
by their ſaying, is almoſt as contrarie to the Articles of Faith,
as the <hi>Romane</hi> Tranſubſtantiation. Leſſe occaſion haue they
to hold themſelues ſeperated from the other Apoſtolicke Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which (as hath beene ſaid) beleeue not Ieſus Chriſt to be
any where elſe then in heauen, touching his humanitie: And
their beliefe, containeth not any thing that doeth contradict
the Scriptures, although they be not able to conclude the ſame
neceſſarily out of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The beliefe of theſe Churches is, that by Prayers the Bread
is changed into the body of the Lord, as Chriſtians are, and
that in both there is a change not onely in name but really. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that ſome ſupernaturall thing proceeding from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the body of the Lord, which is onely in heauen, is infuſed
into the matter of bread, and from thence paſſeth into the ſoule
of the Communicant, and hath the place of forme both in the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1878:125"/>
one and in the other, and cauſeth that both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be called, after a ſpeciall faſhion, the body of Chriſt: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that they ſuffer a change through the obtaining of a new
forme, or elſe their forme ſuffereth a change through the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of new faculties. And that is the reaſon, why aſwell the
ſaid Churches as the Reformed, doe confeſſe that (as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
writeth) <hi>The bread is the Communion of the body of the Lord;</hi>
The difficultie therefore lieth in this point, to wit, whether the
Bread hath poſitiuely in it ſelfe this forme or faculties: to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
them vnto the Soule by it ſelfe: Or whether the ſoule
receiueth them of the Bread, becauſe that the holy Ghoſt which
is preſent in the Bread, as in all things, cauſeth that when one
receiueth this bread, he receiueth the body of Chriſt, by meanes
of this eſſence, or faculties which proceede immediatly from
the ſame body. If there were as much Charitie in men as zeale,
they might find this aboue mentioned tollerable, vntill an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
and lawfull Councell.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, it is the part of the louers of truth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of hereſies, to ſearch and ſeek out the truth, ſufficiently
contained in the holy Scriptures, wherein if they find any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie
(which they ſhall not in thoſe things neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation)
it is their part to haue recourſe vnto the voice of the
Churches, to the which our Lord hath promiſed his aſſiſtance.
And if they be not of one accord, then to ſuſpend their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
or elſe with a holy libertie to trie all, and to retaine that
which they take to be good in euery one of them. If you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
thus (Chriſtian Reader) you will no more ſay, I am of
<hi>Paul,</hi> and I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> but rather you ſhall bee true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes
and Orthodox Chriſtians, and in no maner Idolaters or
Heretickes, Grecians nor Romanes, Papiſts nor Huguenots,
Lutheranes nor Caluiniſts, Proteſtants nor Puritanes: and
make them lyers, that ſeeke to ſtaine your beautifull and holy
profeſſion, with names ſo infamous and vnworthy of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
people and true Chriſtians.</p>

But we thought it a labour as much vnprofitable, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious

hath written a volume against the Grecians, wherein hee ſpeaketh
almoſt of nothing elſe. That we may not omit any thing of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
we doe aduertiſe, that there are two euill Ceremonies found
among the Grecians. The firſt is, that they vſe Leauened bread in
their Sacrament: The other that they abſtaine from things ſtrangled
and from blood: In both they thinke themſelues grounded vpon the
holy Scripture, The <hi>Grecians</hi> hauing oppoſed themſelues againſt
the <hi>Latines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In anſwer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Ausburg.</note> doe reprehend them becauſe they vſe litle Wafers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened,
and not ordinarie Bread, as our Sauiour did. They doe
not thinke that this word Bread, agrees to thoſe Hoſts or Wafers,
and that moſt commonly that name is not giuen them. Moreouer to
make their faſhion ſeeme better, they haue thought good to ſay, that
Ieſus Chriſt did not inſtitute this Sacrament in the dayes of ſweete
bread. As for vnleauened Bread, the Romane Catholickes doe not
inſiſt much vpon it. And it is not ſo important a matter of faith,
to know vpon what day the Sacrament was ordained, prouided that
one pretend not to preiudice thereby the Hiſtorie of the Goſpel, the
paſſages or ſentences whereof may bee better reconciled through the
one,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 15.</note> then through the other. As for abſtinence from things ſtrangled
and from blood: It is founded vpon the decrees of the Apoſtles aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in Ieruſalem, the which Decree they doe not thinke to be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
becauſe that their Church which they hold to be true and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke,
hath ſtill obſerued it: Yea, this maner of abſtinence hath
beene confirmed by the ſixt Synode. There is likelyhood that they
haue remitted this to a generall Councell, for they haue not much
preſſed this point againſt the Latines. The <hi>Aethiopians</hi> are both
in the one and in the other, on the Romanes and Proteſtants ſide. In
<pb facs="tcp:1878:126"/>
               <hi>France</hi> the Proteſtants doe vſe leauened Bread, after the faſhion of
the Grecians.</p>
            <p>Againſt the Churches of the Abyſſines in the South is obiected
that they are rebaptized euery yeare: But the Ambaſſadour of
<hi>Preſter-Iohn</hi> ſaith, that the cauſe why they bath themſelues in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
and Ponds, is not becauſe that they thinke it neceſſary to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but they doe it vpon the day of the Epiphanie in remembrance
of the Baptiſme of our Sauiour. It is to be noted, that this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
is new amongst the Abyſſins: for their King <hi>Dauid</hi> which
raigned but about ſome hundred yeares agoe, ſaid that the ſame was
by the inſtitution of his Grandfather. The Romane Catholikes haue
no occaſion to impute this vnto the Abyſſins for an errour: ſeeing
that in the Church of Rome they baptize Bells, and contrary to the
practiſe of the Apoſtolicke Churches, they ſprincle water euery day
entring into their Churches, for remiſsion of veniall ſinnes, a cuſtome
taken eyther from the Iewes, as the Grecians doe reproach them, or
elſe from Pagan Idolaters.</p>
            <p>The other accuſation againſt the Iacobites is, becauſe that they
tollerate Circumciſion: vpon which <hi>Berthius</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>They cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe

for <hi>Herodotus</hi> witneſſeth, that the Ethiopians in times paſt
likewiſed vſed it. It hath beene likewiſe thought by ſome, that the
Iacobites baptize with fire: But the Hiſtoriographers and thoſe of
the Countrey doe certifie vs, that the ſame is not ſo: but they make
inciſions in their temples, either for comlines, or els for their healths
