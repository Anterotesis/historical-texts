            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>PSAL. cxij. 4.</bibl>
               <q>To the Vpright there ariseth Light in the
Darkness:—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>GOdliness,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>hath the promise of
this life, as well as of that which is to
come.</hi> Of this Proposition of his, the Psalm
we have now before us, may seem to be an
Explication or Paraphrase.</p>
            <p>For in this Psalm Two things are designed,
A description of the <hi>Pious</hi> Man; and a descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his <hi>Blessedness</hi> in this Life: each of which
is done in five instances or particulars.</p>
            <p>The terms wherein the <hi>Pious</hi> man is here
describ'd, are these following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, He is one that</hi> Feareth God and greatly
delighteth in his Commandments, <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is one that is <hi>Righteous</hi> and
<hi>Vpright</hi> in his Conversation, v. 4. &amp; 6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He is one that is Prudent and
Discreet in the managing of his Affairs, v. 5.
<hi>He guideth his affairs with discretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, He is one whose <hi>Heart is fixed
trusting in the Lord,</hi> v. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98156:4"/>
               <hi>Lastly, He is one that is extreamly Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
He is</hi> gracious and full of Compassion, <hi>v.</hi> 4.
He sheweth favour and lendeth, <hi>v.</hi> 5. He hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed,
he hath given to the poor, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Blessedness</hi> of such a man as this,
as to this Life, is describ'd in the five instances
following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first of which is, A great and Happy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
thus, v.</hi> 2. His seed shall be mighty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, the generation of the Vpright shall be
blessed.</p>
            <p>The second is, A Plentifull and an Ample
Fortune, thus in the 3d. v. <hi>Riches and Plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
shall be in his house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is, A lasting Fame and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thus again in the 3d. v. <hi>his Righteousness
remaineth for ever,</hi> and likewise in the 6th. v.
<hi>He shall be had in everlasting remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth is, Honour and Power and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
even such as shall excite the Envy of the
Wicked, thus in the 9th v. <hi>His horn shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
with honour, the wicked shall see it and
shall be grieved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The fifth is, Great Safety and Peace in the
midst of Dangerous and Troublesome times,
thus in the Text, <hi>To the Vpright there ariseth
Light in the Darkness.</hi> i. e. <hi>Light</hi> in the greatest
Straits and Difficulties; for that is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98156:4"/>
of <hi>Darkness</hi> in this place. Times of
<hi>Darkness</hi> in the Scripture Language are Evil
and Difficult and Dangerous times. Now
upon account of this <hi>Light</hi> that ariseth to the
<hi>Vpright man</hi> in Evil times, it comes to pass as it
followeth, v. 6, 7, 8. that such a one <hi>shall not
be moved for ever, neither shall he be afraid
of evil tidings, for his heart is established, and
he shall not shrink untill he see his desire upon
his Enemies.</hi> Or as the Chaldee perhaps better
renders it, <hi>untill he see redemption in distress.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the just Analysis of the whole Psalm.
Now of these several Characters whereby the
Pious man is describ'd, I have pitch'd upon
that of his <hi>Vprightness</hi> to give an account of
and to recommend to you at this time. And
of the several Instances of the <hi>Blessedness</hi> of
such a man I have pitch't upon that of <hi>Safety
and Peace</hi> in the midst of Perillous and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
times. These two points I have
chosen to entertain you upon, as judging
them most suitable to the present occasion,
and to our present circumstances. And we
find them both join'd together in the words
of the Text, <hi>To the Vpright there ariseth Light
in the Darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then we have Two things to consider,
First, The <hi>Person</hi> to whom the <hi>Promise</hi> here
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98156:5"/>
made, or the <hi>Blessedness</hi> here mentioned doth
belong, It is the <hi>Vpright man.</hi> Secondly, The
<hi>Promise,</hi> or the <hi>Blessedness</hi> it self, It is <hi>Light in
times of Darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the Character of the Person to
whom this Promise is made, He is the <hi>Vpright
man,</hi> or as in our more common Language
we express him, the <hi>Honest</hi> man, the man of
<hi>Integrity.</hi> We all know so well what is meant
by these words, that it would render the thing
more difficult to offer Critically to give Light
to them. As all those General Terms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a mans whole Duty is exprest in Scripture,
have their several respects and considerations
which difference them one from the other,
though they be all equally Comprehensive:
So hath this term of <hi>Vprightness.</hi> That which
it immediately and particularly respects, is
the Goodness of a mans Principles, and the
sutableness of his Actions to them. Or thus, The
Conformity of a mans mind to the Eternal
Rules of Righteousness, and the Conformity
of his Actions to the Principles of his mind.
This is that upon account of which any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is denominated Upright, and contrary
to this is all Hypocritical and Partial dealings
in matters of our Duty. So that if we would
give the definition of an <hi>Vpright</hi> man, it should
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98156:5"/>
be in such terms as these, He is a man that in
all things follows the Dictates of his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Or, he is One, that makes his Duty
the Rule of his Actions. Or, he is One, that
always proposeth to himself Righteous ends,
and pursues those Ends in Righteous ways.</p>
            <p>This is the generall description of the <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi>
man: But for the more lively display of
him; and the rendring him, as more Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
so more Imitable, it will be fit that we
represent him a little more particularly under
those several Respects and Capacities in which
his Uprightness is principally seen and exprest.</p>
            <p>And here we must consider him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>God,</hi> and with respect to <hi>Men.</hi> Under
the former Consideration we are to view his
<hi>Religion,</hi> Under the latter his <hi>Civil Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And none ought to be surpriz'd that in the
Character of an <hi>Vpright</hi> man we take notice
of his Religious Carriage towards God. For
in truth that is a point which is Essentially
necessary to Uprightness.<note place="margin">Prov. 14. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> He (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>)
<hi>that walketh in Vprightness feareth the Lord.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
take away Religion and the Fear of God,
and the Foundation of <hi>Vprightness</hi> is destroy'd.
For all the Principles of Conscience, and all
the Obligation to live up to those Principles,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98156:6"/>
is thereby taken away. He that hath no sense
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>od and Religion, can never think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
bound to observe any Rules in his Actions
and behaviour, but what are subservient to the
carrying on his private sensual worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest:
And consequently whatever is Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with that, be it never so base and vile
and injurious, he cannot take himself in point
of Duty, oblig'd to stick at it, when he hath
the least temptation to it. The result of which
is, That he may commit all the villanies in
the world, and yet think himself as Innocent,
and his Actions as Commendable, as if he
had been never so Honest and Virtuous.</p>
            <p>He therefore that is an <hi>Vpright</hi> man, hath a
serious and hearty sense of God and Religion
upon his Spirit, and is above all things care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to preserve and increase that sense. But
then his conduct in this affair is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that of ordinary pretenders to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>For he is a man that doth not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with a meer speculative belief, or an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Profession of the Truths of Religion;
but doth so far impress them on his heart,
that they influence his whole Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
He doth not think it sufficient to
be Orthodox in his Opinions; or to be a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98156:6"/>
Member of a True Church; or to be zealous
in maintaining and promoting the Right way:
But he takes care to live as he believes; to
practise sutably to the profession he makes.
As he holds fast the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Godliness;</hi> so he
never fails to express the <hi>power</hi> of it, in an
Innocent and a Virtuous Life.</p>
            <p>He is a man, that in the whole Conduct of
his Religious affairs, minds Conscience more
than any selfish consideration. He takes not
up his Principles either out of Humour, or
Passion; To advance his Interest, or to please
a Party: But he believes a thing because it is
True, and Professeth it because it is his Duty.
In matters of Religion he hath the indifference
of a Traveller, whose great concernment is to
arrive at his Journeys end; but for the way
that leads thither, be it high, or low, all is
one to him, so long as he is but certain that
it is the Right way.</p>
            <p>And as he doth not chuse his Religion out
of worldly considerations: so neither doth he
quit it upon such. But is resolute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in bearing witness to the Truth against
all opposition whatsoever. As he doth not
make show of his Religion the more when it is
in fashion, and when it may prove advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
to him: so neither doth he practise it the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98156:7"/>
less, when it may prove Ignominious or Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.
He is obstinately Tenacious of his
Principles when he knows them to be good;
and prepared to endure the utmost extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
rather than violate the Laws and Dictates
of his Conscience.</p>
            <p>He is a man that thinks Religion too Sacred
a thing to be prostituted to mean purposes;
and therefore he never useth it as an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the serving a turn; never makes it
a Cloak for the covering a private end, though
he were sure he could compass his designs by
it. He knows that the greatest Impostures
have laid hid under this mask, and by such
Artifices God hath been often made a Patron
of the most horrid villanies.</p>
            <p>He is a man, that doth not place his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in outward forms and services; or in
little cheap duties that cost him nothing. He
hath a nobler sense of God than to think that
such things can alone recommend us to him:
And therefore his principal concernment is,
about the great Indispensable Duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
<hi>The weightier matters of the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 23. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Mercy and Faith.</hi> He hath the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Notions and differences of Good and
Evil, deeply ingraven in his heart, and in the
practising or the avoiding them, he chiefly
lays out himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98156:7"/>
He is a man, that doth not pick and chuse
out of Gods Commandments, which to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to the neglect of the rest: but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
Uprightly and Sincerely to observe
them all. He calls no sin little, because his
temper inclines him to it, or the course of his
Life leads him more frequently into the
Temptations of it. But he hath an hearty Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Aversion to every thing that is Evil. He
holds no secret friendship or correspondence
with any Enemy of God; but fights as reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
against his most agreeable and most
gainfull sins, as those that he hath less Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to upon those accounts.</p>
            <p>He is a hearty enemy to all Factions
in Religion, as knowing the life and soul
of Christianity is often eaten out by them. All
dividing Principles he Abhors; and as much
as he loves <hi>Truth,</hi> he is not less concerned for
<hi>Peace.</hi> And he is better pleased with one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of his Charity in Composing, or his
Zeal in Suppressing Religious differences, than
with twenty of his Skill and Abilities in dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them. For he knows that LOVE is more
acceptable to God, than a right Opinion; and
<hi>to be a Martyr rather than divide and rend the
Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dionys. Alex. in Euseb.</note> 
               <hi>is not less Glorious than to be a Martyr
for refusing to offer Sacrifice to Idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98156:8"/>
Lastly, He is a man, Religious without
noise; and uses no little Arts to make his Piety
taken notice of in the World. For he seeks
not the praise of Men in any thing he doth,
but studies to approve himself to God onely.
And therefore he is as carefull of his thoughts,
as of his actions; and hath the fame fear of
God, and regard of his duty, when no man
sees him; as when he is in the most publick
places.</p>
            <p>These are the great strokes of <hi>Vprightness</hi>
as to <hi>Religion.</hi> And whoever makes good these
Characters, may unquestionably conclude of
himself, that he is an <hi>Honest man</hi> to <hi>God-ward,
A true Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come we now, in the second place, To take
a view of the <hi>Vpright man</hi> in his civil conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
To give some account of him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to his carriage and demeanour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men. And here again we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
him under two capacities, as a <hi>Private</hi>
person, and as a <hi>Magistrate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And First, As a Private person, The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rule by which he frames and modells his
whole conversation, is such a prudent and
diligent care of himself, and his own good, as
is not onely consistent with, but doth effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
tend to promote the Good and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98156:8"/>
of all others that he deals with. This is the
fundamental Principle which he lays down to
observe in all his commerce with Mankind.
For he considers that every man in the world
hath a right to be happy as well as himself:
And he considers, that, as things are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd,
that he cannot be Happy without the
assistance of others: So it is infinitely reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
that he in like manner should contribute
his endeavours to the making them Happy
also. These now being the main principles
of his mind, he takes care in his whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
that his Actions and Carriage be
sutable to them, and bear some proportion
with them.</p>
            <p>And therefore, we may be sure, that he is
a man exactly Just in all his dealings, and
would not knowingly do the least wrong or
injury to any, though he could gain never
so much by it; and were he never so secure
that he could do it without discovery.</p>
            <p>He is a man, that where he is trusted, is
faithfull to the uttermost. Never making ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of mens credulity, nor abusing the
confidence they repose in him.</p>
            <p>He is one, that in point of fair dealing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
man and man, is severe even to Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losity;
and he would rather sit down with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98156:9"/>
loss, than serve his own ends by any practice
that hath but a bad report, that hath but even
the appearance or suspicion of evil in it;
though in the mean time he knows that what
is got by such practices is by some men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
lawfull gain.</p>
            <p>He is a man of great Candour, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and obligingness in his behaviour: But
withall, as on one hand, he is carefull not to
run himself into Inconveniences by his good
nature: So on the other hand, the kindness
and good-will he professeth to all about him,
is more than a compliment, or a semblance of
his countenance. For his fair speeches are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
attended with honest dealings; And
what he once promiseth, he is punctual in
making it good, though it be to his own
prejudice.</p>
            <p>He is a man that loves a good Name and
Reputation, as well as any one, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
tender of it; But yet he scorns to make
use of any evil Arts, either for the procuring,
or preserving it.</p>
            <p>And consequently he is a man, that hates all
mean and servile compliance; and will neither
speak nor doe any thing against the sense of
his mind for the humouring any. Flattery
and dissimulation he abhors, and he dares
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98156:9"/>
speak his mind, when he judges it fit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable;
even though he knows the doing it
will give offence.</p>
            <p>And as he is perfectly averse to all Fawning
and Flattery: so he is above Envy and Detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He never lessens another man to make
himself greater; nor looks upon the prosperity
of his neighbour with an evil eye; backbiting,
and carrying about idle stories is not the thing
he lives by. He puts a fair construction upon
other mens words and actions, and will rather
conceal a real fault, than make it worse in the
reporting it. He hopes and thinks the best of
all men; and rejoyceth in the happiness of those
about him. He doth as much good as he can;
and that good that is done by others, he is so
far from envying, that he thanks God for it as
if he had done it himself.</p>
            <p>He is a man of great Plainness and Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
Apert and open, and free in all his carriage.
You may always know where to have him, for
his words and his thoughts always go together.
And though he is carefull not to be lavish of his
speech, nor at all times to discover all his mind:
yet he is as carefull, that what he doth speak
shall be agreeable to truth; and he so speaks it
that those that hear him, may take measures
of his mind from it.</p>
            <p>He is a man, who though he be very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98156:10"/>
of opportunities to doe himself good, and
very sagacious in spying dangers, and avoiding
them: yet he never uses any indirect means, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the benefiting or securing himself. He
scorns to make advantages of any mans necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
Nor will he undermine another, for the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his own designs. Deceit and Collusion
are strangers to all his dealings. Above all things
he hates a Trick; and in his account to be a
man of Intrigues, a cunning or a shrewd fellow,
is but a more gentile term for a knave.</p>
            <p>In a word, The designs he proposeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
are all Honest and Just, and such as tend
to the good of the Community as well as his
Own, but to no mans loss or hindrance. And
the means he useth for accomplishing these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
are all fair and Regular; and so free is
both his Heart and his Actions from all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,
that he cares not if all the world were
privy to them.</p>
            <p>This is the man that is <hi>Vpright</hi> in his <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi>
towards <hi>Men.</hi> The Man that with the
wisdom of the Serpent joyns the Innocence and
simplicity of the Dove.</p>
            <p>But thus much of the <hi>Vpright</hi> man as a <hi>Private</hi>
Person; Let us now view him a little under a
more conspicuous character. Let us consider
him as a <hi>Magistrate</hi> intrusted with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of publick affairs. (Which is the Second
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98156:10"/>
particular we are to insist on under this head)
And here the Upright man is still the same, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the same Principles, pursuing still the
same designs we have hitherto mentioned. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his Vertues have another Sphere and another
Object, and therefore require another conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>The great thing he proposeth to himself, in
taking any Office upon him, is the glory of
God, and the publick good. The Honour and
Dignity of the place, and the other worldly
advantages that may attend it, are but seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
considerations with him. The first is his
main design which he steadily and constantly
pursues throughout the whole Administration
of his Office; The other is never thought on but
with subordination to the former.</p>
            <p>And therefore acting from such Principles as
these, we may easily conclude him to be a man
whose Counsels and actions are not steer'd by
the wind of popular applause, but by the sense
of his duty. He studies not to ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with men, but to discharge a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
He is more carefull to be a <hi>Good</hi>-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
than to be a <hi>Loved</hi> one; though (so
happily are things contriv'd, that) in being the
former, he rarely fails of the latter.</p>
            <p>The consequence of which is, That he is a
man of great Courage and Boldness, and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98156:11"/>
He dares to do whatsoever is fit, and just,
and conducive to the publick good, what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
soever he meet with. Neither the
menaces of the mighty, nor the murmurings
of the multitude, can fright him from his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For he dreads none but God; nor fears to
doe any thing but what is misbecoming him.</p>
            <p>But then he is a man that doth not resolve
things hastily, and upon the consideration of a
few particulars, but takes good advice, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
mature deliberation before he determines
himself. He doth nothing precipitately: But
weighs all things, represented to him, as impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
as he can. His ears are open to all parties,
and he debates what is said, without passion or
prejudice or prepossession; And he always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
more what is spoken, than who it is that
speaks it.</p>
            <p>He is a man whom you cannot so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
as by attempting to corrupt him. Neither
the regard of his profit, nor his kindness to his
friends, can in matters of Right, tempt him to
act against his inward sense. As to these things
he is as blind as Justice herself, and you may as
soon draw the Sun from his line, as him from
the steady and strict paths of Righteousness.</p>
            <p>He is a man that looks upon his Office ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a burthen, than a preferment. And
therefore he is wonderfully solicitous about
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98156:11"/>
the well discharging it. His care and study is
chiefly employed upon the publick, and he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffers the miscarriage of his own affairs than
that the community by his negligence should
receive any prejudice. While others are doing
their own business, he is watching for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good; for he always remembers that he is
a publick person, and that the time and strength
that God affords him are not his, but theirs, by
and for whom he is intrusted.</p>
            <p>He is a man, that imploys all his power and
interest, as much as is possible, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the worship and service of God, and
the defence and encouragement of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
For he considers God, as the first and
principall person to be respected in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Societies, as being not onely the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
but the Head of them. And he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that Religion doth so much influence the
Civil State, that the happiness and ruin of Cities
and Kingdoms are link'd with the well or ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of it.</p>
            <p>And in pursuance of this his Zeal for God and
Religion he takes care, as much as in him lies,
to encourage those Persons that are Vertuous
and Good, and to suppress and bring out of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
all Vice and Debauchery, all Impiety and
Irreligion, all Faction and Disorder; together
with the Maintainers and Abettors of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98156:12"/>
               <hi>He is a Man, that effectually makes good</hi>
Iob<hi>'s Character of himself,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 29. 14, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>who was also a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate:</hi>
He puts on Righteousness and it cloaths
him, his Judgment is a Robe and a Diadem: He
is Eyes to the blind, and Feet he is to the lame:
He is a Father to the Poor, and the Cause which
he knoweth not he searcheth out: He breaketh the
Iaws of the Wicked, and plucketh the Spoil out of
his teeth.</p>
            <p>He is a Man, that looketh upon himself to
have a Trust, both with reference to those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
him, and those under him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is carefull to carry himself with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
steady hand, with respect to both; studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
endeavouring, both to preserve his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to his Prince, and his Fidelity to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:
Neither invading the Rights of the one,
nor injuring the Liberties of the other.</p>
            <p>He is one, that, next to the Honour of God,
studies the Peace and Quiet of the Place where
he is concern'd. And therefore, as on one hand
he is watchfull in spying out Dangers, and
quick in applying such Remedies to them as
are proper in the Place and Station he holds:
So on the other side he neither takes nor gives
the Alarm upon every slight Surmize, or popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Apprehension. He makes the best of all
things that happen; and by his Prudence and
Moderation endeavours to extinguish growing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98156:12"/>
Flames, rather than add Fewell to them; To
calm and allay mens Jealousies and Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
rather than to excite and increase them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to conclude; He is a Man, that fears
God; that honours the King; that is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Laws; that is true to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that meddles not with them that
are given to change.</p>
            <p>Having thus given you an account of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
man, under the several principal relations
in which he stands; I come now in the second
place, for the comfort of all that are such, and
for the encouragement of all others to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be such; to set forth the advantages and
priviledges, that such a man enjoys in evil and
dangerous times. <hi>To the Vpright there ariseth
Light in the Darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darkness,</hi> as I told you before, is a word by
which the Scripture expresseth any kind of
straits, or difficulties, or adversities. Thus <hi>Job
15. 21. Darkness</hi> is there opposed to <hi>Prosperity;</hi>
thus <hi>Lam. 3. 2. I am the man,</hi> (saith the Prophet)
<hi>that have seen Affliction, by the rod of his wrath
he hath led me and brought me into Darkness.</hi>
And thus likewise, to name no more Texts,
<hi>Joel</hi> 2. 2. The day of Gods Visitation upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
is called <hi>a Day of Gloominess and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
a day of Clouds and thick Darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This now being the Notion of <hi>Darkness:</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98156:13"/>
when it is said in the Text, <hi>To the Vpright man
there ariseth Light in the Darkness;</hi> By <hi>Light</hi> we
may understand any one of these three things,
that is to say,</p>
            <p>By <hi>Light,</hi> we may understand <hi>Light</hi> for his
<hi>Guidance</hi> and <hi>Direction;</hi> and then the sense is, That
in critical and perilous times, the <hi>Vpright</hi> man
of all others, will be best enabled to order and
manage his affairs.</p>
            <p>Or secondly, By <hi>Light</hi> we may understand
<hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Defence,</hi> as the word is sometimes
taken in Scripture; and then the sense is, That
in Evil times the <hi>Vpright</hi> man walks most free
from danger; He of all others may expect se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and protection in a common Calamity.</p>
            <p>Or thirdly, By <hi>Light</hi> we may understand
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> (as that likewise is another usual
sense of the word,) and then the meaning is,
That in evil times, let things happen as they
will, though it should be the fortune of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
man to be opprest in the crowd; Yet this
happiness he will always have, that his mind
will be at perfect ease and peace. Nothing shall
ever discompose him, but in the midst of his
sufferings his heart shall be replenished with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Comfort.</p>
            <p>In any one of these senses the Text may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and in all the Three it fails not to be made
good to the <hi>Vpright</hi> man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98156:13"/>
First, <hi>To the Vpright man there ariseth Light in
the Darkness,</hi> taking <hi>Light</hi> for <hi>Guidance</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
Be the times never so dark, he hath this
happiness, that he is rarely at a loss how to steer
his course. He finds his way easily when other
men are quite bewildred; and he readily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites
himself out of such difficulties as those that
act by other principles find themselves grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intangled with. This is a thing that should
mightily recommend the practice of Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
especially in evil times; and that it is
really attended with this advantage, must needs
be acknowledged upon these two accounts.</p>
            <p>First, To an Upright man his way lies plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and is more easily seen and discovered.</p>
            <p>And secondly, He hath a greater Light to see
it by, than those that take other measures in the
management of their designs.</p>
            <p>First, The Upright man of all others most
easily sees his way, for it lies plain and even, and
straight before him. Whereas the ways of vice
and wickedness are extremely crooked, full of
windings and turnings.</p>
            <p>Whoever pursues evil designs, and is a slave
to base affections, must necessarily intangle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in infinite Labyrinths, through the course
of his life. For having several ends to pursue,
and those many times inconsistent one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
it cannot be avoided but that in many
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98156:14"/>
circumstances he lights into, he will be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at a loss how to behave himself. If he go this
way, then will something come to Light, which
he studiously endeavours to conceal; If he go
that way, then he disobliges some man or
some party whose interest is necessary to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
him; If he go a third way, he destroys that
which is his main design. At what a loss now
in such a case as this must a man needs be in the
determining himself? Upon what a rack is his
understanding put, to get fairly rid of these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties?
And yet such Dilemmas, as these, is
every one that walks not Uprightly, ever and
anon crampt with in his Counsels and Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But suppose he get well over the present diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
yet he is but where he was: For upon the
next emergency of affairs he is as much puzled
and nonplust as before. The same method will not
serve him twice for the carrying on his designs.
As often as new occasions arise, so often must
he alter his Counsels, and take new measures:
so that he is always unsteady; often inconsistent
with himself; utterly unresolv'd what man he
shall be, or what part he shall act, in the next
scene that offers itself.</p>
            <p>These difficulties and perplexities the man of
Intrigues is always hamper'd with; and they
necessarily arise from the various flexures and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98156:14"/>
turnings of the way that leads to his ends: But
the contrary of all this, is the Lot of the Upright
man. For his way neither lies on this side, nor
on that side, but always straight forward. He
hath but one great end to pursue, and that is
to discharge a good conscience: all his other
concernments are wholly regulated by that. The
consequence of which is, That he hath no clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of interests to perplex his deliberations; No
little turns that must be served, to divert him
to the right hand or to the left, but he always
looks straight before him: so that all his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
are easily made; most of those difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that intangle other men are quite cut off
and avoided; his Counsels and his Methods are
always the same; and he is seldom at a loss
how to behave himself upon a new emergency.
In a word, his way is commonly so plain that he
stands in need of little advice or instruction for
the finding it. And this is that which <hi>Solomon</hi>
hath told us, <hi>The Integrity of the Vpright shall
guide him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 11. 3. cap. 4. 18.</note> For, <hi>the path of the just is a shining
light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But secondly, If it be his Lot to fall into such
circumstances, where his way is not so plain;
but that there is need of great advice and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
what course to steer; as it often happens,
especially in such times as the Text speaks of:
Yet here the Upright man hath the advantage of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98156:15"/>
all those that walk by different principles; For
(all other things equal) he has more <hi>Light</hi> to
direct him in the finding of his way than they
have.</p>
            <p>There is this difference, between a man that
walks Uprightly in all his conversation, and a man
that hath sinister ends of his own to pursue: The
former hath always the free use of his Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Powers, and can exert his reason in its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
perfection, and to the best advantage:
Whereas the latter is horribly clouded in his
discerning faculties. He hath constantly a mist
before his eyes, which hinders him from right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distinguishing the objects he looks upon;
and consequently occasions many blunders and
mistakes in the choice of his way.</p>
            <p>My meaning is this, Whoever frames his
life by other Measures than those of Honesty
and Conscience; whoever intemperately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth
his private ends, or is a slave to inordinate
passions, let them be of what kind they will:
these things do clap such a Byas upon his Soul,
as renders him utterly uncapable of making a
right judgment of things before him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
must unavoidably expose him to a
great many dangerous errors in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his affairs; and this oftentimes in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that have no great difficulty in them.</p>
            <p>Take any one of the passions that usually
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98156:15"/>
govern the man that hath no principles of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
Let it be either Fear, or Envy, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
or Vain-glory, or Avarice, or Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it is a wonderfull thing to see, how mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously
they distort his Reason, and what odd
extravagant courses they put him upon; and
this even in plain easy cases; Nay, though the
man, in other things, where his affections have
no influence, be a very wise man. One could
scarce imagine the power that these things have
over a mans Judgment; but that we every day
see such strange instances of it.</p>
            <p>But now the Upright man is not in the least
obnoxious to any of these inconveniences: For
having no turns to serve but those that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and good; having no private Affections or
Passions to be gratified; he looks upon things
in a pure and simple Light, and not through
a coloured glass. And consequently his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of them, as far as humane endeavours
can secure, are according to their nature; and
his determinations and resolutions are suitable to
his conceptions; that is to say, are reasonable,
and fit, and such as become the occasion. As
his main design is to doe in all instances that
which is best; so that design preserves him from
mistaking in: his Notions of what is best. His
Reason and Understanding are free and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
and if there do arise any knot or difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98156:16"/>
he of all others is likely to untie it with the
greatest ease. And this is that which the Psalmist
hath told us,<note place="margin">Psal. 111. 10.</note> 
               <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning
of Wisedome, a good Vnderstanding have all they
that doe thereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But secondly, If we take <hi>Light,</hi> for Safety
and Security, for Defence and Protection, as it
is sometimes used in the holy Scripture: In
this sense also <hi>Light ariseth to the Vpright in
times of Darkness.</hi> For such a man may in the
worst of times, above all other men promise
these things to himself. And this is that which
<hi>Solomon</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 9.</note> 
               <hi>He that walketh Vprightly wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
surely.</hi> And indeed this seems to be the
thing principally intended in the Text; The
<hi>Light</hi> which is here said to <hi>arise to the Vpright
in Darkness,</hi> seemeth chiefly to respect his
Security from Danger in the times of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Calamity; as appears by what immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
followeth; viz. <hi>He shall not be moved for
ever; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his
heart shall not shrink untill he see his desire upon
his Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Security in times of Danger the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
man may expect upon these two accounts.
First, His Uprightness in its own nature (as
things are contrived and carried on in the
world) doth above all other things conduce to
it. And secondly, He is upon account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98156:16"/>
of intituled to Gods more particular protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>First, The Paths of Uprightness are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such as naturally tend to secure a man in
Evil and Dangerous times.</p>
            <p>For first, They do really contribute to the
Good and Happiness of the Publick, in the
which every mans private safety is in a manner
bound up. <hi>As by wickedness</hi> (they are the words
of <hi>Solomon) a City is overthrown:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 11. 11.</note> 
               <hi>so by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Vpright it is exalted.</hi> Every Upright
man, is really a benefactor to the Publick: For
by him and such as he, Cities and Kingdoms
are supported which would otherwise fall into
confusion. The whole Body politick owes its
preservation to the Virtuous Care, and Honest
Endeavours of Upright men. And every such
man in particular reaps the benefit of such his
Endeavours; For he shares in his own person
that protection and security he procures to the
Community. And if he had not been Upright,
as the publick would have fared something the
worse for it: So it is certain he in his private
Capacity, would in the same proportion, have
fared the worse also.</p>
            <p>But this consideration of the conduciveness
of Honesty and Uprightness to the good of the
Publick, I direct chiefly to those that are in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Authority; for really their carriage
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98156:17"/>
and conduct hath a more than ordinary stroak
in the good or bad success of the common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
And therefore it concerns them especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to look to themselves that they be Men of
Integrity, and keep a good Conscience in the
discharge of their trust. Upon their Upright
walking, the safety and preservation of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
doth more depend than upon the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of a thousand private men. Though
they are but particular persons, yet being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with Authority; their Conduct and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
hath as great an influence upon the
common good or the common ruin, as if they
were a Multitude; and single as they are, they
do in a great measure carry the ballance of the
publick Fortune in their hands.</p>
            <p>But secondly, The conduciveness of every
mans Uprightness, to the publick good is not
the onely consideration, upon which it is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
as a means for obtaining safety and
security in evil times. For let the publick go
as it will: In the worst of times; if any man
can in probability be thought able to shift for
himself; if any man can in reason hope
to escape the Violence and Iniquity of the times;
the Upright man, the man of Honesty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
is likelyest to be the man: I say in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he is likelyest and as things commonly go.</p>
            <p>For he of all others takes the surest course to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98156:17"/>
preserve himself; and is least obnoxious either
to the malice or the envy, the undermining or
the rapine, of open Enemies or pretended
Friends.</p>
            <p>All knavery and dishonest dealings set a man
up for a mark to be shot at; but Uprightness
and Integrity is a shield and a protection.</p>
            <p>The Upright man doth so order the course
of his life, that he usually avoids all those rocks
that other men split upon, and which usually
prove their ruin. The undoing of most men
even in evil times, lies commonly at their own
door, and they may thank themselves for it. If
they had been sufficiently carefull of themselves,
the malignity of the times would scarce have
toucht them. It is generally either very great
carelesness and gross neglect of their own affairs;
or the lavishness or intemperance of their
Tongues; or an ill gotten Estate; or private
Injuries they have done, and private grudges
they have contracted; or pragmaticalness in
other mens matters; or factious adherence to a
party; or breach of trust; or treachery to the
publick, or the like: I say, it is these things that
do most commonly draw mischief upon mens
heads, and lay the foundations of all those
straits and difficulties in which they are intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
even in the worst of times. But now the
Upright man doth in a great measure avoid all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98156:18"/>
these occasions; for his principles do oblige him
to walk in a way that is diametrically opposite to
the things I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>The Upright man treads upon such sure
foundations, and his ways are so universally
approved by mankind; that, as things usually
go, no man will easily offer him injury but it
will be to his own detriment.</p>
            <p>The Rule he walks by is such, as doth effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
procure him the most friends and the
fewest enemies, for he takes the course to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
all sorts of men; and consequently he
cannot easily fail, of finding those who will
use their utmost endeavour to assist and rescue
him when he lights into any difficult circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
            <p>His righteous conversation is so unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
and so prudent he is in the management
of his affairs; that those that love him not, will
not easily find an occasion to doe him much
mischief.</p>
            <p>Even those that have no acquaintance with
him, yet have so much concernment for Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and Uprightness in general, that they will
study to give him what assistance and defence
they can, out of a natural sense that it is fit a
good man should be protected; and that, for
any thing they know, his case and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may come to be theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98156:18"/>
And those that have lost all sense of good
and evil, yet out of care to preserve their credit
amongst men (amongst the generality of whom,
to be an honest man will always signifie a great
deal; for when all is done, it is impossible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
the notions of Virtue and Honesty out of
the minds of the multitude:) I say, in point of
their own credit and interest they are concern'd
to be carefull how they oppress such a man.</p>
            <p>But whatever become of these things; how
ineffectual soever all humane means may be,
for the securing and preserving an Upright man
in evil times: Yet in the second place, he has
another Anchor to stay himself upon, which is
more firm and stable, and which will not fail
him: and that is the protection of God All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:
The care of his particular providence
to which he is intituled.</p>
            <p>Men may plot and design; may model and
contrive; may order and manage things as
they please: But when all is done, it is God that
governeth the world; and either blasts their
most fair and hopefull projects; or if he
suffers them to succeed, turns them to what
use and purposes he pleases: Now this God that
Rules and disposeth all things (even the most
particular; <hi>For not a sparrow doth fall to the
ground without his will; and by him the very hairs
of our head are numbred</hi>) This God hath enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98156:19"/>
himself, to take care in an especial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
of those that fear him, and walk Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He hath passed his Promise over and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 37. v. 6, 19, 24, 40, 41.</note>
               <hi>that he will</hi> make their Righteousness as
clear as the Light, and their just dealing as the
noon day. They shall not be confounded in the
perilous time, and in the days of dearth they shall
have enough. Though they fall they shall not be
cast down, for the Lord upholdeth them with his
hand. <hi>In a word, that he</hi> will be their strength
in the time of trouble; he will stand by them and
save them, he will deliver them from the ungodly;
he will save them because they put their trust in
him.</p>
            <p>It would be endless to quote all the passages
in the book of God that speak to this purpose.
And therefore I shall dismiss this point with that
remarkable one which we find in the Prophecy
of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 15. v. 16.</note> wherein we may see, both the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
man, and his security in evil times, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in very lively colours. <hi>He that walketh
Righteously and speaketh Vprightly; He that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the gain of oppressions; that shaketh his hands
from holding of bribes; that stoppeth his ears from
hearing of bloud; and shutteth his eyes from seeing
evil: He shall dwell on high; his place of defence
shall be the munitions of Rocks; his bread shall be
given him; his water shall be sure.</hi> The sence
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98156:19"/>
of which in short is this, That whoever walks
Uprightly and makes a conscience of his ways:
such a man shall be always under the watchfull
care and protection of the Divine Providence.
And never will God suffer him to fall into any
grievous distress; but he shall always have such
a portion of the good things of this world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
to him, as will be sufficient not onely to
make his life supportable, but easy.</p>
            <p>And in truth, The experience of the world
generally makes this good: Honest and Upright
men for the most part, in the most publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
fare well; at least much better than
those that are not so. In their greatest extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
when they have no prospect of deliverance
from any humane means, strange extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
unexpected succour and relief doth arrive
to them. In a word, that care of the special
Providence of God attends them that they are
never miserable, however they may be now and
then cut short in their outward fortunes.</p>
            <p>But it must be acknowledged, that though
Piety and Uprightness hath the promise of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in this Life; and that promise for the most
part, and in general speaking is made good: Yet
there are a great many exempt cases. God may
see it fit now and then to suffer an Upright man
to be opprest, and to perish in a common ruin;
and this without any violation of his Promises
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98156:20"/>
of this kind, which do indeed respect no
more than the ordinary common events and
successes of things. But yet even in this case
still there will <hi>To the Vpright arise Light in the
Darkness;</hi> that is, <hi>Light</hi> in the third sence we
have given of the word, <hi>viz.</hi> taking <hi>Light</hi> for
Peace and Joy and Comfort. And this is that
which the Psalmist tells us in another place,
<hi>Light is sown for the Righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 97. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and Gladness for the
Vpright in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever Afflictions come upon the Upright
man, yet he hath this advantage of other men,
that he bears them infinitely more lightly than
they do; They are really no great disturbance
to him, for he injoys the same calmness and
serenity of mind; the same peace and quiet, and
contentment that ever he did.</p>
            <p>His present sufferings are rather matter of
rejoycing and triumph to him, than of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and repining; for he knows that they come
upon him, by the Counsel and Disposal of the
great Governour of the World: And he
knows that he hath so sincerely approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to God, and is so well beloved by him;
that he should not have been ordered into these
circumstances, had it not been really for his
good. And this consideration doth so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
support him under all the difficulties that
he hath to conflict with, that he not onely sits
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98156:20"/>
down easily and quietly, but is very well pleased
with the dispensations of the Divine Providence
towards him; how ingratefull soever they may
be to flesh and bloud.</p>
            <p>Let what will happen to him, he is full of
Peace and Joy. For he hath met with no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
of his designs. His great aim was
to please God; and his Conscience from Gods
word assures him that he has done it; and he
hath nothing to doe farther but to wait for the
happy time, when the secrets of all hearts shall
be revealed, and every mans Counsels and
Actions shall be made manifest, and then he
doubts not to receive approbation and praise,
and a great Reward in that. Day of the Lord
<hi>Jesus.</hi> And so much the rather, <hi>because this
light affliction, wherewith he is now exercised,</hi> he
is assured,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>will work for him a far more exceeding
and eternal weight of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, Whatever his sufferings be;
he will live and die in a profound peace; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
satisfied with all Gods dealings towards
him: And his Life and Death will verify to all
that know him that advice and observation of
the Psalmist;<note place="margin">Psal. 37. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Mark the Perfect man, and behold
the Vpright, for the end of that man is Peace.</hi>
