            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THOMAS, VICOUNT

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the saying of a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
wise, and great Man, of
our Nation, that <hi>Books of
Use ought to have no
Patron, but Truth and
Reason;</hi> And whether or no I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this <hi>Rule,</hi> in devoting this <hi>Book</hi> to
<hi>your Lordship's Patronage,</hi> will not be
much disputed by Any, who have the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
<pb facs="tcp:60811:2"/>
and Honour to Know you well. For,
whoever understands your general insight
into all Kinds of Learning, your exact
Iudgment in distinguishing Truths from
Falshoods, however subtily concealed and
plausibly delivered, and your strict Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
in all Arguments offered to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
doth need no other proofs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him, that, if You are not <hi>Truth and
Reason it selfe Animated,</hi> yet (at least)
you have them in you, in so eminent a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that it can be no Flattery to say, You
are therein a <hi>Grand Exemplar</hi> to Others:
nor will the most Scrupulous refuse to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
as Authentique and Current, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Position hath once received the stamp
of your Assent and Approbation. So
singular a Felicity it is, to render <hi>Nobility</hi>
more illustrious with <hi>Learning;</hi> to have
long cultivated a fertil <hi>Mind,</hi> with select
<hi>Precepts,</hi> and usefull <hi>Observation</hi> of
Men and Manners; and alwayes to make
mature <hi>Deliberation</hi> the Harbinger to
<hi>Belief,</hi> as well as to <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, the <hi>Argument</hi> of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb facs="tcp:60811:2"/>
which now humbly seeks your L<hi rend="sup">ps.</hi>
Countenance, is much more proper and
fit for Your Cognizance, than vulgar
Eyes perhaps may judge, when they
first glance upon the <hi>Title of it.</hi> For (to
omit, that it leads to the most excellent of
all Human Knowledges; the Knowledge
of <hi>Ones self,</hi> which is the ground-work of
<hi>Civil Prudence)</hi> it explaineth the most
probable <hi>Oeconomy of Nature</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Animals;</hi> and especially the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and noble of them, <hi>Man:</hi> A piece of
Science, certainly, so far from being Unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to a <hi>States-man,</hi> that I dare affirme,
<hi>None can ever attain to any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
proficiency in the Mysteries of
State-principles, or the Art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men, who is not in some measure
conversant in the Mysteries of Human
Nature,</hi> as well those which concern the
<hi>Constitution</hi> and <hi>Fabrique</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi>
as those which belong to the <hi>Inclinations</hi>
and <hi>Passions</hi> of the <hi>Mind.</hi> And, the
<hi>Reason</hi> hereof is obvious and plain; since
the <hi>Maximes</hi> of sound <hi>Policy</hi> ought to be
<pb facs="tcp:60811:3"/>
derived from the <hi>Lawes</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> at
least by way of Analogie and Imitation:
&amp; the best way to understand, how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Men in <hi>Societies,</hi> is to observe, How
<hi>Nature</hi> at first produceth, and afterward
conserveth them in their <hi>single Persons,</hi> or
<hi>individual Beings.</hi> Certainly, My Lord,
the highest pitch, to which <hi>Human Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
can aspire, is, to imitate the works of
<hi>God</hi> in his Creatures: and the most perfect
<hi>Model</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> of Government, is that,
which comes neerest to the Idea of the
<hi>Divine Constitutions,</hi> either in the larger
Volume of the <hi>Universe,</hi> or in the exact A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment
of it, the <hi>Body of Man.</hi> This
made <hi>Pythagoras</hi> call Man, the <hi>Measure
of all things.</hi> This makes the greatest
<hi>Politicians</hi> so frequently consult the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Aphorisms of our perpetual Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and transferre His Rules
of curing <hi>Diseases</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<hi>Disorders,</hi> and rectifying <hi>Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>
in the <hi>State.</hi> This <hi>Menenius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>
found a happy truth; when He, in
a moment, appeased the seditious and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous
<pb facs="tcp:60811:3"/>
Commons of Rome, only by a speech,
wherein He compared the several <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
requisite in a well-ordered Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weath,
to those in the Body of Man; and
shewed the <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Those,</hi> to be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
as the <hi>Functions</hi> of <hi>These.</hi> And,
this that incomparable Sophy, the <hi>Lord
St. Alban,</hi> seems to have reflected upon,
when He said, <hi>It was without president,
that any Government had been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astrous
in the hands of Learned Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours;</hi>
and doubted not to call those,
<hi>Empirique</hi> States-men, who are ignorant
in <hi>Natural Philosophy.</hi> I could, My
Lord, expatiate in this noble and ample
Theme, and permit my Pen to run into a
<hi>Parallel</hi> betwixt the several <hi>Parts</hi> in a
Body <hi>Politique,</hi> and those in the Body
<hi>Natural;</hi> and demonstrate the neer <hi>Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and <hi>Correspondence</hi> of them, in
their respective <hi>Uses, Actions,</hi> and wayes
of subministring to the Health and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the whole: but that I here
speak to a <hi>Person,</hi> to whom such specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are so familiar, that I should dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb facs="tcp:60811:4"/>

it needfull for me onely to put Him
in Mind of them, or (indeed) of any thing
else suitable to that place of Eminency, and
Condition of Dignity, to which his Virtues
have advanced Him.</p>
            <p>Now, My Lord, these my <hi>Exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
being thus, in a <hi>Twofold Respect,</hi>
capable of your Lordships Favour; their

more of Value and esteem, from the

in our English World, by carrying your il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
<hi>Name</hi> in their Front; is not only
Excusable, but also <hi>Commendable,</hi> as
being grounded on the Law of <hi>Decency,</hi>
which forbad them to addresse to any other
Sanctuary; and which evinceth, that this
their applying themselves to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

that induced Him to consent to the Publication of it; I have

it might appear, it was not only his <hi>Inclination,</hi> that brought
this Book into my hands, and so into yours. Besides, I was not so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident
of my own Advantage, as not to understand, how much of
<hi>Reputation</hi> the Booke hath acquired to it self, by passing the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of a <hi>Man,</hi> whose Vniversal Learning, and admirable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicacity
in things of Nature, have conspired to render him as compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
a judge of such Treatises, as the World affords. This I say, not to
assure you, that <hi>Dr. Ent</hi> found nothing in these Papers, from which
He thought fit not to dissent; because, the subjects of Philosophers spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
and Enquiries, being usually very obscure in themselves, it is
no rarity to meet with Diversity of Opinions among Them, as well as
among the Vulgar: but, thus much I dare avouch, that He dissented
but in very few points, and those only concerning such difficulties, that
are not yet cleerly determined by Anatomical Observations; and that
neverthelesse, He pronounced the whole work to have been undertaken
upon mature Consideration, and done with singular Care, Industry,
and Circumspection. And I doubt not but you also will be of the
same Opinion, when you have attentively read the booke; in which
confidence I commend it into your hands, being not a littla glad of so
good an opportunity to manifest my devoir toward the advance of
Knowledge, and service of the Publique.</p>

               </gap>] in respect of
<hi>time,</hi> but [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] in respect of <hi>Nature;</hi>
as the Sun and light are coaevous, though the
one be the Cause, the other the Effect. This,
certainly, might be more justly said of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative</hi>
&amp; <hi>Nutritive</hi> Faculties (if at least, they
be not one and the same); by one of which an
Animal is <hi>produced,</hi> and by the other <hi>conserved.</hi>
For, though the <hi>Formative</hi> Virtue may seem
to precede in its operation; yet are the <hi>Stami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
or rudiments of the Embryo scarce deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
or adumbrated, when the <hi>Nutritive</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to augment and perfect them: So as that
it may rather be said to go hand in hand with
the Plastick's faculty, than to follow after it;
and what priority there seems to be in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60811:10"/>
is rather in respect of Nature, than
of time. To forme, and nourish, are not only
acts of one and the same soul; but so alike, that
it is no easie matter to distinguish betwixt
them. For, <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Accretion</hi> are not
performed without <hi>Nutrition;</hi> nor <hi>Nutrition,</hi> or
<hi>Augmentation,</hi> without <hi>Generation.</hi> To nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
is to substitute such and so much of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as was decay'd in the parts, namely flesh,
nerves, veins, arteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what is that
in reality, but to generate flesh, nerves, veins,
arteries, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> In like manner, <hi>Accretion</hi> is not
effected without Generation; for all natural
bodies, upon the accession of new parts are
augmented, and those nevv parts are such of
which these bodies were first composed: and
this is done, according to all the dimensions;
so that, to speak properly, the parts of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
are encreased, distinguished, and organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
all at once. Farther, this is necessary both
in respect of the <hi>Efficient</hi> cause, and of the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
The <hi>Former,</hi> because <hi>idem esse principium

               <note place="margin">As well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>Matter,</hi> as of the <hi>Efficient.</hi>

<hi>Latter,</hi> because all Animals (such as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<hi>per Epigenesin,</hi> of which is our discourse;
not of such Insects, as are produced <hi>per Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosin)</hi>
are corporated of one part of the
matter prepared by the Formative Spirit, and
nourished and augmented by the rest. For,
Nature doth nourish and amplify all parts of
an Animal with the same matter, or humour
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60811:10"/>
(not with a diverse) out of which she constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or framed them at the first. Because,
whatsoever is superadded to the parts, during
their growth, ought to be of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
with what was prae existent, and so must
consist <hi>ex congenere materiâ:</hi> their Renovation
as well as first Corporation being effected by
<hi>Epigenesis,</hi> Aggeneration, or superstruction. So
that we may well conclude, that Nutrition is
nothing else but <hi>continual Generation:</hi> and as
necessary to the Conservation of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
nature, as Generation it self is to the
conservation of the Universe.</p>
            <p>To make this Necessity the more evident,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
we are to consider;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The necessity of</hi> Nutrition, <hi>two-fold, viz.</hi> Augmentation <hi>&amp;</hi> Conservation.</note> (1) That forasmuch as an
Animal cannot performe all the functions, of
which its nature is capable, whilst it remains
in the minute parts, and rude beginnings, in
which it is first formed; therefore, there must
succeed a Nutrition, that may dilate and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify
those slender <hi>stamina,</hi> by interweaving
and assimilating so many other congenerous
parts, as serve to advance and augment the
Animal to a convenient magnitude: (2) That
since the chief principle of life in every Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
is a certain indigenary Heat (analogous
to pure flame, such as the most rectified Spirit
of Wine yeelds, upon accension) which by
continuall motion and activity agitating the
minute and exsoluble particles of the body,
doth dissolve, and consume, or disperse them;
of necessity, the whole Fabrick would soon be
destroy'd, unlesse there were a continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60811:11"/>
or reparation of those decayes, by a
substitution and assimilation of equivalent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
in the room of those dispersed and absu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
So that, we see, the Necessity of Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is <hi>Two-fold;</hi> one in respect of <hi>Augmentation,</hi>
the other in respect of <hi>Conservation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the continuall <hi>Decay,</hi> or <hi>Depredation</hi> of
the substance of our bodies, wherein the latter
necessity of Nutrition doth consist; that we
may the better understand the manner how it
is effected, we are to enquire into the Causes
thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Agent or Depredator, and the
Matter or substance depredated.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The <hi>Agent</hi> or <hi>Efficient</hi> Cause, with all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,<note place="margin">The <hi>Efficient</hi> cause of the consumption of the parts, is the <hi>Vital Flame</hi>
               </note> we hold to be the <hi>Naturall Heat,</hi> or
<hi>Vital Flame,</hi> at first kindled, by the vegetative
soul, or Plastick spirit, in the blood, constantly
burning in the Heart, as in its fountain, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
<hi>Focus,</hi> and thence by diffusion of it selfe
through the arteries, warming, cherishing, and
enlivening all parts of the body. This <hi>Lar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaris</hi>
is called <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Accensio animae in corde,</hi> the Kindling of the soul
in the heart, by <hi>Aristotle;</hi> and generally known
by the name of <hi>Calidum innatum,</hi> the innate
Heat. The principle of life, therefore, being
a certain Fire, certain it is that the same can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
subsist or endure one moment of time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be perpetually maintained or fed with
some convenient <gap reason="foreign">

Fewell; which is thereby indesinently consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
for, all Fire whatever (that Elementary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60811:11"/>
Fire, which the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> conceive to be so
pure, as to need no <hi>pabulum</hi> or aliment, being a
meer Chimera) doth conserve it selfe onely by
the destruction of the matter, in which it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated.
So that, indeed, we have one and
the same Cause both of our Life, and of our
Death; or (to speak more properly) our Life
is nothing but a continuall Death, and we live
because we dye. For, so long we live, as this
Vestall-Fire is kept glowing and shining in the
sacrary of our heart: and when the same is
put out, either by suffocation, or want of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance,
life is instantly extinguished. And
perhaps, it was to this <hi>Euripides</hi> alluded, when

the Blood and spirits, which having in

are the principal <hi>succendiculum,</hi> or Fewell
of the vital Flame: and not the substance of

that sundry Animals, as Bears, Dormice,

without receiving any supply of aliment: and
yet have all their solid parts of their bodies, as
large and firme, when they awake again in the
spring, as when they first betook themselves to
their dens or dormitories; nay, if we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
Naturall Historians, they grow fat in this

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60811:12"/>
is to be ascribed to this, that the flame in
their heart, all that time, being but gently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and burning quietly, doth consume very

and yet have not been emaciated in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

that it is more than probable, that there is not
so rapid and profuse an exhaustion of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the solid parts, by the activity of the
vital Heat, as Physicians have vulgarly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
In many diseases, we confesse, the habit

this to our present purpose) the <hi>Lamp
of life</hi> consisting in a continuall accension of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
spirits in the blood, as that passeth through
the heart; those vital spirits, transmitted by
the arteries to the habit of the body, no sooner
arrive there, but as they warme and vivifie the
parts, so do they immediatly fly away, and are
dispersed into the air, carrying with them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
aqueous parts, and (perhaps) some sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
exhalations. Moreover, there being in
all parts of the body certain sweet and balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall,
or conserving spirits, as it were affixed
unto and concorporated with them; the vital
spirits meeting with and acting upon them, do
by little and little render them volatile, and at
length wholly disperse them: whereupon the
minute particles, in which they did reside, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
mortified, &amp;, as excrements of the body,
are ejected together with the exhalations of the
blood. And this is (as we conceive) the reason
and manner of the depredation made upon the
parts, by the vital heat.</p>
            <p>If your Curiosity extend yet further, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>

as that no definite compute can be made
of this dispence. And yet we may be certain,
that the proportion of blood and spirits daily

very great: and that the most part of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to that common Axiom, <hi>iisdem nutrimur,

right, who thinke, that the parts of the body
being diverse, those of the Aliment ought
also to be equally diverse. As if Nutrition
were nothing else but a selection and attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of fit aliment; and that there were not
required in every part a concoction, assimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
apposition, and transmutation. For, the
Aliment of all parts is common, and similary,
such as the white of an egge; not heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and composed of diverse parts: and it is the
work of the Vegetative soul, as to forme all
parts out of one and the same homogeneous
matter at first, so afterward to augment and
repair them out of the like, by transforming
that into the substance of each part, which is
potentially all parts, and actually none. As
from the same rain all sorts of plants receive

well in respect of mens individuall tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as of quantity and quality of meats they

tougher and harder the aliment is, by so much
the more difficulty is it comminished, cutt,

the longer before it be concocted. Moreover,
concoction is performed in the <hi>day</hi> much soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

by reason of motion and exercise, the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

how much the smaller the morsels are, and the

digested. Nay, among the parts of the same
meat, there is no lesse-variety; so that some
parts of bread and flesh commonly remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered,
a good while after others more tender
and exsoluble are transformed into perfect
chyle, and protruded into the gutts. So that no

when this chylification is finished in his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> declared, perfectly concocted, is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
(the stomack gently and gradually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) expressed or detruded into the
Guts; and not attracted by them, as hath been
commonly taught. The Guts being filled with
this liquor, and by a certain peristaltique mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or undulation, like that of worms creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
contracting themselves successively from
the first to the last; transmit the same down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
And as it passeth through them, there
is a separation made of the profitable or ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
part, from the unprofitable or excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious:
the latter to be excluded by stool;
the former to be protruded into the <hi>Venae La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteae,</hi>
or milky veins. Which opening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by small orifices or inletts, in infinite
number, into the coats of the intestines; and
running in continued channells from thence
into the Mesentery: carry the Chyle into a
certain common Receptacle or Gulph (called
<hi>Receptaculum Pecqueti,</hi> from the inventor) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of a membranous substance, situate at
the root of the mesentery, upon the <hi>vertebrae
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60811:17"/>
lumborum,</hi> and filling the space betwixt the
Muscles <hi>Psoae.</hi> From this common Receptacle
there are drived other <hi>ductus chyliferi,</hi> which
running upwards, neer the spine of the back,
through the Thorax, and propagated quite
home to the subclavian branches of the <hi>vena Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
neer the external jugular veins, exonerate
themselves into them; so as the Chyle being
there commixed with the blood, is by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
trunk of the <hi>vena Cava,</hi> soon imported,
together with its new associate, the blood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the right ventricle of the heart. And this,
according to the late invention of <hi>Perquet,</hi> and
anatomical experiments of the most accurate
Dissectors since, is the true Traduction of the
Chyle from the ventricle to the heart: at least
of so much of it, as is to be converted into
blood, for the fewell of the vital Flame, and
confection of vital spirits.</p>
            <p>That we may, with the more exactness and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
certainty,<note place="margin">Of which there are two kinds, <hi>one</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the Intestines; the <hi>other</hi> from the Glandules, in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> into which the former sort exone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> trace the footsteps of the Chyle in
all its progress through these various and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
Meanders; we are to observe, from Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomicall
Demonstrations, two things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Chyliferous Conduits. <hi>First,</hi> that
there are (besides the Common Receptacle,
and channells from thence ascending to the
chest and subclavian veins) two kinds or sorts
of the venae Lacteae; one arising in slender ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary
roots from the Intestines themselves,
and thence delated through the Mesentery to
some glandule or other, situate either in the
Mesentery it self, or not far from it in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60811:18"/>
part of the Abdomen, and there dissemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
into capillary surcles: the other taking
its origine out of that very Glandule, into
which the former sort exonerate themselves.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> that the Glandules in the Abdomen
are not seated in the same places in all men;
but are variously posited, here in some there in
others, according as Nature (sometimes affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
variety in the same species, where conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
admits thereof) pleaseth to fix them;
and this without incommodity to the body:
and that from the incertainty of the position of
these Glandules, the Distribution of the venae
Lacteae comes to be also various and incertain.
For, Anatomy sensibly attesteth, that all the
small surcles of the <hi>venae Lacteae</hi> of the former
sort (arising from the intestines) do constantly
tend to some one Glandule in the lower belly;
and are distributed into the same, before they
arrive at the Common Receptacle, or disem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogue
themselves into any vein; yea (as was
newly said) that they produce another race of
Capillary branches in the Glandules, in which
themselves were terminated; and that many
of those small rivulets concurring and uniting,
make one greater channell, before they lose
themselves either in the Common ocean, or
any branch of the <hi>vena Cava.</hi> Now, from the
foresaid various position of the Glandules, it
comes to pass, that the Distribution of the
venae Lacteae into their substance, and their new
propagation out of them again, are so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
as that it hath given occasion to some
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60811:18"/>
Anatomists to suspect, that the <hi>venae Lacteae</hi> are
disseminated into very many parts of the body;
when, indeed, they only come neer those parts,
and then passe by them, without effusing any
part of the Chyle into them.</p>
            <p>Now, from these observations,<note place="margin">But none of either kind tend to the <hi>Liver.</hi>
               </note> it is very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
probable, that all the <hi>venae Lacteae</hi> (before the
Chyle loseth its milky colour) do exonerate
themselves either into the vena Cava, or some
branches of it. And as for the <hi>Lacteae Thoracicae,</hi>
our sense demonstrates, that they empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the subclavian or Axillary veins
(branches of the <hi>Vena Cava);</hi> so that none dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorgeing
their fraught or chyle into any branch
of the <hi>vena Portae;</hi> it is most manifest, that no
part of the Chyle is imported into the Liver
(as was long believed and taught), there to be
converted into blood; and consequently that
the office of the Liver is not Sanguification.</p>
            <p>Whether any of the <hi>venae Lacteae</hi> are distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
into the <hi>Paps,</hi> and <hi>womb;</hi>
               <note place="margin">That the Milk in the Papps is not made of Blood, but of meer Chyle brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by some peculiar ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels: because</note> in women;
though highly probable, is yet in dispute: no
Anatomist having hitherto been so happy in
his searches, as to discover by what secret
wayes or passages they tend to either. We say,
highly probable; for, according to that judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
saying of <hi>Hippocrates, Licetvisum oculorum
effugiant, ea tamen mentis acie comprehendantur;</hi>
though they have thus long concealed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the eye of the body, yet are they
obvious to the eye of the Mind: and the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Reason may herein supply the dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our sense. Now, to evince the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60811:19"/>
of this Opinion, let us consider the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
and weighty Arguments, that seem to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that <hi>the Milk in the paps is not made of blood;
but mere Chyle brought into them by some peculiar
vessells.</hi> Which though a seeming Parergy, is
yet fully pertinent in this place.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> First, there are <hi>no convenient wayes or conduits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">There are no convenient conduits, by which Blood can be brought into the paps, in sufficient quantity.</note>
by which Blood may be, in a due quantity, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
into the Paps, there to be whitened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Milk. For (1) the <hi>Arteriae Thoracicae</hi> can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
but a small tribute of blood into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
of the Paps; and what they bring in, is
soon exhausted and carried off again by the
veins; according to the apodictical doctrine of
the Circulation of the blood. But, did the
blood remain in them; yet would it hold no
reasonable proportion to the large quantity of
milk usually effused in a day (which in healthy
Nurses commonly amounts to two pints). Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Arteries disseminated into the Paps,
are exceeding small, as our eyes witness, and
<hi>Vesalius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Examin obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. Fallop. pag. 89.</note> long since well observed, where He
saith, <hi>Exiguae out ferè nullae arteriae adeunt mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
quod in mammarum cancro affectarum ablati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
constat, ubi paucae aut ferè nullae arteriae san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem
fundunt, cùm tamen venarum magna co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia
sit.</hi> (2) The Arteriae Hypogastricae cannot
be thought to convey blood into the Paps; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are terminated in a part far distant
from their confines, and empty themselves
where their streams are soon swallowed up
and returned into the vena Cava by the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogastrick
veins. (3) The same may be said
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60811:19"/>
of the Epigastrick arteries and veins. So that
in respect of wayes importing blood into the
Paps, it appears altogether unlikely, that that
should be the matter of Milk.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Blood is not a fit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Blood is nor a fit, nor possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Matter,</hi> for the generation of Milk.</note> 
               <hi>nay not a possible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
matter for the generation of Milk.</hi> For (1) if
blood should be imported into the paps, in
sufficient quantity, and there extravasated;
certainly it would be converted rather into
<hi>pus,</hi> than into milk, as is frequently observed in
Inflammations and Apostems of the Paps. (2)
To what end should nature convert blood into
milk, when that milk is to be soon converted
again into blood, in the infant sucking it?
(3) How is it possible, that the Chyle, which
loseth its whiteness and other qualities, when
it is transformed into blood; should resume
them again, as soon as it becomes milk; <hi>a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatione
ad habitum,</hi> is repugnant to Nature?
(4) Meat and drink cannot be suddainly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into blood, and that blood changed into
milk; but experience teacheth, that the paps
of nurses are filled soon after their repasts, and
many women feel their milk flow swiftly into
their breasts, almost as soon as they have drunk.
(5) Women that are somewhat fat, have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
plenty of milk, than such as are lean: but,
if blood were the matter of milk, the lean
would afford more milk, than the fat; because
the lean have larger arteries and veins, and so
more store of blood. (6) If blood were the
matter of milk, then would the bodies of Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
fall into dangerous sicknesses, from excess
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60811:20"/>
of blood, soon after they cease to give suck;
because being long accustomed to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so profuse a quantity of blood, for the
supply of their milk; and that daily evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof ceasing, the whole body must needs
be oppressed with that redundancy: but, they
seldome complain of any <hi>Plethora;</hi> therefore
&amp;c. (7) If blood, not chyle, were the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of milk, then were it impossible the milk
should retain the odour and qualities of the
meats eaten; since no manifest quality of the
meat can be deprehended in the blood, much
less in what is generated of blood, as being one
remove further from it: but the Milk doth
frequently retain the odour and other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the meat and drink; Ergo. This is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
by the experience of Physicians, who give
purging medicaments to Nurses,<note place="margin">Comment <hi>in lib.</hi> Hippocr. de nat. pueri.</note> when there is
cause to purge their children. <hi>Prosper Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi>
the best Commentator upon <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
hath an observation of a woman, who having
taken a purge, soon after gave her child suck,
and thereby endangered the childs life, a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perpurgation
ensuing in the child, while her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
felt no effect of the medicament at all.
No obscure argument, that the Milk deriveth
its purgative faculty from the Chyle, not from
the blood; for it were to be carried so long a
journey, as through the heart and arteries, and
therein undergoe so many and great changes:
doubtless the virtue of the medicine would be
much weakned and dulled; nor could it be
derived into the paps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so soon after it was first
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60811:20"/>
received into the stomack. Here may we sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
recite that saying of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">7. De hist. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal. cap. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Si la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctans
pilum cum cibo aut potu angerat, ad memmas
pervenit, &amp; in earum papillis consistens, morbum
inducit, qui <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> nominatur:</hi> and that rare
observation also cited by <hi>Martianm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Loco eitat.</note> of a piece
of a root of Cichory eaten in sallade by a nurse
at night, and taken out at one of her nipples
the next morning. But, above all, this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
is most convincing. Let a nurse drink a
good draught of milk tincted with Saffron; and
within an hour or two after express the milk
out of either of her paps, into a glasse or other
small vessell: and that milk shall have the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
sapour, yea and the very colour also of
Saffron. (8) Nor is the Milk made of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous
blood, as some Philosophers have
dream't; because many bruit Animals have
milk, that never suffer the monthly flux; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
most new-born infants have some milk
in their paps,<note place="margin">De gen. anim. exercit. 55.</note> as <hi>Dr. Harvey</hi> hath well remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
and because even Men themselves have
been found with good plenty of milk in theirs
also. <hi>Schenchius</hi> affirms, that he knew one <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius
Wolfius,</hi> who from his youth to the 50
year of his age, had aboundance of milk flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of his duggs every day. The like is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
of a certain Flemming, by <hi>Wallaeus;</hi> and
of divers others by <hi>Cardan,</hi> by <hi>Benedictus,</hi> by
<hi>Aquapendens</hi> and other credible Authors. Nay,
Historians report, that in <hi>America</hi> there are
whole nations, among whom the men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
abound with milk, and suckle their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60811:21"/>
To which we may adde, that many
nurses have their Termes, while they give
suck, and yet find no diminution of their milk,
at those times, more than at others. So that we
see, how unreasonable it is to conceive, that
bloud is the matter of Milk.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Thirdly, Milk and Chyle seem to be one
and the same thing;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Chyle</hi> agree in all their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest <hi>Qualities;</hi> and are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetible.</note> as may appear both by
their mutuall agreement in all their qualities,
and by their easie reciprocall convertibility.
As for their <hi>resemblance in manifest qualities;</hi>
(1) They both have a fatty substance: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
neither could be fit either to sustain the
Lamp of lise, or to instaurate the parts; nor
can the bloud contain any such fatty sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in it, but what is derived from the
Chyle. (2) As Milk doth consist of two parts,
the <hi>serum</hi> and <hi>crassamentum;</hi> so likewise doth
Chyle, whose <hi>serum</hi> is dreyned away by the
kidneys, and <hi>crassament</hi> by the guts. (3) As
Milk, if kept over-long, especially in a warm
place, or corrupted by any Acid juice, doth
turn sowr; so also doth the Chyle, and in the
stomach of Calves is found a certain sowr se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
which houswives use for the coagulation
of their Milk; in like manner the same is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
generated in the stomachs of men,
which being ejected by vomitting, sets the
teeth on edge; having acquired that sowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
either by corruption from excessive heat,
or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the admistion of a melancholy juyce.
(4) They are equally sweet in tast; which is
the reason, why many brute Animals lick up
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60811:21"/>
the milky liquor flowing from the secundines,
when they bring forth their young, which is
indeed the nutriment of their young, while
remaining in the womb. (5) They resemble
each other in colour, being both white; as the
sense testifieth. (6) They both contain certain
small Fibers, that seem to be educed from the
more viscous and glutinous parts of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And these, doubtless, are those Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which sensibly uniting themselves in the
superfice of bloud let forth into a cold vessel,
appear in form of a whitish film, or thin skin;
long mistaken by Physitians for cold, viscid
and phlegmatique matter commixt with the
bloud: and if the red parts of the bloud be
gently washed away from them, they become
distinctly visible. And as for their <hi>reciprocal
Convertibility;</hi> that is clearly proved by this,
that Chyle is easily converted into milke, in
the Nurse; and that milk again converted into
Chyle in the stomach of the Infant that sucks
it. Now these many resemblances conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
we may safely conclude, that they have
much more of reason on their side, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Milke to be nothing but meer Chyle
brought from the stomach to the Paps, by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
passages; and therein promoted to
somewhat more of perfection: than they, who
think it to be made of bloud whitened in the
glandules of the paps.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
            </p>
            <p>Having, with so great verisimilitude,<note place="margin">That Chyle is imported also into the <hi>womb,</hi> in pregnant women.</note>
brought Chyle from the stomach to the Paps,
for the sustenance of the infant, after he is born;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60811:22"/>
it remains now that we see, whether any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof be deduced also to the <hi>womb,</hi> for
his nourishment before he is born. First, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let us seriously consider, what light hath
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> been anciently given to this obscure disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
by that Genius of Nature,<note place="margin">From the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> &amp;</note> 
               <hi>Hippocrates;</hi>
who hath sundry pregnant Texts to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uterum foetu grandiorem</hi> (saith He) <hi>compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere

In which words the reverend Author
toucheth upon two things very considerable
and pertinent. (1) That the fat, white, and
sweet Chyle is carried up to the paps, by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the Venae Lacteae,</hi> and <hi>the common Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle</hi>
of the Chyle; the swoln womb being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon them, and pressing the Chyle
upwards. For, that Compression cannot
be understood of the veines and arteries in the
lower belly, as if they were thereby urged to
disgorge their bloud into the paps, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of milk; because, a compression of
those veins and arteries, that are neer the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae
Lumborum,</hi> would necessarily hinder the
course and recourse of the bloud, requisite to
the work supposed. But, as <hi>Perquet</hi> will have
the weight of the Liver, moved up and down
in respiration, to conduce to the compression
of the stomach, <hi>venae lacteae,</hi> and receptacle, from
the upper part of the abdomen: So will <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60811:22"/>
have it, that, from the lower part, the
compression of the womans belly by the
greatnesse and weight of the child, doth cause
the Chylo to alter its course (his words, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place, being,<note place="margin">lib. de Mulier.</note> 
               <hi>convertitur ad maemm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,

to the paps. Thus the Scythians, as <hi>Herodotus</hi>
reports, had a trick to blow up the wombs of
their Mares, by certain sufflatoria o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sea, like
pipes, to the end that their bellies being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by the swelling of their wombs, the
greater abundance of Chyle might be protru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into their udders, and so their milke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.
(2) Since by reason of the same
Compression, the passage of the Milk, by ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
tending from the paps to the womb, is not
so open and free, as while the burthen of the
womb was lesse; thence it comes, that so small
a quantity of the Chyle is imported into the
womb, as will not suffice to the nourishment
of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> Much Chyle, therefore, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the paps from the <hi>Venae Lacteae,</hi> and the
Common Receptacle; and some milk also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
from the womb to them, by reason of
this Compression mentioned: it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if the paps at that time swel above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A second memorable place of</hi> Hippocrates,<note place="margin">libr. citat.</note>
               <hi>to this purpose, is that;</hi> Ad mammas enim &amp;

A third, to the same effect, is this; <hi>Foetus

and the worst is carried to the paps. Which

by frequent sucking doth dilate and amplifie
the vessels (formerly too small) through which
the milk is to pass from the womb to the paps,

the paps derive their nerves from the
fourth intercostall pair, or the fifth pair of the
thorax: and the womb is supplied with sense
from the nerves of the <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by <hi>Similitude of substance;</hi> because the paps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
mostly of Glandules, and the body of the

most certain, that all sympathy betwixt parts
of the body, doth arise either <hi>ex Vasorum Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munione,</hi>
or <hi>ex operis societate,</hi> or both; and that
betwixt the paps and womb there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of vessels, unlesse it be of some chylife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

there is a society of office betwixt the paps and

there are such vessels (though yet undiscove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
by which the Chyle is carried from the

therein, and back again from the womb to the

since it is manifest that there are some such

it is not improbable, they are derived from the

               </gap>,
and cause the same diffusive or expansive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Natural, which themselves have
formerly acquired: we say, considering these
things, it is manifest, that the work is done by
<hi>simple Assimilation;</hi> and consequently that
Sanguification is an Action <hi>similar,</hi> not
Organical, as hath been long erroneously
affirmed.</p>
            <p>Concerning the SECOND, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Efficient,</hi>
let us first examine what that cannot be; and
so we shall the more easily and certainly find
what it must be. The prime Agent, or Author
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60811:26"/>
of the work of Sanguification, is not either the
<hi>Liver,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> and his Sectators conceived and

dreamed; or the substance of the <hi>Heart,</hi> as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
and his Disciples have asserted; or any
other organ of the body.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To be more particular; we affirm, the <hi>Liver</hi>
not to be the Agent in the work of Sanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">Whose Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Efficient, is not the <hi>Liver;</hi>
               </note>
and that for sundry reasons. (1) No
part of the Chyle is brought to the Liver, by
any one or more of the Venae Lacteae: they in
the lower belly generally exonerating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the Common Receptacle; and those
in the Thorax being terminated in the subcla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian
veins: and therefore it is impossible the
Liver should transforme chyle into blood,
when no chyle can arrive thereat. (2) There
is blood to be seen in an Embryo, before even
the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udiments of the Liver are delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and what hath beeing before, cannot be
the effect of what hath no beeing till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
That the blood hath priority of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
is manifest from the observations of <hi>Dr.
Harvey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">de gen. Animal. exercit. 18.</note> who expressly affirms, <hi>Sanguinem dari,
antequam quicquam corporis reliqui existat; esse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que

corporatur foetus, tum nutrimentum, quo augetur,
procedere; esse denique (si modo ulla fuerit) pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam
particulam genitalem.</hi> (3) After the Chick
is perfectly formed in the egg, and hath its
veins and arteries replenished with blood; yet
doth the Liver still remain pale and whitish,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60811:26"/>
not without some small tincture of yellow,
which observation doth of it self alone demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively
depose the Liver from the office of
Sanguification, and conferre that dignity upon
some other Agent. For, how can the Liver,
supposing the Chyle were brought to it, give a
deep redness thereunto, while it self yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
white? Can any thing give that to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which it self hath not? This also is certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the experience of <hi>Dr. Harvey,</hi> who
thereupon firmly concludes; <hi>jecur &amp; calorem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">exercit. de gen A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal. 51 sub finem.</note>
               <hi>&amp; colorem suum à sanguine mutuatur; non autem
sanguis à jecore.</hi> From hence it may be observed,
that the native colour of the Liver is not red,
but pale, with a faint mixture of yellow; and
that, what redness it doth afterward acquire,
is communicated to it from the blood continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
percolated through the parenchyma of it.
Both which may more plainly appear by this,
that in a Chick not yet excluded from the shell,
that yellow paleness of the Liver is visible,
even the very last day of the Hens incubation;
though at that time the same begins to incline
toward some degree of redness, which is more
and more augmented every day after the chick
is hatched. Again, if you fill a bladder with
warm water, and through a slender pipe inject
the same, by the trunck either of the vena Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,
or vena Portae, into the Liver; and so rinse
out the blood remaining in the vessels and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thereof; you shall sensibly perceive the
redness of the Liver to vanish away, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
duskish or sooty yellownesse succeed in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60811:27"/>
the room. Which obscure yellownesse, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
hath its original meerly from the tincture
of Choler. However, most certain it is, that
the Liver hath natively no redness at all; and
what it afterward contracteth, is adventitious,
and from the blood. To this purpose is that
easie experiment of Dr. Harvey;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>(2) Of the <hi>veins</hi> also the same may be said.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
For,<note place="margin">Nor the veins.</note> if that rule of <hi>Galen</hi> holds true (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it doth); <hi>Quod mutatur, in ejus speciem, à
quo mutatur, facessit;</hi> the veins can never be
thought fit, to transform the Chyle into blood.
For, their Colour is white and somewhat trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucid;
their substance viscid, membranous,
and bloodless; they have no parenchyma, and
very little either of heat or spirits of their own:
whereas, on the contrary, the Blood is of a
deep red, not translucid, of a substance fluid
and interminate, and abounds with heat and
spirits. And, therefore, it were vain to expect
an Assimilation, where the supposed Agent
and Patient are of natures in all things so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible,
so contrary. We deny not, that
the veins in some respect conduce to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation</hi>
of the blood; but how? Only as they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60811:27"/>
are Organs, inservient to the defence of it from
external injuries, and the reduction of it from
the parts upon which it was newly affused out
of the arteries. And as for any similar Action
of the veins upon the blood; they have none
at all: yea, their office of Conserving it doth
consist chiefly in their inactivity, <hi>i.e.</hi> in this, that
they are not apt to alter or deprave it; as Glass-vessells
are the best to conserve liquors in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they neither communicate any ill quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their own, nor permit the like to be
communicated from others to them. But, that
which doth principally conserve the blood in
the purity of its nature, is the very same thing
that makes it from the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Heat and Spirits derived from the Heart,</hi> which
by their enlivening warmth, and continuall
motion, do not only vindicate the blood from
corruption, but also all the solid parts of the
body, and so even the veins themselves also, as
long as the Lamp of life continueth burning.
And that being once extinguished; how soon,
alas! do all parts of the body yeeld to the quick
tyranny of corruption?</p>
            <p>(3) Nor hath the Heart more right to this
noble office of Sanguification. For,<note place="margin">Nor the <hi>Heart:</hi> but the <hi>vital spirit,</hi> residing in the blood.</note> that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
all its vital heat and activity meerly
from the vital blood contained in its ventricles,
and distributed into its substance by the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
arteries. Of which vital influx were the
Heart deprived, but for some few moments;
it would soon become as torpid and motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
as any other part of the whole body; so
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60811:28"/>
far is it from exalting the Chyle into so noble
a Nectar, as the blood is, by any similar action
of its owne. To assure this, please you, take
out the yet-panting Heart of any the strongest
and soundest Animal, and having with warm
water rinsed all the blood out of the ventricles,
fill them again with warm Chyle or Milk;
and see whether it will be able to convert the
same into blood. Certainly, you shall find
none the least change to be wrought upon the
liquor infused. Yet the Heart is a solid and
strong part; and one would scarce think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that that action, which it is supposed to
performe, by reason of its solid substance,
should be intercepted in so short a space of
time. Forasmuch, therefore, as the Heart doth,
in a moments time, surcease its activity, and
desist from the work of changing Chyle into
blood, as soon as the vital blood is effused out
of its ventricles; it is as manifest, as certain,
that the virtue Generative of blood, is not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
in the solid substance of the Heart, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily,
but in somthing else, <hi>viz.</hi> in that very
thing, upon whose absence immediately that
virtue is destroyed, which is the vital Blood.
Again, the dissection of Living Animals teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us, that the vital Heat is much greater in
the ventricles, than in the substance of the
Heart: and Reason biddeth us thence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr,
that the same Heat is originally in the
ventricles, and but at second hand, or by way
of communication, in the parenchyma. Now,
if the Activity of even the Heart it self, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60811:28"/>
originally from the vital Blood; and that
the vital Blood be more powerfull than the
Heart: we can hardly deny the same to be
the Primary Cause, or Agent of Sanguificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
unless (at least) it shall appear, that the
vital blood is less apt for such a work, than the
Heart. But, comparing the agreeableness of
the Heart to such an office, with that of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Blood to the same; we shall quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
which of the two hath the greater. For,
the vital Blood is of the same species with the
thing to be made or produced; but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Heart is far different from it. It
being, therefore, canonical, that all Naturall
Agents endeavour, according to their energy,
to assimilate to their own nature the thing, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they act: it seems of equal certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the activity of the vital Blood, is most
properly consigned to the work of Sanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
A further evidence of this, may be drawn
from hence, that the Chyle and Blood are most
<hi>intimately mixed</hi> together in the ventricles of
the Heart; while the Chyle doth only <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially</hi>
and <hi>in transitu</hi> touch the side of them.
To which may be added, that the Chyle makes
but a very short stay in the Heart: but remains
constantly commixed with the Blood, untill it
be thereto perfectly assimilated. Lastly, the
blood flowing in the heart, arteries, and veins,
doth exceed the Chyle of one meal, in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at least ten times, and in strength or activity,
an hundred; (for, what is more potent, then
that spirit, which enliveneth the whole body;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60811:29"/>
what softer, gentler, and more easily supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
than Chyle?) and therefore, no doubt but
the Bloud doth easily obtain the victory over
the Chyle, and over-run it with his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

of <hi>Dr. HARVEY</hi> (the true Oedipus
in all abstrusities of this kind) of the progress
of Nature in the generation of the parts of an
Animal successively one after another;<note place="margin">which alone formeth the blood in a chicken, out of the <hi>Colliqua mentum.</hi>
               </note> and we
shall soon be satisfied, that the First Bloud is
made by the vital spirit. That great man
attesteth, that the white of the Egge doth for
some dayes after the Hen hath sat a-brood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, retain its native whitenesse, and that out
of the Colliquament, or White, made more
thin and fluid, the Chick is generated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the addition of any other matter. The
Question then is only this, <hi>How that white colour
in the Colliquamentum, or so much of it as the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique
faculty converts into blood; comes to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into red?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certain it is, this cannot be effected by any
thing that was red before; because there is
no part of the Egge of, or inclining to, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
and the yelk remains intire a good while
after there is bloud to be seen in the <hi>punctum
saliens.</hi> Nor is it the Fleshy parts, that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
this vermillion tincture to the bloud,
because they remain white after the bloud is
made out of the Colliquamentum: and it is
much more reasonable, that the fleshy parts
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60811:29"/>
derive their rednesse wholly from the bloud,
perpetually irrigating and washing them in
its Circulation. For, their rednesse grows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them by degrees, and that sooner or later,
according to the degrees of Heat impressed
upon the Egge by the Hen, and according to
the greater or lesse quantity of bloud arriving
at them. Some parts, which are but lightly
touched by the bloud, never become red; in
which account are the coats of the Eyes, the
Ligaments, Tendons, Membranes, Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Others obtain a certain palenesse dashed with
a sparing mixture of red; as the Glandules
which as they are furnished with greater or
smaller arteries (respective to their magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude)
so are they tinged with more or lesse of
rednesse. The Musculous flesh is more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
died with scarlet, than the Glandules; as
being irrigated with greater streames of
bloud. The Kidneys, Liver, Spleen, Lungs, and
Heart, are all washed with full streams of
bloud; and therefore have a deeper dye of red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
than any other parts: and yet are much
lesse red, than the bloud it self. Now it is more
reasonable to conceive, that the Greater should
communicate its virtue to the Lesser, than on
the contrary, the Lesser to the Greater. For,
how can any Natural Agent operate beyond
the sphere of its activity, <hi>i.e.</hi> the measure of
its power? or communicate that to another,
which it self wanteth? Again, nothing can
have an activity, before it hath a beeing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
consequently the solid parts cannot give a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60811:30"/>
to the bloud, because they are not in
beeing, till after the bloud. Nothing, therefore,
remains to be the Efficient of the Bloud, but
the <hi>Vital Spirit,</hi> kindled originally in the purest
part of the seminal matter, or <hi>Colliquamentum</hi>
which we may well denominate the <hi>Vital Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</hi>

               </note> though it be very obscure, yet doe
we not think it altogether inexplicable, if we
deduce the bloud from its first Origine, the
newly mentioned <hi>Vital Liquor.</hi> This <hi>Vital Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,</hi>
before it assumes the colour and forme of
Bloud, doth begin to separate it self from the
other parts of the Egge (to which it is at first
promiscuously admixed) and to runne its selfe
out into certain slender rivulets, or branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which afterward become Veins. These
rivolets concurring in a point, meet altogether
at the centre of the <hi>Colliquamentum;</hi> which cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
being the principal seat of the Plastique
spirit, and acquiring a certain mication, or
pulsation, is then called <hi>Punctum Saliens?</hi> And
all this is done, before there is any the least
appearance of bloud in the Egge. So soon,
therefore, as these Rivulets are conjoyned, the

by the same passages, which brought it

it self again into the seminal matter, from
whence at first it began its motion, through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
slender conduits newly for that purpose
formed, and then it begins to flow in a round.
For, this appears to be the true reason of the
<hi>Circumgyration</hi> of the <hi>Vital Liquor,</hi> from the

from hence, that when the motion of

no bloud, but only a clear, transparent liquor,
or (as the Learned <hi>Harvey</hi> call's it) the <hi>Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quamentum:</hi>
and also from hence, that while
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60811:31"/>
the <hi>Seminal Matter</hi> is yet thin and fluid, the
Vital Liquor can easily disperse its channels
through the same; there being then no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment

but, if it should defer its dispersion
and making of rivulets, til after the solid parts
were made; 'tis hard to conceive, how it could
be able to shoot it self forth into branches, and

               </note> though
no Bloud yet appears, yet soon after it doth
appear; the Vital Liquor, while continually
(though slowly) circulated, by little and little
assuming the form of Bloud. And the place
in which the bloud first shews it selfe, is the
<hi>Chorion;</hi> not the Heart. For, seeing that the
<hi>Chorion</hi> ought to be made solid and firme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any other of the parts of the Conception,
insomuch as it serveth as well for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,

and that to this end, there is no moysture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from without, that might hinder its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the whole conception, is the first part
that receiveth the warmth of the Hen, during
her incubation: we say, from hence it comes,
that the vital Liquor doth first of all obtain
the forme of Bloud in the Chorion. And this
is effected the sooner, because the vital Liquor
doth more easily emit its exhalations, in that
place, as being in the circumference, than in
any other more remote from it: and unlesse
those exhalations were freely emitted, the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60811:31"/>
Spirits of the <hi>Vitall Liquor</hi> would inevitably
be soon extinguished. It is moreover pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that at this time, the Vital Heat is more
potent and active in the exteriour parts of the
Conception, than in the Centre; and so, that
the First Bloud is made in the Chorion, where
it first discovers it self to the sight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spector.
Hence also we may observe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is no bloud to be discerned in the

bloud is discernable in the <hi>Chorion:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
must the Circulation of the bloud be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

that Colours frequently are advanced from a
white, or pale, to several kinds of Red, meerly
by Heat and Motion; is demonstrable by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
easie and familiar Experiments. Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioners
well know, that long boyling of
Quinces and other Fruits doth give them a rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
colour. So likewise Fruits baked in an oven,
are more inclined to redness, than while they
were raw. The same is true also even of Flesh,
and Bread, which by baking or rosting, acquire
redness in their superficial parts: and some
Chymists affirme, that a Tincture of Bread
will assume a certain degree of redness, after
long digestion. This is not, we acknowledge,
common to all Liquors, especially simple ones;
for simple waters, and such as are destilled,
suffer little or no change of colour, upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
though long. But generally all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Liquors, especially if they contain any
Nutritive juice, in competent quantity, and
have besides any touch of salt, or Acid spirits in
them: are observed to acquire a sanguine tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
by decoction. Upon which fertile hint,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60811:32"/>
as we conjecture, that highly Learned, Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious,<note place="margin">in Apolog. pro circulatione sanguinis, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Parisan. p. 119.</note>
and Acute Person, Dr. ENT, seems to
have grounded that ingenious opinion of his;
that the Redness of the Blood ariseth <hi>ex Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
spiritus vitalis salinei,</hi> from the <hi>Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the vital spirits,</hi> having their original from a
certain seminal salt. However, we have good
reason to perswade our selves, that all <hi>vital
Liquors, i.e,</hi> such wherein the vital spirits of
Animals do reside, are apt to acquire more or
less of redness; provided they obtain sufficient
Heat, and agitation or strife in their motions.
This is evident in all Sanguineous Animals, in
which the Chyle is first white, and after chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
into bloud. And as for Exsanguious Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
they also give some testimony of this
truth; as may be instanced in Oysters, in
which bloud is frequently found (and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a prodigy) in summ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r time, by reason their
vital Heat seems then to be augmented: and
in winter, when their Heat is again lessened,
below what is requisite to induce redness,
their vital juice is alwayes whitish. To return
to sanguineous Animals; as they are generally
hotter of constitution, than Exsanguious; so
are their Sanguine parts alwayes hotter, than
their pale and white parts. In like manner, in
cold diseases, as the Green sickness, Cachexy,
Dropsy, and in all Phlegmatique constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the bloud is paler, than in hot diseases and
constitutions. Again, the venal blood, as it
loseth the heat, which it had acquired in pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through the heart and arteries; so doth it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60811:33"/>
proportionately by little and little lose that
florid and deep scarlet dye, that it had in the
heart and arteries. For, blood let forth of a
vein, appears blewish, and comes short of that
lively fresh scarlet, that is observed in bloud
effluxed from an Artery. All which clearly
shew, by whose efficiency it is, that the vital
juice (in Sanguineous Animals) is excocted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Bloud; and what conserves the same in its
primitive purity and lustre: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>vital spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
continually renewed in, and enlivening the
blood; for, that being once extinguished, how
soon doth the bloud degenerate into <hi>Cruor,</hi> and

an effect is not supposed to be, untill it
hath obtained existence from its proper cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:

existence, they cannot but give also the identity
belonging to it. All which is imported in that
common Axiome, <hi>Idem, quà idem, semper facit

<hi>Natural</hi> ones are bound up to a determinate

mode of energie, and must, as long as they
continue the same, act after one and the same
way, and so produce invariably the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
Forasmuch, therefore, as the Efficient
of the First Blood, is an Agent <hi>Natural,</hi> and
not Arbitrary; if it continue the same in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal,
while the Animal lives, it must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
continue the same operation. That it
doth continue the very same, during life, is
most certain; because it is the Principle of life,
nor can life subsist for so much as one moment
without it. Nor doth this Efficient of Bloud
only persist the same in the body, that it was
at the first conception; but growes every day
more vigorous, potent and fit for the work,
untill the Animal hath attained to the flower
of his age: and to imagine that an Agent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
(such as the Vital Spirit) should at any
time become idle, intermit its operation, and
not exercise all its forces; is grossely absurd.
Conclude we therefore, that the Vital Spirit,
as it is the Efficient Cause of Sanguification,
in the Embryo from the first Conception; so is
it constantly Author of the same work, untill
the Animal dieth.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60811:34"/>
to verifie that his Tenent. And yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things, not easie to be explicated, and lesse
easie to be reconciled one to another, may be
observed to attend thereupon. For, <hi>Physicians,</hi>
when, in their Physiological discourses, they
treat of the nature of the Bloud and endeavour
to make good, that it serveth to no other use,
but only to afford Nutriment to the body; they
suppose it to be a substance, not simple and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous,
but mixt and compounded of Four
several juices, promiscuously flowing together
in the same streams: deducing their principal
argument hereof, from the Combinations of
the Four First Elementary Qualities (as they
call them) and accordingly teaching, that the
ingredients of bloud are the two sorts of <hi>Bile,</hi>
or <hi>Choler (viz.</hi> the yellow, and the blackish)
<hi>Phlegme,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> properly so called. Further,
of each of these different humours, They make
some <hi>Nutritive</hi> (as assuming the whole body to
be made up of them) others <hi>Excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi>
and then They decree, that the bloud doth
consist of those diverse Nutritious humors, as
of Heterogeneous parts. After, though they
allow the Phlegme to be the colder and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
part, and so capable of conversion into
good and laudable blood, by more intense
heat, and longer concoction; and likewise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Choler to be convertible into Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
by adustion; and blood to be converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
into both choler and melancholy, by the
same means: yet will they by no means admit
of a regression of either Choler or Melancholy
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60811:35"/>
into blood. Now, if these things be true (as
may well be doubted) and that there is no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
regresse of Melancholy into Choler, nor
of Choler into laudable Blood: then will it
inevitably follow, that all the other three jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are but only in Order to Melancholy: and
that Melancholy is the principall and most
perfectly concocted Aliment. Nay more, They
must grant two sorts of Blood; the one, the
whole masse of blood contained in the veines,
and composed of those four humours: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the more pure, more florid, and more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
part thereof, which in a stricter sense
they call blood, and which some will have to
be contained only in the heart and arteries,
apart from the venous blood, as deputed to
peculiar and more noble Uses. Now, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this distinction, it is manifest, that not
the pure arteriall bloud is the nourishment of
the body, but the baser, composed of diverse
juices, or rather chiefly the Melancholy; to
which as to their ultimate term<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or perfection
the three others tend. And how incongruous
it is, to conceive, that the body is nourished, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with impure juices, or with Melancholy

it: is obvious to men of even the shallowest

so as to be admitted into their very substance;

Which perhaps is the reason,<note place="margin">1 Hist. an. c. 16.</note> why <hi>Aristotle</hi>

little blood; and such as are spare and lean,
have abundance: which could not be, if blood
were matter of nourishment. And because
Lean persons have much blood; therefore are
they more lively, couragious, and active, as
abounding with Spirits, in proportion to their
great quantity of blood. Hence is it also, that
Lean persons bear large evacuation of blood,
without detriment of health; because their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60811:36"/>
fleshy and musculous parts, as being firme and
solid, drink up the least quantity of bloud
in their pores, and so there remains the more
for the fewel of the Vitall Lamp. Whereas,
on the contrary, grosse and fat persons, suffer
great dammage by large effusion of bloud;
because the habit of their bodies being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoyled
of Spirits and hotter bloud, is filled
with serous humours, and so easily degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
into a Cachexy. In like manner, in a gross
body, where are more parts to be nourished,
there ought to be the more bloud to nourish
them: but grosse men, for the most part, eate
much lesse, than lean; because they have lesse
veins, and being inclined to sedentary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active

it is but a small portion of the Chyle, that is,

and the too plentifull exhaustion of

upon a turning of the streame of the Chyle

Now, the blood is observed to be more

the arteries, in which it is commonly more
diluted, and full of serum: but the blood is
carried to the habit of the body by the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

parts of the body, instead of this requisite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance

many things a perfect Dissimilitude or dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
For, if we compare the blood, with the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60811:37"/>
brain, the Horny coat, or Humors of the Eyes,
the Bones, tendons, and other the like parts,
we shall find little or no proportion, or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
betwixt them. In an Appolexy, where
the brain is overflowed with bloud effused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the substance of it, all the ideas or marks of
things formerly known, are quite obliterated,
nor doth any perception of them remain. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
when the eye is bloud-shodden, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity
of the coats of the eye is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
opacity, and the transmission of the visible

also are so many wayes discrepant from the
bloud, that it seems impossible they should be

said.</p>
            <p>(9) The Manner of Nutrition, is a certain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
promotion of the aliment from the state of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;<note place="margin">The prog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the state of concoction, or an Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its Spirits to a further degree of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
And therefore, the aliment must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be more crude, than the part therewith
nourished. For, that promotion is not by any
degradation, or Fixation of the Spirits of the
aliment; but by an Exaltation or reduction of
them neerer to volatility. Forasmuch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the Spirits already in the bloud, are
approached or advanced neerer to the state of
volatility, than those contained in the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mentioned: certainly, the bloud cannot
be thought a convenient nourishment for
them. The redintegration of those parts ought
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60811:38"/>
to be expected from such nutriment, as is
more fixed than themselves are: Otherwise
how could it suffice to the solidation or firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, the blood is of a more
rough and grating nature, and its spirits more
advanced toward volatility, than those resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the solid parts: and in that respect is
wholly unfit to nourish them. Moreover, it
is necessary, the Nutritive juice should be
sequestred from the blood, before it can be
opportunely brought and apponed to the parts:
if so, to what end was it admixt to the blood at
all? shall we believe, that Nature (rather than
seem idle) doth make any thing, only that she
may unmake it again afterward?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>(10) What is it selfe nourished, cannot
(without absurdity) be thought to be the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
of another:<note place="margin">The blood is it self nourish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, and doth consume the substance of the solid parts: and so cannot be their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment.</note> nor can that which is the
cause of the exhaustion of the solid parts, be
the matter of their redintegration. That the
blood is it self nourished, is manifest from the
large access of Chyle to it, after every meal:
and that it is the cause of the exhaustion of
the solid parts, is also manifest from hence,
that the Vital Heat, whose <hi>subjectum inhaesionis</hi>
is the blood, is the only consumer or depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the solid substance of the body. For,
whatever be the effects of the Vital Heat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding
in the blood, as its proper and original
subject; the very same may be justly imputed
also to the Blood itself. For, albeit we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ascribe the actions of things to their
Qualities, or Faculties; thereby indicating the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60811:38"/>
Formal Reason, or Manner; by which the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
operateth: yet we cannot deny, but it is
the very substance it self, to which those Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
are inherent, that really performeth the
action. It is the blood it self, therefore, which
by reason of its inherent Heat, doth uncessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prey upon the substance of the solid parts,
and causeth them to make provision for their
reparation, even after they have attained to
their perfect magnitude. Nor doth it only so,
but it moreover, in case of famine, converts
the solid substance of the parts into its own,
supplying its defects out of their decayes. This
is manifest, in long abstinence from meat, when
though the habit of the body be extenuated,
yet (provided the person take water, or some
other thin liquor, that may be a vehicle of the
Humours) do the arteries and veins continue
full of bloud. Thus also in Fevers, though the
stomack be so weake, as to abhorr all things
but small beer, or cooling Juleps; yet doth the
blood all that while repair it self, by colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quating
the substance of the solid parts, and
converting it into its own. For, how otherwise
could the streams of blood be dayly replenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
And, that they are replenished, is evident
from hence, that though the quantity of blood
be diminished (proportionately to the strength
of the patient) by Phlebotomy, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Fever: yet will it be again, in a day
or two after, so encreased, as to require a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and perhaps a third diminution; and
that, notwithstanding the sick person hath

               </gap>rishment all that
while. An undeniable argument, that the
bloud, in that defect of supplies from the
Chyle, doth repair it self out of the spoils of
the solid parts. Now, since the bloud doth
exhaust and depredate the solid parts; how
can it consist with reason, that it should be their
nourishment?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>(11) The Aliment of the parts ought to be

that they have no Nervs derived unto them,
through which the <hi>Succus Nutritius</hi> might be
imported into them: we conceive, that the

repaired by the fresh opposition and affixation

be thus. The Spirits, contained in our solid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment,

recourse to the heart, to be therein, as it

and dignity of perfect vitall Spirits. For, the

               </gap> differ from the Spirits contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our aliment, no otherwise than in the
gradual preparations and exaltations now
mentioned. We are to advertise moreover,
that the Heart, in its Systole, is not contracted
so closely or streightly, as to expell all the
blood contained in its Ventricles, at once: but
leaves a good part thereof remaining in them,
after the contraction is ended. And that this
remaining blood doth heat and kindle the
portion of blood next effused out of the veins
into those ventricles; and by that means exalt
it to the condition of Vital blood. We further
observe, that in the Spirits of the blood, there
are sundry degrees of volatility; so that some
attain to the highest degree of volatility much
sooner, than others; and none, untill they have
undergone severall Circulations, and as many
fresh Accensions in the Heart. For, in every
Circulation they grow more and more subtile
and agile; and so must at length be brought to
the requisite height of volatility. To which
having once attained, in the very next Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
(though they are restrained and kept in,

while they remain therein) being diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon the outward parts of the body, as
they warm and vivify those parts, so do they
soon flye away, and disperse themselves into
air. And while these thus flye away, other
Spirits lesse volatile are, by the colder tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament
of the parts, by which they pass, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
repressed: so that the force of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansive

motion is much abated, the Mication
or panting of the bloud interrupted, and the
bloud wherein they are, of Arterial, or vital
bloud, is made venouse or Natural; and such
it continueth, untill the next circulation bring
it again to the heart, there to be kindled afresh,
and exalted to the due heat of vitality. Which
once acquired, it recovers its intermitted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mication, or rising and falling alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,

the grosser ingredients of the blood, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doth exhibite the <hi>general Essence of Heat.</hi>
To which may be added this short observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that in this Contention, one while the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
prevailing, do lift up, or swell the mass of
bloud; another while the grosser elements
(the contraction of the Heart and arteries as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
them) prevailing, countermand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
that expansive motion: and that by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60811:41"/>
this alternate conquest of these Antagonists, is
made the <hi>Mication</hi> or <hi>Rising and Falling of</hi> the
blood, the one in the Dilatation, the other in
the Contraction of the Heart and arteries. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch,
therefore, as the vital Heat doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the rarefactive motion of the spirits, and
the renitence of the grosser parts of the bloud;
and that the spirits, for the most part, at least
alternately, obtain the victory and dominion
over their opponents: it seems most consenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
to truth, that <hi>this vital Heat cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
without a perpetual expence of the most pure,</hi>
i.e. <hi>the most volatile spirits of the blood;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
necessary, that during life, <hi>fresh spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
must be perpetually minted out of the blood,</hi> to
defray that vast and continual expence. And
this we conceive to be the true progress of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from the first reception of the spirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Aliment, to their education into
the Chyle, their sublimation in the heart,
their gradual exaltation to the highest degree
of volatility, and lastly their dissipation through
the skin into aer: upon which depends the

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Concerning the FIRST; we observe,<note place="margin">That the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood is <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;</hi>
               </note> that
the blood is continually carried, or rather dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

and back again from the circumference,

and vivifying all the parts, as it passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long:
and that therefore, this Motion was, by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60811:42"/>
the glorious Inventer of it, <hi>Dr. Harvey,</hi> called
the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the blood; <hi>quòd,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For, in the first place,<note place="margin">From the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Cava, into the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the heart.</note> the blood is effused <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
out of the vena Cava, into the right ventricle of
the Heart; as may be evidently seen in living
Animals dissected, especially in Coneys. For,
if the trunck of the vena Cava be bound with
a ligature, both above and below the heart;
you may perceive all the blood contained in
the space betwixt the ligatures, to be speedily
discharged into the right ventricle of the heart,
to which the vena Cava is conjoyned.</p>
            <p>From the right ventricle of the heart, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
(the heart contracting it self) expelled into the
vena arteriosa,<note place="margin">From the right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na arteriosa, into the Lungs:</note> and so into the Lungs; but not
through the septum transversum, or middle
partition of the heart, as some have imagined,
conceiving the same to have some certain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
passages from the right into the left ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle;
only because they could, without much
violence, thrust a style, or probe through it:
when, indeed, those passages are not made by
Nature, but by the point of the probe; the flesh
of the heart being so tender, as that it is easily
penetrated, by any hard and pointed instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
though but gently intruded.</p>
            <p>Passing through the vena arteriosa into the
very substance of the Lungs; the bloud is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
returned into the venosa arteria,<note place="margin">From the Lungs, through the Arteria Veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, into the left Ventricle:</note> and
through that into the Left ventricle of the

Heart. This is demonstrable thus, Having made
a ligature upon the great branch of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
venosa; neer the pericardium, in the lungs
of an Animal yet living; you may observe that
branch to be soon filled and much distended
with bloud, in that part, which is toward the
lungs, and that emptied and flaccid, that is
next the heart: and upon remove of the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the bloud will flow amain from the lungs
to the left ventricle. Now, there being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, by which this bloud can flow to the
left ventricle, but from the lungs: it must of
necessity descend thence, by the Arteria veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The left ventricle having thus taken in a

the heart instantly contracting it self, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the same (at least, good part thereof) into
the Great Artery (arising from the left ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle)
thence into the lesser arteries, and so into
the substance of the flesh; from whence the
bloud is intruded into the capillary veins, by
them into the greater veins, from them into
the vena Cava, and at length into the right
ventricle of the heart, there to begin the same
circular progress again.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> We say, from the capillary arteries into <hi>the

               <note place="margin">From the smallest Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, through the substance of the flesh, into the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest veins.</note> For, as to those, who
will have the bloud to pass out of the small ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
into the small veins, <hi>per Anastomoses,</hi> by
certain inosculations, or open passages from
those into these: we challenge them to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to the sense, any such way of entercourse
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60811:43"/>
or communication betwixt arteries and veins,
in the whole habit of the body; and <hi>Dr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi>
did the same before us, when He said, <hi>De
Anastomosi venarum &amp; arteriarum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">de mot. cord. &amp; sang. cap. 9.</note>

not the blood be as wel conceived, to permeate
through the pores of the flesh, as water through
the pores of the earth, the sweat through the
skin, the serum through the parenchyma of the
Kidneys, or as the same blood through the
thick substance of the Liver.</p>
            <p>Nor is only that bloud brought back to the
heart, by the vena Cava,<note place="margin">How the New-made blood is circ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

it before; but the stream is augmented by the
accesse of fresh Chyle also, imported into the
subclavian branches of the same vena Cava,
and thence into the right ventricle of the heart.
For, this is not only easie to be done, in respect
of the vicinity of the ascendent and descendent
trunck of the vena cava, to the right ventricle:
but also necessary, there being no other way
for the new supply of bloud to passe; and that
it is done, this experiment doth testifie. The
vena cava being bound both above and below
the heart; all the bloud contained betwixt
the two ligatures, will in a very short space be
discharged into the right ventricle.</p>
            <p>Again, the Heart seems to immit more bloud <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
into the Great Artery,<note place="margin">That more blood passeth through the heart, in an hour, than can be suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the chyle, in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dayes.</note> in the space of one
hour, than the proportion of Chyle can
amount to, in several dayes. For, in most men,
the Heart makes more than 3000. pulses, in an
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60811:44"/>
hour; and at every systole it expells some
bloud out of its left ventricle into the Aorta;
as may be sensibly demonstrated by this, that
upon a ligation of the Aorta, neer the heart,
and an incision made betwixt the ligature and
the heart, you may observe some quantity of
blood (more or lesse) to be squirted forth by
the incision, at every systole, unlesse the heart
be grown weak and languid; and yet even in
that case, some quantity of bloud will issue
forth at the hole, once in 3 or 4 pulses. Nay,
when the cone or point of the heart is cut off,
and the heart held upright; though the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles
be not then full, yet will some bloud
be squeezed out of them, every time the heart
contracts it self,<note place="margin">2 cap. de. mat. cord. &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin.</note> and that to the distance of 3 or
4 feet, as <hi>Dr. Harvey</hi> observeth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> As for the <hi>Quantity</hi> of bloud admitted into
the ventricles of the heart, when it is dilated,<note place="margin">The Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from three conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, viz.</note>
and expelled into the Great Artery, when it is
again contracted; it cannot be precisely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
For, if in the same individual person,
the motion of the heart, being sometimes more
strong and swift, and sometimes more weak
and slow, doth make the Circulation of the
blood more swift, or more slow proportionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
certainly in the species, it must be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to commensurate the quantity of blood
passing through the heart, at every pulse; since
there is great variety among men, in respect of
their different temperaments, ages, sexes, diet,
exercises, passions; and the like, all which vary
the pulse, and consequently the motion of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60811:44"/>
blood. However, that some satisfaction may be
given to enquirers herein, we are to consider
Three things, <hi>viz. (1) How much blood may be
contained in the heart of a Man, in its Diastole;
(2) How much may be expelled out of it, in its
Systole; (3) and How many Pulses,</hi> or Diastole's
and Systoles, <hi>the heart doth commonly, in healthy
and temperate men, make in an hour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>First;</hi>
               <note place="margin">the quantity of blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the heart, in its Diastole;</note> there are different
observations. <hi>Harvey</hi> saith, that in a mans
heart dilated, he found more than two ounces
of bloud. <hi>Plempius</hi> affirms, that he found al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
two ounces. <hi>Riolan</hi> will allow scarce
half an ounce, in the left ventricle; but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more in the right. And <hi>Hogeland</hi> comes
much lower, admitting only one dragme. But,
all men generally grant, that the whole masse
of blood contained in the body, doth seldome
exceed 24 pounds, or pints, and as seldome
come short of 15.</p>
            <p>Concerning,<note place="margin">the quantity expelled out of it, in its Systole.</note> the <hi>Second;</hi> we say, that in every
systole is expelled either the fourth or fifth or
sixth, or at least the eighth part of the bloud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the heart, at the precedent Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stole.
<hi>Harvey</hi> supposeth at least one dragme,
and proves that his supposition from the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
effusion of all the mass of blood, if but the
least artery be cut: and because all the blood
may be transmitted through the heart, in the
space of half an hour, He thereupon concludes
for certain, that much blood is expelled into
the great Artery, at every systole. <hi>Conringius</hi>
also makes the same compute. <hi>Walaeus</hi> and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60811:45"/>
               <hi>Sleyelius</hi> admit half an ounce: but compute
only from one scruple. <hi>Hogeland</hi> acquiesceth
in one dragme. And <hi>Thom. Bartholinus</hi> brings
it down to only half a scruple. But they all
agree, that in the contraction of the heart, the
sides of the ventricles are not drawn so close
together, as to expell all the bloud contained
in them.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Third,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Number of Pulses, in the space of an hour.</note> we remember, that
<hi>Primrose</hi> reckons 700. pulses in an hour; <hi>Riolan
2000; Waleus</hi> and <hi>Regius 3000. Cardan 4000;
Plempius 4450; Sleyelius 4876; Bartholinus
4400,</hi> or thereabouts; and <hi>Harvey</hi> about 2000;
each one numbering the pulses in his own
wrist.</p>
            <p>Now, from these three things premised we
may collect how much bloud may be expelled
out of the left ventricle of the heart, into the
Aorta, in the space of one hour, according to
the several numerations of pulses <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <item>(4) That, since the vessells are not broken,
that the blood cannot return back out of the
heart, nor be any wayes dissipated: it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary, that the blood must return to
the heart again by the veins, or be Circulated
perpetually, as the immortall <hi>Dr. Harvey</hi>
hath demonstrated.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this Circulation of the blood only

For, the swelling, caused in either vein or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
by the flux of bloud there arrested, will
alwayes appear on that side the ligature, from
whence the blood flowes.</p>
            <p>Here we are to advertise, that in the <hi>Foetus,</hi>
or Infant-unborn, the manner of the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
of the bloud,<note place="margin">But, after a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner in an Infant unborn.</note> through the vessels of the
Heart, is different from that we have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
For the blood is not carried from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
womb, into the Umbilical Arteries; but
from the <hi>Placenta Uterina</hi> (in which those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
are terminated) into the Umbilical
vein: which conducteth it along to the Liver
of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> from whence it is transmitted by
the Vena Cava into the right Ventricle of the
heart. Being brought thither, it is transferred
into the Vena Arteriosa: but, because the
Lungs are not yet moved, as after the birth,
in respiration; and so their vessels are not dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and contracted alternately, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they can neither receive the blood
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60811:47"/>
out of the Vena Arteriosa, not impell it into
the Arteria Venosa: therefore hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of Nature contrived and framed
Two peculiar passages, the one a conduit or
pipe, conveying the blood from the Vena Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriosa,
into the Great Arterie; the other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
foramen, hole, or inlett, by which the bloud
passeth from the Vena Cava into the Arteria
Venosa, thence into the left Ear of the heart,
and so down into the left Ventricle. From
thence (as well as that from the Vena Arteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osa)
it is infused into the Great Arterie. So
that in an unborn Infant, Nature useth the
two Ventricles of the heart, as if they were but
one: and this, lest the infant should have his
Blood too hot and adust, while he wants the
ventilation of the air, and expulsion of fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
exhalations, through the Lungs. From
the Great Arterie, the bloud is sent into the
Umbilical Arteries, which return it to the
<hi>Placenta Uterina;</hi> where permeating the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thereof, it is again infused into the small
branches or (rather) roots of the Umbilical
vein, by them into the trunk, and at length
into the Liver, Vena Cava, and Heart, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Having thus explained, by what wayes the
blood is moved in a round;<note place="margin">This Motion of the blood, is</note> it follows, that we
consider the <hi>CONDITIONS</hi> of that its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Concerning which, we observe that the
Circulation of the blood is,</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>Continuall.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Continual;</note> For, since the Heart is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in motion, and takes in blood, in its
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60811:47"/>
Diastole, and dischargeth the same again,
in its Systole, never intermitting that its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
action, but in great swooning fits, or in the
very article of death: it is necessary, that the
motion of the bloud be likewise continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p>(2) <hi>Vehement;</hi> as may be inferred from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/>
hardness and distention of an arterie,<note place="margin">vehement;</note> or vein
bound with a ligature. For, nothing can be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stended
to great hardness, by a thin and liquid
matter, especially upward, unless that matter
be with vehemence impelled into, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it. But, this vehemence of the motion is
greatest neer the heart, and is afterward dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by degrees, according to the severall
degrees of distance from the heart; so that the
extream arteries have but little pulse, unless it
happens, that the impellent force of the heart
be encreased, as in Fevers, Inflammations, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
exercise, some passions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is
also the reason, why the veins have no pulse,
the impulse of the blood being less in them,
than in the smallest arteries.</p>
            <p>(3) <hi>Swift.</hi>
               <note place="margin">swift;</note> For, an artery or vein being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/>
by ligature, will swell up and be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stended,
as it were in a moment; and the blood
may be observed to flow in its course very
swiftly, so soon as the ligature is removed. But
how swiftly, is not easily determined; there
being so great variety of Causes, Natural, Non-naturall,
and Preternatural, that accelerate
or retard the flux of the blood: only thus may
be inferred from the precedent compute of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60811:48"/>
number of Pulses, and the quantity of blood
expelled out of the left ventricle of the heart,
in every systole, That the whole mass of blood
doth pass through the heart once in an hour
or two, at most. Yet is not the current of blood
neer so swift in its channels, while they are
whole, as when one of them (vein or artery) is
cut: because in that case, the blood streams
forth into the free and easily-yielding aer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any resistance; but being confined in its
vessels, it is forced to distend them, and drive-on
the foregoing current.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/>(4) <hi>As swift in the Veines, as in the Arteries.</hi>
For,<note place="margin">Of equall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity in the Arteries and veins.</note> though the impulse be more vehement in
the atteries, as being continued to the heart,
than in the veins; and therefore it might seem
reasonable, at first consideration, that the
motion should be proportionately more swift
in the arteries: yet, considering, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
are still smaller and smaller toward
their extremities, &amp; that the flux of the blood
must needs be more and more retarded, as it
approacheth those extremities; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that the veins grow wider and wider,
from their extremities, to the centre of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and so the blood hath still larger and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
spaces to run through, in its return to the
heart; we may safely conclude (conjectural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
that the velocity of the motion is as great
in the veins, as in the arteries. This is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by sense; for, the Vena Cava, in all that
tract from the Liver, to the subclavian divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may be observed to beat, as often as the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60811:48"/>
Great Artery; and so must import blood into
the right Ventricle, as fast as the <hi>Aorta</hi> doth
export it from the left. Which doubtless is the
reason, why the Vena Cava hath fleshy Fibres
upon it, when it approacheth the heart. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
we conceive the motion to be swif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Arteries, when the heart contracting
it self, doth impell the blood into and through
them; than when, dilating it self again, it doth
intermit that its impulse. Which is true like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of the blood in the veins, as may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
observed in <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> when the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not so streight, as to cause much disten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the vein, in which the incision is made:
for, in that case, the blood wil flow forth more
swiftly, every time the heart is contracted.
And these are the <hi>Conditions</hi> of this admirable
motion of the blood.</p>
            <p>Lastly, concerning the <hi>CAUSE</hi> of this
motion; it is necessary that the blood be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
either by it self, or by some other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
and if it be the Author of its own motion,
then that must be in respect of either an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
motive-Faculty, or of its Ebullition, or of
its Rarefaction, or of its Quantity, whereby
the Ventricles of the heart are distended, and
so irritated as to discharge the same, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
themselves. If the motion be derived
from an External principle; then it must be
referred either to Attraction, or to Vection, or
to Pulsion. Let us, therefore, see which of all
these may be the most likely cause of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60811:49"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the bloud is not the cause of its
own Motion,<note place="margin">The blood, not the cause of its owne motion, in respect of any motive <hi>Faculty,</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in it.</note> 
               <hi>ratione insitae sibi Facultatis,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of any inherent Faculty; may be inferred
from hence, that in bloud effused out of its ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
into the body, or any other receiver, no
motion at all can be observed: and it is hard to
conceive, that it should be so corrupted in a
moment, as wholly to lose a faculty essential
to it. <hi>Dr. Harvey,</hi> we confess, affirmeth, that he
observed a certain obscure motion of the
blood, in the right ear of the Heart (where
He supposeth the motion of the Heart first to
begin, and last to end) after the Ear had cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to move; but we refer that to the Mication
of the blood from the Vital Spirits not yet
wholly extinguished.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is not the Author of its own
motion,<note place="margin">Nor, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of its <hi>Ebullition.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>ratione Ebullitionis</hi> (which <hi>Arist.</hi> calls
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) is manifest from these subsequent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
(1) No Ebullition can be constantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
or of the same tenour: but the Pulse of
the heart, and so the motion of the bloud, is,
in temperate and healthy men, for the most
part equall. (2) As the Ebullition is greater,
so would the pulse; but in burning Fevers, the
Ebullition is extream great, by reason of the
great intension of the heat; and yet the pulse
is frequently small, and weak; as also in the
beginning of putrid Fevers, as <hi>Galen</hi> long since
remarked. (3) The blood suffers no ebulliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as it passeth through the heart. For, if in the
dissection of a living Animal, you make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
either into the left Ventricle of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60811:49"/>
heart, or into the Great Artery neer it; you
shall perceive the blood flowing out at the
hole, to be pure and such as before it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heart, not frothy, boyling, or rarefied; and
to continue such as at its first efflux: yea, more,
if you receive the blood issuing from an incisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> in one sawcer, and that
issuing from the left Ventricle, in another; you
shall not be able to discern any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the one and the other, either soon, or a
good while after. An invincible argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Ebullition of the blood, first imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and since defended by many
great men, his sectators. (4) The plunging an
arme or legg into cold water, would suppress
the Ebullition, and consequently the motion
of the blood. For, if you apply a close
ligature to a mans arme, and then immerge the
same into cold water, or Snow; upon solution
of the ligature, he shall find the blood retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to his heart, with so great a sense of cold,
as very much to offend him. Which cold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
to the bloud, from its being long detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the extremities of the arme bound; <hi>Dr.
Harvey</hi> will have to be the cause of swooning
immediately after blood-letting, in many
men; the heart receiving injury from that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
cold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Not <hi>ratione Rarefactionis;</hi> because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/>
(1) in living dissections,<note place="margin">Nor of its <hi>Rarefaction.</hi>
               </note> where the heart yet
continueth its motion, no man ever hath, or
can observe any such thing as rarefied blood
to flow from either the left ventricle, or the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60811:50"/>
Great Artery, if cut; but pure and such as is
from the Ears let down into the ventrices.
(2) The Heart it self, when cut in pieces, or
wounded, may be observed to beat; yet not
from any rarefaction of the blood, for then it
hath no blood in either of its Ventricles, or
Ears. (3) It hath been observed in Doggs,
that after the point of the heart hath been cut
off, and the remainder turn'd upside down,
though the ventricles could not be halfe full,
the blood hath yet been squirted forth at the
top, even to the distance of three or four feet;
which were impossible, in case the rarefaction
of the blood were the cause of its motion.
(4) The musculous flesh of the heart, is more
firme and strong, than to be subject to inflati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and detumescence, meerly from the rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the blood. It must be a more force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible
Agent, that moves that great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
machine of the heart. (5) If the blood were
so much rarefied in the Ventricles, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ought the orifices of the Vena Arterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,
and Aorta, to have been much larger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the blood would have required more
room for its egress, than for its ingress. (6) The
motion of the heart, and of its valves would
be confused; for the Diastole of this, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them, would happen at the same
time, and consequently the valves would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
useless; both which are repugnant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
Besides, the opening and shutting
of the valves would be co-incident with the
Systole of the Great Artery. (7) That the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60811:50"/>
blood should be rarefied in the heart, and in a
moment again refrigerated in the arteries; is
contrary both to sense and reason: and
if the rarefaction should so soon cease; why is
it at all?</p>
            <p>It remains, therefore, that if the blood be
the efficient of its own motion, it must be so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/>
only <hi>ratione Quantitatis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">But of its <hi>Quantity</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stending the Ventricles of the heart.</note> by reason of its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
filling and distending the Ventricles of
the heart, and irritating them to discharge it,
by contracting or shurting themselves. For,
the heart being as it were burdened with the
blood distending its cavities, doth contract its
Fibers and so its Ventricles, to vindicate it self
from that oppression; no otherwise than the
stomach, guts, bladder, womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extended by meat, chyle, wind, urine, and
the infant, drive themselves together, by the
help of their Fibers, and so exclude that was
burdensome to them. And thus is it probable,
that the Heart is continually moved by the
blood, like a Mill perpetually agitated by a
stream of water; which stream being cut off,
the motion instantly ceaseth. This may be
credited upon the force of this one experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
if the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> be intercepted by a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature,
so soon as the heart hath disburdened
it self of what blood it hath received from
thence, it instantly remitteth its motion; and
upon letting in the stream again, by removing
the ligature, it as suddenly recovers it. Than
which there cannot be a more convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that the quantity of the blood flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60811:51"/>
into the ventricles, is a cause of the motion
of the heart, and so of its own motion.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60811:51"/>
conjoyned, as a concomitant cause, with the

it be, that this Faculty doth regulate the

otherwise be irregular; or that of it self it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the motion, which cannot be afterward

interrupted. That this Faculty is necessary,
may be inferred from these <hi>Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1) As the Pulse, so the influx of the bloud
would be alwayes unequall, unless it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by a Faculty. (2) When the bloud is
moved vehemently in Fevers, by the intense
heat agitating and urging it; and in men at the
point of death, <hi>propter extremos naturae conatus,</hi>
by reason of Natures agony and last efforts:
yet is the pulse more weak and low, than at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times, because the Pulsifick Faculty is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
much opprest, or much weakned. On the
other side, though the Faculty continue strong,
yet is the influx of the bloud much diminished,
after large haemorrhages, or upon great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
of the capillary arteries and veins, in
the habit of the body. Which consideration
seems to us sufficient to import the necessity of
conjoyning a Pulsifick Faculty, with the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the blood distending and so molesting
the Heart, as a <hi>double proxime cause</hi> of the bloods
motion.</p>
            <p>(3) Though the heart be cut in pieces, yet
will each piece have a kind of weak pulsation,
as long as it continues warme; which in all
probability is to be ascribed to the Faculty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60811:52"/>
in all its Fibres, and not yet utterly
destroyed.</p>
            <p>(4) It would be derogatory to the majesty
of that Prince of all the parts, the Heart, to be
moved by the violent impulse of an external
principle, and it self conduce nothing thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these reasons alleaged, we
dare not set up our rest in this doctrine of the
Ancients, concerning a Pulsifick Faculty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted

the <hi>Perisystole:</hi> all which are to be explained
by their proper Causes, according as ocular
Inspection, and Reason doth dictate them to the
understanding.</p>
            <p>(1) The <hi>Systole,</hi> being the proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
motion of the heart, is the Contraction
or drawing together of the heart to a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
compass, that so the blood contained in the
right ventricle may be expelled through the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60811:53"/>
vena arteriosa into the Lungs; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the left, may be expelled into the
Great Artery, and so into all parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>(2) The <hi>Diastole,</hi> being a motion only Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentary
to the heart, is a Dilatation, or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the heart, that the blood may flow into
the right ventricle, out of the vena Cava; and
into the left, out of the Arteria Venosa.</p>
            <p>(3) The <hi>Perisystole,</hi> is a certain quiet or short
respite betwixt the Contraction and Dilatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the heart, during the small time, that the
blood is entering into, or issuing out of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles.
In healthy men, this pause is so short,
as not to be distinguished from either of the
two contrary motions: but sufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in men at the point of death. It is also
<hi>double,</hi> there being one respite betwixt the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stole
and Diastole; and another betwixt the
Diastole and Systole. And this is the natural
state of the Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> As to the <hi>Figure,</hi> or <hi>Forme</hi> of the heart in
those contrary motions;<note place="margin">And the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> of it in each.</note> from the dissection of
Animals alive, from the commodity of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and quiet, and from the position of its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and other parts, we have learned it to be
thus.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Systole,</hi> it may be observed that (1)
the point of the heart is drawn upward toward
the Basis of it, in order to the expulsion of the
blood; the length of it being diminished, and
bredth proportionately encreased: because
the basis is immoveable, in respect of the cone,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60811:53"/>
which is fastned neither to, nor by any vessells.
(2) The <hi>inner</hi> walls, or sides toward the ribbs,
are brought neerer each to other; because they
are constringed and made narrower, as may
be perceived by putting a finger into either of
the ventricles, at the time of their contraction:
but the <hi>outward,</hi> becoming tumid, seem to be
enlarged in latitude, from the contraction of
all parts inflated in the tension or stretching.
(3) The fore part of the heart is lifted up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the sternum, and chiefly neer the base;
for, where the pulse is felt, there doth the heart
strike the breast with its base, that part being
lifted up, and brought neer to the sternon: and
at the same time (not in the Diastole) is the
heart vigorated, and the arteries dilated and
filled; and the pulses are felt both in the breast
and wrist, the Diastole of the Arteries being
coincident with the Systole of the heart. But
the Pulse is more plainly felt in the left side,
because there is the origine and orifice of the
Aorta. (4) The whole heart becomes tense
and hard, and contracted to a smaller bulk;
as is manifest both to the sight, and to the
touch. (5) The heart appears white, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in imperfect Animals, such as Serpents,
Frogs, Eeles, &amp;c. by reason of the expulsion of
the blood in the Systole.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Perisystole,</hi> when the heart is soft, lux,
and in its proper state, (1) the cone recedeth
from the base; and in some Animals, the base
also recedeth from the cone: (2) The late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts, both the interior and exterior, are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60811:54"/>
tended toward the ribbs: (3) The anterior
face of the heart sinks down, and the posterior
is depressed, especially neer the orifice of the
great Artery.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Diastole,</hi> which beginns in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Dilatation, and ends in the middle
of the Contraction. (1) the upper side is lifted
up and distended by the blood falling into the
ventricles out of the Vena cava, and Arteria
venosa; the swelling sensibly beginning at the
base, and progressing to the cone. But the base
doth not them strike the breast, because the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
at that instant are contracted, and the
heart ceaseth from expulsion of the blood. (2)
The heart is flaccid and soft, because it is then
only passive, in receiving the blood. (3) The
sides become extense, and the cavities enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and therefore if you put your finger into
the heart, during the Diastole, you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no constriction, as in the Systole. (4)
The heart appears red, because of the tenuity
of its walls, and their repletion with blood.
(5) The Cone receding from the base, makes
the heart longer, that it may be more capable
of blood. And thus doth the heart vary its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
in each of these three positions.</p>

            <p>Concerning the <hi>FIRST,</hi> we observe, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the blood being a heterogeneous liquor,<note place="margin">The Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of various Elements or material prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
(as the Element of which it is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te)
and so not capable to be wholly changed
into either the fewel of the Vital Heat; or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Spirits: when those parts of it, which had
their Spirits less closely and firmely united
to their grosser Elements, or (which is the same
thing) which were most prone to volatility;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60811:55"/>
are consumed and dispersed; it cannot be, but
that the remains or reliques thereof must
thenceforth become not only useless, but also
incommodious to Nature, and therefore as
soon as may be, to be rejected. For the sweet
and inflammable Spirits of the blood being
exhausted; to what use can the remaining
mass serve? It can be no longer the subject or
residence of the Vitall Heat, for the conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof the blood is principally made:
nay, if retained in the body, it would rather
damnifie and destroy the same noble princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Vital Heat. For, the <hi>Sulphur</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the blood, doth by reason of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
mication and indeavour of the Spirits
to fly away and disperse themselves, and of
the decocting activity of the Vitall Heat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
upon it, become adust, and contract a
manifest bitterness and acrimony; and the
<hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> or Terrene and grosser part,
conjoyned with the Fixative Salt, is apt to coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
and to be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>trified; and the <hi>Phlegma,</hi> or
insipid and viscid part is apt to obstruct the
capillary arteries and veins, and so impede
the Circulation; and lastly, the <hi>Aqueous</hi> part,
or potulent matter, as being apt to render the
bloud too dilute and serous, is wholly unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
These parts, therefore, being no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
usefull ingredients of the bloud, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into Excrements; and ought to be seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
from it.</p>
            <p>This Generation of the Excrements of the
bloud, may be appositely adumbrated by the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60811:55"/>
Example of Wine distilled. For,<note place="margin">Exemplified in the destilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wine.</note> as Wine is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
a Liquor consisting <hi>ex Elementis primiceriis,</hi> of
Various choyce ingredients, or dissimilar
parts: so is the blood. As the Spirits or more
fugitive parts of Wine, are easily separable
from the more fixed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Phlegme, Tartar,
crass Sulphur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by heat: so are the Spirits
of the blood easily separated from the more
fixed parts of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Phlegme, Salt Tartar,
crass Sulphur adust, the Aqueous or potulent
matter, by the activity of the Vital Heat. As
the Spirits of Wine are, by repeated destilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
advanced to that height of Volatility or
subtility, as that some of them flye away and
are dispersed into air, in every rectification:
so likewise are the Spirits of the blood, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Circulations through the heart,
brought to that degree of subtility and volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
as that they cannot be longer contained
or imprisoned in the body of an Animal, but
penetrating through the pores, are exhaled by
way of dry sweat, or insensible transpiration.
And as the residue of the Wine, after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are gone, remains a dead mass, or vappa,
consisting only of a Phlegme, Tartar, and crass
Sulphur (which by long heat acquireth a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness
and acrimony:) so doth the residue of
the blood, after its Spirits are exhausted and
dispersed. For, (as we said afore) the caseous
and grumous parts of the blood, being brought
to the state of Fusion, by the Vital Heat, make
that excrement called the Phlegma: the Saline
and earthly parts consociated, make the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60811:56"/>
which being dissolved and kept fluid by
the potulent matter (to which it is easily mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
make the Urine: and the crass sulphur, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by the Vital heat, and inseparably float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the serum, makes the Bile, or Cholerick
excrement. And this Diversity of parts in
the blood is evident even to the sense, in blood
let forth of either vein or artery into a vessell.
For, there the caseous or grumous parts
(which being most elaborate, and brought to a
certain degree of Fusion, have thereby acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a viscidity) swim on the top, in the forme
of a whitish filme or membrane; while other
parts of the same kind, having not attained to
the like degree of Fusion and viscidity, sinck
to the bottome; and the serous or watery (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with the Salt, and somewhat of the
crass Sulphur adust) flow round about the
rest.</p>

Mucus: whether it be <hi>Acid,</hi> such as is

(2) the <hi>Bile,</hi> both that which is collected in the
bladder of the Gall, and that deposed in the
cavities of the Ears, called the <hi>Ear-wax;</hi> for
these two seem to be cousin germans, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

            <p>The <hi>Urine,</hi> is a serous excrement, impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

of the Bile; brought by the Emulgent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
into the Kidneys, together with the
blood; there separated from the blood, by a

Ureters into the bladder, and at length avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>The <hi>Sweat,</hi> is likewise a serious excrement,
impregnated with a small quantity of Salt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
out of the capillary arteries into the
habit of the body, and thence excerned

            <p>
               <hi>Tears</hi> also are a serous and brackish excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            </p>

               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:60811:57"/>
(at least a good part thereof) is a mild and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid
exhalation of the blood in the arteries,
sweating through the coats of the smaller
arteries, collected by degrees in the Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,
and by them again infused into the
blood, as well to prevent the coagulation, as
to promote the mication thereof; and after
various Circulations, avoided by evaporation
through the skin.</p>
            <p>Among the Less Thin Excrements,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phlegmatick mucus</hi> found in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
is a thick viscid excrementitious juice,
endowed with some Acidity, brought into the
coats of the stomach, by those branches of the
Celiacal artery, which are therein terminated
there secerned from the blood, and by transu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
immitted into the cavity of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;
to the end, that it may serve to excite
the Appetite, and in place of a Ferment,
promote the dissolution and concoction of the
meat.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pituitous Mucus</hi> found in the Guts, is
an insipid excrement spewed out of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senterick
arteries, into the substance of the
guts, transmitted by insensible passages into
the hollow of them; serving to defend them
from the injuries of the Chyle and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the belly passing through them, and
at length to be excluded together with those
excrements, by stool.</p>
            <p>That <hi>distilling from the Brain,</hi> is a pituitous
excrement, severed from the blood brought
thither by the Arteries, and excerned either
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60811:57"/>
by the Palate, or nostrills. Such also are the
sputum, which falls down from the pituitary
Glandules situate about the basis of the brain:
and the saliva, which is generated of humours
imported into the Almonds of the Ears, the
<hi>Glandulae sublinguales,</hi> and other spongy parts
in the jawes and mouth, and therein separated;
for the moystning of the mouth, and softning
of the solid meat, in mastication.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bile,</hi> or <hi>yellow Choler</hi> found in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

conveyd by convenient vessells (which we

            <p>Lastly, the <hi>Ear-wax</hi> is a bilious excrement,

being thus explained; it followes
that we now discuss the Manner of their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the blood, in the parts specified,
framed by Nature to that end. Which that
we may do with the more satisfaction and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity;
it is requisite, that we premise some
short disquisition, as well concerning the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why such or such Excrements (all being
promiscuously blended together, or flowing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60811:58"/>
confusedly together in the arteries with the
blood) are yet carried into such or such parts,
rather than into any others: as concerning the
various wayes Nature hath contrived, for the
separation of Humours each from other, in the
body. For, these Generals being explicated,
anticipate the remove of many of those diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and obscurities, that we shall encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in our scrutiny into Particulars.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Former,</hi> therefore, we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise;
that the Reason, why the Acid
Phlegme contained in the blood, is imported
rather into the Stomach, than into the guts;
the Insipid Phlegme rather into the Guts, than
into the stomach; the serum into the Kidneys,
rather then into the Liver; and the Bile into
the Liver, rather than into either the Stomach,
Guts, or Kidneys: we say, the reason of this,
is not that each particular Excrement is so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
by any Intelligent Faculty, whose of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is to distinguish not only the excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
parts of the blood from the benigne and
profitable, but also the excrementitious one
from another, and to dispense each to the part
ordained for its separation: nor that each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
is attracted by and to its like, as if the
Phlegme preexistent in the stomach and guts
did, by reason of similitude of substance, draw
to it self those Phlegmatique particles of the
blood, that hold the neerest analogy to its own
nature; and so of the serum in the Kidneys,
the Bile in the Liver, <hi>Porus bilarius,</hi> and bladder
of the Gall, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:60811:58"/>
Not by any <hi>Intelligence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Not, that it is so directed by any <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing faculty.</note> or <hi>distinguishing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;</hi>
because the soul, or Mind (whose Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

               </gap>rement doth
consist of particles of a determinate Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,

only a distinct manner of Conformation of its

and figure, different from those of all other
organs, and accommodated only to that Action
or Office, for which the same was made: it is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60811:59"/>
highly reasonable to conceive, by way of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that the blood being diffused through

the magnitude and figure of its slender passages

doubtless, is it, that the serous part of the blood

the Phlegmatique into the stomach, and guts;
the Bilious into the Liver, &amp;c. rather than into

we conceive it likewise to belong to the very
same Cause, as their Reception or Admission
doth; <hi>viz,</hi> to the determinate magnitude and
figure of the insensible passages and pores in the
Parenchyma of this or that part. Because the
separation of each Excrement is effected by a
kind of Cribration, or Percolation; and in all
percolations, the particles of the matter trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
ought both in magnitude and figure,
to hold an analogy with the pores of the body,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60811:60"/>
through which they are transmitted. Now,
that the Parenchymata of the separatory or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
named, are endowed with various se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
passages and pores of different magnitudes
and figures; is manifest from hence, that their
component particles are variously contexed,
(in one more loosely, rarely and thinly, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more closely, densly and thickly) and the
vessells and Fibers running through them as
variously formed, in magnitude, longitude,

is, it doth necessitate an equal diversity of
pores, which are nothing else but the void

of Humors in the body, be manifold and
various: yet may they all be commodiously
reduced to <hi>Two Kinds,</hi> all being in order either
to <hi>Nutrition,</hi> or to <hi>Excretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the <hi>First</hi> Kind, we have an example in
the Nutrition of the Fibers and Membranous
parts of the body. For, it is most probable,
that those parts (if not all the rest) are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60811:60"/>
by the <hi>Succus Nutritius,</hi> brought to them
through the Nervs; and that Aliment, being
somewhat glutinous, like the white of an Egg,
cannot easily penetrate into their substance,
without the help of a certain thin and watery
vehicle; which having once done that office
of introducing the <hi>succus nutritius</hi> into these
parts, becometh thenceforth unprofitable to
them, and so is presently discharged by the
<hi>Lympheducts</hi> into more ample spaces.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Other Kind,</hi> there are <hi>Three distinct
sorts.</hi> Whereof the <hi>First</hi> is, <hi>when the thicker hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
is retained, and the thinner rejected:</hi> of which
we have an example in the Kidneys, where
the serum is transmitted into the Ureters and
bladder, while the pure blood is retained, to
be returned into the vena Cava, by the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
veins. The same is also effected in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of Sweat, Tears, and spittle.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> (contrary to the first) is, <hi>when the
thinner humor is retained, and the thicker rejected;</hi>
as in the coats of the stomach and guts, where
the Mucous Excrement or Phlegme is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into their cavities, and the blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to be sent by the veins into the vena por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae:
and in the brain, in which the like Mucus
is separated from the blood, and deduced into
the palate and nostrills.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third, when two humors of equal consistence
or thicknesse are separated one from the other,</hi> this
being retained, and that rejected. And this
Colature is performed in the parenchyma of
the Liver, For, the Fellous humor, and the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60811:61"/>
blood, while warm, are very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eer of equall
thickness: and yet hath nature found out a
certain way of percolation, which easily distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
and separateth them each from other
A thing far transcending the industry of man,
who can make no Artificial Colature, by
which two Liquors of equall con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>istence may
be separated one from another.</p>
            <p>These Considerations premised in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
we now at length come to explicate the
<hi>Particular Manner,</hi> how each Excrement is
separated, in its peculiar place.</p>

               </gap>ncles)
convey the same into the truncks of the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
themselves, from whence it spontaneously

into the capillary veins respondent to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Thus long doth the <hi>Bilious</hi> Excrement inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately
accompany the <hi>Phlegmatique,</hi> flowing
along together with it through the branches
of the <hi>Celiacal</hi> and <hi>Mesenterick</hi> arteries,<note place="margin">That the <hi>Bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Excrement doth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, to the stomach and guts; and why.</note> into
the coats of the stomach and guts; but, when
it once comes there, it leaves its associate, the
Phlegme, to be, after the manner expressed,
transmitted into their cavities, and being
throughly commixt with the blood, is propel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into the extremities of the capillary veins,
answering to the extremities of the capillary
arteries, that brought it thither; and from
thence is carried along into <hi>Vena portae,</hi> and at
length into the substance of the Liver, therein
to be segregated from the blood. Nor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
ought this Bilious Excrement to be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60811:62"/>
sooner dissociated from the Phlegmatique; or
conveyed by any neerer way, or shorter cut, in
direct vessels tending from the descendent
trunk of the great artery, to the trunk of the
<hi>vena portae;</hi> and that for <hi>Three</hi> important <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> it seems necessary that the Bilious
humor should accompany the Phlegme, untill
it hath brought the same into the substance
of the stomach and guts; because the Phlegme,
being a mucous and visoid humor, would be
apt to obstruct the capillary vessels, and insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
pores of those parts, unless it were made
more dilute and penetrative, by the admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Bile, an humor penetrative and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergent,
and so fit to prevent obstructions. This
reason may receive verification from hence,
that Men of a hot and cholerick constitution,
and such in whom this Bilious Excrement
doth abound more than in others, are seldom
or never troubled with obstructions of the
stomach and guts, by gross and viscid humors:
whereas, on the contrary, those of colder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions
(especially Virgins <hi>Leuco-Phlegmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi>
and afflicted with the Green-sickness) in
whom less of choler is generated, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
oppressed with oppilations of those
parts, from abundance of tough and tenacious
phlegme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Bilious humor it self seems to
require some certain degree of <hi>preparation,</hi>
conductive to its future separation, before it
can be commodiously imported into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60811:63"/>
For, should it be convey'd into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
directly out of the descendent trunk of the
great artery; it could not be avoided, but some
part of the Phlegme would also be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it: because those humors, while
they remain in the arteries, are never actually
separa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed; and when they are, their separation
is made, by the recess or going off of the
Phlegme into the stomach and guts. And if
any part of the Phlegme should accompany
the blood into the Liver; the Liver would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be inevitably obnoxious to great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
such as would soon render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for the office, by Nature assigned unto
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Bile certainly is more firmely
united to the blood, than the Phlegme; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
essentially radicated in the serous part
thereof, so that without some further prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
it cannot be easily severed from it. And
therefore it was requisite, that the Bile should
be carried about by those ambages of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and gutts, that by passing through those
intricate meanders, it might acquire some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
preparatory to its succeeding separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now, that which gives it this previous
disposition, is a peculiar Fermentation, which
it undergoes in the vessels leading it along in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the trunck of the Vena portae: it being most
undeniable, that the speediest means in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for the separation of impure humors
from pure, is by Fermentation, as may be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
exemplified in Wine and Beer, which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60811:63"/>
are soon defecated by the help of Fermentation,
but never without it. These Reasons, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
make it evident, that Nature was guilty
of no oversight or rashness, when she ordained,
that the Bilious Humor should be thus carried
about through such indirect and long wayes,
before it arrive at the Liver; seeing that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
doth make its separation afterward
both the more safe, and more easie.</p>
            <p>Nor did Nature play the wanton, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogate,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
when she contrived,<note place="margin">Why the Blood is not carried imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately out of the trunck of the <hi>vena portae,</hi> into that of the <hi>vena cava;</hi> but through the various meanders in the Liver.</note> that the blood
should be carried along through all those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
labyrinths in the Liver; forasmuch as
if the blood were to be infused into the trunck
of the vena cava, by some vessell immediately
and directly tending from the trunck of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
portae, the Bilious humor, being not yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from it, would necessarily pollute and
corrupt the whole mass of blood. To avoid
that inconvenience, therefore, was it requisite,
that the blood should be first diverted into the
Liver, and therein defecated from its remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impurities, before it be permitted to enter
the vena cava.</p>
            <p>When it is brought into the Liver, it doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>
not pass through the capillary branches of the
vena portae,<note place="margin">And why it is transmitted through the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Liver.</note> into the extremities of the capilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
branches of the Vena cava, immediately or
<hi>per Anastomoses,</hi> as was long believed and
taught by Anatomists; because we have the
testimony of our eyes, that there are no such
<hi>Anastomoses,</hi> or mutual Inosculations betwixt
the extremities of those vessells: but, it is first
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60811:64"/>
percolated through the Parenchyma or very
substance of the Liver. Now, to what end is
it so percolated? That percolation must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be in order either to some <hi>Alteration,</hi> or
to some <hi>Separation.</hi> It cannot be in order to
any <hi>Alteration,</hi> because no such thing can be
imagined to be effected in the Liver, since the
Liquor passing through the Liver, as it came-in
blood, so doth it go out blood. It must, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
conduce to the <hi>separation</hi> of something
from the blood. And that something can be
nothing but the <hi>Bilious Excrement;</hi> because all
other Excrements are separated, before the
blood arrive at the confines of the Liver: and
because no other Excrement can be found
therein. Which consideration is alone suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to evince, that <hi>the Office of the whole Liver, is
to receive the blood out of the vena portae, to purge it
from the Bilious Excrement, and to discharge it so

through the branches of the vena Portae; the

the branches of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> export
the blood, after its purification; and those of
the <hi>Porus Bilarius</hi> export the Bile, after its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:
so that it is manifest, that all these

            </p>
            <p>(1) That the Capillary branches of each

equally into all parts of the Parenchyma; so
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60811:65"/>
that the Port-vein doth dispense the blood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
into all parts thereof; and the capillary
branches of the <hi>Porus Bilarius,</hi> being likewise
disseminated through all parts of the same, lye
ready to admit the Bilious<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>humor, as fast as it
is separated from the blood; and the capillary
branches of the <hi>vena cava,</hi> being also dispersed
into all parts of the same, are ready to receive
the pure blood, as fast as it is defecated from
the Bile. Which is some document, that this
whole work of purifying the blood from the
Bilious humor, is performed in the Liver, only
<hi>Mechanically,</hi> and that with the greatest facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
imaginable: nor is it possible for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
wit of man, to imagine any fabrique more
commodious for the effecting thereof, than this
of the Liver is.</p>
            <p>(2) That the <hi>Vena portae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pulsation of the Vena Portae within the Liver.</note> being entred into
the body of the Liver, doth acquire a certain
<hi>Pulsation</hi> (though weak and less perfect than
that of an Artery) by the benefit partly of the
<hi>Capsula communis,</hi> that includeth it, and partly
of the <hi>Arteria Hepatica,</hi> that accompanieth it.
For, being included in the same common case
with the <hi>Arteria Hepatica,</hi> it must necessarily
be compressed, in some measure, by the systole
thereof; and again be relaxed, in the diastole:
and by that means suffer a certain Dilatation
and Compression alternately. And being so
compressed, it must impell the blood into the
parenchyma; and that blood must be driven
on by the next succeeding blood: so as that the
motion and distribution thereof is necessarily
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60811:66"/>
continued by that impulse, without the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any either <hi>Similary Attraction,</hi> or <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Faculty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3) That the <hi>Hepatick Nerve</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
also to conduce somewhat to that Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of the <hi>Vena Portae.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The assistance of that Pulsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the Hepatick Nerve.</note> For, that Nerve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is included in the <hi>Capsella Communis,</hi> and no
less distributed upon the same, than upon the
branches of the <hi>Porus Bilarius.</hi> And, therefore,
when the <hi>Arteria Hepatica</hi> is dilated, this
Nerve, as being contiguous to it, must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
compressed; and so irritated to make
some small Contraction of it self: which being
impossible to be effected, without a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
constriction of the <hi>Capsula Communis;</hi>
it comes to pass, that the <hi>Vena Portae</hi> included
in the same <hi>Capsula,</hi> suffereth a constriction, at
the same time.</p>
            <p>(4) It is probable, that this Pulsatile motion
of the <hi>Vena Portae</hi> within the Liver,<note place="margin">The Resusci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in the blood, in the branches of the <hi>Vena Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae,</hi> within the Liver; and a new <hi>Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> thereof, praevious to the separation of the Bile.</note> doth cause
some new <hi>Fermentation</hi> of the blood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dintegrate
the decayed <hi>Vitality</hi> thereof, in such
a proportion, as may be sufficient to vivify the
<hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Liver, and conduce to the
more easie and speedy separation of the Bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
impurities therein: especially considering
that the Spirits of the blood brought in, are
hindered from flying away (as they usually
do through the thinner coats of the veins) by
the thickness of the <hi>Capsula Communis,</hi> and so
kept together to resuscitate the Mication and
renew the Vitality thereof. That this is so,
may be in part inferred from hence, that the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60811:66"/>
Vital Spirits can be no otherwise communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to this Parenchyma; the <hi>Arteria Hepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica</hi>
being wholly distributed upon the <hi>Capsula
Communis,</hi> and the branches of the <hi>Porus Bilarius,</hi>
but never touching the Parenchyma with so
much as one small surcle. Now there being
no vessel that brings blood into the Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
but only the <hi>Vena Portae;</hi> that Parenchyma
must of necessity be deprived of all Vitality,
unless we allow the blood, brought by the
<hi>Porta,</hi> to recover its vital disposition, by the
means of the Pulsation caused in the <hi>Porta,</hi> and
the excitement of a new Fermentation from
the restraint of the Spirits. For, without the
influx of vitall blood, no part can be vivified:
and certain it is, the Parenchyma doth receive
no blood, but only from the <hi>Vena Portae.</hi> This
Resuscitation of the Vitall Spirits in the blood,
brought into the Liver, may be adumbrated
by the example of the heart of a Viper, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animal of like vivacity. For, the Heart
being cut out of the Viper yet alive, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon a table, doth a good while retain its
pulsation; and as that motion begins to decay,
by reason of the consumption of the Vitall
Heat, if you but drop some warm liquor upon
the then languishing heart, it will instantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive,
and beat again, untill it grows cold. And
such doubtless is this small spark of life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enkindled
in the blood contained in the <hi>Vena
Portae,</hi> within the Liver: which though but
small, may yet be sufficient both to enliven the
Parenchyma, and to excite some gentle Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60811:67"/>
in the blood, conducible to its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification
in that place.</p>
            <p>Now, to bring all this into a narrower cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;
if we reflect upon the Equall Dissemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the foresaid vessels through all
parts of the Parenchyma; upon the Pulsation
of the Vena Portae, within the limits of the
Liver, whereby the motion of the blood is
made more strong and quick; upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of that pulsation, by the Hepatick Nerv
spontaneously contracting it self, after every
diastole of the Hepatick Artery; and lastly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the resuscitation of Vitality in the blood,
and its renewed Fermentation (which always
precedeth the separation of any humor from
the blood): we say, reflecting upon these things,
we may plainly understand, with how little of
difficulty the bloud is impelled into all parts
of the Parenchyma, and therein separated from
the Bilious impurities, only by reason of the
Diversity of Pores in the same Parenchyma,
according to a <hi>MECHANICAL</hi> way or
method. Which was the difficulty that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

as that of the Serum through the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Kidneys, that of the Bile into the

of the Phlegma into the Guts. <hi>Another</hi> is,
from the <hi>Rarefaction of the Excrements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi>
as when the Serum, flowing together
with the blood in the arteries, is rarefied by
heat, and breaks forth into the habit of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

watery part of the blood is by way of Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
transmitted through the coats of the

And a third sort of Excretion is made,

more than Nature hath made.</p>
               <p>For the solution of this Difficulty, therefore,
we <hi>Answer;</hi> that those Motions and Actions,
which Physicians call <hi>Natural</hi> (because they
are not instituted by the Will; but done even

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60811:69"/>
retarded, or suppressed, <hi>ex Arbitrio nostro,</hi>
at our pleasure: and so have no dependence
upon the Brain, that is the Common instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the senses) these motions and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we say, are not yet made without some
<hi>sense,</hi> naturally inhaerent in the parts moved.
For instance; we are certain, that in palpitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
tremblings, syncopes, swooning fits, and
other Cardiacal symptoms or affections, the
<hi>Heart</hi> doth variously move, and agitate it self;
as being offended with something preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and noxious to it, and irritated to resist and
repell the same: and this in respect only of
some sense or feeling, by which it discerneth
what is incommodious and harmfull. The
<hi>stomach</hi> and <hi>Guts,</hi> in like manner, being oppress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and provoked by vicious humors, instantly
rise in armes, and raise impetuous vomitings,
nauseousness, convulsions, fluxes of the belly,
and the like motions, for the expulsion of their
enemies: and as we have it not in our power,
to excite or suppress those commotions; so
have we no particular cognisance of any such
sense, which should extimulate those parts to
begin and continue them. Truly, we cannot
but wonder, as oft as we observe the effects of
Antimony infused in wine, and taken into the
stomach. It is not our Tast, that doth distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
the tincture of the Antimony, from the
wine; nor are we sensible of any disagreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
therein to our nature, while we are swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
it down: and yet in the stomack there
is a certain sense, that discerns the offensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60811:69"/>
of that draught, and quickly engageth
the stomach to raise and contract it self, and
to eject it again by vomiting; nor will it ever
cease, till it be wholly discharged. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
how even the <hi>Flesh</hi> it self doth presently
distinguish a poysonous puncture, from a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
one; and how soon it contracteth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denseth
and fortifieth it selfe, to expell the
venome, whereupon ensue swelling, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and great pain in the part pricked,
as is observed in the stinging of Bees, and
Hornets, and Scorpions, and the biting of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Vipers, and other venenate Animals;
and all this meerly from some sense, which
teacheth the flesh that difference, and excites
it to make resistence. Consider further, how
the Contorsion, Falling downe, Ascent, suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and other violent Agitations of the
<hi>Womb</hi> in women; proceed not from the brain,
or Common sense, but from a <hi>Natural sense</hi>
inhaerent in that part, without which it could
not be provoked to those impetuous strivings
and motions. For, whatever is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of fense, is wholly uncapable also of
being irritated to performe any action or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in order to its safety. Nor can we, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
otherwise discern what is Animate and
sentient, from what is Inanimate and void of
sense; but only by some <hi>Motion</hi> excited in it,
by something molesting and irritating it: which
Motion doth continually both follow and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
sense.</p>
               <p>To evince this <hi>Natural</hi> sense yet further, we
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60811:70"/>
shall thus reason. We find in our selves, that
we have Five External Senses, by which we
perceive objects without us; but, because we do
not perceive our perception, by the same sense,
by which we perceive objects (for, we see with
our eyes, but do not by them perceive that we
see; but by the mediation of another internal
sense, or sensitive organ, the Brain, by which
we judge of all objects offered to the External
senses): therefore is it manifest, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sensory is the Brain, which together with
all its Nerves, and external organs annexed to
those nerves, ought to be held the adequate
Instrument of sensation. And we may fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
it to a sensitive Root, which shooteth
forth many Fibers or strings, whereof one
doth see, another hear, a third tast, a fourth
smell and the fifth feel.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, As Experience assureth us,
that there are some Motions and Actions in
us, whose regiment or moderation is no ways
dependent upon the Brain; and therefore, by
contradistinction to voluntary or Animal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and actions, they are named <hi>Natural:</hi>
So also doth Reason teach us, that we have a
certain sense of <hi>Feeling,</hi> which is not referrible
to the Common sense, nor communicated to
the Brain, and of which we take no cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
but by the various effects and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that it causeth in our bodyes. For, in this
Sense, we do not perceive that we feel; but as
it fares with men distracted, or otherwise agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
with any violent passion of the Mind,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60811:70"/>
who neither feel pain, nor take notice of objects
offered to their senses: so is it with us in this
Sense, which operating without our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
is therefore to be distinguished from the
Animal sense, and may be properly enough
called a <hi>Sensation without Sense.</hi> And certainly
such as this, is that sense observed in <hi>Zoophy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or Plant-Animals; as the sensitive Plant, the
Boramets or Vegetable Lamb of Tartary,
Sponges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We know, there are many Animals, that
have both sense and motion; and yet have no

                  </gap>sense, as Earthworms, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillers,
Silkworms, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> and that there are
some Natural Actions in us, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
without the influence or help of the
brain. As Physitians, therefore, teach us to
distinguish such actions Natural, from actions
Animal: why may not we, with equall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
distinguish the <hi>Feeling Natural,</hi> from the
<hi>Feeling Animal;</hi> so as to refer one to the brain
the other not.</p>
               <p>We know moreover, that it is one thing
for a <hi>Muscle</hi> to be moved or contracted <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneously</hi>
(as in Convulsion); and another, for it
to be moved <hi>Voluntarily,</hi> or with various regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
contractions and relaxations, in order to
the performance of some action intended, as
Progression, or Apprehension. The Muscles,
certainly, or Motory-Organs, are, in cramps
and convulsions, moved spontaneously, upon
their irritation by some acrimonious vapours,
or other injurious cause; no otherwise than
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60811:71"/>
the body of a Fowl is moved, after the head is
cut off. For as the body is tumbled up and
down, and agitated by various convulsive
motions of the feet and wings, yet such as are
wholly confused and irregular, and of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
either to progression or to apprehension,
because the power and influence of the brain
is extinguished; by the government and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
whereof, those motions were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
regulated either to progression, or fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
so in Convulsions, our Muscles are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
and our members variously agitated
with irregular and ineffectuall motions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those motions depend upon a natural
sense only, without the regulating influence
of the Brain, which taketh no cognizance of
the injuries done to the Muscles, nor of the
sense which irritateth them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These things duly considered, Reason ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth
us, henceforth to lay aside that opinion
of</hi> Des Cartes, <hi>and his disciple,</hi> Regius, <hi>(both great
Philosophers, and in many other things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be followed) that the influx</hi> of Animal
spirits by the nerves, is necessary to the performance
of all Naturall Motions and actions done in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
<hi>and to take up this more probable one of</hi>
Dr. Harvey, <hi>that</hi> each Natural action is effected
by the part doing it, meerly in respect of a certain
sense, whereby it feeleth what is troublesome and
injurious to it selfe, and so is irritated to excite
such motions of it self, as may conduce to its vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
and this, without any influx or regiment of
the Brain, or Common sense, at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60811:71"/>
We might have added further, out of the
same <hi>Dr. HARVET</hi> that all Motions in the
body, are derivative from the <hi>Vitall Influence of
the Heart,</hi> and wholly dependent thereupon;
because, no part is longer capable of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
sense, than while it is irradiated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened
by the Vitall Spirits or blood flowing
from the heart; for no part once mortified, <hi>i.e.</hi>
no longer participant of the Vitall influence,
can have any sense, or be irritated to motion.
Besides, it is not unreasonable to conceive, that
the strength or <hi>Tone</hi> of each part doth mostly
consist in its enjoying a due proportion of
Vitality: and if that Tone or firmeness be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
or diminished (as soon it must, if depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of that requisite influx), that part becomes
languid, dull, and hardly capable of irritation
But this noble speculation requires to be
handled with more exactness, than the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
limits of a short Digression will admit
of: and we have already said more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to assert, that all parts of the body have
a certain Naturall sense of Feeling, distinct
from the Animal, and wholly independent
upon the Brain; which was the Probleme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. ¶.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation, to the precedent.</note>
betwixt which and the <hi>Pulsation</hi> is a manifest
affinity. For, these two Actions or Motions,
as they are inservient to the conservation of
the Lamp of Life, and the Generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Spirits; so do they both consist of a Dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Contraction; the one of a Diastole
and Systole of the Heart and Arteries, the
other of a Diastole and Systole of the Breast
and Lungs.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Affinity,</hi> hath given occasion to
many Physicians to conceive the Diastole and
Systole of the Lungs, to be Synchronical or
coincident with the Diastole and Systole of the
Heart; and to refer both their motions to the
same cause and Original. But, They have
grossly erred, in confounding things so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
different. For</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>(1) There are many sorts of Animals, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60811:72"/>
have Hearts,<note place="margin">The Disparity betwixt <hi>Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;</hi> both as to their <hi>Times</hi> or periods, and as to their <hi>Vses.</hi>
               </note> but no Lungs. (2) The Dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Contractions of the Heart, are clearly
distinct from those of the Breast and Lungs; as
is evident from hence, that they are not syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronical,
<hi>i. e.</hi> made and terminated in the
same periods and times; one complete Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
taking up more time, then 4 or 5 Pulses:
and this in all Animals that have both Heart
and Lungs.</p>
            <p>(3) The Motion of the Heart and Arteries
is much different from that of the Lungs, as to
their Uses.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> if the Pulse and Respiration have
one and the same Final cause, and that (as
these men have assumed) the Arteries take in
the ambient aer through the skin, at every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astole;
and exclude it again the same way, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Fuliginous Exhalations of the
blood, in every systole; and that in the space of
time intermediate betwixt each Diastole and
Systole, they contain both the inspired aer, and
exhalations: then must we renounce both the
doctrine of our Master <hi>Galen,</hi> that in the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
nothing is contained, but the blood; and
our owne experience, that confirms it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> if the Arteries were (as the Lungs
are) filled with aer drawn in by their extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and that the quantity of aer attracted,
were proportionate to the magnitude of each
pulse, or to the greater or lesser dilatation of
the arteries: then, if, while the pulse is great,
the whole body were immerged into a bath of
water or oyle, it would necessarily follow, that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60811:73"/>
the Pulse would become much smaller, or
much slower; because it is highly difficult, if
not wholly impossible, that the ambient aer
should pass through the bath, into the pores of
the skin, and so into the arteries.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, since all the Arteries, as well those
that lye deep in the body, as those terminated
in the skin, are moved with equal velocity,
and at the same time; it is not possible, the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient
aer should as freely and swiftly pass
through the habit of the body, into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest
arteries, as into those contiguous to
the skin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it is not credible, that Whales, Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins,
and other Cetaceous Animals, that have
Respiration, can draw aer into their arteries,
at every diastole, through so vasta mass of
waters, as is from the bottom to the top of
the sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> if in their systole, the Arteries ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the fuliginous exhalations of the blood,
through the pores of the skin; why should
they not expell also the vital spirits, that are
far more subtile and fugitive, than those sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Exhalations can be? Nature certainly
hath made no such Colatory, as should retain
the thinner spirits, and let the grosser fumes
pass through. Nor is it yet sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that there are any such Fuliginous Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
generated in the heart and arteries, and
afterward excluded partly by the Lungs, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Arteries, in their Contractions; as
are vulgarly believed. For, the blood suffereth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60811:73"/>
only a simple agitation, or conquassation in the
ventricles of the heart, and a propulsion in the
arteries: and that it can produce such an aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of sooty fumes from the blood, as Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
have talked of; is not easie to conceive.
Truth is, the blood, by reason of its heat and
swift motion, doth emit some Halitus, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
(which streaming through the coats of
the smaller arteries, are received and conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into a thin limpid liquor by the Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts)
but is it therefore necessary, that it
should emit Fuliginous exhalations? We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
also, that there is a certain thin Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the blood and humors, which passeth
through the habit of the body; but, that it
should be discharged in thick clouds of exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
in every systole of the arteries, this is
plainly impossible: because at that time the
coats of the arteries are constringed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
and there might be an easier egress for
them, in the Diastoles, when the cavities of
the arteries are dilated. So that among these
many Arguments, there is not one, but doth
clearly detect, and throughly refute the Error
of those Men, who have confounded the Uses
of the Arteries, and Lungs, of Pulsation and
Respiration.</p>
            <p>This capital Error eschewed, we may the
more safely progress to explicate the nature of
Respiration, as a thing in sundry particulars
distinct from Pulsation, though perchance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by Nature, as in some sort subservient
to the vital Faculty. And, that we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60811:74"/>
methodically, it is requisite we consider
(1) the <hi>Manner</hi> of Respiration; (2) the <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the</hi> Inspiration, <hi>the grand
Question is,</hi> Whether the Breast and Lungs are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
because they are filled and distended with the

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> To solve this difficulty, in a word, we say,

with aer, and that Dilatation or heaving up
of the brest is the cause of the airs rushing in at
the mouth and nostrills, down the <hi>Aspera Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria,</hi>
or wind-pipe, into the Lungs. For, since
there is no vacuity (at least no Coacervate one)
in the world, no body can be moved out of its
place, but the next body must give way, and
the next to that likewise give back, till such a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60811:74"/>
part of space as is adequate to the dimensions
of the body first moved, be made to receive it,
and the space which it abandoned, be again
fully possessed by another body succeeding
into it: we say, since this is necessary, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that the aer next incumbent on, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
unto, the Breast and Abdomen being
urged and impelled by the breast, while that
is dilated or expanded, is forced to give back,
and press the aer next to it, which likewise
drives back the next aer, untill at length the
compressed aer wanting room to retreat into,
and endeavouring to avoid further compressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(its own Elater ingaging it thereto) rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into the breast and there possesseth that
room or part of space, which was left by the
breast, when it began its motion. So that so
much aer is impelled into the breast, as is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of its place by the superfice or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the breast, during its expansion or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Attraction</hi> of Aer into the Lungs,

               <p>And if there were any Cause to be found,
that might blow the aer into the breast, as it
is blown into a bladder, so as to distend it; or
at least, if the aer could be conceived to enter
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60811:75"/>
into the breast spontaneously, or of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
without impulsion, so as to force, or heave
up the same: then indeed, would the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
betwixt the dilatation of the breast, and
that of a Bladder, by wind blown violently
into it, hold good, and we should not need to
seek further. But, there being no such insuffla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
cause assignable; and it being ridiculous
to imagine the aer should spontaneously
move it self, so as to flow uncompelled into
the cavity of the Chest (as is manifest not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in dead men, into whose breasts, though
their mouths and nostrils are wide open, the
aer doth not croud it self: but also in living
men, when they at their pleasure keep their
breasts compressed, or hold their breath, as the
vulgar phrase is), it seemes much more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to explain the reason of Inspiration, by
that other similitude of the flux of aer into a
pair of Bellows; there being no other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the repletion of the Chest, and
the repletion of a pair of Bellows, with aer, but
only this; that the Bellowes are opened by an

which is the naturall motion of Restitution
For, the Dilatation being an action, whereby
the parts of the Chest are distended into a
position more large, than is natural to them;
the Contraction seemes to be nothing else, but
a certain falling down or relaxation of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60811:75"/>
parts distended, whereby they spontaneously
return to their natural position, and such as
they hold in a dead body; and this not onely

which in dead bodyes is not extended down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

them; but the reason which detaine us
from assenting thereto, is, that after the chest

were impossible, if they derived their motion
from the chest.</p>
               <p>Now it being evinced, that the Lungs are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
not moved either by themselves,<note place="margin">But from the <hi>Diaphragme</hi> moved by a congenite Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</note> or by the
Heart, or by the Thorax<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it remains, that they
must be moved by some other part in the
Breast, in which as in the first origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
the motion of Inspiraiton doth begin:
and this part seems to be no other, but the
<hi>Diaphragme;</hi> and that for these reasons. (1) In
wounds, or perforations of the breast, the Lungs
instantly falling together, as it were close
themselves (for some short space) while the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphragme
is still elevated and depressed alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
contracting and againe relaxing the
ends of the spuricus ribbs, and cartilages to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60811:77"/>
which it is annexed: whence it comes, that
the aer rusheth violently into the cavity of the
chest, and upon the elevation of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme,
is driven out again, through the
wounds with impetuosity sufficient to blow
out a candle. (2) Every man, in Inspiration,
feels the Thorax to be dilated, and the whole
Abdomen lifted up, and the ends of the lower
ribs to be drawn inward: the Diaphragme
being extended downward, with its middle
part crowding down the stomack, liver and
guts, and with its circumference or extream
parts contracting the ribs.</p>
               <p>(3) Allowing the Diaphragme to be the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
Movens,</hi> among all parts inservient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
we may easily understand, why the
Respiration becomes more frequent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
when the stomach is full, and when the
Aer is made more dense, than ordinary, by
fogs and thick exhalations. For, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
case, the Diaphragme hath not room e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to expand it self downward, as it ought,
and so is compelled to compensate the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of its motion, by the frequency of it; and in
the latter, the Lungs are so prepossessed with
gross vapours; as that they cannot admit much
aer at a time; and therefore the Diaphragme
is necessitated to repeat its motions so much
the oftner. (4) In Apoplexies (unless they
be fatal) though the Respiration be almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible,
yet the motion of the Diaphragme is
continued; as may be peroeived by the gentle
motion of the Chest. (5) Respiration is more
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60811:77"/>
perturbed and vitiated, by diseases of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme,
than by those of any other part of
the breast: and it hath been observed by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slingius</hi>
that a <hi>steatoma</hi> grown upon even the
carneous part of it, caused extreme difficulty
of breathing. Now, these are the Reasons that
have induced us to believe, that the <hi>Motion of
Respiration begins in the Diaphragme;</hi> which

use of Respiration, is for the <hi>Refrigeration
of the Heart.</hi> Which though very ancient and
plausible, is rather meerly Conjectural, than
Areopagitical or demonstrative. For (1) AS
aer over-hot is injurious to the heart, so is aer
over-cold: and as aer moderately cold is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to the heart, when it is excessively hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
so is aer moderately hot, beneficial, when
the heart is too much cooled. But, while the
heart is in good temper, then the aer most
agreeable to it, is neither hot, nor cold, but
temperate. (2) It is inconsistent with the
prudence of Nature, to make the natural heat
of the heart so intense and excessive, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
perpetual ventilation with cold aer:
when it had been much easier for Her, to have
kindled a more gentle fire there in at first, than
to bring cold aer to the hearth with so much
adoe, to keep it in moderation ever after. And,
in case that-Fire should chance, at any time, to
grow less, or languish (as it often doth, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
cold aer, many men being frozen to
death in <hi>Green-land, Russia,</hi> and other Northern
Countries) what provision hath Nature made
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60811:78"/>
for the reaccension or instauration of it? (3)
If it be only the Cold of the aer, that is benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the heart; then, certainly, the Water,
(which is much colder than the aer) would
more conveniently satisfie that necessity in
Fishes, which yet cannot live without aer. (4)
In persons of cold and Leuco-phlegmatique
constitutions, there would be no need at all of
Respiration; especially in frosty weather, when
the heart hath as much want of warmth, as of
cold, and more too. We confess, indeed, that
at such times, our Respiration is more slow
and rare, and in the heat of Summer, more
quick and frequent; as it is also in Fevers: but
the reason hereof is, that in Summer, the blood
being made hotter, is sooner subtiliated into
spirits, and those spirits faster consumed and
dissipated; and so requires more aer to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the subtiliation and inflammability of its
spiritual parts. So that it should seem, the
Aer is required rather as an Excitement, than
as an hindrance to the vital Flame. We say,
for the Excitation, or Accension of the Flame
of life, by subtiliating the blood, and making
the inflammable parts thereof more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fewell for the same vitall Flame, and for
the matter of the spirits, which being diffused
through the whole body, serve to conserve and
vivifie all the parts; no otherwise than Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
conduce to the accension of flame in
wood.</p>
               <p>For, as the Aer blown out of a Bellowes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
doth promote the accension of fire,<note place="margin">The same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified by the accension of flame in wood, by aer blown out of Bellowes.</note> in wood,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60811:79"/>
or other combustible matter; not by reason of
any Cold (for Contraries never generate each
other) but by the subtility of its particles, and
the vehemence of its motion, in respect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it both dissipates the ashes, that hinder the
ingress of the fire, and impells the particles of
the fire into the pores of the wood; so as that
they penetrating more deeply into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thereof, invade and kindle all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable
particles therein contained: so doth
the Aer brought into the Lungs, and commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self with the blood circulating through
them, insinuate it self, by the Arteria Venosa,
into the left ventricle of the heart; and there
partly by its subtility, partly by its expansive
motion, so conspire with the pulse of the heart,
as to conduce to the rarefaction and subtiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the more thin and inflammable parts of
the blood, that so they may be made both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
fewell for the Fire burning in the
heart, and also fit matter of the vital spirits.
All the difference is, there are no Ashes made
in the heart, the Flame thereof being more
pure, than focal-fire, and subsisting in a matter
as fine and subtile, as spirits of wine. Nor are
there any sooty exhalations; such as arise from
oyle burned in a Lamp: but such a Flame is
perpetually revived out of the blood in the
heart, as is made by the purest spirits of wine
set on fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> This Use of the Aer inspired, may be in some
sort inferred from the very structure of the
Lungs.<note place="margin">And inferred from the structure of the Lungs.</note> For, to what purpose doth both the

                  <hi>Vena arteriosa,</hi> and <hi>Arteria Venosa</hi> divide and

be to convey the aer brought into them (out
of the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> or pipes derived from the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera

of these vessells, that the Aer doth not
arrive at and enter the heart, pure and sincere
(as it ought to do, in case it were to refrigerate
the heart) but mixed with the blood returning
out of the Lungs: which is the reason, why
in the dissections of living creatures, no aer is
to be found in the Arteria venosa, being, before
it comes thither, throughly commixed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
with the blood. Nor can we force aer
into the heart, through the Lungs of a dead

ceased. And this we conceive to be the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

to the reasons by us formerly alleaged to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
the Generation of them, we shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
two or three convincing ones, to disprove
their Exclusion through the Lungs. (1) The
motion of the blood out of the Lungs, by the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60811:80"/>
Arteria Venosa, into the left ventricle of the
Heart, being continual and strong; doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
forbid any thing to come from the
Heart, into the Lungs that way: and (2) the
situation of the Valves in the same Arteria
Venosa, doth as much. (3) That the Aer pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to the Heart, and the (supposed) Fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
exhalations issuing from the Heart,
should be carried through one and the same
vessel, by contrary motions; is insolent to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and incompetent to the oeconomy of the
body.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> And here we aske leave to propose a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem.</hi>
Certain it is,<note place="margin">A <hi>Probleme,</hi> of the Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> in the Mother's womb.</note> that the <hi>Foetus,</hi> while in
the Mother's womb, doth receive nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(not by the Umbilical Vessels, for in them
nothing is contained, but Blood, which is not
the Aliment of the parts; and the Umbilical
Vein serveth onely to the Circulation of the
blood, by bringing back to the heart, what the
two Umbilical Arteries carried from it into

this being so, doth it not seem necessary, that
the <hi>Foetus should also have the use of Respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
For, since all <hi>Suction</hi> is by <hi>Impul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we have elsewhere at large demonstrated)

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60811:80"/>
without the help of aer, the <hi>Foetus</hi> cannot
possibly suck in his nourishment. To this
Reason (and we think it a weighty one) may
be added, (1) the Authority of the <hi>Divine old

(2) that Chickens breathe in their shells
(through which the aer hath a more difficult
passage, than through the secundines) and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes

within the shell not yet broken; so hath it been
observed and recorded by sundry learned and
authentical Writers, that Infants have been
heard to cry in their Mothers wombs: which
were impossible, unlesse they enjoyed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Respiration.</p>
               <p>(3) The posture of the Child in the womb
seems to assert the same. For, as there is an
ample space betwixt the coats of the Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines,
and the Child, to the end that a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
magazine of milk for his sustenance, might
be stored up, and conserved therein; so is not
that whole space filled up with that Liquor,
but in the upper part there remains so much
space unpossessed by any thing but Aer, as is
sufficient for so gentle a Respiration, as the
Infant hath need of: just as in the blunter end
of an Egge, we perceive a certain empty space
after the Hen hath sate upon it. And lest
the <hi>Chorion</hi> should at any time be corrugated
or shrieveled up together, and so streighten
or compresse either the Liquor, or the Infant;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60811:81"/>
Nature hath affixed the same to the <hi>Placentae

hang fast, as an Apple hangs by its stem, or as
our Globes of Glass are hung up by strings to
the Seeling of a room. So that the <hi>Chorion</hi> thus
adhaering to the <hi>Placenta Vterina,</hi> which is fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the bottome of the womb, and the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios</hi>

in the same upper part; and the lower part of
each membrane being depressed by the weight
of the Infant, and of the Humors contained in
them: it thence comes to pass, that this Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Machine both of the Child, and Membranes
(though at first it were perfectly round, as the
yolk of an Egge) is afterward made of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
figure. For, though the <hi>Foetus,</hi> sitting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curved
or bowed forward, as much as possible
doth keep himself in a round figure, because
of taking up the lesse room (for he sits with his
leggs crossed, his heels drawn up to his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks,
his elbowes resting on his knees, one
hand held up close to his ear, the other to his
cheek, for the more firme and easie sustenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his head) yet, in that situation he hath
need of a Mansion of an <hi>Oval Figure,</hi> that
swimming in liquor, he might keep his head
above water, and at his pleasure take in his
nourishment by his mouth, and also inspire
the temperate aer surrounding his head, in the
void space of the Secundines; according to the
opinion of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> newly recited. (4) Nor
is the ingress of Aer into the womb impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60811:81"/>
For, albeit the mouth of the womb, in
pregnant women, be shut up, so as to exclude
ones finger, or (as others will have it) a small
probe: yet is it not so sealed or luted up, as
to exclude the Aer; as may be inferred from

then, doubtless, <hi>Hâc etiam penetret per cuncta

though it seems a Paradox, yet is it no
light and vain Conjecture, that the Foetus
doth respire in the womb, at least gently and
placidly, and in proportion to the pulsation
of his heart; which being calmly and softly
moved (as are the hearts of Dormice and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animals, that sleep all the winter) hath
but a small necessity of Aer. However, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting

it to the consideration of wiser heads.</p>
               <p>Here also we may opportunely touch upon
the <hi>Motion of the Brain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Motion of the <hi>Brain</hi> dependent, not upon Respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but upon the <hi>Pulsation of the Artsries.</hi>

many have referred to the Inspiration and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
of Aer; as if the Brain were dilated

for the exclusion of it. Whereas, indeed, this
Motion doth not belong (1) to the <hi>substance of
the Brain;</hi> for, that being very soft, tender, and
delicate, seems uncapable of any such dilatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and compression. Nor (2) to the <hi>Membranes</hi>
investing the braine; because, as <hi>Riolan</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the head of a Sheep, the diastole and
systole of the brain hath been continued long,
after part of the skull and Membrans also were
cut off. But only to the <hi>Arteries,</hi> (1) because
the Motion of the brain is exactly coincident
and concordant with that of the Arteries, as
may be discerned by the touch, in the heads
of Infants new born, and in large wounds of
the skull. (2) Because the chief Pulsation is
in the upper part of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which is
conspersed with store of Arteries ascending
from the <hi>Plexus Arteriosus Mirabilis,</hi> and disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
themselves upon it. (3) Because <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi>
observed, that in some persons, who fell
into extrem agonies, and swooning fits, upon
great fractures of the skull, the motion of the
brain ceased, and was begun again, as their
Pulses recovered. (4) Of what <hi>Use</hi> should the
inspired Aer be to the Brain? For <hi>Refrigeration,</hi>
It cannot be; the temper of the brain being
such, as seems to require rather Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>efaction.
And, as for the <hi>Generation of Animal spirits;
Dr. Harvey</hi> hath upon good reasons made it
doubtfull, whether there be any such or not:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60811:82"/>
and if there be, certainly they consist only of
the purest and most subtile parts of the blood,

            <p>Their <hi>Insertion</hi> likevvise is tvvofold.<note place="margin">Insertion.</note> For,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
those in the Abdomen are all terminated in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60811:85"/>
the grand Receptacle of the Chyle, into which
as into a cistern, they infuse that thin liquor,
which they carry in their pipes; that so the
same being there commixed with the Chyle,
may be conveyed along with it, through the
<hi>Lacteae Thoracicae,</hi> into the <hi>subclavian vein.</hi> And
those above the <hi>Diaphragme,</hi> or such as arise
from the Limbs, are inserted into the <hi>External
jugular</hi> Veins, into which they disembogue
their several rivulets. Wherefore they have
no common Trunck, but (like several Springs
of water) rising up here and there from divers
parts, they all tend into two large channels,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Receptacle of the Chyle, and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Axillaris,</hi> that their streams may all meet
in the common Ocean of the Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> As for their <hi>Situation</hi> and <hi>Progress,</hi> it is thus.
In the Armes,<note place="margin">Situation and Progress.</note> they creep up by the side of the
<hi>Vena Brachialis,</hi> to which they are firmely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected,
and so ascend together with it to the
<hi>Vena Axillaris,</hi> into which they open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with a small inlet, or Orifice, that is
guarded with a valve, set there by Nature, to
prevent the reflux of the liquor out of the Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illary
vein. And, from the <hi>Thighs,</hi> many in
like manner climb up in the company of the
Crural and Iliacal veins, which they encircle
in some places more closely, in others more
laxely; and in this manner they mount up to
the Mesentery, where together with the small
branches of the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> they are termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.
Again, those issuing from the <hi>Liver,</hi>
or <hi>Bladder of the Gall,</hi> do also descend in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60811:85"/>
of the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> to the middle Glandule
of the Mesentery, and are therein terminated.
But, if with a more curious eye you trace
these proceeding from the Liver, up to their
very original; you may perceive them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Capsula Communis,</hi> of the <hi>Vena Portae;</hi> and
therein so to lose themselves, as that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern their progress from thence: yet it
is probable, that being included in the same
<hi>Capsula Communis,</hi> they follow the distribution
of the same, and never stray from it into the
<hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Liver; because, if they did,
how comes it, that they are no where to be
found in the parenchyma, no not in that part
of it, where the <hi>Capsula Communis</hi> is?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning the</hi> Liquor <hi>they contain, there
are two Difficulties,</hi> viz. (1) Whence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it? (2) Why they return it into the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
of the Chyle, and into the Heart?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Former</hi> is solved, by saying, that the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
is derived partly from the Arteries,<note place="margin">Liquor dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced partly from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and</note> partly
from the Nerves.</hi> That the <hi>Arteries</hi> have
some share in bringing that mild and thin Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
into the Lympheducts, may be argued
thus. The blood, being by the Vital Heat and
Motion, agitated in the Arteries, doth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
diffuse abundance of Vapours into those
parts, into which it is immitted; and this so
much the more, because those vapours are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
and kept in, by the thicknesse of the
coats of the greater Arteries, untill they are
driven into the smaller arteries, through
whose thinner coats they more easily trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60811:86"/>
And these vapours thus dispersed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re
for the most part retained and re-collected by
the Fibrous and Membranous parts, and by
that means condensed into a Liquor, which
makes one part of that Humor which the
Lympheducts carry away. For, we are not to
conceive, that that Liquor was preexistent in
the Arteries, under the same form it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
obtains in the Lympheducts; and that
being protruded together with the blood out
of the Arteries into the substance of the parts,
it is in those parts separated from the blood,
by any kind of Percolation, as the Urine is in
the Kidneys: because there are in all parts
Veins answering to the Arteries, and those
ample enough to export whatever liquor is
by them imported: nor can any reason be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
why that watery humor should be at all
separated from the blood; seeing it is no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
of the blood, though it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
an Excrement of the parts, from
which immediately it is immitted into the
Lympheducts. No Excrement of the blood,
because it is again brought into the blood; and
Nature useth not to lose her labour, or to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
things each from other, on purpose to
mixe them again afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the <hi>Nerves</hi> also contribute
some part of this Liquor to the Lympheducts,<note place="margin">Partly from the Nerves.</note>
may be inferred from hence; (1) that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Liquor ariseth from vapours condensed,
is perfectly pure, thin, and transparent: but
this liquor is not so, and therefore it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60811:86"/>
some other Humor should be admixt to
it, which gives it a greater thickness, than a
simple dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lled water usually hath. For, this
whole liquor is more dense, and less diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
and sometimes white like milk, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
tincted with yellow, and sometimes
with blood, like water wherein raw Flesh
hath been washed. (2) It is an opinion high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreeable vvith Reason, that the thicker
part of the Liquor found in these Water-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits,
is the Vehicle of the <hi>Succus Nutritius,</hi>
vvhich being dispensed from the brain and
spinal Marrovv, to all parts for their nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the Nerves, is assimilated into their
substance, leaving its thinner part (vvhich
before served to promote and facilitate its
distribution through the slender passages of
the Nerves) to be infused into the Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,
vvhich return it into the blood, for a
<hi>double use,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>First, to prevent the <hi>Coagulation</hi> of the blood,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
to vvhich othervvise it vvould be strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.<note place="margin">Uses of that Liquor.</note>
Secondly, to promote the <hi>Mication</hi> of
the blood; for this thin liquor, being formerly
advanced to the state of Volatility, or exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
it easily united to the Vital blood, and
doth as easily advance the mication of it.</p>
            <p>But, vvhat vve here say, of the derivation
of one part of this Liquor from the Nerves,
vvill be more illustrated by vvhat follovvs,
concerning the dispensation of the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

a certain milder and sweeter juice, conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
to that spermatical Matter, of which
those parts are first made up: Lest therefore,
we should defraud your curiosity of such fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

(yet most reasonable) opinion requires; we
must no longer omit to explain (at least accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what light the excellent <hi>Dr. Glisson</hi>
hath given, in so obscure an Argument) <hi>From
whence, and by what vessells, the Nutritive juice is
distributed to all parts of the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Thesis</hi> is, that the proper and adequate
Nutriment of the Parts, is derived to them
from the Brain and Spinal Marrow, by the
Nervs: and the <hi>Reasons</hi> asserting it, are
these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:60811:87"/>
(1) In the <hi>Palsy,</hi> it is observed,<note place="margin">from the Atrophy, or decay of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition in parts affected with the Palsy, and whose Nervs have been wounded.</note> that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
parts resolved do at first appear somewhat tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
or swolne, by reason of the laxity of their
Fibres, and the easie afflux of blood unto them.
And yet it is manifest, that swelling doth not
arise from the true and genuine Nourishment
of those parts; because afterward they by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little pine away, to extream leanness,
notwithstanding the blood floweth as freely
and plentifully to them then, as before. A
pregnant argument, that the vessells, by which
they ought to be supplied with nourishment,
are obstructed; which vessels, certainly, can be
no other but the Nervs, because both Arteries
and veins are wholly exempt from any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
in this Disease; and the Nervs alone
fail of performing their office, as they ought.</p>
            <p>This may be confirmed by an observation
of our owne. A certain woman having a Nerv
pricked by an unskilfull Chirurgeon, as he
was letting her blood in the right arme, was at
first surprised with Convulsions of that Arme;
and those ceasing, there ensued so great an
Atrophy of that member, as nothing now (for
the woman is yet living) remains of it but
skin and bones: which extream extenuation,
doubtless,
is to be referred to the want of pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age

to be very beneficial to the sick; and that, not
only because they stop the defluxion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
from the head upon the Lungs: but also
(and chiefly) because they warme and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
the Brain and Nervs, and so promote
the Nutrition of the Parts. Which effect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expected from their Heat and Driness,
but from some comfortable influence trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Nervs, by which they are

they carry nothing but blood; why may

and Acrimony, to be the material Principle of
such Tumors: besides, we have the testimony
of our sense, that the rudiments of such Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
are like Eggs included in a membranous
filme, which contains a humor resembling
the white of an Egg, but nothing like blood.
Moreover, these Tumors frequently tend to
some kind of Formation, though but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
one; producing sometimes a mass or
lump of Flesh, sometimes a Worme, or other
(such Monster; which is a strong Argument,
that their primitive Matter is not blood, but
a certain juyce much milder and sweeter, and
brought to the parts in which they are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by the Nervs.</p>
            <p>(6) This Opinion is further confirmed by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
the Matter of the Seed, and the Manner of its
preparation in the Testicles.<note place="margin">From the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> in the Testicles.</note> For, the Seed
seems to be generated, not of the blood (as
hath been vulgarly believed) but of a matter
much sweeter and more generous, brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Seminary vessells, from the brain, by
the Nervs: forasmuch as the Nervs are both
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60811:89"/>
more copiously and more deeply disseminated
into the parenchyma of the Testicles, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Arteries, or the veins; which is the
reason, why their inward substance is white,
not red. Again, their proper Coat appears to
be nothing else, but a certain expansion of the
Nervs inserted into them; from which Coat
many small Nervs are on all parts derived to
the middle of the Testicles, where meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they make the long Nervous vessell,
that manifestly exonerateth it self into the
Chanel of the Epididymis, as may be plainly
seen in the stones of a Horse, Bull, Boar, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
large Animal. As for the veins of the
Testicles, they serve only to export the blood
imported by the Arteries: and the Arteries
themselves, though they variously diffuse
themselves round about the Testicles; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
the Nervs, tend in divers places
from the inward coat, to the <hi>Ductus Seminalis</hi>
(situate in the very middle of the Testicle)
and are connected thereunto; yet they rarely
disperse any branches, untill, reflecting from
that chanel, they have begun their progresse
back again toward the Circumference of the
Testicle. But, there they send out some sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to the outside of the Testicle; to the end
that, those capillary veins, opening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the substance of the Testicle, may
the more easily receive the blood effused out
of the Arteries, and so carry it off again. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
that blood, if left there, would soon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the parenchyma of the Testicles, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60811:89"/>
disturb the praeparation of the seed. Yet these
Arteries no where insinuate themselves into
the Nervous, or Seminal Chanel, or infuse the
least drop of blood into them: So that it is
more then probable; they serve rather for the
vivification of the Testicles, by bringing the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
blood and spirits into them, than for the
importation of the Seminal Matter. Now,
the Nervs implanted in the Testicles, cannot
be in order to their Motion, because they have
none that is voluntary; nor is there any need
of them, as to sensation: and therefore it is
more credible, that their Use is only to bring
in some certain Liquor, for the making of
seed. Furthermore, the Testicles are furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with many Lympheducts, which could be
of little Use unto them, unless there were some
other vessells present also, by which that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Liquor is brought in, whose thinner and
superfluous part those Lympheducts are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to export. Add to this, that the seed is a
liquor much more noble and Ambrosiack; than
the blood; as is evident even from hence, that
a small expence of seed doth more exhaust the
spirits, than the losse of twenty times so much
blood. Which doubtless, is the reason, why
Heaviness and dejection of spirit, do alwayes
ensue after the delights of Venus; and it hath
been observed, that in men excessively addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to women, the Brain it self is not only much
debilitated, but made also lax, thin, and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The Gout-likewise is generally an Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of immoderate venery; because the joynts
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60811:90"/>
and nervous parts being much debilitated, and
the roscid and Unctuous Liquor of the Nervs,
deprived of its milder and sweeter part, the
Succus Nutritius becomes too thin and sharp,
and so is more expeditely discharged upon the
joynts.</p>

very beneficial toward the uniting and

cannot proceed from the Arteries, whose office
is only to convey the blood (a liquor vastly
different from this Glew): and since besides
them, and the Nervs, there is no vessell yet
found out, that carries any humor from the
Center to the circumference of the body; it is
very reasonable to conceive, that this Glew is
derived from the Nervs.</p>
            <p>(8) The <hi>White</hi> of Eggs is brought into the

part, in respect it is wholly destitute of any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma,</hi>
which is absolutely necessary to the

Whereas the secretion of the <hi>Succus

no <hi>parenchyma,</hi> and may be effected in parts the
most bloodless. And that such a Secretion of
the <hi>Succus Nutritius</hi> is made in the womb, is
manifest from the great number of <hi>Lympheducts</hi>
returning from thence, which Nature had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

ordained in that place, unless it were to
export the thinner and superfluous part of the

seem to teach us, that the <hi>Succus Nutritius</hi> is
derived into the womb by the Nerves; and that
the watery part thereof being protruded into
the Lympheducts, the more unctuous and

from the less aptitude of some Nerves, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the nourishment, than of others. For, that
Disease seems to be seated originally and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
in the Spinal Marrow without the
skull, and in the Nerves thence propagated:
and therefore those Nerves must be more
weak, languid, and unfit to transmit the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Nutritius, than such as arise from the
Brain, or Marrow within the skull. And
hence is it, doubtless, that the Head, Face, and
<hi>Viscera</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> (all which derive their
Nerves from the Marrow within the skull)
grow excessively great: while the Armes and
Leggs become lean, flaccid, and enervate, as
being supplyed with nourishment by Nerves,
issuing from the Spinal Marrow without the
skull. Moreover, because it sometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
that some one particular branch of this or

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60811:91"/>
thence it comes, that one part of a Limb is
better supplyed with nourishment, than the

            </p>
            <p>(1) That in the Nerves no passages or cavities

            <p>(2) That in the dissection of Animals alive, and
the application of a ligature to any Nerve, no swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
can be observed to arise on either side the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature:
and upon cutting off a Nerve, very little or
none at all of this supposed Liquor can be discerned
to distill from either end; contrary to what happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in the binding and cutting off any other ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</p>
            <p>(3) No such Liquor hath yet been found in the
Nerves of bodies dissected.</p>
            <p>And yet these Difficulties are not weighty
enough to counterbalance the Reason for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60811:91"/>
by the experiment of lowing the Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
or any Nerve in water; that the Nerves
are made up of many small Fibrous, Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or threads coh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ering together, with a
soft medullary substance betwixt them: much
like the Indian Canes, which, though in the
cortex so hard and compact, as to yield fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
percussion with a Tobacco-pipe, and as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
within as many sorts of wood; being yet
composed of many small and long Filaments,
with small perforations betwixt them, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
from one end to the other, so as a man
may without much difficulty blow his spittle
quite through them. Likewise, in the leaves
of plants, there shoots up a certain small Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
rib, arising from the Foot-stalke, by which
they are fastned to the branch; and without
which nothing of nourishment can be brought
to them. This little rib running up in the
middle, sends forth various lesser surcles or
threads equally to all parts of the leaf, so as
the whole is thereby equally nourished. And
yet, if you cut off this rib, or any one branch of
it, you shall discover none the smallest cavity
or hollowness therein, nor any drop of juice
issuing out of it, unless in the Sowthistle, Esula,
Celendine, and some few other plants, which
emit either a milky, or a yellowish juice, which
certainly is their nourishment. And though
other plants yield not, upon cutting of their
leaves, the like juice; yet most certain it is, they
are nourished with some kind of juice or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
derived to them by their Foot-stalks: So
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60811:92"/>
that we can perceive no such absolute necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any manifest cavity in their small ribbs,
for the dispensation of their nourishing juice,
as this Objection seems to import; especially
when we consider, that the Motion of the
Succus Nutritius in those slender Filaments or
threads, is very gentle, slow, and insensible; not
rapid, or Violent, as the motion of the blood
in the Arteries and Veins of Animals. Now,
since our sense is witnesse, that liquor may be
transmitted through a Fire-cane though suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
solid and compact; and our Reason
assureth, that the Nutritive juice of Plants is
distributed to all parts of the leaves, through
the Foot-stalk, and little Rib running up in the
middle of each leafe, though we can discern
no manifest passages, or channels, through
which it flowes: Why may not the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Animals be, in like manner, dispensed
to the parts, through the Nerves, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they appear destitute of any conspicuous
hollowness? But yet some Nerves there are
not so impervious, but they admit a small
style or probe into them; in which number are
the Optique and Odoratory Nerves: and
though the rest have not the like visible hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowness,
yet reflecting upon this, that all the
Nerves are framed for the performance of
some one Common Office, it is not unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to conceive, that all of them are perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
more or less, so as to be capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
the <hi>Succus Nutritius.</hi> This may be in
good part inferred even from hence, that the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60811:92"/>
Apoplexy often ends in a Palsy; in which
case all Physicians grant, that the Humor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
and obstructing the Brain, is dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
thence upon the Spinal Marrow, and
Nerves affected; which could not be, unless
the Nerves were capable of being obstructed
by the Humor protruded or impelled into
them.</p>
            <p>You will reply, perhaps; <hi>that they are capable,
indeed, of the influx of Animal Spirits, unless their
originals chance to be obstructed, as in the case of
the Palsey: but, as for any Liquor, or Humor (of far
lesse subtility, than those Spirits) it is impossible
they should admit it into them.</hi> And we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
that the supposed Animal Spirits (nor,
intruth, the Vital ones) are any where to be
found in the whole body, pure or sincere, and
without mixture; and therefore, if the Nerves
were framed for the reception of any matter
pure and distinct from all others, certainly
that matter must be of a grosser substance,
than simple and abstracted Spirits.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, that there are small Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
in the Nerves, may be perceived by their
Compression in our limbs, as when we have
long fate upon a hard seat, or otherwise
streightned our sinews; for, in that case, we

come, either to apply a ligature unto, or to cut

            </p>
            <p>Under the <hi>First</hi> Classis of those Glandules,

receive from the Nervs, a certain humor more

the Succus Nutritius; and therefore the Nervs,
by the help of these Glandules discharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of it, and retain only the more sweet,

Humor, thus rejected by the Nervs, hath some

out of the body, as an absolute Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but imbibed by the Glandules adjacent
to the veins, and by them imported into the
veins. Which seems to be the most satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reason, that hath hitherto been given, why
such Glandules are placed, for the most part,
neer to the greater Divisions of the Nervs and
veins; <hi>viz.</hi> that they may the more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
receive the humor effused out of the
Nervs, and deliver it again into the veins.</p>
            <p>And to the <hi>Last</hi> (inservient to the Praepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the true Succus Nutritius) belong the
Glandules of the <hi>Mesentery,</hi> the 3 Glandules
of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and the <hi>Thymus,</hi> or single Glandule
in the Chest, neer the Ductus Lactcus Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racicus,
and in Brutes called the Sweet-bread.
For, (1) as to the <hi>Glandules of the Mesentery;</hi>
Anatome assureth us, that a great multitude
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60811:95"/>
of the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> tend unto them, and are in
them distributed into surcles extreamly small;
and that other small branches (or rather roots
of milky veins take their beginning in the same
Glandules, and progressing from thence, make
a second sort or race of <hi>venae lacteae,</hi> as we have
more particularly declared before, <hi>in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Art.
of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Exercit.</hi> Now, to what end hath Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
made these two kinds of Venae Lacteae,
one sort to import the Chyle into these Glands,
and the other to export it? unless it be, that
the Chyle should either suffer some Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or be separated from some Humor, in these
Glandules? Alteration it suffers none; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is carried off again in the same forme,
as it was brought in. And, therefore, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
probable, that it is brought into the
Glandules, only that it might be separated from
some parts less agreeable with the nature of
pure nourishment. Now, what should the
Humor be, that is thus to be separated? An
absolute Excrement it cannot be, because these
Glandules have no peculiar Excretory vessells,
as all parts inservient to any Excretion have.
Nor is it like that matter, which is reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the veins, by the Reductory Glandules: for,
if it were such, it would need no such separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all, the rest of the Chyle soon after
flowing into the subclavian vein, and it being
easie for Nature to have contrived, that the
chyle brought into these Glandules, might
have accompanied the rest in that journey,
without any intermediate Secretion. This
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60811:95"/>
considered, it is reasonable to conceive, that
the Liquor separated from the Chyle, in these
Glandules, doth not belong either to the First,
or Second sort of Matter (<hi>viz.</hi> the absolute
Excrement, and the Excrement Relative) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned; but is the true <hi>Succus Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
Which being granted, it is not difficult
to explore, by what vessells this <hi>Succus Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
is from thence carried away. For, since it
cannot be thence exported by any peculiar
vessells, nor by veins; it must be by the Nervs.
(2) As for the Three <hi>Glandulae Lumbares;</hi> it
is probable, They also are official to the Nervs,
in the same way; and that for two important
Reasons. <hi>First,</hi> because they are furnished
with Venae Lacteae of both sorts, some tending
to them, and others propagated from them,
and exonerating themselves into the Common
Receptacle: in all points like the Glandules
of the Mesentery. <hi>Secondly,</hi> because in such
Animals, as have the Glandules of the Mesen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
very large, these <hi>Glandulae Lumbares</hi> are
either very small, or wholly deficient; and in
men, in whom the Glandules of the Mesente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
are but small, the Lumbares are great:
an undeniable argument, that the same office
is common to both sorts, and that the exility
of those is supplied by the amplitude of these.
And (3) the <hi>Thymus</hi> also seems to be a <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious</hi>
Glandule. For, in Infants, and other
Animals new born (at which time, they grow
much, and so require the more abundant nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment)
the magnitude of this Glandule
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60811:96"/>
doth exceed that of any other in the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
but, in old men (who daily go down the
hill of life, and so have less need of nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in such abundance) it dwindle's away to
a smallness many times scarce discernable.
Again, this Glandule hath no Excretory ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
nor (like other greater Reducing Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les)
any hollowness within; and therefore, we
may well list it in the number of Nutritious
Glandules. Add also, that it is white, soft,
and very sweet, and in substance resembling
the Glandules of the Paps: so that in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
as the paps serve to prepare nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the infant, <hi>ab extrà;</hi> the Thymus
supplieth him with nourishment, <hi>ab intrà;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the same, perhaps our of the <hi>Ductus
Lacteus</hi> in the Thorax, which in its approach to
the Thymus, is usually divided into two
streams or rivulets. And these are the reasons,
upon which we conclude, that the Nerves
take in some of the <hi>Succus Nutritius,</hi> out of each
of these Glandules mentioned, whose use
seems to be, to separate the same from the less
Alimentary parts of the Chyle.</p>

what is the <hi>Prineipium Dispensationis,</hi> whence
the Succus Nutritius is immediately immitted

that all the Nervs desuming their original
from, and having their extremities or roots

the same Nutritive Liquor, is brought into the
brain and Spinal Marrow?</hi> We say, By the
<hi>Nerves,</hi> and particularly those of the <hi>sixth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation:</hi>
For, this pair of Nerves, though they
appear less than all others, at their first rising
from the Brain; do yet hold a commerce with
all other nerves of the whole body, and are
immediately derived to more parts, than any
other pair or Conjugation, which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why Anatomists called them, the <hi>Wandring</hi>
or <hi>Dispersed</hi> pair. And the Commerce they
maintain with so vast a multitude of other
nerves, is founded on a threefold relation or
intercourse, <hi>viz. Complication, Consociation,</hi>
and <hi>Inoculation:</hi> all which are largely descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by <hi>Fallopius,</hi> and after him by our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

               <note place="margin">in observat. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomic. de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natom. Hepatis. p. 436.</note> Now, if we seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the scope or design of Nature, in all those
laborious and curious Connexions of Nerves,
we shall find none, wherein our reason may
with so much satisfaction acquiesce as in this,
that they conduce to the commodious recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Nutritive juice and transportation
of it to the principle of its Dispensation. For
it seems, the Nutritive juice is first imbibed by
the small branches of the Nerves of the sixth
Conjugation; and those, though very many,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60811:97"/>
being yet too few for the transportation of so
large a quantity of that rich Nectar, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to the nourishment of the whole body,
Nature hath conjoyned with them a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of other Nerves, as Auxiliaries in that
great work. So that it is not dissentaneous to
reason, to conceive, that by these Nerves and
their Coadjutors, the <hi>Succus Nutritius</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the brain and Spinal Marrow, thence
to be afterward derived to all parts for their
sustenance.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Concerning the <hi>Fourth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What is the <hi>Motion</hi> of the same in the Nervs; <hi>viz.</hi> not continual, nor vehement: but <hi>by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls,</hi> and <hi>slow</hi> and <hi>gentle;</hi> to the brain, in sleep, and from it to the members, after sleep.</note> viz. <hi>the Motion of the
Succus Nutritius in the Nerves;</hi> though it be a
problem of great obscurity, yet doth the light,
let in at the postern gate of Conjecture dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
thus much, that it is not continual (as
that of the blood in the Arteries and veins)
but <hi>by intervals;</hi> nor violent, but <hi>slow</hi> and <hi>gentle;</hi>
as the defect of any swelling on either side of
a Nerve bound about, in a living creature,
doth sufficiently manifest. Nor is it unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to conceive, that in a short time after
each meal, immediately upon the distribution
of the Chyle through the <hi>Venae Lacteae,</hi> the
Succus Nutritius is imbibed by the Nerves of
the sixth Conjugation, and by them carried to
the brain and Spinal Marrow. Which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
is the reason, why alwayes, within an
hour or two after meat, we perceive a certain
dulness in our heads, together with an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to motion, and a propensity to sleep,
according to that proverb, When the belly is
full, the bones would be at rest: and soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60811:97"/>
all those vanish again, and we perceive
our selves more light, strong, and active than
before our refection; because then the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
begins to be diffused from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Dispensation, of outwards into the limbs
and other parts of the body. And with this
opinion agrees that observation of <hi>Bartholinus</hi>
that the Lympheducts are more plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
about five or six hours after meat,
than at other times; as being at that time more
filled with the superfluities of the <hi>Succus Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritius.</hi>
Nor is it improbable, that the Brain
and Spinal Marrow are chiefly nourished in
sleep, and that then the Nutritive Liquor is
usually carried to them, relaxing them with
its sweet and mild vapours, and so both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
and prolonging sleep. From whence
perhaps it comes, that after long sleeps, we
perceive our brains to be oppressed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded
with vapours, our senses dull, and the
motive-faculty enervated. Besides, in sleep all
motions of humors flowing to the patts by the
Nerves, seem to be suspended; and yet the
Circulation of the blood is certainly at that
time more free and quick, than while we
wake: So that It cannot be thought the cause
of that cessation, but the Nerves onely, which
intermit their office of distributing the Succus
Nutritius, during sleep. And all this will
appear more reasonable, if we reflect upon
the flux of humors in the Nerves immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after sleep. For, then the Brain and Spinal
Marrow re-contract themselves, and become
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60811:98"/>
more tense; so that the <hi>Nutritive</hi> liquor is from
thence transmitted, partly to the members to
be nourished, and partly to the Glandules; as
well such as serve for the excretion of its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Excrement, as those that serve for the
reduction of its relative, <hi>viz.</hi> its acrimonious
parts, that are returned into the blood, for
the reason formerly mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> And concerning the <hi>Last,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And what the <hi>Causes</hi> of that Motion, <hi>viz.</hi> the motions of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme,</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> and of the <hi>Nerves</hi> themselves.</note> viz. the <hi>Causes</hi> of

this abstruse Theoreme, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
of some more dextrous Anatomist pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
deeper into the mystery of the Nerves; a
subject not much lesse inscrutable, than the
Nature of the Soul it self, which useth them as
her principal instruments: we hope, we may
have the liberty to conceive) that the <hi>Succus
Nutritius</hi> is not imported to the brain and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Marrow, nor exported from thence to the
members, by any Attraction similary or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective,
against which we have formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
convincing arguments, unnecessary to
be here repeated: but, as the blood, and indeed
all other humors of the body are moved, by
meer <hi>Impulsion,</hi> or <hi>Protrusion,</hi> the immediate
Cause of all motions in Nature. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
in this case impelling, we conceive to be
the motions of the <hi>Diaphragme,</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi>
and of the <hi>Nerves</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>For since the <hi>Depression of the Diaphragme,</hi> is
generally admitted to conduce to the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60811:98"/>
of the Chyle out of the stomach, guts,
<hi>Venae Lacteae,</hi> common Receptacle, and <hi>Ductus
Chyliferi,</hi> successively into the subclavian Vein:
by alternately compressing all those parts, and
so compelling the Liquor contained in them,
to flow upward; and indeed to all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
motions; why may not the same be
thought sufficient also to the Expulsion of the
Nutritive juice, both out of the Praeparing
Glandules, into the Nerves of the Sixth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation
and their Auxiliaries, and out of
them into the brain and Spinal Marrow; their
position being such, as renders them no lesse
subject to compression, by the descending <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme,</hi>
than the Venae Lacteae, common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle,
and other <hi>Chyliferous</hi> parts are?</p>
            <p>If this seem difficult, we may have recourse
to the reason of the ascention of a liquor from
the bottome through all parts of a sponge,
cloath, or other filamentous substance (as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
in the percolation of <hi>Aqua Calcis,</hi>
made by a long piece of woollen cloath,
whose one end is dipt in the water, and the
other hung over the brim of the vessel contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it) which we have professedly explained in
the 356 <hi>page of our Physiology;</hi> and seems to be
the same with the reason of the ascention of
the nutritive juice of all plants from the roots
to the top of the branches.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Motion of the Brain;</hi> though
it may seem to be no other, but what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
upon the brain, by the Pulsation of
the Arteries (ascending from the <hi>Plexus Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosus
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60811:99"/>
mirabilis</hi> chiefly to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and
copiously disseminating themselves upon it);
yet, since it is credible, that the Pulsation of
the arteries doth promote the flux of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
in the Nerves, in other parts, especially
such, where Nerves are either contiguous, or
neer enough to <hi>Arteries,</hi> to participate of their
impulse: why may not the motion of the Brain
also, to which the Nerves are continued, serve
to ex-press the liquor out of them, toward the
parts wherein they are terminated? Besides, it
is most certain that immediately after sleep,
the whole Brain, together with the conjoyned
net-work of its Nerves, becomes more tense
and firme, than in sleep, which seems to render
it moist and lax: and since that Tension cannot
but in a manner ex-press, or squeez forth, the
liquor contained in the original of the Nerves,
it is reasonable to conceive, that the motion of
the <hi>Succus Nutritius</hi> from the brain to the
parts, is to be imputed thereunto; especially it
being by us observed, that the diffusion of the
nourishment is chiefly soon after we awake
and rise from sleep.</p>
            <p>And lastly, as for the <hi>Motion of the Nerves</hi>
themselves; nothing is more manifest, than
that, while the Nerves and Muscles are disten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Voluntary motion, the juice contained
in the Nerves must be impelled or ex-pressed
to the parts, into which they are inserted; the
extension of any nervous body, necessitating
the flux of any liquor contained betwixt its
filaments, from one extream to the other.</p>

weighty <hi>Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1) Voluntary Motion being nothing,<note place="margin">the <hi>Mutation of Figure</hi> both in the Muscle and Member moved:</note> but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
the willing translation of the body of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
or some part of it, out of one place, into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60811:101"/>
it is necessary, the member moved
should measure the determinate space betwixt
the <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> and the <hi>terminus ad quem;</hi>
and consequently, that the proportion of the

<hi>Figure,</hi> as well in the member moved, as in the

that Mutation of Figure in the external in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
cannot arise immediately from the

her self produce no such effect: and therefore it
must arise from something more proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

either the grossness of the member, or muscles

which Something can be no other, than the
Animal Spirits, whose subtility makes them to

whose sudden influx through the Nerves,

the Muscles, there must be some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate
instrument, such as is capable of
being so transmitted from the Brain, into the
Muscles, with the greatest velocity imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and of setting them instantly a-work, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the determination and direction of
the soul. Now, no part of an Animal can be
thought capable of such easie and expedite
<hi>Mobility,</hi> but the <hi>spirits,</hi> which flow through
the body in less than the twinckling of an eye:
and therefore, we conclude, that They are the
Immediate instrument of the soul, in voluntary
motion; according to the assertion of <hi>Galen (in
4. de locis affect cap. 6.)</hi> in these words; <hi>Est in
cerebri ventriculis Spiritus, Animae primum instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,
quo &amp; sensum &amp; motum per universas
corporis partes Anima transmittit, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3) As the Power or Faculty of Seeing doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
not reside in the Eye,<note place="margin">the conquest of the acting Muscle, over its Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist.</note> nor that of Hearing, in
the Eare,  but is imparted to the organs
of sight, and hearing, from the soul, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of Nervs and Spirits: so likewise is not
the Virtue Motive inhaerent in the Muscles, but
communicated to them upon occasion, from
the same soul, and seems to consist wholly in
the quick afflux of spirits, as that by which
alone they are moved. Which <hi>Galen</hi> also doth
not obscurely intimate <hi>(in 1. de mot. Musculor.
cap. 8.)</hi> where he saith, <hi>Aequipollens musculorum
motus fit, quando neuter tonum Animalem habet
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60811:102"/>
auxiliarm; non aequipollens verò, cum alter solus
dominatur: quare necessum est, ut vincat contractio
istius musculi, qui ab Animali Facultare adjuva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
For, what can be understood by this <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Animalis,</hi> or <hi>Facultas Animalis,</hi> unless it be
the distention of the conquering muscle by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
spirits, sent from the brain, at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Soul?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>(4) What's the reason,<note place="margin">the <hi>swelling</hi> of each Muscle, when it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</note> that a muscle is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
moved, but it becomes more hard and
swelling in the middle, than before (as is most
evident in both the Masseter and Temporal
Muscles, when we chew our meat) unless be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is then filled and distended with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
gale of spirits, issued out of the store-house
of the Brain? For, it seems more reasonable,
that this swelling in the body of the Muscle is
the Cause of its Contraction; than, on the
contrary, that the Contraction should be the
cause of the Swelling, as those contend who
would have the motion to be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the afflux of spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>(5) If a Nerve be cut asunder, the Muscle
into which it was inserted,<note place="margin">the privation of motion in a Muscle, whose <hi>Nerve</hi> is cut off.</note> doth for ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
uncapable of motion; and this, certainly,
for no other reason, but because the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the spirits betwixt the brain and that
particular Muscle is wholly destroyed. So
that we may well conclude, that the Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
cause voluntary motion, but by the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of Animal spirits, through the Nervs,
into the Muscles.</p>
            <p>The necessity of Animal spirits, as the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60811:102"/>
Instrument of the soul, thus appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
we are next to speculate the Conditions
requisite in the Immediate Instrument of the
Motion it self: that so we may come to a clear
understanding both of the structure and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of the Muscles, and at length of the reason
of their moving the members, the thing at
which our Scrutiny is chiefly levelled.</p>
            <p>As for the requisite <hi>Conditions,</hi> therefore, of
this last Instrument, we observe,</p>
            <p>(1) That in an organ of voluntary Motion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
is required such a Constitution,<note place="margin">vvhy a Muscle is composed for the most part of <hi>Flesh.</hi>
               </note> as may render
it fit to receive the Animal spirits, at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and command of the soul. Which makes
it manifest, that a hard, inflexible, and bony
substance is most incompetent to an instrument
of motion; for which reason, perhaps, <hi>Galen</hi>
adventured to affirme, that any part made
hard and stiffe by a thick Cicatrice, becomes
unfit for motion: and that it must be such a
part, as being soft, rare, spongy, and flexible,
and distinguished with multitudes of Fibers,
may most easily and readily admit the Gale of
spirits flowing into its substance, and be by
them filled or distended. Which is the reason,
why the substance of the Muscles is for the
most part <hi>Fleshy;</hi> than which no part, is more
soft, rare, flexible, and distendible: as <hi>Galen</hi>
hath observed <hi>(in 1. de usu part. cap. 13.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) Lest the spirits might flow into this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
flesh,<note place="margin">of a <hi>Nerve.</hi>
               </note> indeterminately or at randome and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringly:
there ought to be such peculiar ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells
or Conduits, which being continued from
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60811:103"/>
the brain or spinal marrow, quite home to the
Flesh, into which they are inserted, may both
carry the spirits thither, and preserve them
from straying or dispersing by the way; and
by which the Soul, or Regulating Faculty, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
residing in the brain, the original of the
Nervs, may rule the members, as a Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
rules his horses by the rains of his bridles;
that we may use the same comparison with
<hi>Galen, (1. de mot. musculor. cap. 1.).</hi> Now, the
<hi>Nervs</hi> being the only parts of the whole body
thus qualified, Nature most wisely inserted
one, or more of them, into each Muscle. So
that from this constitution of the Nervs, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that they make the second Essential part
of a Muscle. Nay, according to strict truth,
we may adventure to say, that the Flesh and
Nerve are the principal ingredients required
to compleat the essence of a Muscle: because
there are some Muscles <hi>(viz.</hi> those of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
of the Forehead, of the Eyes, of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
of the Fundament, &amp;c.) in whose bodies
are neither Tendons, nor Ligaments to be
found, but only Nervs, and Flesh distinguished
with various Fibres.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>(3) Because in some Members,<note place="margin">Of a <hi>Ligament.</hi>
               </note> by reason of
their Gravity, there is a greater resistence to
motion, than the Musculous Flesh (in respect
of its softness and tenderness) is able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
therefore ought there to be an addition
of some stronger and tougher substance, which
being connected or united to the Flesh of the
Muscle, may both corroborate the same, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60811:103"/>
firmly conjoyn it to the bones, so as to enable
it to move the ponderous member, to whose
bones it is fastned. Now, this Nature fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw,
when she furnished some Muscles with
<hi>Ligaments,</hi> especially such as were ordained to
bear great stress, in moving the greater and
more weighty members. Which <hi>Galen</hi> most
elegantly expresseth thus; <hi>Ut enim ossa, quae
dearticulantur, exactè simul ligarentur ac contine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur,
ne facilè in motibus vehementioribus à sese
abrumperentur; Ligamentum, quoad maximè po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit,

promptè obsequeretur, molle rursus esse oportuit, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
ob id ipsum imbecillum. Atqui, forte quidem
imbecillo, ac durum molli est contrarium. Quaenam
igitur fuerit in his Naturae solertia, quae corpus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit,
quod commoditatem utramque haberet, idem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que

               </note> by the mediation of a

Spirits, and to fulfill the command of the Soul,

and of its tough and strong Contexture, or
substance, and also of its connexion to the

therefore hath Nature cloathed the

which hath these two further Uses, that it
causeth the Muscles that are contiguous, to
slip up and down easily and without enterfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
each other, and preserves the spirits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the body of the muscle moved,
from passing quite through, or dispersing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which they are apt to do, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

            <p>In respect of their <hi>Parts</hi>
               <note place="margin">Parts;</note> (by which we must
now understand not only such, whereunto as
chief ones every Muscle is divided, but those
also upon which it is seated); there are various
differences. The parts into which each Muscle
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60811:105"/>
is commonly divided, are the <hi>Head,</hi> or Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
the <hi>Belly,</hi> or Middle; and the <hi>Tail,</hi> or
Tendon. Most Muscles have but one Head;
yet some have two, others three: whence they
are called <hi>Bicipites,</hi> and <hi>Tricipites.</hi> Most have
but one Belly, yet some are double-bellied, as
the Muscle shutting the <hi>lower jaw,</hi> of the Bone
<hi>Hyoïs,</hi> whence they are named <hi>Digastrici.</hi> The
Tendons of some are broad and membranous;
of others, round; of others, short; of others,
long; of some, perforated; of others, intire;
of some, single; of others, multiplied. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you shall find many Muscles ending in
one and the same Tendon; as, in the Leg, the
<hi>Gemelli</hi> or Twin-Muscles, and the <hi>Solaris,</hi> are
united into one Chord. Lastly, from the
parts upon which they are seated, they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
borrow their names; as the <hi>Crotaphitae,</hi>
or Temple-Muscles; the <hi>Rachitae,</hi> or <hi>Spinati</hi> of
the back; the <hi>Iliaci,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>According to the variety of their particular
<hi>Actions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">and Actions.</note> the Muscles admit of a triple Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Whereof the <hi>First</hi> is, that some are
<hi>Congeneres,</hi> or <hi>Confederates,</hi> which both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
to one and the same motion; as when two
are Flexors, two Extensors; one possessing the
right, the other the left side of the member:
and others <hi>Antagonists,</hi> which have motions
contrary to those of others; there being scarce
any one Muscle, which hath not its Contrary,
or Opponent; as to every Flexor is opposed
a Tensor; to every Elevator, a Depressor; to
every Adductor, an Abductor; excepting only
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60811:106"/>
the two Sphincters, and the Cremasters. The
<hi>Confederates</hi> are generally equal in magnitude,
number, and strength: the <hi>Antagonists not,</hi> but
different, according to the weight of the part to
be moved, and the vehemence of the motion.
Thus, the Muscles bowing the Head, are only
Two; while there are Twelve to lift it up;
and those that shut the lower jaw-bone with
the upper, are many, but those that open it,
are only two; for the weight of heavy bodies
doth facilitate their falling downe. The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
is, that some Muscles move only Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as the two Sphincters: others somewhat
else besides themselves. And the <hi>Last</hi> respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>To come to their <hi>Concernment</hi> in the Motion
of the Muscles, we observe, that every Muscle
hath a twofold Motion, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>Natural,</hi>
wherein the Fibers of the muscle spontaneously
recontract themselves, after they have been
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60811:109"/>
extended, or restore themselves to their native <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
tenour;<note place="margin">That every Muscle hath a Twofold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, viz. <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal.</hi>
                  </note> by Philosopher named, the motion of
<hi>Restitution,</hi> common to all <hi>Tensile</hi> bodies: and
this is alwayes from the end, towards the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Muscle, according to the positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of its Fibers: another, <hi>Animal;</hi> wherein the
same Fibers are further Contracted, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
and copious influx of Animal spirits, at
the command of the soul, in order to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of some action intended.</p>
               <p>That the Natural Contraction of a Muscle,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/>
is not sufficient to voluntary Motion,<note place="margin">That the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction is not the cause of Voluntary Motion; but only the <hi>Animal.</hi>
                  </note> though
we allow every muscle to be made upon the
stretch, <hi>i.e.</hi> in an extended position, is manifest
from hence, that betwixt each Muscle and its
Antagonist, there is an equal power of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally-moving
themselves toward their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals;
so that betwixt two Contrary forces,
the one drawing one way, the other the clean
contrary, the member must be held immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
as appears in the 5th. <hi>proposit. Architecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</hi>
Necessary it is, therefore, to voluntary
Motion, that one Muscle over-power the other,
not by reason of its spontaneous or Natural
Contraction, but of its impressed or Animal;
which depends upon the supply of spirits trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
from the brain, by the Nerves into the

them, as to cause the whole Muscle to shorten
or contract it self. And, that the power of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonists
is, as we affirme, naturally equal;
may be concluded from hence, that if one
Muscle be cut off, its Antagonist instantly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60811:110"/>
drawes the member to its side, which before
was held in the middle, and as it were aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
betwixt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> we observe; that in all Motion
there are <hi>two Terms</hi> to be acknowledged,<note place="margin">That in Moti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, are Two Terms, one <hi>Fixt,</hi> the other <hi>Movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> the last of which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, sometimes less remote from the former, according to greater or less resistence of Gravity in the member to be moved, and vehemence of the Motion.</note> the
<hi>one</hi> is the <hi>point of Rest,</hi> or the Fundament, in
which the muscle is firmed or fastned, because
all motion is <hi>super aliquo Quiescente:</hi> the <hi>other</hi>
is in <hi>parte Mobili,</hi> or insertion of the muscle,
from whence the Muscle, by contraction,
drawes the member toward it self; and this is
sometimes less, sometimes more remote from
the Center, or point of rest, according to the
less or greater resistence of Gravity in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to be moved, and according to the less or
greater vehemence required to the motion.
Which Nature (whose Art is not more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in any thing, than in her proportioning
the length of the insertion of each muscle, from
the Hypomochlion or point of Rest, to the
Gravity of the member to be moved) respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
most ingeniously contrived a way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate
the slender strength of divers muscles,
by inserting them at great distance from the
Center of their motion, or that point, about
which the member is to be moved. For, since
(according to the 1. <hi>proposit. Architectonical)
there is no motion in the Center;</hi> we may easily
understand, why in many muscles, ordained
for strong motions, the <hi>Terminus stabilis,</hi> or ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
is more remote from the <hi>Terminus Mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
or insertion, than in others framed for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
less strong; <hi>viz.</hi> that by even a small
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60811:110"/>
force, the muscle (which, considered in its
proper bulk, or in any other position, would
be insufficient to the effect designed) might
elevate a great weight, as we see in the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Hand, Arme, Thighs, and other
parts. For this reason also is it, that in some
bones we have certain <hi>prominences,</hi> or But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
forth in the end, called <hi>Epiphyses,</hi> and
<hi>Apophyses,</hi> to which the muscles are fastned.
The truth of all which is evinced by the 2d <hi>and
3d proposit. Architectonical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things being thus firmly established,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/>
it appears an undeniable truth,<note place="margin">No Motion without change of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</note> that no moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can be made, without changing the Figure
of the muscle. For, since equal Angles sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
equal sides, by the 6th <hi>Geometrical Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
it followes necessarily, that in all motion,
the Figure of the member moved, is changed.</p>
               <p>And, because the change of Figure doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/>
on the change of Angles;<note place="margin">Which is Threefold, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective to the difference of Angles.</note> therefore must
we admit a threefold Figure, as there are three
sorts of Angles, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) a right, in which
neither of the two opposite muscles acteth;
(2) an obtuse, which being greater than a right,
is consequently subtended by a greater side;
and (3) an acute, which being less<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> requires
a less subtending line.</p>
               <p>Now, forasmuch as in the <hi>Middle</hi> Figure,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
no motion can be made,<note place="margin">All motion is made in one of the Two <hi>Extream</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; and how, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</note> because then both the

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60811:111"/>
by the Animal influx, more than its
Antagonist, whereupon the Figure of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering

Articulation is made more Acute, or less, by
that Contraction; and that segment, detracted
from the line, is in proportion to the space
comprehended. For Example.</p>

as may be observed in the Sphincters of the
Bladder and Fundament, and in the Round
muscle of the Eye-lids.</p>
               <p>Onely it may be enquired, Why those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/>
                  <hi>Sphincters</hi> have no Antagonists,<note place="margin">Why the Sphincters have no Antagonists.</note> as the <hi>Clausor
Palpebrarum</hi> seems to have, the <hi>Elevator</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the eye-lids, as the <hi>Clausor</hi> shuts them?
Whereof the Reason certainly is this, that both
the Bladder and Fundament are not opened
by muscles, but by the quantity of Excrements
contained in them, which being pressed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
downward by the Diaphragme and
muscles of the Abdomen, force open the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60811:113"/>
Sphincters, by extending their Fibers from the
Centre to the Circumference; so that to speak
strictly, the excretion of the Urine, and of the
Excrements of the belly, are not actions <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi>
voluntary, as the opening of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
is.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> And this is all we thought necessary to be
said, concerning the Use of the muscles,<note place="margin">Conclusion.</note> in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi>
and concerning the admirable Geometry
observed by Nature in the Fabrique of them.</p>
               <p>Should we extend our discourse, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
of the Figure and motion of each

Geometrical, and Architectonical principles
premised: as we should abuse your Patience,
so should we disparage your Capacity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
use of the same Clue for your guidance
through the whole Labyrinth of Voluntary
Motion, that we have put into your hands for
your more easily entering into it. We shall
conclude, therefore, with this due acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment;
that the <hi>Omniscient Creator hath
