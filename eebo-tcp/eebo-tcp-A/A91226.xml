            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>WHereas not only one <hi>Walker, Bates,</hi> and others heretofore,
for their own privat lucre, have printed ſundry illiterate
<hi>Pamphlets</hi> in my name, to <hi>cheat the People,</hi> but likewiſe
one <hi>Chapman</hi> in <hi>Popes-head</hi> alley (as I am credibly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thoſe who will prove it) on the 30. of this inſtant
<hi>May</hi> hath printed and diſperſed a paper, intituled,
<q>[<hi>A Sheet, Or if you will, a Winding Sheet for the good Old Cauſe:</hi> By W. P.
<hi>Philopolites.]</hi>
               </q> 
Prefixing the Letters of my name before it, as penned by me,
and on this 31. of <hi>May,</hi> hath printed and publiſhed another <hi>Sheet,</hi> ſtiled
<q>
                  <p>[<hi>Mola Aſinaria: </hi>Or,<hi> The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſupportable Burthen now preſs'd

                  <p>BY <hi>WILLIAM PRYNNE,</hi> Bencher of Lincolns Inne.</p>
               </q>
Printing my name thus at large not only in the <hi>Title,</hi> but in the <hi>Contexture it
ſelf,</hi> inſinuating it to be penned by me, on purpoſe to <hi>cheat the people of their
monies;</hi> and make me the <hi>Father</hi> of theſe BASTARDS, (through the <hi>Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Knavery</hi>) which the true <hi>Fathers</hi> need not be aſhamed to own publickly
by name, being Ingenuous well-penned Pieces. To prevent all future <hi>Frauds</hi>
of this nature (eſpecially in Pamphlets declaiming againſt <hi>Publike Cheats,</hi>) I
held it my duty openly to <hi>detect and diſclaim theſe two,</hi> in print before all the
world; having no hand at all in the conception, generation, or production
of either of theſe <hi>Pamphlets</hi> directly or indirectly, whoſe Compilers are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unknown to me. And I ſhall deſire all Stationers, Printers hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
to take notice; that their thruſting out Books in other mens names <hi>
                  <hi>to
pick peoples purſes, is a Counterfeiting of Letters in other mens names
falſly and deceitfully to get mony from other perſons,</hi>
               </hi> within the Stat. of <hi>33H</hi>
8. c. 1. puniſhable <hi>by Impriſonment, Pillory, and all other corporal pains, except death:</hi>
Which Law I intend to proſecute againſt them, if they ſhall henceforth abuſe
me, and the people in this kinde.</p>
            <p>As for the ſcurrillous rayling, nameleſs, empty abuſive Printed <hi>Libels</hi> and
Papers formerly and lately publiſhed againſt me; I look upon them onely
with contempt, <hi>as the braying of illiterate Aſſes,</hi> who can neither <hi>contradict</hi> nor
<hi>refute</hi> my writings for the <hi>publike good and ſafety:</hi> and value them no more,
than the <hi>barking of mangie Doggs againſt the Moonſhine:</hi> having treaſured up
this <hi>Soveraign Antidote</hi> of my <hi>Saviours</hi> own compoſition, in my breaſt
many years ſince, againſt the <hi>venom</hi> of <hi>all falſe viperous tongues or pens,</hi> Luke
6. 22, 23. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall hate you, and</hi> ſeperate <hi>you from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and caſt out your name as evil, for the Sonne of mans ſake: Rejoyce and leap
for joy, for great is your reward in heaven, for ſo did your Fathers unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
A wiſe <hi>Heathen</hi> could ſay, <hi>Regium est male audire cum bene feceris;</hi>
much more a magnanimous Chriſtian. The beſt refutation of Raylings, is
Contempt; <hi>Spreta exoleſcunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In teſtimony of the premiſes, I thought neceſſary to ſubſcribe and publiſh
them under my own hand and name.</p>
