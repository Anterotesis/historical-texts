            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER in God, GEORGE, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Prouidence Lord Bishop of LONDON, <hi>my singular good Lord.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE whole Church, and Kingdome of England, (Right Reuerend Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late) hath a long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether taken notice of that continuall neerenesse, into which it hath pleased his Maiestie (who does all things vpon Iudgement) to admit your wisedome and faithfulnesse, in matters of aduice especially, which be most proper to your sacred Function. Which Grace of your Lordships with so wise and learned a Prince, hath perswaded me, that as you were the fittest, so you would be the willingest to doe our Great Master this seruice; for so I hope this Office will proue, if your Lordship wil be pleased, that this Boke may by your hands haue accesse vnto his Maiestie. It treats of a Royall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and therefore (euen of dutie) to be dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a King, as a thing due vnto <hi>Caesar:</hi> And due
<pb facs="tcp:20039:4"/>
vnto our King especially, whom God hath raysed vp in <hi>Brittaine,</hi> as the <hi>Fort Royall</hi> of Princes, to amate that Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> that prowd Castle of S. <hi>Angelo.</hi> And therefore as his Maiestie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath first of all, and best of all, written in this kind, and giuen the ablest directions vnto others to prosecute the Argument; so it might seeme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, if any thing of this subiect should come abroad without his Royall assent.</p>
            <p>His Maiesties example (together with this Gentlemans owne zeale to the Cause) did at first, no doubt, encourage this learned Author to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this present Worke, who as he still is by his place a Iustice of Peace, so hath he here done Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice vpon that sawcie Medler with the Rights of Princes, <hi>Parsons</hi> the Iesuit, and those two sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bookes of his, one comming our vnder the name of <hi>P. R.</hi> the other of a Catholike Gentleman, both which he hath here made to keepe the Kings peace. The Title will (I hope) find gracious acceptance, and the Booke honourable approbation with his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Maiestie. Which hope of mine hath emboldened me to offer it vnto your good Lordship, as a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of my most hearty and humble thankfulnesse, for those fauors which I haue receiued from your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: the remembrance of which shall euer bind me to be at your Lordships seruice most faithfully.</p>

Why then should not this example of his, excuse me from blame of the Author of this following Worke, for attempting to commit to the Presse, and commending that to others in publike, which he but lent to me in priuate? since good things are best knowne, by their vse; and well considering, how acceptable it may prooue to our hopefull times.

               </gap>, when hee first began this Treatise (I am well assured) was onely to satisfie his owne priuate Iudgement, esteeming it (through his too much Modestie) so farre vnfit for the publike view, as for the space of tenne or twelue yeeres since the finishing of it, hee suffered it to rest obscure, amongst his other priuate Labours; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his industrie and abilitie may appeare to be made yet more transparent, in his owne vnder-valuing of what hee hath so exactly performed: Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thus accidentally to my hands, and viewing the matter it treated of, and the malicious slanders it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, I could not chuse but euen blame the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Author, that would haue made the very Wombe of this his seasonable Off-spring, the Tombe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it at one and the same time both life and dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion together.</p>

And though the man opposed be (as I conceiue) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of defence, yet there remaine many of his Labors, that like the Vipers brood haue suckt a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Poyson from his death.

            <head>AN EXAMINATION OF a Position published by P. R. in the preface of his treatise, tending to mitigation, <hi>concerning the lawfullnesse of the Popes Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ouer Princes: with a defence of the oath of Allegiance.</head>
            <p>IT pleased the Right Honorable the Earle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in his exactly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and necessary published answer, to certaine scandalous Papists prouoking him by occasion, and in fashion vnsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to protest against the insolency and malignity of the Romish Church, out of the bosome whereof so many Treacheries, Conspirases and Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the foulest kind, haue bin vented into the world, tending to ouerule or ruinate whatsoeuer authority, not submitting the necke to the yoake of that vsurping po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; in the very first passage of that his Appologetticall declaration (which enuie it selfe could not passe ouer without attribution of highest praise) hee was carried (by the contemplation of so many dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20039:8"/>
and complotting practises, dayly pretended and contriued against the safetie and dignitie of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Potentates) to a more vehement expressing of himselfe in the zeale of words following.  <q>I haue been a long time sorry, that those which imploy so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny seditious spirits dayly to instruct the vnlearned Catholikes, in these mysteries of deposing Princes, haue not by some publike &amp; definitiue sentence Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall (in which it is supposed, the Pope cannot erre) made some cleere explication of their assumed power ouer Soueraigne Princes, as not onely those which acknowledge his superioritie might bee secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from feares and iealousies of continuall treasons, and bloody assassinates against their persons, but those kings which doe not approoue the same, and yet would faine reserue a charitable opinion of her subiects, might know how far to repose themselues in their fidelitie, in ciuill obedience, howsoeuer they seem to be deuided from them in point of conscience.</q>
To which his Lordsh. so honourable desire, this good father offereth and endeauoureth to giue satisfaction. Aman (if we mistake not his sheepemarke) of some fame, and note of that side, placed in a degree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, graced with more then ordinary gifts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently conceited of himselfe, and daring to vndertake matters of highest nature; not withstanding, obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of him that his boldnes much ouerbalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth any other his best worth.</p>
            <p>His said preface of the importune exasperations vsed by diuers to increase our diuision and disagreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matters of Religion is very presumptuous, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together censorious, wholly spent in taxing and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20039:8"/>
not onely the particular speeches, or writings of some especiall men of excellent desert in this state, as if whatsoeuer they haue vttered out of the abundance of iust griefe in detestation of the late execrable treason, did wholly proceede from exasperation, exulceration, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauation, exaggeration and calumniation, (for in those high sounding tearmes he beareth his stile aloft) but also <q>the administration of iustice, the vprightnes of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, the newly enacted penall lawes, as making the state of English Catholikes vnder Protestant gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more miserable and intolerable, than that of the Iewes vnder any sort of Christian Princes, that of the Grecians, or Christians vnder the Turke or Persian, or that of bond Subiects, vnder the Polonians, Suetians, and Muscouites, onely he confesseth that in two mens writings he findeth more moderation. The one is his Maiestie in his speeches, both in Parliament, &amp; in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations (whereunto yet he giueth some dash or wipe of exception) The other is my Lord of Salisbury in his said answer, to that fond menacing letter, or rather fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke commination which yet (hee saith) wanteth not his sting, piercing euen to the quicke.</q>
After hee hath thus throughout his many licentious leaues, braued it with exorbitant and exulting phrases, at the last, he falleth in hand with this piece of doctrine occasionally drawne thereunto by the consideration of his Lordships said de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and (forsooth) he is the man that must instruct and settle my Lords iudgment by his profound resolues, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be moued with pitty, that his Honour (in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not appertaining properly to his facultie or professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) hath beene misled or misinformed by his diuine.</p>

            <p>It seemeth that these laques of the Romish faction are very frequently acquainted with such fictions, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie can be more disasterous then that the credence, so publikly deliuered by so honorable a person of his place, and eminency in the state; and of such vnspotted integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in the carriage of all causes, and otherwise to bee suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently testified also, by the concurrence of sundry mens particular knowledge, must vndergoe the girds and glances of his misdoubts and questioning curiositie? but leauing the cauilling fellow to his maleuolent surmises; I will now come to his other presumption, whereby hee vndertaketh to assure and satisfie my Lord of the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall position, of deposing Soueraignes, wherein (albeit I well know, that his honour is most able with his sharpe enquirie, and iuditious discerning, to looke into all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretest corners and hiding places which he can contriue, or reserue in this cause, <hi>Nequae forte lateat intus garrula cornix,</hi> yet not knowing whether his Lordship out of his many other most waightie affaires can affoord vnto this vain discourser so much losse of time, as but to read his so idle, &amp; frothy stuffe.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20039:9"/>
so high and most important controuersie.</p>
            <p>But before we come to the core of the question, let it be obserued what good cause he hath to pleade for mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation, and how well he acteth the part of a mittigator. In the mention which hee maketh of the late powder plot for the suddaine, and vnrecouerable subuersion of our gratious King, and the whole state at once, (the very cogitation whereof, is as full of horror, as the perpetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, would haue beene of treachery, and atrocitie) what fit or equiualent tearme hath his mild, and mittiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting spirit, deuised to expresse or paint forth the hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof? he doth twice (for fayling) iterate vnto vs that it was the temeritie of a few. He could not haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen a more easier, or more abating word, if he had beene, to reprooue them for some small misdemeanour against a petty Constable: can it be otherwise thought, but that this Artist, and Tradesman of words, did out of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and tendernesseof heart, sort out of the gentlest tearme he could find, lest he should seeme too sharpe and sore against them. Doth he imagine by such his initiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to persuade the King and Realme to tolleration? the kings Councell, learned at the law, in the dinotation and amplification of that vnspeakeable conspiracy, finding it to conteyne so many treasons in one, declared the same to be, as <hi>Sine exemplo, &amp; sine mode,</hi> so also <hi>sine nomine.</hi> Now this Rhetoricall Father could haue taught them all to haue framed the inditement vpon his so proper name, the treason of temeritie. I can hardly endure his other word (few) sauouring of the like mittigation also, yet I know that I shall euen madde him, in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him the very troth of my thought.
Hee sayth,
<q>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:20039:10"/>That to extend and draw out the hatred and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that fault to others of that religion, yea vnto the whole multitude, is a matter of exorbitant iniustice and vntemperate malice.</q>
I confesse that he hath herein some aduantage, both by the admirable goodnes and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of so louing a Soueraigne that suffereth not Iealousie to out trunne proofes, and by the deffect of discouerie of the degrees and depths of that designe.Yet (if it bee but to crosse him in the conceit) hee carrieth, fronting the same in the stile and inscription of his booke. <q>That it is not vnpossible for Catholikes and Protestants to liue together in dutifull obedience and subiection vnder the  gouernment of his Maiestie.</q> (I will let him know) that for my part, I did long since make it euen an article of my beleefe, that the like plot was rightly to be resembled to the trayne of powder; wherby it was to haue had his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, for as one corne thereof would haue fired ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, carrying the flash along, till the whole should ioyne together in full force. So vndoubtedly, the maine corps of Papacy within this land would haue beene stirred vp being laid in order and prepared by those wicked tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and leaders, according as they had contriued, the fire of their treason and rebellion to catch hold, &amp; flame forth. And it may sooner be feared, then it can be known, that (besides the few powder cornes ditected and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed) there was a longer and stronger traine, yea great and mighty barrells, that would haue beene combined to haue wrought the generall combustion, and dissipation of the whole state. I will rest this point with prayer, that (howsoeuer there may be vse or necessitie to trust vnto their faithfulnes) yet that there may neuer be opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or meanes giuen them for the triall of her infidelitie, and disloyaltie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:20039:10"/>An other tricke of his running in mittigation, is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mangling and mincing of the sense and feruency of his Lordships speech, hee wholly pretermitteth that part of the recited sentence, which by charging them to haue imployed so many seditious spirits to instruct the vnlearned Catholikes in the mysteries of deposing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doth the more vrgently presse them by a iust account to make good the causes of such their mischieuons and detestable proceedings. Shall I coniecture at his conceite in concealing or withdrawing of these words? be felt the same to strike into his sides the spurre of guiltines, by the remembrances of his owne notorious offences: who for many yeares hath beene thought a busie instrument of enkindling the simple and deuoted Catholikes with the spirit of sedition, and hath beene a detected confederate in the trayterous agences, wherein his subordinate Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites hath beene so disloyally imployed. Wherefore (though he had no great liking to heare againe the sound of such words, as must conuey an accusing sting into his conscience, yet he thought to lay it heauy vpon him (as a charge that hee might not well auoyde) to set forth (by declaring of the Papall right) some seeming shew in iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his owne and his complices, vndue &amp; disloyall dealings.</p>
            <p>In the rehearsall of the same sentence, he maketh one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omission of these words, inclosed in a parenthesis (in which it is supposed the Pope cannot erre.) This prero gatiue point of the Popes new erring iudgement, hee hath slyly passed by, as not willing to rush vpon that rock, vpon the firmenes and stabilitie whereof, their whole Church is bailt, this opinion (as his Lordship truely deliuered) hath for some ages passed beene receiued, and stifly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20039:11"/>
by the fawning hindes of the Pope, that hath beene accustomed, <hi>Tribunat Romanum lambere,</hi> but this good mitigator, finding no coulerable defence against many and wayty arguments, whereby such the transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding exaltation bestowed one his holinesse, is vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and ouerthrowne, hath no great liking to passe his affirmation, and assent to that doctrine, which the powers of his wit and learning, is not able to vphold. Nay hee hath in this controuersie taken an head, and singled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the common Catholikes, closing hands in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion with the Protestants. For in this very treatise, he <note place="margin">Cae. 6. par. 2</note> hath affoarded vs this fauour, that Popes may erre, yea euen in the articles of faith, yea and become Heretickes, and Apostataes, and that as Popes, that for the same, they may be deposed, and depriued of their Papall prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, doth he not speake like an honest plaine dealer, as if he would no more adore that I doll of Rome? and as if hee cared not any whit for the triuiall obiections made out of the words of Christ vnto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> I haue prayed that thy faith shall not faile: and againe, vpon this Rocke (meaning Saint <hi>Peter</hi>) I will build my Church? Nothing more permanent and vnmooueable than a rock, nothing more certaine of effect than what Christ prayeth for, and whatsoeuer endowments of gifts or graces was bestowed vpon Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> did become the fee-simple and inheritance of the sea of Rome. Hee that regardeth not these inferences, and allegations so generally allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and insisted vpon in the Church of Rome, and which hath hitherunto been vsed as the shoulders of <hi>Atlas</hi> to vphold the earthly heauen of the Pope, their earthly god, doth he not giue good hope, that hee will reuolt from Papacy it selfe? But (notwithstanding these faire
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20039:11"/>
shewes) by the helpe of some of his fellowes, hee hath found out a shifting distinction to winde himselfe out of all the straights, and entrapments, wherewith he seemed to be fettered so vnuoydably, Aud this it is.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That albeit the Popes, as Popes may erre, become A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postataes and Heretikes, yet that God (as Popes) will neuer permit them, to decree any hereticall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be held by the Church, or for the whole Church;</q> What can we say to the subtletie of this distinction? It is like to the buckler of <hi>Achilles</hi> that had many plates ensolded, one within the other, to giue the more assurance against all blowes or thrusts. It is a fertile and pregnant distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it hath these seueral issues of his body begotten. First, that Popes as men may erre, and be Heretikes, yea and decree hereticall doctrine, but not as Popes, for that God will not permit; It is pretty, but what sure marke or token doth he giue, whereby it may be knowne, what hee doth as Pope, or what hee doth as man? they say that God permitteth not, and we say, that onely God knoweth the difference Between his actions, or enactings as Pope, and his decisions as man, and so the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth vncertaine how farre to be bound.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God may permit Popes (as Popes) to hold hereticall doctrine, but not to decree it, where shall wee finde <hi>consistendi locum?</hi> if in their consistory, they shall declare, pronounce, and resolue vpon Heretical doctrine, may that amount vnto a decree, we haue had many such decrees reuersed and repeated.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, though God permit Popes (as Popes) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree an erronious and false doctrine, yet if at any time after (as if that wild beast euen the Bore of the forrest, had <hi>reuertendi animum</hi>) he recall or reiect the same, or doth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20039:12"/>
not wittingly (as against the known Catholike truth) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himselfe with peruersitie, that doctrine is not to bee adiudged hereticall, and thereby commeth vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert of the first distinction.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, though God permit Popes (as Popes) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree any hereticall doctrine, yet doth this distinction af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foard one hiding corner more, that the same is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to be held by the Church. Then let them, at the least, allow vs this footing against the Pope, that the Church is not bound to maintaine all his decrees.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, though God permit Popes (as Popes) to decree any hereticall doctrine to be held by the Church, yet the former distinction is further enriched with this clause, (taken out of <hi>Canus</hi>) that God permitteth not that decree for the whole Church: as if by the permission of God, the Church (like to the moone) may bee for the greater part thereof, darkned and seduced by such hereticall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Pope; yet that the whole Church, and euery member of the same, as (for instance) the Protestant part, which is deuided and departed from the abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Rome, is not carried headlong into heresie by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sentence or decree Papall</p>
            <p>Sixtly, there is yet included and reserued in this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction one question more, as conceiued in the wombe, but not expressed in plaine tearmes, which (at times of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent when they be pressed) they forget not to cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; which is, that the Church here mentioned, is, and must be the Catholike Romish Church, as if that particular of Rome, were the generall of the world, and that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish alone, had this eminent exception, aboue all other Churches, that the members thereof were not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded or enthralled by euery decrees of their Head.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20039:12"/>
I cannot yet haue done with this seauen-headed subtle serp<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>et, this deceitfull distinction. Allow it in his perfectest shape, and close it together in all his ioynts, God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the Pope (as Pope) to decree hereticall doctrine to bee held by the Church, and for the whole Church; what hath all this more then an equiualence to this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? God permitteth not the diuell to haue power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the elect and faithfull? And as when the Angell <hi>Raphaell</hi> bound the euill spirit from hurting of <hi>Tobias,</hi> it could not be construed to bee a fauour or a signe of loue vnto that euill spirit: so the not permitting of the Pope to decree hereticall doctrine, is no aduancing or aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Papall authoritie from being restrained, or not suffered to doe so grieuous hurts.</p>
            <p>This may suffice for his distinction, and subdistincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, like the foxe and the cubbs, vnto which I haue the more respectiuely cast mine eye, because I find this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the vnfallibilitie of the Popes decrees so closly couched euen to the centure of our question, of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer Princes. If I haue beene too long in examining his <hi>malam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> in the mittigations and omissions before mentioned, I must (for excuse) confesse, that I was well content to take him tardy in that very fault which hee so clamerously vpbraideth to his Antigonist Master <hi>Morton,</hi> carping and catching at him throughtout his whole book with a triumph of phrases for the very same corruption, (as he tearmeth it) though I nothing doubt but hee will sufficiently acquit himselfe of all those friuolous and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust cauells.</p>
            <p>The matters that we haue hitherto met with, haue been but introductory, and vpon the bye. Now it is meete we look into the maine and substantiall point of doctrine,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20039:13"/>
which (as if hee were closset-keeper to the Pope) hee confidently deliuereth to be Catholike and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall, inducing his Lordship to set vp his rest vpon that vnreprooueable resolution.</p>
            <p>I protest, that when I first considered how to redvce the question to a true discussable state, I found that I could not draw downe the right proposition, which is to bee controuerted betweene vs in that kind of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which hee speaketh, I found that hee vsed so much glosing, and dilating so many gay shewes and pretences, such cloathing and decking of the cause with well chosen words for the faire carriage of the matter, as that the naked and plaine sence thereof was not easily to be discouered.</p>
            <p>But after scanning more aduisedly, and breaking the ranke of his words, to looke into his innermost meaning, and matching the same, with that hee must stay if hee will performe his vndertakings, I discerned at the last a sowre pill to bee wrapped vp in a leafe of gold, the doctrine of conspiracy and rebellion against the state and life of Princes, cunningly couered ouer with a thicke crust of sweet Candie, to relesh the better with the simple, and so to deceiue them with a fore-inducing sweetnes. The Proposition must be this, The Pope may depose the king, and such his power is approoued of all Catholikes. And that appeareth thus, his Lordship spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the seditious spirits, that instruct the vnlearned in the mysteries of deposing Princes, desireth therein some publike and definitiue sentence Orthodoxall for cleare explication of such. The Popes assumed power, ouer So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Princes, therefore if this smooth mittigator will without winding away by circumlocutions, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20039:13"/>
his so finely framed tendernesse of Phrase, speake <hi>ad idem,</hi> plainely, and home to the purpose, hee must auouch this to bee a publike definitiue sentence, That the Pope hath lawfull power to depose Princes, but how doth hee expresse and pronounce this point? hee is so nice and warie, that hee thinketh not good to name the Pope at all, doubting belike that that name is distastfull, but in stead thereof, hee bestoweth on his holinesse the stately stile of Supreame Gouernour and Pastor of the Church and Common-wealth, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same words sundry times, and purposedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding the other, doth hee not imploy and inferre by this mounting of the Pope to the title of Supreame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the Common-wealth, that hee is the king of kings, and that Princes hold their scepters, as Viceroyes, and Lieutenants vnder him? I vnderstand not else how he can close the Common wealth within the Popes clawes: then again in the like sort, he shunneth the hatefull tearm of deposing, and vseth in the stead therof, restraining, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing, censuring, or iudging. And lastly he doth very mildly mittigate the rigor of deprauing the name, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing the person of the Prince, by applying this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to the restraining or censuring any exorbitant &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious excesse of great men, States or Princes, would not any man iudge, that (being so mannerly, so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, and cautulous, he were affraid or shamed to fall so fowle vpon Princes, as to maintaine the vsurpation of Papacy, in deposing of them?  hee setteth not one step in this question, wherein hee doth not doubt, that hee tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon thornes, yet trusting vpon his two great <q>gifts, facilitie of speech, and boldnesse of face. Hee spareth not to tell his Lordship that his Diuine

might easily haue enformed him, that amongst Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like people the matter is cleere, and sufficiently defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and declared in all points wherein there may bee any doubt concerning this affaire.</q>  Surely, his Lordships Deuine, may perhaps concurre in opinion with Master <hi>Morton,</hi> and most euidently discerne the consent and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herensie of Catholikes in the execrable practise of this proposition, but (that they haue not agreed in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and approbation of the point in question) the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect renouncing and disclayming thereof by some of the best learned of that side, at the time of their suffering of death for Treason, doth cleerely and fully make knowne vnto him and all the world.</p>
            <p>I will not take vpon me to search out and lay together heapes of rapsodies and collections, culled our of their writers to demonstrate their differences in this argument, thereby to disprooue their so pretended agreement in this definitiue sentence; but I trust to shew the same to be so false, so weake, so washie, and of so little waight, as vpon the ripping and examining thereof, it will euery whit of it fall quite asunder, fayling altogether of all ground, whereupon to stand, and hauing no good props to sustaine or support the same.</p>
            <p>In the meane while hee may perhaps doe vs a little more good than hee wisheth by his intimation vnto vs, That among Catholike people the matter is so cleere, for we are thereby to take notice and warning, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wee are to trust Catholikes, seeing they acknowledge this L. <hi>Peramount,</hi> aboue the Kings, &amp; must yeeld their <hi>Omni-moda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obedientia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> to that supreame Pastor, combining themselues at his beck in al dangerous designes when any pretence is made, that the gouernment of spiritual affaires
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20039:14"/>
appertaining to the Cath. Church, is letted or impugned by our temporall gouernour, for in such case (saith this learned Father) <q>the said supream Pastor hath authority to proceed against the said temporall gouernor, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence &amp; preseruation of his spiritual Charge,</q> had we not need to looke about vs euen with <hi>Argus</hi> eyes, when wee haue so many hands of this <hi>Briarius</hi> to fasten vpon vs at euery turne: euery let of spirituall affaires is punishable by the supreame Pastor, and such lets may as easily be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted or imposed for a crime vpon the temporall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; here is a good gap opened, and a way made wide enough for the firebrands of sedition, and the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous discontented, to reuell and route it in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, to suggest, inform, obiect, and oppose against all magistracy.</p>
            <p>Here againe I must put him in mind of his mittigations and extenuations, in sorting and vsing the gentler, and more pleasing words. What shall we think he meaneth by proceeding against the Temporall gouernor? might he not as well haue said, cite him, censure him, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him, depose him, and beare him out of his chaire of estate with the horns of a dreadful Bull? If <hi>Paulus</hi> the 3, or <hi>Pius</hi> the 5, had had this our mealie mouthed mittigator to haue bin the penman of their Bulls, he would rather haue the milder words of proyning or repressing, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of extreame and violent (borrowed from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremie</hi>) of destroying and pulling vp by the rootes, yet his kindnesse doth not hold constant, for in after rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings, when he ioyneth vp issue vpon the true state of the question; whether the words of the Prophet be well applyed by allusion to make good the authoritie of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20039:15"/>
Christs successors vpon earth, and whether the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Popes by such their arrogant and impudent glosing <note place="margin">Cae. 5. par 2</note> vpon the text, doth not (in this forcing and streyning of the Scriptures) peruert the Sacred Oracles of God, he is content to ioyne with his companions of that feather, in iustification of the right ayplying of the text, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Papall power, of pulling vp and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soueraigne Gouernours, though indeed (to doe him right all the reason he vseth, or yeeldeth in defence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is onely and barely this. <q>Is this so great an impietie thinke you?</q> Then let him giue what allay he listeth to the tartnesse of this doctrine, by his well seasoning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with his soft and supple words; yet as in the practike, the degrees of proceeding against Princes doth grow in order (or rather in disorder) of consequence by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall attempt of their subuersion and destruction, so in the disputatiue to allow him his mittigating tearmes, of redressing or repressing, will by direct inference and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie extention, reach to the crowne and life of Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Maiestie.</p>
            <p>Therefore laying aside all masking and mincing of the matter, by his artificiall vtterance, the cause in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, and to be argued is all one in the words as we put it, whether the Pope may depose the Prince, and in the words, as this shye and slye discourser will needes haue it, whether the Supreame Pastor may reftraine the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant and pernicious excesse of great men, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now that we haue the right questioned proposition, set downe plainely, and stripped of that Rhetoricall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray which dazled our eyes from discerning the true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and intention thereof, wee may proceede to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20039:15"/>
the considering and sifting of the reasons, deuised and alleadged for the maintenance of this assertion: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse it is not my purpose, nor standing with my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession (being no Diuine, and scant a Scholler) to looke into all the sinewes and veines of this question, to the vttermost spread and extent thereof, it toucheth vpon some principles of naturall reason, it also runneth through the course of Histories of all ages and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, It is triable by many rules and examples, both in the old and new Testament, it wanteth not the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the old Doctors, and Fathers of the Church. It is handled cunningly, and mystically, by the Popes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the Canonists. It must abide a canuasse amongst the Sophisticating Schoolemen: Finally, it hath beene by the moderne handlers of controuersie, argued with much skill and strength of wit. I haue no intent to leade along this question, through all the parts of learning. I will willingly leaue the loade, and tugge off such multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, or rather vniuersalitie to his good hand, and dexterity of handling, who is already interessed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged thereunto, and no doubt well prouided, and most accomplished, I meane, Mr <hi>Morton,</hi> against whom this Popish volume is addressed, in refutation of his former learned and religious treatise. My endeauours in this cause, be confined onely to that part of the Preface, in the which (concerning this question) that dissembling Authour, hath set forth the Catholike opinion, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed, and garded with some reasons, to confirme and strengthen the same, pretending thereby to let his Lordship know, that the point whereof hee resteth doubtful, is amongst them reduced to a generall resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued certainety; the opinion it selfe what it is indeed,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20039:16"/>
or what it ought to be, in the direct opposition, or (as he presumeth) satisfaction to his Lordship hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready sufficiently debated, and laid downe. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to <hi>cogere assensum</hi> be two; one, that this assertion is founded in the very law of nature, and nations, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is also maintainable by the authoritie, prouidence, and ordinance of our Sauiour Christ: <q>for declaration of his first reason, hee setteth forth, that in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths that are not Christians, all Philosophers, Law-makers, Senators, Councellors, Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and all other sorts of soundest wisedome, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and experience, either Iew, or Gentile, haue from the beginning of the world concurred in this, that God and Nature, hath left sufficient authoritie in euery Common wealth,</q> for the lawfull and orderly full repressing of these euills, euen in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est persons; so what a cloude of witnesses hee hath brought out with one breath, and yet no more for the proofe of his purpose, than the casuall confluence or concourse of <hi>Democritus</hi> his motes, did serue to make solide bodies or concreate substances.

To that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in this Assertion, auouching that GOD and Nature hath left sufficient Authoritie in euery Common-wealth, &amp;c. I pleade ignorance of his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not vnderstanding (except hee meaneth the Creation, in which sense hee should haue said, God in Nature, or by Nature) how God should leaue or institute any such authoritie, but by his reuealed word. I trust hee will not obtrude vnto vs, any long concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or closited Tradition, or any iuggling tricke of Reuelation, and vnwritten Veritie, wherewith the Christian world hath beene so notoriously <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>; and I am sure, that in the written Law of God, there is not any sillable sounding so harshly (or rather horribly) as to giue any order or rule, to dispoyle Princes of their Diadems, or to depose the Anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God. Now for Nature, if shee haue any part in the frame and workemanship of the publique body of the State, as shee hath in the particular and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodies of men, certainely shee hath allowed the like right to the Head of the Common-wealth, as shee hath done to the head of this fleshly Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture. Doeth not the inferiour members, patiently, and without repugnance, beare all the offences and surcharges, descending vpon them from the head? Is there in Nature any so much as desire (much lesse meanes) of remoouing or repressing of the Head? I acknowledge that Medicines are often applyed for the curing of the griefes and diseases of the Head but what more ready course is either deuised in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20039:18"/>
the infirmities and faults of the head, then to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load the annoyances thereof vpon the subiected parts of the body? Will you examine another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the opperation of Nature? Next vnto the body it selfe, is the issue and off-spring of the bodie, what bounds of dutie hath nature made of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren towards the Father? Hath shee left any such Law or libertie, that in any respects the childe may renounce or disclaime his parents? yea, though the father should (as oft as out of iudgement hee doth) cast off or disinherite his sonne? Let vs now but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyingly remember, that the Prince is <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the Father of the Countrey; then will our cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aptly accommodate this similitude in Nature, vnto the dutious dependancy of the Subiect vpon the person of the Soueraigne, with a true naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and recognition of all loue and obedience, hauing from nature (out of the resemblance of these two paternes) no other Law, then <hi>parendi &amp; patiendi.</hi> Where shall we find more representatiue obedience of Natures intentions and operations, then in these originals and fountaines of Loue? Then from what stepdames milke hath hee sucked this impuritie of opinion, That Nature hath left some sufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in euery Common-wealth for the repressing &amp;c. I will not deny but that there be some axioms of Reason, ingrauen in our nature, which perhaps (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not rightly vnderstood) hath occasioned this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and slander against Nature, <hi>Omnis natura est conseruatrix sui quisque sibi melius vult quam alteri, f<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

which as they argue a sense and sting in Nature, to vpholde our owne welfare, to feede our owne humour, to further our owne desires, to hate our enemies and wrong doers; so they must admit the brideling limitation and exposition of reason, which also Nature hath giuen to rule the rest, that all the foresayd priuate, and indiuiduall respeets, must haue no place in the question of our naturall obligation to Superiours, as Fathers, and of our naturall vnion in the communitie of humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for the preseruation whereof, Nature hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined Gouernment, and the Soueraigntie thereof to bee sacred and inuiolable.

            <p n="23">23 Lastly, to bring him home to his rest, and to the ground whereupon hee must reare his foundation, hee must euict by proofe, that the Supreame, Vniuersall, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, Bishop, by force or tenor of any Commission giuen by Christ, and transferred vnto St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and so diriuatiuely and successiuely conueyed ouer to him, may censure, iudge, or depose Princes, taking vppon him the decision of Regall rights, assayling of Subiects from obedience, animating at home rebellion are from abroad invasion, and that vnder protext of aduancing of the Ecclesiasticall regiment of soules, and the good of Catholike Religion.</p>
            <p>This is the highest ladder of the Popes eminency, to the which exaltation, hee cannot otherwise assend then by these stayres and steps, before rehearsed, which must
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20039:24"/>
lead him vp to his lofty consistoriall Chayre: If any of these stayres bee loose and faile him, hee falleth vnreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerably, and shall neuer bee able to assume the power, which hee pretendeth himselfe to bee lawfully possessed of. But when of all these exceptions and interruptions cast in his way, hee can cleare or assure not any one, his presumption in taking so much vppon him, will but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue his all daring boldnesse; and his striking close to the conclnsion, when the premises runne another way will make euen Children to scoffe at the want of judgement in his so great vndertakings.</p>
            <p>By these few indissoluable questions (amongst infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite others) for all the world knoweth what a world of doubts, and what a sea of controuersies, is encompassed in this cause. This <hi>P. R.</hi> or rather <hi>R. P.</hi> (if hee would be better knowne) that would seeme to bee so iudicious in his resolues, and so modest and moderate in his asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, might haue beene put in minde to stay his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in concluding so <hi>Magistraliter,</hi> that case, with his peremptory <hi>est amen,</hi> which hath so many stopps, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and euen breake necke passages, as hath hetherto perplexed, and plunged the whole Alphabet of their owne Authors.</p>
            <p>By that time, that he hath runne through the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and proofe of the particuler difficulties before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, hee will somewhat slacke, the heate of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious affirmations, and to let him know that this poynt, (as wee now propound it and debate it) is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Catholike wrighters themselues, so clearely and generally agreed vppon as hee avoucheth (for hee sayth) that in this there is no difference of opinion, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in any sort of Catholikes whatsoeuer, (so they bee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20039:25"/>
Catholikes) I must remember him (if hee forget not his owne name, yea and his nick-names too,) that in the bitter contentions, and fiery conflicts, betweene the Priests and the Iesuites, a principall matter of their variance was this, That the Priests vtterly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this Turbulent, and Sedicious opinion of the Iesuites.</p>
            <p>That the Pope might and ought to intermeddle in the temporall rights and preheminencies of Princes, and that he had a powre to depose and deiect them at his pleasure. Doth not <hi>William Watson</hi> the Priest in his booke of <hi>quidlibets</hi> bestow a whole Chapter with much earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of spirit, and variety of arguments, vpon this very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, making in the same this <hi>R. P.</hi> the obiect of his scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and revilings? Doth he not in many places of that worke impute all the causes of the many troubles and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities which they vndergoe in <hi>England</hi> to the violent spirits, and treacherous practizings of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who neglecting or despising the Ministeriall function, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come meere Statists, and negotiating factors of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> disturbing the quiet of all Countryes where they be entertained, and working wicked stratagems and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable devices against Soveraigne Princes? Hath hee so soone forgotten, or can hee so bold'y dissemble, in what sort the said Priests vncased and discovered him for his many notorious and scandalous intermedlings in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>? Perhaps he will say that they be no Catholikes, for so he enterposeth (if they be Catholikes) he dareth not to lop away at once so many chiefe lims, so many strong armes, yea such stocks and plants of the popish religion, though the said Priests doe not feare or spare to affirme, that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> are not any certaine order or vocation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20039:25"/>
in the Church, being rather to be reckoned (as their vse and imployment is) to be Lay-men, States-men, busie-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, pragmaticall agents beyond all limits of any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall calling) yet it is necessary, (if he will <hi>constare sibi</hi>) to stand to it, that (seeing they vary from him, in this part of doctrine) they be no Catholikes, because in this refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and refuting of his Majesties distinction of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Papists, he expresly affirmeth, that he that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not all and every Article assented vnto and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the Church, he is not to be accounted Catholike, acording to St. <hi>Augustine. Catholicum</hi> is constered to be <hi>secundum totam,</hi> and not <hi>secundum partem,</hi> I will leaue the Priests to defend that they be better Catholikes then he, notwithstanding this discrepance and my selfe will revert to the parting place where occasion was taken to make this digression.</p>
            <p>There is offered for plea the words of the institution, and the very authenticall enstallment made by Christ himselfe, <hi>Pasce oues me as</hi> which words include (say they) acording to Catholike exposition, not only authority to feede, but to governe also, direct, restraine, cure, represse, and correct when neede is. Allow that these words doe appoint and institute a pastorall charge (which is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall vnderstanding thereof) yet such charge is not thereby more appropriate to <hi>Peter,</hi> then to other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but if they so far tender out the same, to make them beget vnto vs a Pastor, of Pastors, a Bishop, of Bishops, a supreame and soveraigne governor of the whole Church, I may not yeeld their logick such libertie, as to conclude so vnconsequently.</p>
            <p>Againe allow that in this commission and charge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Pastor were required not only to instruct the sheepe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20039:26"/>
of his fold with wholesome doctrine of faith, but also to have an eye to their life and conversation to reprove them, admonish them, and censure them with ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call discipline, what is that to the governing in secular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or to the claime of such an vnlimmited power by the Popes intrusion? I may not yeelde to their Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, such a preuayling or perswading power, as that where they cannot shape so much as a shadow, there they shall erect and create the true substance, of a more then Monarchiall principallity: It is heere auouched, that Catholike exposition includeth within this worde, <hi>Pasce</hi> the commission of gouerning also.</p>
            <p>Therefore many Catholikes that will rather hazard the exclusion of his (if they bee Catholikes) then they will condiscend to this interpretation. A graue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Catholike, one of the pillers of papacy, Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> being to animate and confirme his Holinesse proceedings, against the <hi>Venetians</hi> for their great sinne, of executing Iustice, against men of clericall habit, in causes criminall, and ciuilly punishable, passed ouer this Text of <hi>Pasce,</hi> as not sufficiently seruing the turne, to prooue the Popes right of jurisdiction in such t<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eporall affaires; and thereuppon interpreting and applying the same restrictiuely, to the teaching function, made choyce of a fitter peece of Scripture, to accommodate vnto that case, and to put into the Popes hand, for the justification of that excesse of his authority: Hee maketh the office of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be two-fold, the first of feeding and teaching, comprised in the word, <hi>Pasce,</hi> the other of correcting, and chastifing contayned in the words of Christ, vsed in the vision of the beasts presented to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20039:26"/>
               <hi>Peter, occide et manduca,</hi> kill and eate: You see that hee was content to leaue that leane and pining appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Pasce,</hi> and to finde out a more stinging Text, that might pierce to the very quicke of the cause, doth not this same (<hi>occide et manduca</hi>) giue authority to draw blood, putting the Sword into his Holinesse hand, to execute at his will and pleasure, such as hee shall recon, Beasts without exception of great and small, people or potentates, Is it not made evident thereby that all sorts of people whatsoever, cleane or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, high or low, friend or foe, are as it were tyed and bundled vp together, and so subiected and abiected at his feete, to feed vpon, and satiate his devouring appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites? It maketh no matter for the proper sense of the text, (figuring and signifying <hi>Iew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi>) the wrest and streine thereof serveth best to his purpose, cutting even to the core of this question.</p>
            <p>Old Father <hi>Barronius</hi> in his dreame, espied more then young S. <hi>Peter</hi> could apprehend by vision: He hath found and inferred out of that place, that which St. <hi>Peter</hi> if hee lived to this day (except his successors did teach him) could never have gessed at, the Excommunication, and further degradation of States and Soueraignes. In the same his encoraging advice to his Holinesse (which I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recount, because it so evenly matcheth with their moderne divinity) hee stirreth vp the fainting spirit of the Pope with a <hi>Memento te positum esse in Petram,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou art placed for Rocke, whosever rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against thee shall be crushed all to peeces. Therefore where his Holinesse layeth a heavie hand to his fulmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting censures, there no resistance, rescue, or reliefe, can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile to defend from destruction. For this Prophesie is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20039:27"/>
as fitly appliable to the Viear of Christ, as it was directly and properly referred to Christ himselfe.</p>
            <p>Thus this learned Cardinall bestowed vpon his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as he were the very image and character of Christ vpon earth the self-same attribute, and exaggeration vsed in scripture, to set forth the might and dignity of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Nay further, hee will needs comfort the Pope with the application of that to his person in perticuler, which Christ assured to his whole Church in generall, that the gates of hell shall not prevaile against him, and will earthly Princes then persume to shut his Holinesse out of dores? Hee that hath a power over Hell it selfe, shall not he commaund and over-rule the earth? These beeing the proude and prophane conceits which they have of that Idoll of <hi>Rome</hi> (their imagined Lieutenant of Christ) they draw not only from the Spouse of Christ the rich ornaments of her glory to deck that bewitching Harlot with, but also hold it no robberie, to enrobe the man of sinne with the gracefull and blessed titles of the Sonne of God, for which so Luciferian and blasphemous arrogatings, I doubt it will not be made good and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the gates of hell shall not be shut against him. I must confesse, that I like better of the simplicitie of our mitigator, in misliking vpon the poore probability of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son picked out of the word (<hi>Pasce</hi>) and that rather by a consequence, then by any direct induction, then I doe of the affected and vnserchable subtilty of this Cardinall, and some others, who studying for vnwonted straynes, and forcings, doe cast beyond the Moone to magnifie or dignifie his Holinesse aboue the Sunne, I will be bold to set downe some more of these deepe digged and far-fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched argum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ets, not with any purpose to vouchsafe them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20039:27"/>
any time, or paines for answere, but euen to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, if not exclaime at the impious and presump tuous absurdity, of such their so frivolous and most strange inferences; Pope <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the eight (that layd the first stone of this <hi>Babilonian</hi> building) out of the words of Christ vnto his Disciples, in the twenty two of St. <hi>Luke</hi> (they sayd vnto him, behold here are two Swords, Christ answered it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.)</p>
            <p>By these two Swords (sayth <hi>Boniface</hi>) Christ meaneth the spirituall and temporall, both the which are left by our Sauiour, for the defence and preseruation of his Church; and because there would be no order, but mutiny, tumult, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, if these swords should not well agree, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must needes be employed, and intended by Christ, a subjection, and subalteration of the one sword vnto the other, and both depending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Supreame Command.</p>
            <p>From this supposed authority of Christs lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and recommending both Swords vnto his Church, <hi>Boniface</hi> tooke vppon him the power of both Swords, and caused to be passed as an Article of Faith that the Pope is supreame, ouer both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, spirituall and temporall, and shortly after in a <hi>Iubile,</hi> publikly shewed himselfe, with a key in one hand, and a sword in the other.</p>
            <p>And that hee may the better maintaine, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the sword, hee further argueth, that one of the swords, was his prodecessors St. <hi>Peters</hi> sword, (it being well knowne that <hi>Peter</hi> had a sword; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20039:28"/>
Christ sayd vnto him put vp thy sword (shall I neede to make any refutation of this collection, or assertion? being declared not as positiue out of the word, but expository, by a sence which the Pope assumeth? Let me yet gather vp this note by the way, that it was good fortune, that Christ did command St. <hi>Peter</hi> to put vp his sword, else per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the sharpenesse and weight thereof, had long since light vppon the heads, and neckes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well as it cut off the eare of <hi>Malchas:</hi> for the same pretence which occasioned him to draw vppon <hi>Malchas</hi> in rescue and maintainance of his Maister Christ might incite the high courages of his supposed successors to bee as actiue with their blades and forces, for the support and furtherance (as they alledge) of the Christian faith and religion, impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or impeached by temporall Potentates. I would now know of Maister <hi>P. R.</hi> whether hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth the exposition and decree of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the Pope, to bee Catholike and Orthodoxall, if hee doe not, wee also will take (by his example) the like liberty of acceptance or dislike in any the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, concluded and adiudged by his Holinesse: If hee doe, then what neede hee bee so slye and mistrustfull in affirming the same Doctrine, absolueth also, without any distinctions and cooling quallifications, as if hee were either ashamed of confession or afraid of conviction? when hee hath such an argument <hi>ab authoritate</hi> to a rest him to stand vnto it? Why should hee (I say) runne about the bush, with a Commission direct and indirect,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20039:28"/>
when hee cannot but know that <hi>Bonifacius</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in opinion, that his power ouer Princes, and in temporallities was absolute without any oblique consequence, or respectiue dependency, jumping therein plainly, and fully with the Canonists, <hi>Papa est Dominus totius orbis directe in temporalibus.</hi> How would this so well tempered and timorous mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor bee brought to iustifie the hautinesse of Pope <hi>Clament</hi> the fifth, successor to <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> who not satisfied with the rule and command ouer temporall and earthly states, did brauely adventure, by his papall Bull, expressely to enioyne, and command Angels to execute his will: Me thinketh I should aske him also whether hee will hold consonancy of iudgement with his owne Country-man, and good friend the renowned Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> who in his Appology for the English Catholikes, out of the miraculous working of St. <hi>Peter</hi> mentioned in the fifth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> of sentencing to suddaine death <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> doth no lesse miraculously wring out this great Ministery of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, censuring, and other proceedings against Princes.</p>
            <p>There is no parcell of Scripture wherein any mention is made of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but if it can be rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to affoord them any patterne or patronship for either their deedes or decrees, it is miserably torne, and tormented to vndergoe that seruice: Not so much as the power of Keyes; but it must needes bee made a picke locke, to possesse prisons, Castles, and Towers: The Key of knowledge for the sauing of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20039:29"/>
soules, is turned to a Key of powre to deprive Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the binding and loosing of sinnes, is but a very legerdemaine of fast and loose at the Popes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the fishing for men to bring them to eternall life, is made a pretence for spreading his nets, to catch and conquer whole States and Dominions: The Pastorall Sheep-hooke, subdueth Kingly Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Saint <hi>Peters Aurum &amp; argentum non habeo,</hi> doth now glitter in all the pompious and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous varietye of riches, and the promise of Christ, <hi>Dabo tibi claues regni caelorum,</hi> is not so much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, as the offer of the Devill, <hi>Dabo tibi &amp;c.</hi> All these things will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship mee.</p>
            <p>If the Pope will needs enioy a right of succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all that Christ sayd vnto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> let him not refuse also (Get thee behinde mee Sathan,) and, O thou of little faith.

            <p>Christ refused to be made a Iudge in a Civill or Temporall cause, the Pope maketh himselfe Iudge of any debates, that by any pretext can be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

to be fit for his cognizance: Christ bad, Giue vnto Caesar that which was Caesars: The Pope rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Cesar, of his treasure, of his honor, of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, of his rights, and of his subiects.

R.</hi> is much cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, and put to his shift, to finde out an even cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting distinction, to saue the repugnancye of Christs sayings. The Canonists, and some other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, out of these words, All power is given vnto mee in Heaven and in Earth, doe conclude, that besides his Spirituall government of our Soules, he hath a kingly Dominion also vppon our bodies and goods, and vppon all the Kingdomes of the earth, and might iustly haue exercised all actions, of temporall iurisdictions, as casting into prison, appoynting new Offices, Kings, and great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narckes.</p>
            <p>Marke how they compell our Sauiour Iesus Christ to sallogize against himselfe? All power is giuen to mee in Heauen and in Earth, but my Kingdome to bee of this World is such a power, <hi>Ergo,</hi> my Kingdome is of this same World.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Now obserue also his witty and substantiall reconcilement, hee had a Kingly temporall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in this life, but hee renounced the vse and

priuiledge of the same: Or thus, hee had no direct Dominion vppon temporall things, yet indirectly, for preseruation of his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Dominion hee had and might haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the same, and in that sence left it to his successour: Is not this most shamelesse, and direct abusing of Christ, and his most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Word?</q> When hee sayd at another time, that the Foxes had holes, and the Birds of the Ayre had nests, but the Sonne of man, had no place to hide his head: If these expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors had then beene knowne to his Apostles, they would haue replyed; Sir, you haue places of refuge, but you renounce the vse and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge thereof, or albeit you haue not any place directly, yet indirectly for the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your function, you haue all palces at your Command, or if you haue not in your owne indiuiduall person, yet in your Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, you must needes haue, else how should they maintayne the hauing and inhabiting of such Royall and Magnificent edifices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they keepe such stately and more then impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Courts?</p>

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:20039:31"/>To manifest yet more discerningly, the idlenesse, the fraude, and vnfit applying of this distinction, let them know, that is not to be trusted vnto, because it will serue their adversaries as well as themselues, for where the question may be propounded and disputed, whether temporall Princes may suppresse or remooue Popes, (if the authorities alleadged out of Gods Word, and the Histories of the Church shall not suffice to giue in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for any such direct and vndoubted preheminence in Princes) then we may make bold of this their make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shift distinction, that Princes haue euer had such a power annexed, and proper to their governing charge, though they haue forborne the vse and preuiledge thereof, or that indirectly and by consequence (for the vpholding of their states, and keeping of their people in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which by so many Popish practises is dayly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted) they may and ought to exercise and execute the same.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let it be examined, how and from what originall this distinction draweth his pedigree, what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some or heate did first hatch it, and what causes of weight doth still nourish and continue the same, Mr. <hi>P.

<q>For if Christ (sayth he) should not haue left such an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his Church for remedy of vrgent causes, hee should not haue sufficiently provided for the necessity thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is maruaile that this our Moderator, and mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mittigator did not vse the word of conveniency, in the stead of necessity, to haue avoyded the disadvantage of the stricktnesse of that word, can there (concerning the subsistance, and stability of the Church) any more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20039:32"/>
vrgent causes to be imagined for the vpholding thereof, then there was in the first times of the primitiue purity? or is the vsurping power of the supreame Pastor, his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer awing or over peering of Princes, his correcting and repressing of them, by alienating subiects, and egging enemies against them any constitutiue causes or essentiall necessities of the Church? I will not deny but that the height and eminency, wherevnto the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> haue aspired, by encroching vpon the rights and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the states of temporall Gouernors, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede to be provided for, and maintayned by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed necessity: But the purity, the poverty, the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, the feruency, of the first fathers, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators of the faith and Church of Christ needed none of these humaine and worldly additaments, none of these temporall encountrings, or conflicting with Potentates, no such foreseeing perpecations, to affront all occurting causes, nor any such politiciall circumventings, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications for defence and offence against Princes: They conquered powers and principalities, but with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Armor of God, they beate vppon them with the hammer of the word, they cut deeply into the secrets of their soules, with the sword of the spirit they prayed for their peace, and prosperity, they embrased the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry persecutions with obedience, and for the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing fauours, (by giuing them respit from affliction, and the sunne shine of liberty) they honoured them as the nursing fathers of the Church, (when I contemplate the composute and frame of the Popish Monatchy, and the linking together of so many cunningly contrived positions, tending (all of them) to the encrease of gaine and advance of Honor to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> I wish that some excellent Scholler extraordinarily endued
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20039:32"/>
would out of his many obseruations collected, exhibite vnto the world (in imitation of <hi>Matchauell,</hi> who made the shames and vices of the house of <hi>Florence,</hi> the patterne of a perfite Prince) this Antichrist of <hi>Rome</hi> as a true pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of Tyranny and Vsurpation by publishing with an apt resemblance, as well the vilde and vnchristian practises, as also the false and pernicious articles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath atchived so strange matters, and attained vnto so vnmeasurable greatnesse, which my desire is the more increased, the more I consider, how the webs of that worke, hath ensuared, if not enthralled Christian people, euen in the carriage of this controversie. I haue traced the foot-steps of many politicke reaches, and now in the closing vp of the matter, a faire traine is layd, to catch and lay hold vpon an easie follower, which we must not so suddenly passe by, as not to discerne the sleight thereof, he speaketh plainely in honest and oyly words: <q>That that authority temporal is to be moderated by many perticularities to be considered, There must be iust cause, graue and vrgent motives, formall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, great deliberation, lawfull meanes, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, to concurre, requiering great discretion;</q> what a goodly displaying he maketh, in tearmes of the best shew, when yet (howsoeuer occasins shall alter their intentions) there is no more conteyned or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded thereby, then what is vsually requisite in all Benches of Iustice, erected for tryall of common rights, But our question is, Whether the Pope be a competent Iudge, vpon or against Temporall Gouernours, let the matter be caried neuer so presizely and circumspectly, that maketh him no title for enterposing his vsurped Authority. Therefore hee might well haue spared his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20039:33"/>
paines, in making this the third question which neither in this, nor any other iudiciall power is any question at all. But he conceived, that this orderly course and discrect cariage which hee would haue vs to presuppose in the Pope, would carry vs along in all conformity, to condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to any his presumptious and vsurping iurisdiction. Let him tell whether the publicke denunciation, or rather execration made euery Maundee Thursday against the Hereticks whatsoeuer, doth not also enwrap the Princes of our religion (especially if they haue made and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted feuere lawes against the Popish) within the danger and rigor of that sentence, which if it do, then these flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and superfluous words, of the cognition of the cause, of due proceedings, of vrgent motiues, of aduised consultations, of lawfull meanes of preambles and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances are but snares to beguile the simple, seeing that his Holinesse (for the most part) acteth his solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ceremonies of Excommunication, both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and personally, without the obseruing of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities. Beyond all this the pondering of such seuerall considerations, to whose brest, or trust are they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended? are they not euery one wholly and absolutely in the Popes discretion? Let vs but remember the course of proceedings by these perticularities, against our late Queene, his Holinesse tooke knowledge, as well by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke fame, as by complayning relacions, of the afflicted and distressed Catholikes, and of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> hard vsage of them in this Kingdome, there is the vrgent motive and importing cause, what were the consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what the meanes, and what the proceedings, a Bull of Excommunication publickly deprived her, of her Royall Dignity, setteth free her Subiects from their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20039:33"/>
enioyneth all Catholikes to endeavor her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, and so exposeth her to continuall Treasons, and bloody Assassinates; This is the short Epitome of this all presuming Papacy, Then let any other Prince take to himselfe the like scantling, by the measure offered to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (bethinking himselfe whether the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeration of so many good poynts, of aduisednes, and the cautilous respects set forth by glosing words, may sufficiently secure him from feares and iealousies. One o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt (of great consequence and preiudice) may much perplex Princes, which is the vndistinguished and vnlimited nature of the causes, triable by the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for what cause can be supposed so meerely Ciuill, as hath not some mixture of cases in Conscience, and so to be referred in order to a spirituall end, becomming (as in that regard) of a spirituall cognizance. And then his Holinesse (holding himselfe onely in his owne element) beeing the supreame Iudge in spirituall doubts, how extendable is the amplitude of his power to any manner of debates or variences, which (by complaint or appeale) vnder a colour of devotion or religion shall be presented to his holy decision? But the deadliest poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that lyeth in the Dragons Tayle, is the disposition and ordination of the meanes, of giuing to such Popes Iudgements, the full blow of execution.</p>
            <p>For where the spirituall blast of his indignation, is not much regarded, there (as the inferior rout of the Clergy, doth) his holinesse will not sticke to implore the ayde of the secular arme, be it forraine, be it domesticall, be it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for the same cause, or indirectly (I am in loue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I am induced to beleeue, that they haue some direct Commission, or some indirect incitation so to compell and precipitate their ill gouerned mindes, into the horror of so vild an action: Neverthelesse, I may not dissemble, that concerning any priuate exployts, in this kinde, they disclayme the approbation thereof; though I am well assured, that experience to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doth make it manifest, that they dissemble. This authority (sayth this our satisfying mittigator) doth not onely not allow the wicked and vnlawfull attempts of priuate men, but also doth expressely and publickely condemne the same, as in the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> the wicked article of lawfull killing of Princes, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men (holding them Tyrants) is rejected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
            <p>Euery man seeth how resolued a case he maketh it, both by the Catholicke Divines, and by the Cannon of the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> that no priuate attempts though of neuer so magnanimous a spirit against the life of a Prince, though neuer so much tainted with Tyranny, insuffieiency, infidellity, or heresie can be in any sort iustifiable.</p>
            <p>But that it may the better be knowne, that these be but fallacious and gay-coated words, <hi>Ad faciendum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum,</hi> I will (for bearing any mine owne refutations, encounter and contradict this smoothing <hi>P. R.</hi> with one of his owne fellow Iesuites, that goeth more roundly,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20039:34"/>
and plainly to this poynt: Such a one as whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed his skill and faculty, with any mischiefeuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to animate wicked enterprises, (for his Booke was Printed about the very time of our last so memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plots of Treason) my charity will suspend my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he casteth no colours, nor feareth to deliuer bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his resolutions, and encouragements to all Catholikes. It is <hi>Iohannes Mariana,</hi> a Spaniard and Iesuite, and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity Reader, his Booke is intituled, <hi>De Rege et Regis institutione,</hi> published in the the yeare 1605. Dedicated to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and printed <hi>Per missu superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> yea and <hi>Regia authoritate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Mr. <hi>P. R.</hi> will allow this great Scholler, comming foorth <hi>in lucem et oculos hominum,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with such estate of attending approbations, to be a Catholike, hee shall heare him speake, and then set him blame his temerity, for telling tales out of the Iesuiticall Schoole. The sixe Chapter of his first Booke, is wholy bestowed vpon this question, of the lawfulnesse of deposing or slaying Tyrants. The particularity of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the French King is argued, the reasons on both sides produced, pondered and enforced: His determination decideth, and adjudgeth the fact to haue beene just, prayse worthy, and agreeable to the Catholicke grounds.</p>
            <p>He further setteth foorth, the receiued opinion of the Church, to be that it is lawfull for Subiects, when the King resuseth to be reformed, and after sentence against him, to renounce their Obedience, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult for the leuying of a necessary Warre, to taxe the people, with the charge thereof, and with armed force and weapons, (in such case of necessitie) to

And to the foresaid Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> (which is produced to impugne this position of the practises, or attempts of private men against lawfull Soveraignes) hee also maketh answere in this manner, First, that no Decree of any Councell standeth good and holy, without the consent of his Holinesse thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Then, that this Decree was neuer approved by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the 5th, neither would <hi>Eugenius</hi> or his successors euer ratifie the same, and after declareth also, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that assembly did chiefly intend that their Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and consultation against the <hi>Hussits</hi> who maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that Princes, for crimes by them committed, did forfeit their estate, and that thereupon they might lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be by any man deprived of that power which they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly held, or obteined. Againe, that in perticuler and properly, they then purposed to opugne the proposition of <hi>Iohannes Parvus,</hi> a Divine of <hi>Paris,</hi> who vnder colour of this defence, that it was lawfull by private authority to kill a Tirant, endeavored to justifie the fact of the Duke of <hi>Burgundie</hi> in slaying of the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> In which case there were these diversities from that rule. Here was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20039:35"/>
betweene these persons equallitie, and no inferioritie, there was a solemne oath violated and broken, and here was no attending for the sentence, or direction of the Superior. Here we see two Iesuites in two different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in a matter of greatest moment, both of them founding vpon the faith of the Church, both approved <hi>permissu superiorum</hi> by the allowance of the superiors. Thus hauing buckled together two principall Iesuites to lugg and tugg each other by the eares, I will only thus far giue my verdit of their variance, That the Spanierd <hi>Mariana</hi> dealeth plainly and constantly to the practize of Popery, and the ratificacions and afirmacions of the Popes themselues, who will not endure any abridging of their prerogatiue power of proceeding against Princes in what sort soeuer, And our English <hi>P. K.</hi> hideth the sting, would conceale deepe dissembled treacheries by protesting termes to secure vs from suspicions, till the venome of malice hath pierced all the veines of the state, and seazed our very hart and life-blood, by surprizes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of, hauing brought vs into a carelesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull securitie; <hi>P. R.</hi> hath beene very curious and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in trying, and examining his aduersaries allegacions, interpretacions, falsificacions, translacions, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, seeming so watchfull and diligent in that kind of animaduersion, as if he accounted it a shame, and foile, to omit any line or sillable vnanswered, for indeede, the whole bulke of his booke in this businesse, is fraught with no other stuffe then with such wrangling matter, of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avouching, and misconsterings of quoted allegacions. But that it may appeare how his deadly hooke resting in the beliefe of his heart, is covered over with an honied bait beguiling vs with fairer speach, I shall be bold to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20039:36"/>
trouble him with one question.</p>
            <p>What is the cause that Mr. <hi>Mortons</hi> publication, of the solemne Oration made by the Pope <hi>Xixtus</hi> the 5. in the Consistory of the Cardinalls, in the commendation of the notable, rare, and memorable act of the braue Monke that killed the French King, and the inferrence by him made and vrged against the Pope, for his maintenance of Conspiracy, and Treason, is both by the modrate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer first, and after, by this mitigating replier layed aside in silence, and not once handied, or glanced at by any seeming answer. The truth is, they were enwrapped with a dilemna to allow the fact was against their pretence in their position, and to disallow the Pope, was against their faith in their religion they must defend by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, what for outward carriage is giuen them in charge, sith it tendeth to their aduantagious purpose: and they may not (without dispensation) either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to censure, or vndertake to oppugne, what his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse approveth, lest they betray and shake the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of their Supremacy. By this time, I trust his well cloaked dubble iniquity is discovered to his very naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; were it not now very strange that hee and I (whom our former contencions haue so farr devided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funder) should part reconciled, and well accorded?  In his sixt Chapter (of corruptions and falsificacions) hee taketh hold of Mr. <hi>Morions</hi> exposition, That the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and Kingly Authority in Spirituall causes, reacheth no farther then as to outward preservation, and not to personall administration: <q>Hereupon he assureth vs, that if this be really ment, all the Catholikes of <hi>England</hi> will presently take the oath of Supremacy, requiring with an earnest challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge that as this is publikely printed, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20039:36"/>
that by Authority, so it may have publike allowance &amp; performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to make it good, whereby as touching that poynt there may be an attoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</q>  I feare that the man in the heate of his sudden apprehension, and without the wary consideracion which his pen hath been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed vnto, doth overshoote and forget himselfe. Shall I thinke that he hath never read, or vtterly forgotten the Oath of Supremacy? He hath so scanned and canvased the Statutes of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, and Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> picking at every mote thereof, and making a beame of the same (though with a left eye, and a left hand) that I cannot so much as surmize but that he hath had every threed of this question betweene his fingers. Therefore (if his former subtillity hath not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly betrayed him, and exposed him to derision) as I must admire that he is so easily reformed in Iudgement, so, I shall be content to embrace the occasion of a well gained agreement. And will <hi>P. R.</hi> the Iesuite, and the rest of the English Catholikes of the Romish faction abide by this word in good earnest? that if the Kings Maiestie doe not claime or assume vnto him personall administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in cause Ecclesiasticall, the Oath of Supremacy shall no further be stood vpon, or refused. Then let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke himselfe of this part or clause of the Oath, That no forraigne Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate, hath or ought to haue any iurisdiction, power, superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, preeminence, or authority Ecclesiasticall, or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall within this Realme, if he digest this, then see how one thing draweth on another: all our former differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are at once, and in this one compounded: also, for if the Pope (being a forraigne Prelate or Potentate) be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, from hauing any Ecclesiasticall power or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20039:37"/>
authority within this Realme. Then our question of his preheminency or jurisdiction in repressing the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant and pernicious excesse of great men, as an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Iudge, or Supreame Pastor, direct, or indirect, is at an end clearely determined: I doubt not but his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majesty of his Princely care to bring home so many lost sheepe, and to bosome them againe in his dearest loue, will affoord them that fauorable interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which this there Aduocate and Orator, requireth in their behalfe.</p>
            <p>In the meane space (not to loose what we haue got) I returne vnto <hi>P. R.</hi> the like charge of making good of his word, touching the Oath of Supremacy, in the sence and distinction afore mentioned, and therewithall might thinke it not reasonable, any further to stricke a yeelding aduersary, that by so voluntary an offer cleareth the cause from any further controuersie.</p>
            <p>But remembring the nature and quallity of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary and the many winding and intricaking trickes he is vsed vnto in the canvassing of this or the like contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, I feare that this our reconciliation is rather see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming then substanciall, and will suddainly vpon a small touch, fall a sunder againe to as great a discrepance; for howsoeuer he doth so franckly yeeld vnto his Majesty, a supremacy, of the Church in Ecclesiasticall causes, as touching outward preseruation onely, let him be but sifted a little in his meanings, it will breake from him that he neuer purposed to strengthen the state and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our Soueraigne, with any such power of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute defence and protection, which shall presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by ministring vnto him some few questions: I pray you Sir, what Church, and what Ecclesiasticall causes,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20039:37"/>
doe you consent to be within the Kings Royall preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? is it incident and appropriate to his Princely Scepter, to mayntaine the religion now established in his Dominions? by making Lawes for enforcing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to an vniforme allowance, and profession thereof, by punishing Recusants according to Iustice, and by employing all his powers to suppresse the oppugners, or Conspirators against the same? Dareth he to abide by this? will he henceforth justifie this preseruation, and that by his religious oath, which hitherto the impoy-soned pens of these Iesuited spirits haue not spared odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to tearme a cruell persecution? wee haue shaked him already from his attonement, with vs in this poynt, He will tell vs plainely, That the Church and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall cause which he authorized the Prince to protect and preserue, is onely the Catholike Church, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and then (as if <hi>orbs,</hi> and <hi>vrbs,</hi> were all one) that the Catholike is the Romish, so that vnlesse the King will turne Leigeman, with a kinde of vazilage to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> his right of Supremacy in the outward preseruation of the Church, (which this man dareth assure vs that all Catholikes in <hi>England</hi> will easily accord vnto) must be denied him, as not due and proper to the Title of his Regality, Papacy is the pole-starre of all their contemplations, It is the Centure whereunto are carried and cleaueth fast all their drifts and disputations. And no further shall any Prince hold power (especially, in Ecclesiasticall causes which are all bosomed vp in the breast of his Holinesse) then the same shall serue in a sub-ordination to the advancing and exaltation of that most imperious Romish Hyerarcy.</p>
            <p>Nay their temporall authority, also must be kitbed,

What if the very same Author who so boldly assumeth and assureth at this time for all Catholikes the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20039:39"/>
Title of Spirituall Supremacy, to appertayne to the Crowne Imperiall of this Land, doth after in another set Treatise, published purposedly, or rather malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, to traduce and discredit our gouernment, and to vphold the Popes and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> censures concerning the Oath of Allegiance, like a very Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, fall quite away from this his former so earnestly pro ferred and promised conformity, declareth himselfe, to be so farre from affoording his Majesty by oath his supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of preseruation in causes Ecclefiasticall, as that he holdeth it vnlawfull for a Catholike conscience to take the oath of Temporall Allegiance, as repugnant to the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> will not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of vnderstanding admire, how the same person can refuse to sweare Allegiance Temporall, that hath so readily and hotly, granted a Supremacy Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuail?</p>
            <p>To induce me to beleeue that it is all one person that hath so vndertaken to act vnto vs two so repugnant parts, I haue (besides fame and report) and a kind of idempnity in the phrase and stile, some very approveable probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <note place="margin">A Letter of a Catholike Gentleman touching the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, Fol. 67.</note> his mencioning of the powder-treason in these weake and tender tearmes, of that headlong action of a few Catholike Gentlemen, and such other lamenting spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for the euill cariage, or miscarying of the enterprise without any one apt or right expressing word to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate or condemne the foulenesse thereof, is certainely moulded with the soft hand of this our countersetting kind-hearted mitigator, his shaping and propounding of the generall question concerning the Popes authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Princes, is conceaved even in the same words which this P.

                  </note> Oath of allegiance to deny simply and absolutely, That the Pope as supreme Pastor of the Catholike Church hath any authority left him by Christ, either directly or indirectly, with cause or without cause, in neuer so great a necessitie, or for neuer so great and publike vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Christian religion, to proceede against any Prince whatsoever, temporally, for his restraint or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</q> Is not this the very same water of the same Cesterne? He yet goeth further for better proofe and confirmacion of his said supposall by the selfe-same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons set forth <hi>Verbatim:</hi> 
               <q>for that they should thereby contradict the generall consent of all Catholike Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and confesse that Gods providence for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servacion and preservacion of his Church and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vpon earth, hath beene defectuous, for that hee should haue left no lawfull remedy for so great and  ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive an evill as that way might fall out.</q> I had set the print of my fingers vpon all and every of these words before, so that by that brand they were presently knowne vnto mee, and their Author or owner apparantly discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, howsoever as a Iesuite he stileth himselfe <hi>Gent.</hi> who bound to no order may assume any shape.</p>
            <p>Then presupposing vpon these likelyhoods, that in the pursute of this my slippery adversary (Iesuite or <hi>Gent.</hi>) I haue met with him againe as at a new turning, I must not let him escape vntill hee make mee a good answere, how he can affirme for the King a Supremacy Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall for preserving of the Church, and yet alledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the oath of allegiance a more supreame power in the Pope, to suppresse and annihilate that Supremacy,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20039:40"/>
and that in a course of Temporall Supereminency? I ever tooke Supremacy to be such a superlative, as admitteth no superior: I never heard of any subalternate suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it hath too harsh and absurd a sound; but that any temporall Prince absolute of himselfe, vndependent vppon any higher on earth, immediate to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should be over-awed or over-topped by the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded primacy of a Luciferian Prelate, and that by the brandishing of a temporall sword, and imploying for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, coercians temporall, what can be more vnsensible to be conceaved, more vnreasonable to be maintayned, or more impious to be practized?</p>
            <p>Yet the only cause and couler why the Pope comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and the Cardinall adviseth, the Catholikes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to forbeare and refuse to take the oath of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is this, <q>That in the said oath is couched and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the derogation, and renunciation of the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and absolutenesse of the Popes authority over or against his Majestie, claymed by vertue of his high of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of supreame Pastor, whereby he is enabled to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against any Prince whatsoever temporally for his restraint and amendement, or to permit other Princes to do the same: </q> So that the question of the lawfulnesse of this oath, and the question argued in these few leaves of my labor concerning the Popes arrogant Vsurpation, hath not any threed of difference sorting both alike to one and the same purpose. Therefore if vnto my former refutation of the Mittigators, immoderate attribution of power vnto the Pope, I shall ioyne some few animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercions vpon the epistoling Gentlemen: also (an <hi>alter idem</hi> of <hi>P. R.</hi>) for the better observing and discovering of his deceitfull and disloyall cariage, in the reproving of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20039:40"/>
that oath, it will be a continuance of the same skirmish, and the like battering of the same bulwarke which the pride of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erected and endeavoreth to fortifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the dignity of Kings and the truth of God.</p>
            <p>First I observe that howsoever he vndertaketh in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall tearmes to make good the Popes desision touching the refusall of that oath on the part of his Maiesties Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes subiects, yet in his perticuler arguing thereupon, (as if he were also another Pope, whom as a iudge, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth not to dispute) he discusseth not the severall parts to be disliked in the oath, or setteth forth plainly and contradictorily the words which hee will hold or maintaine to be vnlawfull or cumbersome to the sque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish conscience of their pretended Catholikes, whereby a true state or issue of the matter in question might be taken in consideration, but in stead of such expresse and positiue mentioning of the disliked parts of that oath, glideth away in his glosing fashion wiht bare affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dangerous doctrinall clauses, conteining matter of faith craftely conioyned together, with the exacting of civill duty, preiudiciall to the integritie and purity of Catholike religion.</p>
            <p>This kind of handling a controuersie, is rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing then reasoning, and more Pope like in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining as a Iudge, then Scholler like in demonstrating as a Disputer: Why doth hee not to euery branch, of the sayd oath affixe and oppose his negatiue, without any such faynt plea, or fumbling and broken speeches, cut of with &amp;c. Will the distinction of direct, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct, as he maketh it to serue the Pope for actions and authorities, so serue his turne also in speaking and argumenting? standeth it with any Logicall rules, to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20039:41"/>
induce or inforce conclusions, indirectly by conception and application, which ought to be produced directly, in a full opposition to the questioned proposition.</p>
            <p>Then where the oath hath these plaine words, that the Pope hath not any power or authority to depose the King, or to dispose any his Maiesties Kingdomes, or Dominions, or to authorize any Forraigne Prince to invade or annoy him in his Countries, or to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge any of his Subjects from their allegiance and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Maiesty, or to giue Licence or leaue to any of them to beare Armes, rayse Tumults, or to offer any violence, or hurt to his Majesties Royall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, state, or government, why doth not he in justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vnlawfulnesse of this oath, by as playne, full, and broade termes, tell vs that the Pope, by the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his omnipotency, is indued with so plenary a power, as that he may depose the King, dispose his Kingdomes, authorize Forraigne invasions, discharge his Subjects from allegiance, licence them to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to his Royall Person, state, or gouernment? And that for that regard the conscience of the Catholikes may not be obliged by any such prophane oath, impy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous against the Pope, and the amplitude of his Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall primacy? But doth hee in any-one line of his whole Volume, let slippe any word expressely declaring, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or mentioning any power of this nature, and that Lawfully may produce these effects, to be invested or bestowed vpon his Holinesse? I am perswaded that the <hi>igniculi</hi> of naturall duty, the <hi>morsus</hi> of an acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging conscience, and the <hi>pudor</hi> of his face (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps yet retayneth some remnants of modesty) would not suffer him so far to degenerate from naturall notions,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20039:41"/>
so farre to be alienated from his dutious recognicion, or so farre to passe all the bonds of shame, as directly, and roundly to deliuer vnto the World any sentence so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous, and so full of horror and heynousnesse.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse hee hath taken such a taste of the sower grape of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is dipped so deepe into the venome and malice of that imperious and persecuting Church, as that yet indirectly, and by a subtile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance of his meaning, hee giueth vs to vnderstand, that his inward soule, hath pronounced this doome and judgement against his annoynted Soueraigne, and therefore that soule, must not be entangled, stayed, or bound, by any brideling or restrayning oath to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But how doth his outward man manage these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties? Iust in the same manner to an hayres breadth, as Mr. <hi>Mittigator</hi> (whom hee may call his <hi>ille ego</hi>) doth that is closly, dissemblingly, timorously, and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously: In the place of the Pope, hee vseth the entitle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Supreame Pastor, the deposing and killing of Princes, hee compriseth, and couereth vnder the words of proceeding against, and restrayning of them, what is done by inuasion, insurrection, or force of armes, is included in the word temporalty, the stirring vp and appoynting of other Potentates, to partake, in the quarrell, is brought in very gently in this good shew of permitting other Princes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now fie vppon this blaunching and disguising Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, If hee could passe away cleanly with these easie and fauouring phrases, hee would steale out against vs, (as not suspecting his harmefull intentions) his deadly writ of execution: This one word of restrayning would
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20039:42"/>
(like to a ball of wild-fire) disclose it selfe, and breake a sunder, into censuring, depriuing, deposing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying, and murthering of Soueraignes, and would haue no meane, or end of oppression or Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Next, admitting him to this liberty, as not to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out any speciall, or particular clauses of the oath, let vs examine how hee prooueth that there bee enwrapped within the sayd oath, poynts of religion as well as of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> obedience; he maketh reckoning to haue shewed it by foure seuerall distinct wayes: I will beare him wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that the wayes be seuerall; for onely one of them hath shewe of leading vs to the scope and conclusion fore-intended, the rest are all straggling pathes, quite from the purpose, for are not these I pray you good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments? <q>The <hi>Pope</hi> telleth the Catholikes that hee hath heard, that they are compelled to go to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Assemblies of Heretickes, and to be at their Sermons, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the oath of Allegiance contayneth matter of Religion, as well of ciuill obedience. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> compareth the oath to the crafty composion and commixture of the Images of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Iulian,</hi> and the <hi>Pomim</hi> gods, all coupled and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together in this Imperiall banner:</q> 
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> by an argument <hi>ab authoritate,</hi> there be in that oath poynts Spirituall and Temporall conjoyned together.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the good Gentleman doth kindly make this reall offer for satisfaction of his Majesty, that hee will sweare vnto him, as much Loyalty as euer any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Subject of <hi>England</hi> did, vnto the lawfull Kings in former times before the change of King <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there lurketh articles of sayth in the sayd oath, vnder the pretence of ciuill duties. The first of the foure, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20039:42"/>
to shute faire, and and at the least to sticke in the  <q>Butt, though farre enough from the marke; and thus it speaketh, from the plaine expresse words, sence, and drift of the oath it selfe, That besides the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Soueraigne to be true King and rightfull Lord ouer all his Dominions; and that I will be a true loyall Subject vnto him and such other clauses, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at no man sticketh or maketh any difficulty, the sayd oath contayneth further, that I must sweare in like manner some poynts, concerning the limitation of the Popes authority, to wit, what hee cannot doe towards his Majesty, or his Successour in any case whatsoeuer? Which question brought vnto the <hi>Thesis</hi> of all Kings toucheth (sayth he) a poynt of Doctrine and Catholike beliefe, concerning the sufficiency of of Pastorall authority, left by our Saviour in his Church vnto St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Successours, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing of all inconueniences that may fall out; and this to forsweare hath perill of euerlasting Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There must be a monstrous strayne, nay, hee must breake through and steale, before his Holinesse with his predominate power, can get into the Creede. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, is this, every oath that conteyneth poynts concerning the limitation of the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is an oath belonging to Religion; but this oath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing what the Pope cannot doe towards his Majestie, or his successor in any case whatsoever, is an oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the limitation of the Popes authority, therefore this oath is belonging to Religion: If the <hi>Maior</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fition be vntrue or vncertaine, all the rest tottereth and falleth, as without foundation: I will examine the same by the pondering of the particuler words thereof. First, (belonging to Religion, in a generall sence may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the actions and resolues of men: yea ciuill duties, also are within the spaciousnes thereof, because a true Christian is governe his whole life and carriage by the rules of his Religion: but this Disputor must narrow the signification thereof more precisely, tying and applying the same onely to the articles of Payth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Popes authority must vndergoe the like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction as themselues haue propounded vnto vs, (that is to say) what he may doe as Pope, and what he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to doe by other acquiered titles, or by meere vsurping intrusion.</p>
            <p>Now then to say, that euery limiting of the Popes authority whatsoeuer the same be, or howsoeuer obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or exercised belongeth to the Articles of beleefe, I for my part will neuer beleeue it, and I do not thinke, that any of their owne Secritaries will be so much besot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I will explayne my meaning by instances and cases of the like condition; suppose that the Pope would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and pleade that the King doth hold of him the Crowne of this Land, and therefore as Superior Lord,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20039:43"/>
will require homage or trybute, and in default of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the same, will invade his Dominions with sword and force: If in this case the King shall for more security of his Imperiall State, aske (vppon Allegiance) the oathes of all, or any his Subjects in detestation of that claime, may the Catholikes make scruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science concerning such an oath, because the same see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to limmit and abridge, the Popes pretended right and authority? making in the meane time no Religion of the limitting, lessening, and detracting from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes Title and pre-eminence? perhaps they will say that this is a question of civill right, and that the Subject is cleerely bound to maintaine the Prince. But how if the Pope pretend withall his Pastorall care, and preservation of matters spirituall, then I trust (<hi>in ordine ad spiritualia</hi>) his temporall attempts must bee suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by his spirituall Children, against the King and Country.</p>
            <p>Againe, let it be conceiued that the Pope much mooued with indignation, at the execution of Iustice ministred in this Kingdome, against the Treacherous Conspirators of the Popish faction, should vpon that gnawing grudge towards the Iudges of this Land, take vpon him by solemne Censure, to depriue and displace them from their Iuridiciall offices, wherein (though he can assume no ordinary or rightfull power) yet <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia</hi> and for the generall releefe, and necessity of the Catholike cause hee adventureth as from his pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charge, to pronounce them from henceforth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Iudges, commanding all Catholikes also to reckon of them, and the iudgements by them giuen: Now the question is, whither to make a constant asseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20039:44"/>
that the Pope hath no such authority, be vnto a Catholike conscience a poynt of Faith or Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of such limiting bounds, disabling the Pope in his supposed sufficiency of his generall function for the good of the Church? If the denying or abating of the popes authority over these inferior minifters of Iustice be not accounted cumbersome to the c<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>osciences of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes (wherein I thinke they will make no doubt) why should the abjuring of this papall power ouer our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Magistrate touching the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>This <hi>Gent.</hi> saith that touching the acknowledgement of our Soveraigne to be true King and rightfull Lord over all his Dominions, no man sticketh at that: But, I aske, whether if the Pope haue already enwrapped his Majestie within any of his generall sentences, or shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by any especiall means, that he is not to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged King, will not then the Catholikes sticke at that? must not they refuse to sweare vnto that clause of recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition also? for feare that his Holinesse be questioned and limited in his owne powre and preeminence? I will not feare to affirme, That the true allegiance, and obedience of a naturall subject, cannot dwell together in the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

heart of a devoted &amp; dissembling Papist, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no marvell that the heart preposessed with Papacy, doth cast such doubts, of offending his dearest love, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially having plighted faith, and vowed his service, by all constant endeavors thereunto.</p>
            <p>This contrariety of Masters, must needs breed iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies on both sides, for as the Pope forbiddeth Papists, to sweare their allegiance and fidellity to the King, (fearing lest himselfe should thereby be excluded and renounced) So the King can never thinke himselfe secure and assured of those subiects, who (from their acknowledgement of the Popes superiorship over the King, and that in such a degree as may indure no limiting) dare not be affianced by oath to the safety of the King against the decrees and designes of their <hi>Dominus dominancium.</hi>  Then what will they say, or do, to free his Majestie from feares and ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies? <q>Doth this supple <hi>Gent.</hi> thinke to make or bring confidence, which I hope in Gods goodnesse that the Pope will never attempt any thing in preiudice of his Majestie. Surely Sir, your hope is too weake a stay for our state to rest or trust vnto: For what if the same great important and vrgent cases, concerning Christian religion doe fall out wherein yee averr the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over Princes: Then in that case I perceive the best answere wee shall expect from you will be the fooles proverbe, <hi>non putarem.</hi> For here againe you feede and foppe vs one with another of your hopes (which wee hope will never be betweene our Soveraigne and the Sea Apostolike.)</q>  Is it not more then strange that this so provident coniecturer of future events, should hope that that matter will neuer be; which long hath beene, continually is, and I trust perpetually will be, seeing, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20039:45"/>
these same great, important, and vrgent cases concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christian Religion haue done, and doe dayly fall out, betweene our Soveraigne and the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him Apostolike, Therefore it appeareth that the man hath lost his wits, whilest he would obtrude his hopes. The true conclusion is, that for as much as these great and important cases are in continuall conflict and question betweene the Pope and his Majestie, and that consequently the Authority of the Pope lyeth prest in dayly readinesse to represse and suppresse his Majestie vpon all occasions, as it concerneth his Royall person, for the preservation of his Life, State, and Dignity, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure himselfe of the vnviolable faithfulnesse of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, so that must needs be accounted a disloyall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall part for any subiect to be so seduced, by hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall pretences, as to adhere to a forraine and fained cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall Primacy, against his alleagiance, love and duty, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his true Soveraigne Lord and King.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gent.</hi> vseth many glorious and plausible speeehes of the humble acknowledgment of all temporall dueties to his Majestie, and iumpeth with the Mittigator in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it is not vnpossible for the Catholikes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in Subiection to the Civill goverment, and yet to reserve their consciences to the religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> if this were affirmed of such Countries only where the Prince is of the Romish faith, or of this Nation whilest the Pope had some hold, and prevalency in the same, then perhaps we might come neere to an agreement in this poynt, but where the Prince and Pope are of religion so repugnant and opposite, where the Pope is quite secluded and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any power Eccleslasticall or Civill, and where the Prince as in the right of the Crowne, is the defender
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20039:45"/>
and preserver of the faith within his Kingdome, there we are taught by experience, and directed by reason, that the entertayning and professing of Papacy, is the renouncing and repressing of regallity. I weigh not the allegation that is made, of the long continuance for well-neere a thousand yeares, of the admission and permission of the Popes Superioritie in this Realme, and how the same for all that space stood vn-offensive vnto this state, for whilest there was either subiugaiton, or coniugation of the two powerfull commands, their contrarietyes and repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could not be so apparently discovered, as they be now manifested, by the distinguishment and finall disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of them into their proper natures, rights, and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. I haue read diligently that great Volume, avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <note place="margin">Answere to Sir <hi>Edward Cooke.</hi>
               </note> by this <hi>Gent.</hi> written with much labour to this poore purpose, of declaring the Papal pre-emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Cuntry, ever since the first conversion thereof to Christianity, vntill the reigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight.</p>
            <p>The Authors sedulity and devotion may amongst the Birds of the same feather, receiue his reward, (at the least) of commendation, but I will vndertake with one short answere, (consisting but of two parts) to runne my pen through every line of that huge Bulke, blotting and putting out whatsoeuer he hath painted, foorth for the best shewe. First, (forbearing to refute their Fables, and taking their owne accompt of time, which they make of the entry of the Romish Religion into this Land,) it is euident that the mystery of iniquity, and the Antichristian arrogancy of the Romish prelacy, was then reuealed and exalted into worldly pompe: So as they then sending of Factors into these parts, was but to Conquer the simple people, of that vninstructed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:20039:46"/>
age to the bondage and yoake of <hi>Rome.'</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore no maruaile, if they were still held in the same, or the like subjection in the succeeding times, wherevnto they were at the first surprized by politicall handling, and with much simulation of piety trayned one for intromitting, and acceptation thereof; and I cannot invent a fitter resemblance whereby to represent the cunning carriage of that plot in those dayes, then that which Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath vsed and applyed in this question. Which is the crafty composition and commixture of Images set by <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour of himselfe and the <hi>panim</hi> gods coupled and combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in his Imperiall banner, for as that Emperour vnder the shew of reuerence due to be performed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, though to haue seduced those good Christians to the honoring of Idols, so in those darke and vndiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning times of our fore-fathers, by the tempering and ioyning of the Christian Religion, and the Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vsurpation, their simplicity was abused, and they by subtile practises, wrought vnto such a credulity, as that together with the sweete comforts of Christ, they sucked in at once the poyson of Romish Idolatry, and the oppression of papacy: The second part of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is, that notwithstanding such encroachment of the popedome vnto this Kingdome, wherein by stealing steppes and sundry Hypocriticall passages that had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten good footing, keeping in the meane while both Prince and people in an ignorant devotion, and a dread of damnation: Yet did the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> from time to time, feele themselues and their Soueraigne state to be enthralled and wronged by the ouer-awing, and busie intermedling of that vniversall pastorship, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20039:46"/>
therefore omitted not, vppon all occasions, to make knowne their dislikes and reluctations, to vphold the course, and force of the ancient Common Law, to defend and put in practise the Imperiall prerogatiues of their Crowne, and to restrayne the exorbitant ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> by prouiding statutes, vnder grieuous penalties against the Subjects of this Land, that in derogation of the Iustice, gouernment, and regall rights, of the King, did make recourse vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> by way of appeale, impetration, or other pretences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the naturall obligation of their faith and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</p>
            <p>But it will be sayd, how came it to passe then, that the Subjects held on their former orders, and no whit refrayned from <hi>Rome,</hi> yeelding still to the pope the same their dependency, and acknowledgments: That shall I also tell you, the pope and Councell of <hi>Rome</hi> (knowing right well, how fully they had possessed all sorts of people, with a blind zeale, carried after idle Ceremonies, and well pleasing superstitions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that they had so seazed and fastned vpon their Conscience, as that euery one held the saluation, or damnation of his soule, to consist in his obedience, or disobedience to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>) did crosse and avoyde the execution of such states by decreeing and sending foorth their Ecclesiasticall execution, of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, and excommunicating, of all Ministers of Iustice, or other ministeriall persecutors whatsoeuer, that should attempt to enforce, or execute any such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>; by this meanes of denouncing such terrors to the soule, the mightinesse and authority of the pope, grew dreadfull and powerfull, vntill it pleased the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

God, by the revelation of his truth, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of Popish falshoods, to inspire with courage and magnanimity the heart of that Right Noble King <hi>H.</hi> 8. who finally without any feare of his thunderbots, accomplished that worke of freeing this Realme from the grieuous butthen, and heauy yoake of the popish Supremacy, which diuers of his prodecessors Kings of <hi>England,</hi> had often, and much endeauoured, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to do, if their illightnings with grace, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings with meanes, had serued them thereunto; Thus it is made cleare, that the Popes authority, neither at the first landing thereof vppon the Coast of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (which was not in the purer times, but 600 yeares after, Christ as themselues confesse, when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was falne from sincerity) neyther in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and exercise of the same was lawfull, allowable, or beneficiall, but rather intruded, offensiue, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall vnto this state; and for his motion of sampling our proceedings to the practise vsed in other Countries ouer Catholike Subjects, in this poynt of excluding the Pope for intermedling temporally against Princes, shewing that they will be ready to answere as much duty and allegiance to his Majesty, as any such Catholike Subjects in any other Kingdome doth, or is bound to doe: He must know that he must then make and take his patterne, from the Protestant Princes, who haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed their ancient and originall rights, and not from them whom he calleth Catholikes, that honoreth the best, and dishonoreth themselues; wherefore the <hi>Gent.</hi> may hold his hand from the booke, his kind offer of swearing vnto his Majesty as much loyalty as euer any Catholike Subject of <hi>England</hi> did vnto the lawfull King
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20039:47"/>
in former times and ages, before the Change of King <hi>H.</hi> 8. will not be accepted as a suffring seruice or duty; Then was both King and people made drunke with the Popish cup, of spirituall Fornications, the Kings then were but halfe Kings, and the Subiects but halfe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; his Holinesse had pared away so much from the one, and gayned so much vppon the other, the one could not be absolute in commanding, for feare that his Superior should enterpose, the other could not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in obeying, because there might come a stronger countermaund; then what hath this offer more then thus? We haue beene filthy and will be filthy still. And why should not his Maiesty require of his Subiects such obedience, as by the rules of the true reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hee professeth he lawfully may doe? Or is there any reason that he should still be held to the former wrongs, and disaduantages, which ignorance, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, pride, and other manifold corruptions did beget and produce against his Crowne, and Soveraignity: Is it to be reckoned a poynt of Fayth and Saluation to lay forth a limitation of that power which hath beene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore so infinitly extended, and so vniustly claymed? and what is this limitation?</p>
            <p>Forsooth that the Pope cannot make Kings no Kings, or Subiects no Subiects, that his spirituall Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooke may not subdue the Princely Scepter, nor order and dispose of temporall rights; why may not the Pope be limited with some clauses? Of what he may do, and what he may not doe? The <hi>Gent.</hi> dogeth me, with <hi>P. R.</hi> his distinction of directly, and indirectly, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth thus much, that in plaine, true, and in direct course, to his Pastorall office, there be fixed bounds,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20039:48"/>
which he cannot passe, but in an vndue vnproper, and indirect course, he may goe where he listeth, neyther hedge nor ditch can hold him, neyther can there any matter of cause be conceiued, wherevnto this indirect and outstretched power may not be carried, we reckon in the Common acceptation of speech, vndirect dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bee fraudulent and vniust dealing, and why shold it not likewise be vnderstood, that this indirect au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is a wrong vsurping, and mis-begotten authority?</p>
            <p>The temporall is subordinate to the spiritual therefore (<hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia</hi>) he that hath all spirituallity, may in that regard, as occasions be ministred, rule, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any temporall thing, or businesse whatsoever; this is the reach &amp; strayne of their (indirectly) which can be no lesse then a direct and shamelesse illuding shift, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning whereof, and iustifying of that infinity of doing and determining, so many English Subiects, must forsake and abandon their obedyence, breaking a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the chaynes of loue and allegiance, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Lawes, Diuine, and humane, and necessity it selfe doeth tye them with, alas, that vppon so slender proofe, not contayning so much as a shadow of any probability, our deare Country-men enjoying the benefits of the same soyle, and pertaking the protection of so gracious a Prince: whereby their liues and estates are preserued in peace and good repose, should bee bewitched to their owne woe, and seduced to the stirring of sedition: Yet it is not vnknowne that diuers of them moued more with the true zeale of rendring to his Maiesty, their dutious respects, then carried with that head-strong, and blind zeale, of attending the pleasure and commands of their great Dragon, haue willingly (and as wee are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20039:48"/>
to judge) faithfully taken the oath aforesayd, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfort and (as he entertayneth the same with an acceptable construction) to the assuring of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, of their vnfeined fidellity.</p>
            <p>But this cauilling <hi>Gent.</hi> taketh exception vnto, and maketh considerations vppon the words, (willingly and faithfully.) First, for shew and proofe that they haue not done it willingly or freely: hee alledgeth that the statute imposing such a paine vppon the refusors, doth make a kinde of restraynt through feare; and so depriueth them both of liberty and freedome; I appeale to the parties themselues, that haue taken the oath, who speaketh more truely and honestly of, then he, or I, when I finde it a branch of their oath, that they doe sweare willingly, I doe beleeue them, not taking them to be so Reprobate, as in any such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of them, as that the passion of feare could so farre transport them as to make them sweare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>: He (belike knowing them better then I) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, yet he thinketh he hath pleased them againe, and falued the matter by laying the fault vpon the enforcement of feare, wrought in their hearts, by the rigiour of the Law: In the meane time hee maketh them in their Religion to be very faint, and of little faith, if worldly respects and dread of Calamities. can so farre stagger them, or preuaile ouer their infirmities, as to make them feare man more then God; and so in an vnbeleefe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phannesse, hazard saluation by forswearing; but because he so carpeth at the carriage, and composure of that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20039:49"/>
oath, and the enterlacing of those words, I would aske his opinion whither it be not lawfull and reasonable that any Magistrate may, yea ought, to charge the conscience of him that sweareth, that he shall doe the same wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and faithfully? Or doth he know any oath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the same are equall thereunto, to expresse the trueth and sincerity of the heart, be not eyther directly vsed, or necessarily imployed? His supposall of feares, troubles, or losses, is as applyable to the taking of any other oath, and by any other persons aswell as to this, by them taken, seeing that there is no oath prescribed to be required or exacted of any subiect, but the refusall thereof doth occasionally, and consequently, draw dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and losses to the partie so refusing. And doth hee thinke it fit to infert thereof that all the oathes that are propounded with such condition, or likely to breed such inconvenience to the refuser, are not taken freely and heartily? I wish his wits more freedome, and his heart more loyalty then so to judge.</p>
            <p>If the oath had stayed at the recognition of his Majesties right vnto the Crowne, and had not mentioned the Popes Authority, or any restrictions concerning the same, the heauinesse and extreamitye of the penaltye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted against the refusors, and so much aggrivated by this <hi>Gent.</hi> had not beene charged as a compulsarie cause, or any privation, or impediment to the freedome of the Catholikes consciences, whereby it is made evident, that not the manner, but the matter of the said oath, it is, that stingeth and offendeth them so much, for otherwise they will not deny, but his Majestie may lawfully, either by oath (which putteth vpon their Soules an awe and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation spirituall) or by propounding correspondent pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20039:49"/>
temporall (which often worketh a suppression of outward attempts) secure himselfe so farre as he may of good affection, or at the least of no aversion in his Subiects.</p>
            <p>As touching the other word (faithfully) howsoever he comments vpon the same either by way of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the sense and meaning, which his Catholikes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned to themselves, when they tooke the said oath, or by way of direction vnto such as shall hereafter be pressed thereunto, what cautelous reservation they may make by a mentall conceit, (for surely by giuing his judgement what the former haue done, he intendeth to instruct the rest what to do) yet for my part, I will still hold my selfe in my rule of charity which before I haue obserued, That for as much as they haue sworne, that the words by them spoken were sincerely acknowledged, according to the plaine and common sense and vnderstanding of the same, without any equivocation or mentall evasion, or secret reservation whatsoever. I doe not beleeue, that any of them haue vsed any such damnable deceit, or haue so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently and grossely foresworne themselues. Can this <hi>Gent.</hi> be so hard-hearted towards his beloued, as when he seeth and rehearseth the very words of their religious asseverations, and protestations, and that with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding clause (by the faith of a Christian) yet to iudge that they tooke the said oath in the same lawfull sense and interpretation which might stand with the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine, making them thereby equivocators, and mentall Iugglers, yea, expresse periured, if they haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly reteyned any others meanings then as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and plaine sense of the words affordeth. But how doth he convey and conster that part of the oath as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20039:50"/>
the Popes Authority, in dealing with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes? What moderate meaning hath he found for the safegard of the Catholike consciences that haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that oath? Truly this devise and exposition is so sleight and simple, as that I am verily perswaded he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth and publisheth the same, meerely for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and practise of the simple and vulgar Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes: The learned amongst them would be ashamed of so meane and vnschollerlike a shift, to wit, that in swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that the Pope hath no authority to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Princes, they should subunderstand (without good cause) for this inperpretation (saith he) is agreeable to the integritie and sinceritie of the Catholike doctrine, <hi>quia illud possumus quod iure possumus,</hi> And I pray the Gentlemans worship, to tell me whether <hi>non possumus etiam quod iure non possumus,</hi> is not power for the most part extendeable beyond right and iustice? But in this case the question it selfe being <hi>De jure,</hi> Whether the Pope rightfully and lawfully (as incident into his Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall place) may exercise power and authority over Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces temporally, how frivolously, and ridiculously, is this evasion devised, that hee may not doe it without good cause, which is as much to say, hee may not doe it lawfully, except hee doe it lawfully. Why? the question is not what hee may doe vnlawfully, for then wee might give to some one Pope an exemption, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation for more sinnes, then there were vertues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all. But when it is asked what this supreame Pastor may doe, or what he may not doe, in the right of his ministeriall office, this same (<hi>jure</hi>) hath reference to the authority generall, and not to the exercise thereof in any vnlawfull particularitie. Yet I may not so haue done with this his so foolish conceit, lest if I let him passe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20039:50"/>
therewith, hee may gather vpon me another absurdity, that (with good cause) the Pope may take vpon him the power, which we absolutely deny him, who knoweth not, that the cause and offence may be such as may moue and provoke the dislike of all men?  yet the correction, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and restraint belongeth not to all men, but only to a competent and authorized Iudge, which the Pope over Princes can never be, especially in temporall affaires, neither directly, that is truly and by commission, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, that is coulerably by any devised or fained pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, wherfore if he can invent no better an hiding cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for dissembling swearers, I hope there is no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like will make vse of his so fond a reservation and favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable interpretation, which indeed is all one, as if he asked leave to speak senselesly, to meane deceitfully, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize treacherously; presently after this out of his charity he had conceaved this escape by construction, for the consciences of Catholikes, forgetting (as it seemeth) that the said oath had by speciall words provided against such reserved meanings, he remembreth himselfe better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that as this case standeth, <q>they may not well induce themselues to equivocate, or sweare in any other sense then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Maiestie is proposed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth it to be lesse hurt plainly to deny to sweare, then by such swearing to giue no satisfaction neither to God, the King, himselfe, nor his neighbors,</q> thereupon falleth into a deepe grave invective against this great pressure laid vpon mens consciences, shewing that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we recken it a godly devise &amp; intent, and that God did accordingly blesse the same, yet that no viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression whatsoever is like to this, and that the devising of this new oath was no blessing, but an vnspeakable afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and augaracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mind (his angry passion forging vnto vs

that new word) and in this fuming fashion he precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, not forbearing to tell vs that by such extreame vexing of men, we shall gaine nothing, and giueth vs further to vnderstand, <q>that such forcing of men against their consciences may make vs more doubtfull of their good will after they haue sworne, then we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before; and that iniury receiued, must needes stirre them to more auersion of heart, working contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to that which is pretended; Nay, he dareth also to adde hereunto some threates and terrors, Setting foorth that amongst all other passions, none is more strong then that of reuenge for oppressions receiued, and therefore would haue vs conceiue, and apply it, that such as do not sticke to sweare against their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, for feare or other passions, will as easily breake that oath vppon like motiues if occasion serue:</q> In this boyling manner doth the fervency of his spirit inkindle the inclinable hearts of the male-contended, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, by the memory of their wrongs, and with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of words, making incitations, to sedition, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; his Theologicall resolving that wee commit a grieuous sinne, when wee force and presse men to sweare against their consciences, making the same the highest degree of scandall actiue, tendeth to no other end, then to scandalize the Iustice of our state, and to animate their mutining and factious complices, to some desperate vndertakings.</p>
            <p>And because hee sayth, that such their Catholike Doctrine, will not be denyed of the learned Protestants themselues: He forceth for answere a declaration of the truth, positiuely mayntained amongst vs in that behalfe; wherein (first absolutely denying that <hi>de facto</hi> we inforce
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20039:51"/>
any so to sweare) or that the tenor of the Statute, or any rigor contayned in the penalty thereof, doth presse them to any repugnancy, against their consciences, we confesse that amongst priuate men in particuler neccssi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for discouering of some truth, which otherwise cannot be made knowne this course of giving and taking satisfaction by a voluntary oath is held in vse, and that needfully and lawfully; and that in such debates of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate nature, it belongeth to the discretion, honesty, and conscience of any well aduised man, not to require or accept of the oath of any such as hee by vehement pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption mis-doubteth will forsweare himselfe. But when for the publike good, and by publike authority of the Law, the publike officer or Magistrate is enioyned to vrge an oath, or to be satisfied by the same, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (for performing and executing of the direction and command of the Law) is not to be blamed, neyther committeth any sinne, though in his priuate opinion hee shall suspect that the party so brought to his oath, will falsly or corruptly forsweare.</p>
            <p>For heerein hee is but a Minister of the Law, and must leaue the searching into the secrets of the heart, to the Almighty all seeing, and all iudging God, his duty and office both worketh and endeth in the act of the Law, saving that piety and charity may mooue him zealously to admonish him that so sweareth, to haue God and his Christian faith in remembrance, and to beware of all precipitation into the danger of hell fire.</p>
            <p>This godly and charitable aduisednesse, (I am well assured) is duely obserued by the Magistrates of this Realme, not suffering any to passe so carelesly, as not with louing tendernesse to admonish them, of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20039:52"/>
poynts, of that oath, and to adhort him to plainnesse, and willingnesse in taking of the same, that their consciences may not after be combred, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with scruples, conflicts, or reluctations.</p>
            <p>He affirmeth a likely obiection to be made on our side, for defence of the enforcing of Catholikes to this oath, which is by way of justification, of our doings therein, to be agreeable to the practise of the Romish Church, or in a course of recrimination that the Popish authority is more or equally culpable of the same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, because in the tribunalls of inquifitors, men are forced to abiure their opinions, and that vnder paine of death, or other most grieuous punishments.</p>
            <p>Now what is his answere, and what is the difference which he findeth out, to convince our constraynings to be dissauowable, and theirs (much more violent and Tyrannous) to be approueable? marry, because the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church hath <hi>Ius acquisitum</hi> ouer Heretickes, as her due subiects, though now gone out of her, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from her; doth this answere beseeme a <hi>Gent.</hi> that professeth learning, who well knoweth that wee will presently deny the Popish to be the Catholike Church? that we haue not departed from the Church? but from the abhominations of <hi>Rome,</hi> that we be neither Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, not subiects to that Antichristian Supremacy, and that their <hi>Ius acquisitum</hi> is not obtayned by any deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or substitution from Christ, but it is intruded and vsurped, and so rightly termed <hi>acquisitum,</hi> beeing neither <hi>Datum</hi> nor <hi>Legitimum,</hi> but gotten by fradulent contriuings, and strong illusions; in which cases it is not vnlawfull to shake of the yoake of bondage, and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, so vniustly brought vppon vs, so soone as any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20039:52"/>
meanes and opportunity shall be offered.</p>
            <p>And the rather because we haue (to front this <hi>Ius ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitum</hi> with) an old and strong opposition in our Law, that <hi>nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> whose Royall pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and supreame power, God hath in due time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, from that great captiuity of the <hi>Romish Babell;</hi> and was it not high time, and most requisite that the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Maiesty of this Kingdome should be exempted from the seruitude of that <hi>Ius acquisitum?</hi> Doe you not note that all such as be or haue beene brought vnder the same, are by this <hi>Gent.</hi> called the subiects of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church? such is the haughtinesse of that high built Tower of pride.</p>
            <p>The Pope is here made a Soveraigne, St. <hi>Peters</hi> nets catcheth more Kingdomes, then Fortune cast into the nets of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Captaine. The Monarchies of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> must be come the acquisites or perquisites of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Hath not then the Pope some reason thus to contend for the retayning of his subiects in his obedience, by barring of them from swearing themselues subiects to his Majestie, and by performing of the duties of allegiance requierable of subiects?  I shall be driven to avouch in earnest, that which Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi>gathereth against vs as a great absurditie, <q>that is, That no man can professe vnfeinedly his civill obedience, and detest treason and conspiracy, but hee must bee forced also to renounce the Primacy of the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </q>  The headship of the supreame Bishop which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth away in his streame the service and devotion of so many reputed Catholikes, is the headspring of treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and sedition, which by claiming amongst vs so many subiects, draweth from vs their affection and obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:20039:53"/>The distinction of Spirituall subjection and civil obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is become idle and of no vse, because the Pope doth not keepe his quarter, but will needs breake forth of the rayles and limits of that distinction, taking vpon him to be authorized also temporally, and that, for the suppression and subversion of the Civill Soveraignity, and so vpon that occasion (hauing his sheepe as by his pastorall charge to attend his call and heare his voyce) maketh at the lest a scruple, and distraction, if not a full declination in the wills and dutyes of the people of this Kingdome, whence must necessarily arise either privie complottings, or open attempts, in favour of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in furtherance of their defires, which how farre it will extend, and into how deepe degrees it vseth to grow, many sorowfull and fearefull examples hath in this Realme demonstratively declared vnto vs, to every whereof Papacy hath beene the stirrer and instigator. I scant dare to mention that late most memorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample (beyond all examples) of the Powder-Treason, this Gentleman is so tender-eared, as that he cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to heare of that, he findeth fault with the appol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger for the odeous and often repetition thereof. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame them if the repetition of that purpose bee thought odeous, which maketh them odeous to all true Christian hearts, and putteth all the world at gaze, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring at a designe so diuellish and detestable. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he asketh whether there be no end of reprobation, I will end with a wish, That there were in that hollow vault some shrill and screeching <hi>Eccho,</hi> that might never cease, by continuall resounding out-cryes, to beate and fill the aire, with the memorie of that hellish enterprise, that a Treason so extraordinarie, hatched vp with the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20039:53"/>
heate of Papacy, should even from forth of the stones themselves receave for ever in all succeeding Ages, a most iust reproofe and exprobation. My position where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I will conclude is this, That albeit I doe not hold all popish opinions, or Papists seduced with such errors, to be culpable of Treason, knowing that many simple and vninstructed people, may in some perticulers be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and neverthelesse, remaine allowable subiects, and perhaps not forsaken Christians: Yet such and so many of them, as directly, and compleatly, maintaine Papacy, that is, the Supremacy of the Popes power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the sense, and to the purpose, as this Gentleman and <hi>P. R.</hi> hath expressed and advanced the same, and in vpholding thereof, deny their Faith, Allegiance, Assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Subjection, and Adherence vnto their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, doe carry Treasonable hearts, and are thereby apted for the like Actions, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity shall allure or enable them thereunto.</p>
