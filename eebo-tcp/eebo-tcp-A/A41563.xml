            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>

And on the other hand, with the <hi>Groans and Struglings</hi> of a few, who have not defiled their Garments, but are wreſtling for their <hi>Chriſtian Liberty under different outward Practices againſt Impoſitions and introduced Innovations, contrary to that great Principle of Conviction and Choice,</hi> upon which all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were at firſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in diſtinct Societies.</p>

            <p>I am conſtrained in my mind thus to appear in publick, teſtifying to that <hi>Spiritual Order</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the firſt Churches, and recorded in the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> as the only proper means for preſerving any <hi>Chriſtian Society</hi> from a <hi>confuſed, diſorderly Licentiouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Tyrannous uſurped Impoſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I intend not by publiſhing this Diſcourſe, to enter into a debate with any Perſon; being reſolved, what ever entertainment it may meet with, to poſſeſs my Soul in Patience, committing the Iſſue to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Neither would I be underſtood to be ſo ingaged in any particular Company of <hi>Protestants,</hi> ſo as to plead for the one againſt the other: It is the firſt great <hi>Foundation Principle</hi> upon which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſeparated from thoſe of the <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> that is here pleaded for, to wit, <hi>That the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Holy Scriptures without us, and the Illumination of the Holy Spirit within us, gives final determination in Matters of Religion:</hi> Whereby every Chriſtian <hi>for himſelf</hi> is reſtored to his Liberty of <hi>Inquiry</hi> &amp; <hi>Choice,</hi> &amp; ſo freed from the Impoſition of unſcriptural <hi>Traditions</hi> by Popes &amp; General Councils.</p>
            <p>Therefore what I am, matters not to this Diſcourſe, and what others may judge me to be becauſe of it, doth but little concern me; every man is to give an account of himſelf to God, and not he that commends himſelf, or is highly accounted of by others, but <hi>he whom the Lord commends, is approved.</hi>

            <p>THE Apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt having received the Promiſe of the Father, and fitted with Power from on high, went forth Preaching
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46906:2"/>
the Goſpel with great Power, <hi>giving Witneſs to the Reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus, and Multitudes believed, and great Grace fell upon them all:</hi> They came not with outward Force upon the unbelieving World, neither did they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterially, as by an unaccountable authority, impoſe upon Believers, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Practiſes to be received by them, without inward convincement: Nay, nay, God who commanded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, ſhined in their Hearts; therefore they knowing the terrours of the Lord, <hi>perſwaded</hi> men, they beſeeched &amp; prayed men to be reconciled to God, <hi>commending themſelves in the ſight of God, to every mans Conſcience,</hi> by requiring every one in the Church to be <hi>fully perſwaded in himſelf:</hi> Whereby they became manifeſt both to God, and in the Conſciences of thoſe that believed.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Diſciples multiplying, firſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and afterwards in other Places, they were gathered into ſeveral diſtinct <hi>Congregations</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> each diſtinct Congregation continuing together with one accord, abode ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly in the <hi>Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip,</hi> the care of whom was upon them, by whoſe Miniſtry they were firſt gathered, for their Eſtabliſhment in their moſt Holy Faith: who therefore delivered to them, when preſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and in Letters when abſent from them, ſuch Inſtructions, as (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved) might preſerve them (though in diſtinct Fellowſhips) as <hi>the Houſhould of God, built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the Chief Corner Stone, in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we read in their Epiſtles theſe and ſuch like Precepts; <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, mark them which cauſe Diviſions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them: Be perfectly in the ſame Mind and in the ſame Judgment; I beſeech you Brethren, be Followers of me; for this Cauſe have I ſent Timotheus, who is faithful in the Lord, who will bring you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my ways, as I teach every where, in every Church: Now I pray you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances as I delivered them to you: Know them that labour among you, and are over you in the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſteem them highly for their Works ſake; exhort, rebuke with all authority; let no man diſpiſe thee; let all things be done decently, and in Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus alſo the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> being guided by the unerring conduct of the Spirit of God, in diſcarge of the Miniſtry committed to them, whereof they gave ſufficient Evidence, to the ſtopping the Mouthes of Gain-ſayers, could with an infallable certainty preface their Determinations, in matters controverted in the Churches referred to them, Viz. <hi>It ſeemeth good to the holy Ghoſt and to us:</hi> which for any Perſon or Perſons now to pretend to, by an alledged uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, or by a Revelation to that end, now in this Age received, withou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> giving the like Evidence of their being ſo ſent and conducted, is but a vain empty boaſt, to make void the certainty of the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> thereby to eſtabliſh in themſelves an unſcriptural <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> over all in the Church.</p>
            <p>And as the Apoſtles were careful to eſtabliſh the <hi>Spiritual Order</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46906:3"/>
in the Churches, they were no leſs careful to preſerve their <hi>Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> leſt under the pretence of <hi>Order,</hi> it ſhould be incroached upon by Church-Rulers, in whom the <hi>Form of Words</hi> might become ſtronger then the <hi>Power</hi> of Godlineſs; as after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> dayes it indeed came to paſs.</p>
            <p>Hence we alſo find in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> Church-Rulers required, to be <hi>apt to teach, ſober, patient in Meekneſs, inſtructing them that oppoſe; no Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, no Railer,</hi> but in much for-bearance to feed the Flock of God, <hi>not as Lords over Gods Heritage, but as Enſamples to the Flock; not as having Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over their Faith, but as helpers of their Joy: For</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the Authority given us of the Lord, is not for Deſtruction, but for Edification.</hi> The <hi>Spiritual Authority</hi> intruſted of the Lord with Church Officers, is to reach the Conſciences of all in the Church, to be manifeſt there; and not to exalt Man over the Conſciences of the Diſciples: Church-Rulers are not, becauſe of their authority to force by Church-Orders or Laws, every one to ſubmit to every particular appointment they judge neceſſary to be eſtabliſhed in the Church: becauſe Practices or Doctrines impoſed upon Perſons, to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſubmitted to <hi>unconvinced, edifies not,</hi> but <hi>deſtroys</hi> the work of God in their Hearts: the <hi>true Miniſters</hi> beareth with the <hi>

            <p>Thoſe that are to be ruled in the Church, are alſo required in the <hi>New-Teſtament, to ſubmit to thoſe that have Authority over them in the Lord,</hi> yet <hi>So,</hi> as every one is to be <hi>fully perſwaded in his own Mind</hi>: Chriſts Government is to be exerciſed in the Hearts of his People; Truth is to carry with it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in the Conſcience firſt, before it be ſubmitted to outwardly: Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this kind are not to be taken upon truſt; we are commanded to <hi>try the Spirits, whether they be of God or not,</hi> we are to examine Doctrines, to <hi>hold faſt that which is good: Chriſt's Sheep they hear his Voice, and follow him, a Strangers Voice they will not hear; they that are Chriſts, are led by the Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> this is the main thing in Religion: Perſons are not to be <hi>hurried</hi> too haſtily into the Practice of the <hi>decent Church-Orders,</hi> but are to wait on the Lord, to clear the matter to their Underſtandings: they are to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this kind <hi>doubtingly,</hi> but in clearneſs and Faith; <hi>for what is not of Faith, is Sin:</hi> an Error here, is an Error in the Foundation; becauſe <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further, that <hi>Church-Government</hi> might not degenerate into <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and to preſerve <hi>Chriſtian-Liberty,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us wherein the <hi>

obſerving it; ſome eating, and ſome not eating, and that in one and the ſame Church; wherein they were commanded by the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> (as a rule in ſuch caſes to all Chriſtian Societies) not to <hi>judge one another</hi> becauſe of them: whence i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nifeſt, that not outward different Practices breaks <hi>the Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church, but judging one</hi> another becauſe of them, he that obſerves a day, or other outward appointment in the Church, <hi>doing it in the Lord,</hi> may have unity with him that obſerves it not, <hi>alſo in the Lord</hi>: It was ſo in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, and it will be ſo ſtill, where GOD, and not Man, POWER, and not Form is exalted; for indeed the true ground of Unity among Chriſtians; is not that ſuch a Perſon is <hi>conform</hi> to me in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Practices, but becauſe I find him in what he doth differing from me, walking in his integrity, according to his own underſtanding in the Lord, and this is the ſtronger band of Unity betwixt us, then if we were both (without inward Convincement) in one uniform practice: nothing is more pleaſant to behold in Chriſtian Societies (while we ſee but in part, and every individual is to ſee for himſelf) then different ſorts and ſizes of Chriſtians, every one in their own Station, learning their own Leſſons from Chriſt, to whom they are to give an Account, and yet in their <hi>different Practices,</hi> having <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the Lord</hi> one with another: this is indeed lovely to a Spiritual Eye, though to the Carnal Eye it ſeems undecent and diſorderly: Indeed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> in a Chriſtian Society is much to be deſired; but the Lord is to be wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to bring People to this: Chriſtianity was begun in the Spirit, and ſo it muſt be continued; nothing muſt be received by force of Church-Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or Arguments of mans Wiſdom, but as by Convincement the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is perſwaded thereunto, where the Lord alone is to rule, who leads his People into the <hi>

            <p>Thus without forced or conſtrained Commentaries and Meanings, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the very Words of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> its manifeſt to him whom the Power of an outward Form of Words without Life, or the Ways of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs hath not blinded, that both <hi>Spiritual Order</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> were eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the firſt Churches.</p>
            <p>Now that this <hi>Spiritual Government</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> are conſiſtent in one and the ſame Chriſtian Society, neceſſarily follows beyond the reach of Contradiction, becauſe it was ſo appointed by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the firſt Churches; Secondly, becauſe they walked in their Church-Fellowſhips in the practice of them, both which is already cleared: Neither can any man ſuppoſe either that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> gave forth inconſiſtent and unpracticable Inſtructions to the Churches, or that even in their own time, while preſent among them, they were never practiced, though given forth, except he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to leſſen their Authority in the Churches, or the divine Authority of the holy Scriptures, conveying to us the truth of theſe things, as I have already ſhewed.</p>
            <p>But further, this <hi>Spiritual Government</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> are not only

            <p>And the neceſſity of the continuation of both theſe conjoyned together is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo manifeſt, by the ſad Conſequences which have followed there, where <hi>Church Government</hi> hath been exalted on the Ruines of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty:</hi> at this Door this <hi>dark night af Apoſtacy</hi> entred into the Church at the firſt, a <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> that begun to work in the days of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> not by a <hi>Demas</hi> that forſook them, but by a <hi>Deotrephes</hi> that ſought Preheminence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; for in the exerciſe of <hi>Church-Government</hi> in Chriſtian Societies, had the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Rules of <hi>Expediency, Edification, Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> (the beſt and only Preſervatives of <hi>Goſpel Order and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi>) been obſerved in all Ages by Church Rulers, the many <hi>Schiſmes</hi> that have rent and divided the <hi>Churchos</hi> of Chriſt, had not entred: and when contrary to <hi>Chriſtian Liberty, Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are impoſed by <hi>Church-Authority,</hi> the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> cannot in truth be reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Breakers of the <hi>Churches <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> though accounted ſuch by the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers.

            </p>
            <p>Which kind of <hi>Impoſition,</hi> as it is manifeſt by what is ſaid already, to be contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> and tenour of the <hi>New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>; ſo it makes void the Foundation Principle of <hi>Protestancy,</hi> is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> really deſtructive both to the <hi>Spiritual Order and Chriſtian
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46906:4"/>
Liberty of the Goſpel,</hi> and laſt of all, is a direct contradiction to an <hi>immediate inward Revelation of the Spirit,</hi> as being a Rule to every particular Chriſtian for his Conduct in all Religious Practices, and to that end implanted in every man as he comes into the World.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let the ſerious <hi>Proteſtants</hi> examine the firſt and great Foundation Principle on which they founded their Separation from thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi>; and they will find, that to aſſert the Divine Authority of the <hi>Holy Scriptures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us,</hi> and of the Illumination of the <hi>Holy Spirit within us</hi>; they proteſted that <hi>neither Traditions, Councils, Popes, nor Cannons of any viſible Church, but the Scripture only, interpreted by the Holy Spirit, gives final Determination in Matters of Religion.</hi> Which is ſo wholly at once made void by this kind of <hi>Church-Impoſition,</hi> if allowed; that their <hi>Protestation</hi> becomes quite inſignificant thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is contrary to <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> to allow of ſuch an Impoſition in a <hi>Chriſtian Society</hi>; becauſe all in ſuch a Society are of one joynt voluntary <hi>Communion</hi>; it is therefore moſt unreaſonable for one or more of that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to impoſe their final determinations in matters controverted on their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren unconvinced, and not referred to them; in reſpect ſuch Societies are to be governed according to their firſt Principle of Union, which is, <hi>Inward Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,</hi> and therefore is to be upheld by that ſame Principle, leaſt it degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into <hi>Tyranny:</hi> Uniform Outward Practices they may be <hi>driven into,</hi> but they cannot be the <hi>Bond</hi> of their Spiritual Union; that being ever one and the ſame, whil'ſt outward Practices are alterable, ſo never to be impoſed as neceſſary, but to be perſwaded into, as they are found agreeable to the Rules of <hi>Conveniency, Edification, Peace and Charity</hi>; It is Man's Glory, that he is not Religious by any kind of outward force, but that in his worſhiping God, he offers up to him a free and reaſonable Sacrifice; whereas this kind of <hi>Church Power</hi> once admitted, deprives Perſons of the uſe of their Reaſon, who by ſubmitting unconvinced, do give the Lye to their Underſtandings; in a word, it leaveth a man neither the uſe of his Reaſon as a Man, nor of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Underſtanding as a <hi>Christian</hi>; and therefore cannot be of the God of Truth, that hath indued every man with a reaſonable Soul, and every <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> with a Spiritual Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is alſo deſtructive both to the <hi>Spiritual Order</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> of the Goſpel: this is ſufficiently proved in the ſad Example of thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi>; where the many unneceſſary and unſcriptural <hi>Traditions, Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> impoſed, have wholly extinguiſhed the <hi>Spiritual Order</hi> of the Goſpel mentioned in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and where the <hi>Bloody Inquiſition</hi> hath buried <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> and will infallibly produce the ſame event where it is received.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> The Contradiction betwixt this kind of <hi>Impoſition,</hi> and an <hi>Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelation</hi> of the Light and Spirit of God in every individual, as his uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Rule and Conduct in every thing of Religion is manifeſt in this, that this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46906:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Inward Revelation</hi> is aſſerted to be therefore given to every man as he cometh into the World, as being of it ſelf ſufficient (if obeyed) to lead him into all Truth, without any neceſſity of hearkning unto any outward Writings or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions whatſoever, but as this Light leads thereunto; which if it be ſo, and that a Society be united upon that Principle in one joynt Communion, the uſeleſsneſs of one or more in the <hi>Church</hi> having ſuch a Power, or of general or particular outward Laws and Inſtructions to order Matters in that Society, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Obedience thereunto: And of the fore appointed Standing Meetings, <hi>Weekly, Monthly,</hi> and <hi>Quarterly,</hi> and the frequenting the Set Times and Places of thoſe Meetings, further than it becomes neceſſary to every individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Society, through the <hi>Inward Immediate Revelation</hi> of the Light in his own Particular then received, which he is to abide in, hearken unto, and obey, is ſo very manifeſt, that indeed it is a deſerting the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> once ſo fiercely contended for, to be in every Man, to lead him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Truth; and on <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> acknowledgement of the Inſufficiency of that Light within of it ſelf, ſo to lead them in whom it is, or to preſerve them therein.</p>
            <p>It remains in order to the cloſing of this Diſcourſe, to examine ſome of the arguments of old, muſtered up by thoſe of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> againſt the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and long ſince refuted by them, and manifeſt in their Conſciences to have no force in them againſt this Doctrine of the <hi>New Testament</hi> treated of in this Diſcourſe, yet now again raiſed out of that Rubbiſh, to uphold this <hi>little new erected Papacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is the Body to be without Government? And if ſo, will it not turn into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Ranters, every one having liberty to do what he pleaſeth? Is not this rather a Carnal Licentiouſneſs than Christian Liberty</hi>?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, It is not pleaded for here, that every one, or indeed, any one ſhould do what he pleaſeth; but that none ſhould be conſtrained, or impoſed upon to do what others pleaſe, but they ſhould be left free to do what God pleaſeth; <hi>They that are Chriſt's, are led by his Spirit</hi>; whoſe Conduct cannot introduce <hi>Confuſion</hi> or <hi>Licentiouſneſs,</hi> in them eſpecially, who own the Divine Authority of the Holy Scripture as their Outward Rule: Indeed ſuch things may enter into a <hi>Chriſtian Society</hi>; but its only then, when the Doctrine of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and the Leadings of God's Spirit according to them, is departed from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, are we not to believe as the True Church Believes? Is not the Infallible Spirit of God in his Church? If ſo, what will you believe, if not as the True Church doth believes</hi>?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, This is the old reaſoning of Carnal Wiſdom, whereby Chriſt is juſtled out of his Office, and the Divine Authority of the Holy Scripture trampled upon, to introduce an <hi>Implicit Blind Obedience</hi>; the ſtrength of which <hi>Argument</hi> is at large ſolidly refuted, and the Deceit lurking under that Covering, clearly laid open, by <hi>W.

               <hi>An Addreſs to Protestants,</hi> the Peruſal whereof is recommended to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers,</hi> for their Information herein:
<q>I am (ſaith he) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as the true Church believes; but not becauſe ſhe ſo believes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am convinced in my Conſcience of the truth of what ſhe believes; otherwiſe my Faith may be falſe, though hers be true.</q> We have the ſame Rule for our Faith the true Church hath, and the ſame Reaſons to induce us to believe, that ſhe hath; the whole multitude of the Believers, who make up the whole Church, having the ſame Rule of Faith with me in particular; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe as the whole Church believes, but upon the ſame Principles and Motives upon which every one in particular believed, who firſt made up a Chriſtian Church, which was <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Choice:</hi> and though I ought thus to believe, as the Holy <hi>Catholick Church</hi> believes, and that the Spirit of God reſts in his <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> yet I am not therefore blindly, without examination and convincement, to give up my whole Concern <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> unto any particular Society of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> even though I be ingaged as one among them in <hi>Church-Fellowſhip,</hi> as unto the Judgment of the Spirit of God in the <hi>Men's</hi> or <hi>Womens-Meetings</hi>; the generality among whom may be in a Decay, and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> may be the few who keep their Garments unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, as moſt ordinarily in ages paſt it hath happened actually to be in other <hi>Chriſtian Societies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But was there not a Government in the Churches in the Apoſtles Days? And were there not Governours, and Governed? And ſhould it not be ſo ſtill? Were not the Elders to ſeed the Flock, and rule over them; and was not the Flock to ſubmit themſelves to them, and to follow their Faith, as they that muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Souls? And it was not Tyranny then to exerciſe this Authority in the Church, how comes it to be ſo now?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>Church-Government</hi> is Spiritual, and only to be exerciſed Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Conſciences of the Governed, not as Lording it over their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction,</hi> but by <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> and <hi>Conviction</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come manifeſt in their Conſciences, waiting till the Lord ſhall reveal it to them: thus was Spiritual Government exerciſed in the firſt Churches by their Governours, according to the Rules of <hi>Expediency, Edification, Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and thus did the Governed ſubmit themſelves in the Lord, whereby they were preſerved in the Unity of the Spirit in different Outward Practices; which being departed from, the Government becomes Tyrannous.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But the infallible Judgment, in reference to Differences in the Church, though it be fixed in the Spirit of God according to the Testimony of the Scriptures, ought it not to be exerciſed by one, or more, certain Perſon, or Perſons, in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Meetings of the Elders of the Body, ſo long as he or they abide in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that Spirit, and are not in a Decay? And what can be the hazard to ſay,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46906:6"/>
That in ſuch a Church there is ſtill an Infallible Judgment in one or more ſo guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to whom all are to ſubmit?

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, In ſuch a Society, Matters controverted, may and ought to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally determined by Perſons of the Society, to whom they ſhould be referred: and it reſts in the power of any one particular <hi>Church</hi> to make Orders for the better Governing of the <hi>Church</hi>; the Exerciſe whereof may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Church</hi> to particular Elders and Overſeers, to whom in their acts of Government they are accountable: but in the framing ſuch Orders, and in the Exerciſe of <hi>Church-Government,</hi> the Rules of <hi>Expediency, Edification, Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> are ever to be obſerved, that the Conſciences of the Deſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may be preſerved tender under the feeling of <hi>Chriſt's Government within them,</hi> that Obedience be never impoſed as neceſſary upon them, but as the Lord ſhall clear the Matter to them: for this being departed from, it ceaſeth to be the <hi>Spiritual Government</hi> of Chriſt, exerciſed in his Church according to the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and becomes an <hi>Eccleſiaſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<q>So long as he or they abide in the Conduct of that Spirit in their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and ſo not in a Decay:</q> Is no more than what they of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſert of themſelves; and the great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion here remains undetermined, <hi>Viz.</hi> Who ſhall be Judge of the Life or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of this one or more? Whether the <hi>Pope and the Council of Trent,</hi> or the <hi>Diſſenting Protestants</hi>? The very aſſuming ſuch a Power in themſelves at <hi>Trent,</hi> was a ſufficient evidence in the Conſciences of <hi>Diſſenting Protestants,</hi> of their Decay <hi>then,</hi> and it is ſo <hi>now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But if there be no infallible Judgment to be expected now in the Church, how are theſe words of our Lord's to be underſtood,</hi> Lo I am with you to the end of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46906:6"/>
the World, the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it? <hi>And how is the Church the Ground and Pillar of Truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The neceſſity of this infallible Judgment in one, or more in the <hi>Church,</hi> can no more be concluded from theſe words, than the <hi>Pope's Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> over Emperours and Kings, and the whole <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> from the words of our Lord to <hi>Peter, Feed my Sheep:</hi> Theſe Expreſſions in plainneſs import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only this; That Jeſus Chriſt will be ſo preſent with his <hi>Holy Catholick Church</hi> in the World ſo long as it ſhall laſt, that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, ſo as in it the truth of the Goſpel ſhall be preſerved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed: which is not applicable to any one particular <hi>Church</hi>; for many that were ſuch in the days of the Apoſtles, are long ſince ſo far prevailed upon, by Hereſies, Perſecutions, and Devaſtations, that they have loſt, not only a <hi>Church-State</hi> according to the Order of the Goſpel, but alſo their very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World, yet Chriſt's Preſence remains with his <hi>Church,</hi> ſo as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in the World, the Ground and Pillar of Truth, againſt which the Powers of Darkneſs ſhall never ſo far prevail, ſo as it ſhall not have a Being in the World, or ſhall ceaſe to be the Ground and Pillar of Truth.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But if there be no Infallible Judgment now to be expected in the Church, will not both the Diſſenters, &amp; they that are diſſented from, be in the Miſt, both hitting at Random? And will not Religion degenerate into</hi> Sceptiſm?</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> There is no ſuch hazard, where the Divine Authority of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures,</hi> and the Illumination of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, is owned and preſerved: and where People are called upon not to imbrace outward Appointments too haſtily, but wait the Conduct of the Spirit of the Lord to lead into all <hi>Truth</hi> according to the Scriptures; and this can never be the neceſſary conſequence of this Doctrine, however theſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Order</hi> would impoſe ſuch an Inference upon it: but we do indeed then hit at random, and are in the miſt, blindfolded, when being denyed the uſe of our Reaſon and Spiritual Underſtanding, we are required to ſubmit to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Impoſitions; to be firſt blindfolded, and then led by ſuch blind Guides, is the ſhorteſt way I know of, to fall into the Ditch.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But if any through unclearneſs or diſobedience, do not ſubmit, is not the Church to deny them her Spiritual Fellowſhip? If in Civil Corporations or Societies they have power to declare the Breakers of the Fundamental Articles of their Society, to have forfeited their Right in the Society, why ſhould it not be ſo in Chriſtian Societies, without the brand of Tyranny</hi>?</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer, The chiefeſt Liberty pleaded for</hi> in this Diſcourſe, is not on their behalf who break the Fundamental Spiritual Band of the Churches Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is <hi>the Spirit of God by Conviction and Choice</hi> uniting them together in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46906:7"/>
one voluntary joynt Communion; neither is it pleaded for on their behalf, who break the Fundamental Articles of a <hi>Chriſtian Society,</hi> as ſuch, <hi>to wit,</hi> thoſe who walk ſcandalouſly in a diſordered prophane Converſation, unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Holineſs of the Goſpel, and thoſe who avowedly maintain, and obſtinately adhere unto thoſe damnable Hereſies, as are manifeſtly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the very Fundamental Principles of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> from all ſuch as having a Form of Godlineſs, but denying the Power thereof, and as having erred concerning the Truth, overthrowing the Faith of ſome, in the Apoſtles days the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were to turn from; and it ought to be ſo now in all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Societies,</hi> walking according to that Pattern, as is clear in the <hi>New-Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if Perſons make <hi>Outward Bands</hi> of Church-Unity as neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Church Communion,</hi> which was not in the firſt Churches, and impoſe them contrary to the Apoſtles Rules of <hi>Expediency, Edification, Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> obliging all perſons in the Church, notwithſtanding any unclearneſs in themſelves, to a ſubmiſſive obedience thereunto, as unto the Judgment of the Spirit of God in the <hi>Men's</hi> and <hi>Women's Meetings,</hi> or be denied the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Fellowſhip of the <hi>Church</hi>: In this Caſe, the ſtanding faſt to <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> not to be ſubject to <hi>Ordinances after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men,</hi> is no breach of the Fundamental Articles of a <hi>Christian Society,</hi> but a neceſſary Teſtimony againſt <hi>Introduced Innovations,</hi> contrary to them: for in any <hi>Chriſtian Congregation,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> though there be not an Uniformity in <hi>Outward Practices,</hi> becauſe of unclearneſs in the Conſciences of the Diſciples, in matters that are not plainly manifeſt to them all, to be of that weight as ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to diſſolve the Spiritual Union, and break the Fundamental Articles of all <hi>Chriſtian Societies,</hi> as ſuch, the Congregation, or Church is not to deny the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> her Spiritual Fellowſhip: Chriſtian Liberty was thus allowed of in the firſt Churches, and will be ſo ſtill, where <hi>Church Government</hi> is not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Eccleſiaſtical, Juriſdiction</hi> in the hands of a few Church-Rulers, to uphold their Authority over all in the Church.</p>
            <p>Neither are <hi>Christian Societies</hi> like other <hi>Corporations,</hi> becauſe not gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſame Grounds; nor being gathered, &amp; preſerved by the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nor governed by the ſame Methods: the ground of their being gathered in <hi>Societies,</hi> is, their being firſt joyned to the Lord by his Grace in their Hearts, and then a voluntary joyning together for their mutual Edification in the holy things of the Goſpel: this Principle which firſt united them, and that only preſerves them in one joyn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Body, in the exerciſe of that <hi>Spiritual Government,</hi> that is conſiſtent with <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> in different Outward Practices: which Principle of Union, and Method of Government, no Civil <hi>Corporations</hi> pretend to.</p>
            <p>Many more are the Cavils and Clamours that are raiſed by <hi>Babylon's Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> againſt this Doctrine treated of in this Diſcourſe, which are eaſily confut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch as will conſult the <hi>New Testament</hi>; from the plainneſs and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city whereof, ſome <hi>Men of Learning, &amp; Maſters of Sects</hi> in their deep Wiſdom

finding it their Intereſt, to depart, making indeed a ſhow of <hi>Wiſdom in Will-Worſhip, and Humility, and neglecting of the Body,</hi> have intangled themſelves in <hi>many Inventions,</hi> beginning even in the <hi>Apoſtles Days</hi>; ſo early did the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> in the <hi>Churches</hi> begin to work; at firſt indeed under a <hi>Form of Godlineſs, but denying the Power thereof</hi>; which once being departed from, by degrees they come to make Shipwrack, both of Faith, and Order of the Goſpel, as it was at firſt delivered by the Saints.</p>
            <p>In which Apoſtatized State, the <hi>Church-Rulers</hi> puffed up with Pride and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, never reſted until by crafty, ſiniſter, and wicked means, they had eſtabliſhed in themſelves an <hi>Eccleſiastical Juriſdiction and Supremacy</hi> over Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Kings, and the Conſciences of all Perſons in (as they pretended) the whole <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; whereby under the Names of <hi>Church, Miniſtry, Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> thereof, the true <hi>Church-State, Spiritual Order,</hi> true <hi>Ministry,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of it were quite loſt, and the Image of thoſe things, in a Carnal, Worldly, Politick, Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Church-State,</hi> erected in the ſtead thereof: againſt which in ſeveral times and ſeaſons, as it pleaſed God, he raiſed up faithful Witneſſes, who ſealed their teſtimony againſt ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe introduced Abominations with their Blood: after whom others aroſe through their Miniſtry and Sufferings, who running too haſtily in their own Wiſdoms to build up <hi>the Ruines of Zion,</hi> out of the <hi>Rubbiſh of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> (which, as accurſed ſtuff, ſhould have been utterly rejected) God in his infinite Wiſdom divided them in their underſtandings; ſo that inſtead of Building one uniform Eccleſiaſtick Structure after the Pattern of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were ſcattered into ſeveral Parties and Sects, each pitching a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle for themſelves, and confining God to their Way, or Party.</p>
            <p>Among whom here is a ſad Inſtance of them, who having condemned this kind of Impoſition as <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi> in others, are nevertheleſs caſting after the ſame Copy: yea, behold here the very ſame Perſons, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of themſelves, that they were raiſed as Inſtruments in God's hands, to gather his People out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> out of the many divided Sects in <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> have fixed themſelves in one particular Sect, bounded by, and limited unto outward Obſervances, and thereby eſtabliſhed in themſelves Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over all their <hi>Little Flock,</hi> who, altho they have no authority from the Scriptures, nor the Law of the Nation, yet burden their Conſciences with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Inventions, under the pre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46906:8"/>
whatever Outward Diſpenſation of Light God hath once gloriouſly appeared in, yet he is not limited thereby: the Life of God in every outward Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration is one and the ſame, the adminiſtration being but the Outward Garment that he chuſeth and refuſeth at his pleaſure; gathering his People, not out of one Sect, or Path only, but out of various Adminiſtrations into himſelf, <hi>who is Love,</hi> and in his Love comprehending all the upright hearted, however diſtinguiſhed from one another; who therefore cannot be tied to any one Form; the Form being for ever to be ſubject to the Power of God in its various appearances: there is therefore no certain knowing of the power of Godlineſs by any outward Form it hath manifeſtly once appeared in; the outward Form being to be known and owned, as the Power manifeſts it ſelf in and through it; and this the Lord doth, that no Fleſh may glory in his Preſence; that <hi>God alone, and not Man,</hi> may be exalted in delivering his People out of all <hi>the ſtreets of that great City Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe with the words of our Lord to his Deſciples in a day when <hi>a Lofty Spirit</hi> was exalting it ſelf in ſome of them; which be excludes out of his Church, to have no place in his Miniſters; <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.25, 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>Ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe Dominion over them, and they that are great exerciſe Lordſhip upon them: but it ſhall not be ſo among you; whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your Miniſter; and whoſoever will be Chief among you, let him be your Servant: even as the Son of Man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter.</hi>
