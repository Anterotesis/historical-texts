            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Controuerſies han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in this short Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe are two: The firſt is of the Iewes Sabaoth, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolically tranſlated into the euer memorable day of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Reſurection. The ſecond, whether al forts of meates may be lawfully now eaten by Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: diſputed againſt <hi>Iohn Traſke,</hi> of a Puritan miniſter lately grown halfe a lew in his ſingular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the old Sabaoth, and Moyſaical difference of meates, held by him &amp; many other men and women, obſtinately profeſſing and practiſing the ſame doctrines, as morall Lawes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15085:3"/>
vnreapealed by Chriſt, and neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now to be obſerued by Chriſtians. His only learning is a litterall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Scriptures, and ſome little Hebrew and Greeke lately learned for the better vnderſtanding of them: which alone he holdeth ſufficient, not only to inſtruct vs in al points of faith, but to direct vs alſo in our particuler thoughtes, ſpeaches, &amp; actions; ſo as no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſpeach is by Chriſtians to be vſed, no meate to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no kind of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell to be worne &amp;c. not particularly expreſſed and warranted in Scripture. Huma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e iudgment &amp; experience (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are originally taught to diſcerne the naturall goodnes and euil of al our actions, and to make a conſcience of them) being ſo little regarded by him, as he ridiculouſly deemeth it not to be any rule at all to direct Chriſtian men in common manners and morality of life; God himſelfe hauing by a higher law contayned in the old &amp; new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, particulerly inſtructed them in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15085:3"/>
all holy and needfull knowledge.</p>
            <p>Out of which ground he deduceth, as I shall haue ſeuerall occaſions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare afterwards, ſtrange Concluſions &amp; Diſtinctions not eaſy to be diſtintly knowne &amp; refuted by any learned man that hath not from his owne mouth hard them. This was my chiefe reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to write theſe two Controuerſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, wherby ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of his diſciples may peraduenture be reclaymed from his groſſe doctrines; and other it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching eared people now inclinable to his Sect, may be moued vtterly to forſake him. And one ſoule ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely gayned to a neerer degree of truth, will make me thinke a few ſpare houres well beſtowed from bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtudies. Learned men alſo will gladly, perchance, ſpare an idle houre or two to read a new Controuerſy, breifly, as I could contriue it, and plainly expreſſed. Smaller errours, and of leſſe conſequence then theſe nouell fancies of <hi>Traske</hi> haue
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15085:4"/>
been by ſundry holy Fathers anſwered in large volums, which may well ſerue to shew my labours not wholy needles.</p>
            <p>Little ſparkes of fire not timely quenched, ſoone grow into flames, that deuoure houſes and Citties. Small wounds waxe feſtered ſoares, when they are not ſpeedily cured. Single ſeedes of tare and cockle ſowne in fields amongſt good Corne make great bundles in harueſt, fit only for combuſtion. And the miſerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of theſe latter times aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with nouel &amp; heretical doctrines, witneſſeth, that as plaguy people are for feare of infecting others carefully to be ſecluded; and ſmall leakes in a ship are ſpeedily to be ſtopped for the ſafety of ſuch perſons as ſayle in it: ſo all morall and pious diligence is by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours and Guiders of ſoules to be vſed for the timely preuention and ſuppreſſing of pernicious opinions, with which <hi>Traſke</hi> is ſo ſtored, as he is in very few pointes of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15085:4"/>
fayth rightly perſuaded.</p>
            <p>He hath 8. arguments to proue that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was the holy Ghoſt mentioned <hi>Geneſ. 14. Hebr.</hi> 7. He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly aſſured, that he himſelfe hath truly repented, and is made ſure of his eternall election in Chriſt: and that he can in this life neither ſinne, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent any more. Likewiſ, he is able to collect out of Scripture when <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob</hi> and other Saints were truly. penitent and iuſtified in Gods ſight: and will often preſume to tell his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whether at all, or when, they truly repented. Yea he is able, as I haue heard, by Phiſiognomy, to make certaine gheſſes whether parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons ſhal be damned or ſaued. His owne and his diſciples prayers are commonly roaringes, and ſuch loud out-cries as may be heard in diſtant roomes and houſes, voluntarily fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and filled for the moſt part with frequent imprecations, that God would confound the aduerſaries and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15085:5"/>
perſecutors of his little flocke, ſuch as walke in the luſt of their owne fleſh, eating like the Idolatrous Gentiles all prohibited and vncleane meates; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning his holy Sabaoth, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it into another day neuer coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him, but by themſelues inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Frequently rendring thankes to God for keeping them ſo holy as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he hath done, and deſiring him according to their vprightnes to bleſſe and protect them.</p>
            <p>Pretended reuelations alſo are not wanting amongſt them. He will tell you of ſtraung abſtinences from food and other great auſterities vſed by himſelfe, notwithſtanding his chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes ſeeme full, and his body ſtill fatt and in good liking. He will with great glory vtter the ſingular approuement made of him in his Miniſteriall ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when other Countrey Schollers were reiected, himſelfe hauing neuer byn more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a gueſt in any Vniuerſity. His excellency aboue others was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15085:5"/>
occaſioned by a perfect Summe of all Diuinity, only abſtracted by his owne Confeſſion out of <hi>Muſculus</hi> his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Places. When he was a ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter at a Gentlemans houſe in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſetshire</hi> to a few Grammer ſcholers, he could write and ſpeake pure latin, as he grauely tould one of his fellow priſoners, which in his riper and matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſtudies ſince of Diuinity, he hath quite forgotten, and altered his <hi>Cicero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> wonted ſtile into the humble and plaine phraſe of Scripture; and indeed much more barbarous. When he was reprehended by an Aduerſary for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the <hi>minor</hi> of an <hi>enthimeme,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in excuſe of his groſſe ignorance <hi>Rhamus</hi> logique, only affirming an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimeme</hi> to be an imperfect ſillogiſme, and ſayd, that <hi>Ramiſts</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> could not vnderſtand each others termes and manner of diſputing but after much practiſe togeather. He will bragge of many bookes written, and ſome of them dedicated by him to his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15085:6"/>
Maieſty, who becauſe he eateth not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſwines flesh, he ſuppoſeth by his Princely nature halfe framed and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to imbrace and profeſſe his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which he is confident to haue generally one day held in our English, and all other Proteſtant Churches.</p>
            <p>Hearing that <hi>Maiſter Howes</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuer &amp; Augmenter of <hi>Maiſter Stowes</hi> cronicle was deſirous to ſee him, out of a vaine deſire to haue al circumſtances of his perſon and opinions hiſtorically blazed, he wrote a letter to <hi>Maiſter Howes</hi> fully to informe him of both, mentioning therein the day, order, &amp; continuance of his impriſonment, if he liſted ſo to recount them. He wil tel you how many publique Lectures he made weekly with great applauſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his aboad with <hi>Maiſter Drake</hi> in Deuonſhire, and how his chamber lay open beſides to all comers, day and night for priuate inſtruction, ſhewing himſelfe a Foole, if not a Phariſy, in affecting humane prayſes ſo palpably,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15085:6"/>
in all his ſpeaches and actions.</p>
            <p>Two of diſciples only vnderſtand Latin aſwell as himſelfe: the one a poore ſeduced Gentleman, better ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Hebrew then himſelf, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerſant in Scripture: the other a Comfit-maker, who lately vndertooke by <hi>Traſkes</hi> directions, as is probably gueſſed, to publiſh his doctrinall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, &amp; to defend them againſt <hi>M. Crashaw</hi> who hath write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an idle &amp; looſe refutation of them. For contrary to his common Pulpit-doctrine, and raylinges againſt Catholikes, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting traditions and pointes of faith not contayned in Scripture, he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth without further proofe, that Chriſt in conuerſation with his Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Reſurrection, taught our kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Sunday in place of the Sabaoth, that being a meere Tradition no where mentioned in Scripture. Which ſortes of aduantage are craftely obſerued by <hi>Traſke</hi> in all conferences of learned Proteſtantes with him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15085:7"/>
&amp; he will not ſticke in anſwering their arguments deduced from the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vniuerſall practiſe of Chriſts Church in all ages before him, to tell them, that they fight againſt him with the Catholikes borrowed wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and in their ſtrokes at him, wound themſelues more deeply, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing moſt opinions of their own faith, which are as ſtrange and vnheard of, till within the laſt 100. yeares, as his doctrines, and equally repugnant to the ancient authority and knowne practiſe of all Chriſtendome in times paſt. So that if his ground of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no doctrine not expreſſed in Scripture be shaken, their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will totter alſo. For the ſame authenticall teſtimonies of antiquity which ſerue to proue the Apoſtolicall obſeruation of the Sunday, do likewiſe mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Liturgies &amp; Maſſing Sacrifices celebrated by Chriſtians in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique ſinaxes and meetings on feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall and dominicall dayes, teſtified by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15085:7"/>
S. <hi>Auguſtine ſerm. 251. de tempore,</hi> by <hi>S. Cyprian de oper. &amp; eleemoſyn.</hi> by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Agathen Councell cap.</hi> 47. by the 6. <hi>Oecumenicall Councell cap.</hi> 8. and ſundry other ancient authors.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> and ſole aſſertion is a ſufficient rule of fayth to all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, among whom if any chance to grow wiſer (as many of them lately haue done) and to depart from his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he will ſeeme to haue formerly feared &amp; foreknown that mans frailty and finall reprobation. Thus not long ſince he dealt with one of them, who notwithſtanding then proteſted that <hi>Traske</hi> had heertofore vnder his owne hand warranted his true repentance, and eternall election in Chriſt Ieſus, though paſſion at that time tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to make a contrary iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to him and his diſciples, then to be tearmed ignorant or abſurd in any of their aſſertions. And albeit himſelfe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15085:8"/>

knowne to very few, conſiſting of 2. or 3. gathered togeather in Chriſts name, himſelfe promiſing to be in the midſt of them <hi>Matth. 18. verſ.</hi> 20. that is to ſay, a ſmall number of ſuch little ones as haue truly repented, and are made ſure of their election in Chriſt, hated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by men, but beloued by God &amp; guarded by Angells, ſeeing the face of their Heauenly Father. <hi>Matth. ibid. verſ.</hi> 10.

                  <p>So he fooliſhly ſeeketh with <hi>Ebion</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancient Heretikes to breath life and ſpirit into the ceremonious carcaſſe and buried rites of the Iewiſh law, feeding his groſſe children with ſuch vnſauery excrements, for ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tearmeth them <hi>ad Philip. 3. verſ.</hi> 8. as Chriſt long ſince in the ending of that Law hath caſt out of the myſtical body of his church, as not conteining any true noriſhment of ſoules in them; &amp; vainely endeauoureth to illuminate thoſe which obſerue ſhadows, who haue happily ſince Chriſts time liued in the cleere ſunſhine of heauenly graces, planting like a fooliſh buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

By which Sabaoth cannot be meant the feaſts of Trumpets, Tabernacles, Expiation, and other ſuch ceremoniall and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh feſtiuities, as <hi>Traske</hi> heretically co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menteth. For albeit thoſe feaſts be called indeed (<hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.) Sabboths, or daies of reſt, becauſe all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall workes were alike forbidden in them, as on the ſeauenth day: yet the Apoſtle reſt rayneth the word <hi>Sabaoth</hi> in this place, to ſignifie the weekly Sabaoths of the Iewes, as appeareth firſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15085:18"/>
in that hee numbreth ſuch Iewiſh feſtiual daies diſtinctly from the Sabaoth, equally forbiding the obſeruance of them both.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond reaſon why he prohibiteth them conteyned in that part of the text, <hi>quae ſunt vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra &amp;c.</hi> which are ſhaldowes of future good thinges, equally agreeth to them both: for as thoſe feaſts were ſhaddows and types, ſo were the weekly Sabaoths alſo. Wherfore <hi>Ebion</hi> and his diſciples, the firſt hereticall obſeruers of our Lords day and the Iewiſh Sabaoths togeather, as witneſſeth <hi>S. Epiphanius haerſ. 30. S. Irenaeus lib. 1. cap.</hi> 26. preſſed with the authority of this place, and perceauing the vnanſwerablenes therof, rather then they would therunto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their doctrines, abſolutly reiected all <hi>S. Paules</hi> Epiſtles, and accounted him an Apoſtata from the Iewiſh faith: The which <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> ſeemeth not yet to do, albeit hee dared once to ſay of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> that he ſought to pleaſe men, ſo conſequently could not be the true ſeruant of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I deduce out of Scripture this The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The Iews for the like reſpect, &amp; memory of Gods reſt, were as well bound to obſerue ech Sabaoth of years, &amp; the Sabaoth of that yearly Sabaoth, called the Iubily, or 50. year, as to keep the weekly Sabaoth of daies, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25. But thoſe yearly Sabaoths, are certainely (I ſuppoſe in <hi>Traskes</hi> opinion) abrogated: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the weekly Sabaoth is no longer to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15085:19"/>
Gods precepts thereof deliured out of fire to the people, and written wit his owne ſinger in the Decalogue, eſpecially inſtanced by <hi>Traske,</hi> being meere circumſtances impertinent to the morality therof, further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer queſtion already declared: Gods comaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement whether giuen out of fire, or not being ſufficient of it ſelfe to oblige his creatures to the perpetuall obſeruance of any Law for morality of life fit to be obſerued. And no learned man will deny but that many precepts, neither deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of fire, nor written in the Decalogue Tables were morall, and as ſuch, are now to be obſerued by Chriſtians: as for a man not to marry his Fathers wife, his ſiſter, his daughter &amp;c. The prohibition of vſury and ſundry other like moral precepts, amongſt which (though falſely) <hi>Traske</hi> numbreth the legall difference of meates, albeit it was neither commaunded out of fire, nor written in the Decalogue Tables.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly I argue, that <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> hath no ſufficient authority of Scripture, prouing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of the Iewiſh Sabaoth: for our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours obſeruance thereof little importeth for this purpoſe, the Law wherunto he voluntarily &amp; in obedience to his Father ſubiected himſelfe, being not before his death determined, ſo that he practiſed likewiſe Circumciſion, and many other cerimoniall rites, now vnlawfull to Chriſtians. The practiſe alſo of the Apoſtles, entring commonly, after Chriſts death, into
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15085:19"/>
the Temple, and other Iewiſh Sinagogues on their Sabaoth, maketh as little as our Sauiours example to proue the continuance thereof, this their practiſe being in no text of their holy Acts teſtified. Wherein likewiſe the holy Euangeliſt inſinuateth not, the motiue &amp; end of this their Cuſtome to haue ben not ſo much a religions obſeruation of that Sabaoth, as a more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and generall inſtruction of the Iewes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Law &amp; Prophets, fulfilled in Chriſt their expected Meſſias, they being in thoſe dayes and places chiefly aſſembled and beſt prepared to haue ſuch ſpirituall doctins propounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the Apoſtles: Who for celebration of Chriſt ſupper, preaching, and other publique exerciſes of Chriſtian piety and deuotion, were accuſtomed to meete on the firſt day of the week, called therefore our Lords day <hi>Apocal.</hi> 2. becauſe our Lord had then ſanctified the ſame by his reſurrection, and commaunded the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obſeruance therof, as ſhall in my next Queſtion bee fully diſcuſſed.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> will further contend, that the Apoſtles for other religious reſpects beſides preaching of Chriſt, entred the Temples and Sinagogues on the Sabaoth, and feſtiuall daies, as <hi>Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21. verſ.</hi> 23. 24. 25. where <hi>S. Paul</hi> not to auert the whole nation of the Iewes from Chriſt, did by the counſell of <hi>S. Iames</hi> purify him ſelfe with other <hi>Nazaretts,</hi> and ſo enter the Temple, that he might ſeeme to obſerue the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15085:20"/>
Law as other Iewes conuerted vnto Chriſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commonly did. I anſwere, this conditionall obſeruance of the Sabaoth and other cerimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall rites for a time by the Apoſtles, was only permitted by Chriſt, as a charitable meanes the better to vnite the Iewes and Gentills in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of one Church: The giuer of the Law (ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> writing to <hi>S. Hierome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi> 19.) hauing ſo determined to end the ſame with his owne death, and afterwards honorably to bury it, by permitting the conuerted Iewes for a while to practiſe it, vntill his Ghoſpel were ſufficiently promulgated. For (ſaith this holy Father) thoſe legall obſeruaunces were not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely to be deteſted, as the diueliſh ſacriledges of Gentills, when Chriſts grace began to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, which was in ſuch ſhadowing rites pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured; but to be permitted for a ſeaſon to their poſterity, who firſt receaued them, which after their exequies honorably performed, were by all Chriſtians to bee vtterly forſaken.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Traske</hi> wil preſſe me further to know the preciſe time, when the ceremoniall obſeruation of the Sabaoth, and other rites of <hi>Moyſes</hi> Law wholy ceaſed, and became vnlawfull to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed any more by Chriſtians. I anſwere him, that peraduenture vntill the very deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſubuerſion of the Temple, more then 40. yeares after our Sauiours paſſion, the old Sabaoth and other ceremonious rites of the Law, might be by ſome faithfull Iewes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15085:20"/>
any touch of infidelity, and falling from Chriſt, albeit vnneceſſarily and improfitably, obſerued: Gods prouidence (ſaith <hi>Origen homil. 10. in Leuit</hi>) wiſely ordaining, that the Citty, Temple, and all things els belonging to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer glory of that Law and nation, ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather deſtroied, leaſt ſucklings and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>klinges in faith, ſhould be longer allured by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and drawne away from purely imbracing Chriſtian verities ſhadowed in them. So that when our Sauiour willed his diſciples, <hi>Math. 24. verſ.</hi> 10. to pray that their flight might not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in winter, ſaith <hi>S. Ierome,</hi> becauſe extremity of could would hinder their laſting aboad in mountaines &amp; deſert places; nor in the Sabaoth becauſe the religious reſt therof would hinder their flight: which had ben idly ſpoken, ſaith <hi>Traske,</hi> if Chriſtians to whome theſe wordes were vttered, had not ben bound to a ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance of the old Sabaoth, when <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was ſacked.</p>
                  <p>I anſwere firſt this obiection, that albeit it might be gathered out of this text, that many Chriſtian Iewes did obſerue their old Sabaoth as before, vntill the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> yet can it not thence alſo be inferred, that ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians obſerued it in like manner afterwards, when they had ſeene the perfidious cruelty of their whole nation againſt Chriſt, ſo examplarly puniſhed, their citty ſacked, their Preiſts ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and Temple ſubuerted, neuer againe, by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15085:21"/>
Chriſts ſpeaches, to be reſtored, which could not but be taken by faithfull people as certaine ſignes of that law and religion wholy abrogated by Chriſt and ended, the cheifeſt exerciſes whereof conſiſted in prayers made in the Temple togeather with miſterious rites and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices therein only performed. Secondly. I anſwere, that theſe words were vttered by Chriſt to his diſciples who were naturall Iewes and members of that Commonwealth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sabaoth was by moſt people ſtrictly ſtill obſerued. Wherefore our Sauiour might well take an occaſion to vtter this ſpeach to them, which cheifly concerned the generality of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing Iewes, liuing togeather with them and obſeruing the Sabaoth, as may be inſtanced in many other examples of like ſpeaches in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Thirdly. I anſwere, that Chriſt vttered that ſpeach, as fore ſeeing that the very day in which <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould beſiege the Citty, ſhould be no other then the Paſchall ſolemnity, and great Sabaoth, wherein multitudes of people repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> from all places, ſhould be ſodai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely ſo incloſed, as they ſhould haue no meanes to fly, hauing the gates ſhut vpon them by ſuch captaines and people as vndertooke to defend the citty, and ſo narowly watched by the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoldiars, as when any were taken to fly they were vſually crucified before the walles, and being reſtained by ſuch multituds, they ſuffered vnſpeakeable famine, plague, and ſlaughters, by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15085:21"/>
externall foes and inteſtine diſſentions, which being forknowne by our Sauiour, he might wel wiſh, them to pray that their flight or cauſe of flying, to wit, the approach of <hi>Titus</hi> army, might not happen in winter, or on the Sabaoth, not that they might not lawfully fly thereon for ſafeguard of their liues, or fight againſt their enimyes, as we read of <hi>Iudas Machabaeus</hi> ſouldiers 1. <hi>Machab.</hi> 3. but becauſe all meanes of flight ſhould be hindred by the ſodaine approach of their enimies without, &amp; Iewiſh captains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Citty, and their miſeries be multiplied by occaſion of ſuch multitudes aſſembled on the Sabaoth.</p>
                  <p>Finally if <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> for continuance of the Sabaoth, ſhall obiect, as one of his diſciples ſeemed to do, that the celebration of the ſame is called, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. A ſempiternall Couenant betwene God and his people, to be obſerued with perpetuall honour in all their generations <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. I anſwere, that the like manner of ſpeach is vſed of the old <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Preiſthood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. now tranſlated into the Prieſthood of our Sauiour <hi>ad Heb. 7. v.</hi> 11. 12. 15. 16. and abrogated by <hi>Traskes</hi> owne confeſſion. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to interprete the eternal duration of ſuch rites, to import only a continuance of them, till the Law fully ended, or becauſe they ſtill remaine according to the morall &amp; eternal things ſignified by them, as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſolueth this obiection <hi>quaeſt. 46. 124. &amp; 131. in Exod.</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15085:22"/>
Chriſtians are expreſſely forbidden to play the Iewes, and to be idle on the Sabaoth, and willed with all to obſerue and prefer our Lords day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. So as if any teſtimonies of antiquity might be by <hi>Traske</hi> and his Companions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and held ſufficient to proue the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall tranſlation of the Sabaoth, there would need no other arguments to refute, and reduce them from their idle and ſinguler fancies, then thoſe former vndoubted authorities of ancient &amp; learned Fathers. But as he &amp; his companions are wholy ignorant &amp; vnacquainted with their workes, ſo are they fully bent to contemne all ſuch Teſtimonies, which they find not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by plaine texts of ſcripture, as themſelues only are pleaſed to expound them.</p>
                  <p>For whereas not only the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but <hi>Ebion</hi> alſo himſelfe, and his diſciples acknowledged their hereticall doctrine of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh feaſts and Sabaoths neceſſary to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Chriſtians, togeather with their owne Dominicall daies and proper feſtiuities, to haue beene expreſly contradicted and condemned by <hi>S. Paul ad Coloſſ.</hi> 2. reiecting thereupon all his Epiſtles from the Canon of Scripture; theſe new <hi>Ebionites,</hi> by ſhifting comments, and abſurd gloſſes of their owne deuiſing, ſeeke to delude the text, and drawe it againſt all ancient expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions therof, to be only vnderſtood of cerimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall feaſts mentioned in the 23. of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> only becauſe they are there called <hi>Sabaothes.</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:15085:23"/>
Whereas the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth ſuch feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall daies from the weekly Sabaoth, and equally in this text forbiddeth the obſeruance of them both to Chriſtians. Which true expoſition heere ſuppoſed, I conclude this argument. One day of ſeauen is ſtill as a morall precept to be holily obſerued by all Chriſtians. But the obſeruance of the old Sabaoth is prohibited by the Apoſtle to Chriſtians, and no other day introduced in place thereof, but the day of our Sauiours Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Therfore that day only, and not the Iewiſh Sabaoth, is ſtill as a morall precept to be holily obſerued by Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> is moſt delighted with Sillogiſticall collections, albeit himſelfe be ſo little skilled in Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, as writing lately againſt an Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he denied the <hi>Minor</hi> of his <hi>Enthimeme,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that Chriſt was, as he tould the Iewes, <hi>Dominus Sabati,</hi> and had full power either by himſelfe, or his Apoſtles to abrogate and alter as well as to inſtitute &amp; approue the obſeruance thereof; I frame this argument. That day of the ſeauen is by Chriſtians now weekly to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, which the Apoſtles themſelues allotted for their holy Aſſemblies, and other publique exerciſes of their Chriſtian faith. But the day which the Apoſtles ſo allotted &amp;c. was the firſt day of the weeke, and not the Iewiſh Sabaoth. Wherfore the firſt day of the weeke, &amp; not the Iewiſh Sabaoth is to be obſerued by Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:15085:23"/>The <hi>Maior,</hi> or former part of my Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is certaine, becauſe ſuch publique aſſemblies and exerciſes of faith, are the chiefe end, for which the Sabaoth, and other feſtiuall daies were firſt ordayned. The <hi>Minor,</hi> or latter part is clearely proued by the practiſe of the Apoſtles <hi>Act. 20. v.</hi> 6. 7. where <hi>S. Paul,</hi> &amp; many other Diſciples, of ſeauen whole daies which they ſpent in <hi>Troas,</hi> are read only to haue aſſembled themſelues for preaching &amp; frequenting Sacraments, which are the moſt publike exerciſes of faith, on the firſt day of the weeke, and not on the Iewiſh Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth. Likewiſe on that day, the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor. 16. verſ.</hi> 1. 2. willed the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth</hi> to make their Collects, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon gatheringes for the poore brethren at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which is an euident ſigne that Chriſtians vſed to aſſemble themſelues on that day, there being no reaſon to be yealded why ſuch common collections of almes ſhould be rather on the firſt day of the weeke, then any of the reſt, but that Chriſtians vſed only therein to make their holy Sinaxes &amp; conuents for praier, preaching, almes, frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sacraments &amp;c. mentioned by holy <hi>Iuſtin</hi> in <hi>Apolog.</hi> 2. to <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> and other Gouerners of the Empire in behalfe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſundry of thoſe holy Fathers formerly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I make this Argument for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance of the ſunday in place of the Sabaoth. That day of the weeke is chiefly to be obſerued
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15085:24"/>
by Chriſtians, which our Lord was pleaſed to make, and haue called his owne day. But our Lord did make and call his owne day, the firſt day of the weeke, and not the Iewiſh Sabaoth. Therfore the firſt day of the weeke, and not the Iewiſh Sabaoth, is eſpecially to be obſerued by Chriſtians. The <hi>maior</hi> is certaine, becauſe as Chriſtians are bound by their faithfull profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to honor Chriſt himſelfe with thankefull &amp; humble ſeruices; ſo doth the wiſdome of faith teach them alſo eſpecially to honor and eſteeme that day of all others moſt holy, which their Lord himſelfe moſt reſpected, and did chooſe to make, and haue called his owne day. For as to name any day, <hi>the day of a King,</hi> importeth that day to be ſpecially regarded by the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and feſtiually obſerued by his ſubiects in memory of ſome victory obteyned, or memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good, happened to himſelfe or his people on the ſame: ſo for ſuch holy and memorable reſpects, the firſt day of the weeke is called <hi>our Lords day, Apocalyp.</hi> 2. 5. worthieſt of all other daies of the weeke to be honored, and feſtiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued by Chriſtians as ſhall be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proued in my next Argument. My <hi>minor</hi> is proued cleerely by that former text of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> expreſly calling one day of the weeke or yeare as a familiar name knowne to all Chriſtians in his time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Diem Dominicum,</hi> our Lords day, to wit, a day eſpecially ſanctified by Chriſt, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to his ſeruice which was not the Sabaoth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15085:24"/>
of the Iewes, no where els in Scripture ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor any other day but <hi>vna,</hi> or <hi>prima Sabbati,</hi> the next after the ſabaoth, as <hi>S. Ignatius S. Iohns</hi> ſcholler teſtifieth <hi>epist. 6. ad Magneſianos,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that after the Sabaoth ech louer of Chriſt celebrateth <hi>Diem Dominicum,</hi> our Lords day, conſecrated to our Lords Reſurrection, <hi>regina &amp; principium omnium dierum,</hi> the cheifeſt and principalleſt of all other daies &amp;c. els where <hi>Epiſt 8. ad Philippenſes,</hi> he conteſteth, that if any Chriſtian celebrateth his Eaſter with the Iews, or their other Symbolicall feſtiuities, amongſt which the Sabaothes are included, he maketh himſelfe partaker with thoſe who killed Chriſt and his Apoſtles. <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> alſo to omit many other like teſtimonies of ancient Fathers, <hi>ſerm. 251. de tempore,</hi> teacheth the religions ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of our Lords day to haue beene inſtituted by the Apoſtles themſelues, becauſe our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our therein roſe from death to life, and to haue beene by them called <hi>our Lords day,</hi> that we might learne by that name to abſtaine therein from ſin, and earthly labours, attending to diuine ſeruices. And after much honourable mention made of that day, he ſaith, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Doctors of Chriſts Church, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Apoſtles, decreed to transfer on that day al the glory of the Iewiſh Sabaoth, that what they celebrated in Types we might celebrate in Verities &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly the precept of the Sabaoth obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15085:25"/>
Chriſtians no further then it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to conteyne a moral law, neceſſary to direct them in their religious duty, and thankfulnes towards Almighty God for benefitts. But the obſeruance of our Lords day is fitter to direct Chriſtians in their duty towards God, &amp; to put them in mind of his gracious benefitts towards them, then the obſeruance of the old Sabaoth. Therfore our Lords day, not the old Sabaoth, is now commaunded, and fitteſt to be obſerned by Chriſtians. The <hi>maior</hi> is certaine becauſe all cerimoniall and iudiciall precepts are confeſſed by <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> to haue beene abrogated by Chriſt; and no law of the old Teſtament bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Chriſtians which is not morally expedient and neceſſary to direct them in their Chriſtian duty and ſeruice. My <hi>minor</hi> may be beſt proued by examining and comparing the inſtitution and ends for which our Lords day and the old Sabaoth were firſt ordayned and obſerued.</p>
                  <p>The old Sabaoth was cheifely ordayned in memory of Gods reſt from his labours, of creating all things in ſix daies, and therefore <hi>Philo lib. de opificio mundi,</hi> wiſely calleth it the worlds birth-day, ſeruing for a continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Gods people in the knowledge of their creator, and to exclude the error of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers commonly teaching the world to haue had no beginning. Secondly it ſerued to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that reſt, which God had giuen vnto them after their <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſeruitude,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15085:25"/>
and painefull labours ended, as is expreſly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Deut. 5. verſ.</hi> 15. Thirdly it declared them to be a peculiar people, ſanctifyed by God and deuoted to his ſeruice <hi>Exod. 31 verſ.</hi> 13. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Iewes Sabaoth allegorically prefigured Chriſts reſt in his ſepulcher, after his paynefull labours for mans redemption ended, as is inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated by <hi>S. Paul ad Hebr. 4. verſ.</hi> 10. Fifthly in a tripologicall ſenſe it ſignifyed the ſpirituall reſt of ſoules, after the ſeruile workes of ſinne by Chriſts grace ended, as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> teacheth vs <hi>tract. 30. in Ioan.</hi> and in ſundry other places. Sixtly is was Anagogically a figure of that reſt which holy ſoules after this labourſome life en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, were to enioy in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, as is inſinuated by S. <hi>Paul ad Hebr. 4. verſ.</hi> 6. &amp; 11. and is alſo taught by <hi>S. Auguſtine epiſt.</hi> 119.</p>
                  <p>For all which holy reſpects and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſignifications it was expedient and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the old Sabaoth ſhould be changed by Chriſt into that bleſſed day, on which himſelfe was borne for mans redemption, to wit, the firſt day of the weeke, as may be Mathematically demonſtrated by ſearching backwards the Cicle of Dominical letters, which will be found on the 25. of December in the ſecond yeare of the hundred and ninty fourth Olympiade; of Rome firſt built 754. from <hi>Ceſars</hi> death 42. from the Triumuirate began by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> 41. of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods raigne. 29. when our Sauiour was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borne, to haue beene B. Secondly on that firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:15085:26"/>
day of the weeke he roſe, and began humanely to lead his glorious immortall life, as may be expreſly gathered from the laſt chapter of all 4. Euangeliſts. Thirdly, on that day he viſibly infuſed his holy ſpirit on the Apoſtles, in the day of Pentecoſt, to wit, the fiftith day after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Azimes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iews began to number their day of Pentecoſt, which happened to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletly e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the yeare of our Sauiours paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on ſunday, as is learnedly proued by <hi>Ribera de feſtis Iudaeorum Cap. de Pentecoſte,</hi> by <hi>Bellar de Cultu Sanctorum lib. 3. Cap.</hi> 13. and ſundry other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. So as three of the greateſt myſteries of our Sauiours life, and moſt ſingular benefitts that God could deuiſe to beſtow on mankind happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on our Lords day, to ſanctify and make it more worthy then the Iewes Sabaoth, to be by vs Chriſtians weekely celebrated, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
                  <p>To which holy reſpects we may add alſo theſe, that God created the earth, the heauens &amp; Angelicall creatures on that day, graciouſly ſo therein preparing the locall place of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Beatitude and heauently repoſe, ſignified better by ours, then the Iewiſh Sabaoth, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our companions therein an earthely ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in the meane while to honour him in this life, and make our ſelues by his graces wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our future glorification. All Types of the old Sabaoth are in the myſteries of this fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. This day is a gracious Symbole, or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15085:26"/>
ſigne of our ſpeciall deuotion towards Chriſt, a holy memoriall of ſpirituall graces receaued from him, as the other was chiefly of Gods temporall benefits towards his creatures. So as they ſeeme to be Iewes rather, then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who againſt the vniuerſall and known practiſe of Chriſts Church, ſince the Apoſtles tyme, eſteeme the old Sabaoth more holy, and worthy to be obſerued, then our Lords day, made for ſuch high and myſterious reſpects, memorable to Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul ad Hebr.</hi> 4. plainely ſuppoſeth Chriſt to haue inſtituted a new Sabatiſme, or day of reſt for his people in memory of his reſt, after the labours which he ſuſtayned for our redemption ended, as God ordayned from the beginning, a holy day in memory of his owne reſt after his workes of creation perfected. And from the myſticall ſignification of theſe two diſtinct Sabaothes ſucceding ech other, and ſimbolizing a double reſt of Gods people, the one in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as our Sauiour tearmeth the place, wherein the Patriarches before him reſted, and the other in heauen with himſelfe after his Reſurrection; he taketh an occaſion to exhort the Hebrewes, that ſithence their Forefathers entred not through their incredulity into Gods reſt, figured by the firſt Sabaoth, they ſhould haſten to enter into the reſt of Chriſt, by the day of his new Sabaoth repreſented, from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15085:27"/>
which Text litterally, ſo, and truly explicated, I make this argument.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Sabaoth repreſenting that reſt which God gaue to his people before Chriſt, of which it is ſayd <hi>Geneſis</hi> 2. he reſted the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day from his workes &amp;c. is ended accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apoſtle <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. &amp; 8. and a new Sabaoth, or Symbolicall day of reſt was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould by <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ordayned by Chriſt after his labours ended <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. 10. But no new Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth or Symbolicall day of reſt, diſtinct from the ſeauenth day can be vnderſtood to haue beene mentioned by <hi>Dauid,</hi> and inſtituted by Chriſt after his labours ended, <hi>praeter diem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicum,</hi> beſides the day of his glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Therefore the old Sabaoth figuring the reſt, whereunto God inuited holy people before Chriſt, is now ended, and the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall day, ſymbolizing the new reſt which Chriſtians inuited holy ſoules vnto is in place thereof happily ſucceeded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> lately entred into a humor of reading hiſtories that he might ſeeme skilled in ſome other good ſtudies, beſides the knowledg of Scriptures, may chance to ſtumble vpon an obiection ſeemingly ſufficient to proue the continuance at leaſt of the old Sabaoth, togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our Lords day. For example <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Niſſen</hi> in his Oration againſt ſuch as broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not reprehenſions, asketh an Heretike, with what eyes he ſaw our Lords day, who deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15085:27"/>
the Sabaoth, theſe dayes being brethren, ſo as he that reproacheth the one wrongeth the other alſo. <hi>Socrates lib. 6. hiſt. cap.</hi> 8. affirmeth the Sabaoth and our Lords day to be the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feaſts of Chriſtians, wherein they were wont to aſſemble themſelues. And <hi>Anaſtaſius Nicenus lib quaest.</hi> 77. affirmeth thoſe two dayes to be holy and feſtiuall. The Apoſtolicall Church alſo of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> doth at this day religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerue both Sabaoths: ſo as the old Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth by theſe hiſtoricall paſſages, and other authenticall teſtimonies of antiquity, ſeemeth not to haue beene abrogated by the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto I anſwere, that albeit the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles abrogated the old Sabaoth, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lords day in place thereof, as is already proued in this and my former queſtion, yet afterwards Chriſtian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, occaſionally, and for a while only in many Eaſterne Churches renewed a feſtiuall and Chriſtian obſeruance thereof, not that they held the Moyſaicall precept ſtill to oblige them thereunto, as doth <hi>Iohn Traſke</hi> and his diſciples, or that as <hi>Ebion,</hi> they held it neceſſary for all Chriſtians equally to obſerue both Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baothes, whoſe opinion all the ancient Fathers are knowne generally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to haue deteſted. But for a holy and zealous refutation of the <hi>Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Menandrians, Cerinthians, Carpocratians, Baſilidians, Marcioniſtes,</hi> and other like Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tykes, who to reproach the Author of the old
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15085:28"/>
Teſtament, whom they tearmed <hi>An euill God</hi> &amp; leaſt they might ſeeme to honor him in any ſort, feaſted on the Sabaoth, as <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>haereſ.</hi> 42. the holy Paſtours and people of Chriſts Church in a zealous deteſtation of their blaſphemies, and to ſhew the ſame God to haue beene author of both Teſtaments faithfully and fittly for a tyme obſerued both Sabaothes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding any Chriſtian vnder grieuous penalties to faſt on Saturday more then on our Lords day, one Saturday only excepted wherein our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our lay dead in his ſepulcher, as is expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>S. Ignatius Epist. ad Philipenſes,</hi> in the 55. Apoſtolicall Canon, and in ſundry other ancient Authors. Which Chriſtian and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall obſeruance of the old Sabaoth is knowne not to haue beene generally practiſed, but only in particuler Churches, wherein ſuch heretikes liued: and as thoſe Hereſies ceaſed, the feſtiuall keeping of the Sabaoth ceaſed alſo, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans feaſted aſwell on it, as on friday in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Sauiours death, and the Apoſtles ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row continued vntill his ioyfull Reſurrection, as is expreſly affirmed by <hi>Innocentius epiſt. 2. c. 4. Hieron. epiſt. 97. August. epiſt.</hi> 86. &amp; 18. by <hi>Caſſianus collat. 3. cap. 10 &amp;c.</hi> As for the <hi>Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſtill obſeruing the Sabaoth, I anſwere, that they are knowne to haue byn corrupted ſince their Apoſtolicall conuerſion with many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and Iudaical doctrines, practiſing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and ſundry other rites of <hi>Moyſes</hi> law, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15085:28"/>
to Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>An other Argument much vſed by <hi>Traskes</hi> Diſciples is, that if circumciſion were by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe decree of the Apoſtles <hi>Act.</hi> 15. repealed, with much more reaſon was the Sabaoth by their like decree to haue ben abrogated alſo, conſidering that the Commandement thereof was included amongeſt the other morall, and ſtill continuing precepts of the Decalogue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles &amp;c. Wherunto I anſwere firſt, that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was indeed by the Apoſtles declared to be a burdenſome and vnneceſſary precept, to be impoſed on the Gentills. But to the Iewes it was abrogated only, as generally the Sabaoth was, by the contrary doctrine of the Apoſtles, ſufficiently warranting and ſecuring the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any good Chriſtian, to belieue and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe any point of Religion taught by them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we read of no Apoſtolicall Synode purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely made to determine the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I anſwere, that an expreſſe decree was more neceſſary to haue ben made by the Apoſtles of abrogating the practiſe of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion then of transferring the Sabaoth to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more myſterious and memorable day; the determination of the ſeauenth day rather then any other being as I haue els where declared, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall to the religious obſeruance of Gods Commandement, binding only according to the morall end, and intention thereof, faithfull people to abſtaine in one day of ſeauen from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15085:29"/>
ſeruile labours, and to deuote the ſame to Gods eſpeciall honor and ſeruice: whereas the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Circumciſion giuen before <hi>Moyſes,</hi> as a couenant and ſigne, diſtinguiſhing <hi>Abrahams</hi> holy poſterity from other faithleſſe people, was wholy to be repealed, notwithſtanding the Iewes ſo highly regarded it, as not to conuerſe or admit into their Temple any one that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that holy ſeale, and ſigne of Gods couenant with them.</p>
                  <p>Other arguments more friuolous &amp; leſſe important I willingly omit, being loath to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine my Reader needlesly, and impertinently in them, wiſhing heere for a finall concluſion of this queſtion, that <hi>Io. Traske</hi> and his brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren would maturely conſider the finall iſſue of their vnchriſtian and exorbitant doctrines, disliked by our Soueraigne and State, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by all learned men comming to heare of them, and vtterly as yet vnheard of in other partes of Chriſtendome: ſo as the firſt Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and obſtinate Profeſſers of them can truly belonge to no Chriſtian Church, preſent now, or paſt in any age before them.</p>

And laſtly it is to be feared, that falling more and more from their Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profeſſion, they will with <hi>Adam Neuſerus, Bernardinus Ochinus,</hi> and other Puritan Deuines finally forſake Chriſt, and imbrace Iudaiſme, or Turciſme, the fearefull ſequell and iuſt puniſhment of ſuch fantaſtical ſpirits, as will imbrace no Religion but of their owne deuiſing, nor be obedient children to any Church, but of their owne raiſing.</p>
                  <p>But let <hi>Iohn Traske,</hi> and his Diſciples celebrate what Paſchall they will, and on what day they pleaſe, our Paſchal-Lambe according

reaſon, to obſerue the entire Law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> &amp; ſo cannot be longer a Chriſtian. He was wont heeretofore to vnderſtand that text of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>ad Coloſſ. 2. Let not man iudge or diſcouer you in meate or drinke, or new moones, or part of a feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall day &amp;c.</hi> of the Ceremoniall feaſts of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes mentioned <hi>Leuitic.</hi> 23. abrogated by Chriſt, amongſt which the feaſt of <hi>Azimes</hi> is firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.

                  <p>For long before <hi>Victors</hi> decree thereof, <hi>Pius</hi> his holy predeceſſor, as. <hi>Euſebius</hi> recounteth in his Chronicle, declared it to haue byn an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall doctrine that Chriſtians ſhould keep their Eaſter on the Sunday, and not on the 14. of March-moone, as the Iewes celebrated their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15085:31"/>
Paſchall. <hi>Socrates</hi> alſo <hi>lib. 5. hiſt. cap.</hi> 21. expreſly affirmeth, that <hi>S. Peter &amp; S. Paul</hi> taught in the Roman and other Weſtern Churches the like Dominicall obſeruaunce of Eaſter, which is alſo teſtified by <hi>S. Protenius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> in his Epiſtly to <hi>S. Leo,</hi> wherein he teſtifieth alſo, that <hi>S. Marke</hi> introduced the ſame manner of keeping Eaſter in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Churches <hi>S. Ignatius</hi> who ſaw our Lord himſelf in fleſh, who alſo conuerſed with many of the Apoſtles, and was the ſecond Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> after <hi>S. Peter,</hi> in his epiſtle to the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> not only taught them to keepe holy our Lords day, as the queene and chiefeſt of all other daies conſecrated to our Sauiours Reſurrection, but alſo he conteſteth <hi>Epiſt. ad Philip.</hi> that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian celebrating his Paſchall with the Iewes, maketh himſelfe thereby a partaker with thoſe who killed our Lord himſelfe, and his Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Neither was the decre of keeping Eaſter on the Sunday lightly made in <hi>Victors</hi> tyme, but grauely and maturely determined in many holy and learned Synods of Biſhops, aſſembled by <hi>Victors</hi> appointement, before he proceeded to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his chronicle alſo teſtifieth; in ſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids the Councell which <hi>Victor</hi> himſelfe called at <hi>Rome, Theophilus</hi> metropolitan of <hi>Ceſaraea, Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> Patriarth of <hi>Hieruſalem, Palmas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Pontus, S.

Prouinces aſſembled Synods, and with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from no other fountayne then the certaine doctrine &amp; tradition of the Apoſtles themſelues determined the Dominicall obſeruance of Eaſter. So that <hi>Policrates</hi> aſſertion hauing byn taught by <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> the Quartadeciman manner of keeping the yearly feaſt of our Sauiours Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, ſeemeth to be againſt <hi>S. Iohns</hi> owne writing, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 2. calling Sunday, <hi>Diem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum,</hi> our Lords day, for the reaſon formerly aſſigned by his ſcoller <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to wit, becauſe it was ſanctified, and chiefely aboue all other dayes obſerued by Chriſtians for our Sauiours Reſurrection which theron hapned. And if in a feſtiuall and holy memory of that ſacred myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Apoſtles themſelues inſtituted a weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſeruance of that day; how can it be wiſely thought that they would haue the anniuerſary day it ſelfe of our Sauiours Reſurrection not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated on that determinate day alſo? Wherfore, as we may ſuppoſe, that which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> only permitted in <hi>Aſia</hi> for the peace of thoſe Churches, touching their Quartadeciman ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance of Eaſter, <hi>Policrates</hi> partially and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakingly affirmeth it to haue beene taught by the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>S. Irenaeus</hi> agreeing with <hi>Victor</hi> in his doctrine, yet ſeeming to blame him for ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſeuerity vſed in excommunicating the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches for a practiſe tolerated in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> long before by his holy predeceſſours; I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15085:32"/>
that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> peraduenture knew not <hi>Victors</hi> motiues of doing ſo, which was to reſiſt <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> errours then newly begun to be broached in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and to cut quickly off <hi>Blaſtus</hi> Iudaicall innouations, riſing euen in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, and much confirmed by that legall manner of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Eaſter, which made holy <hi>Victor</hi> to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a violent remedy to cure a dangerous wound then begining to corrupt the purity of Chriſtian doctrine in many Churches: the caſe of the Aſian Biſhops being not the ſame then, as it was in <hi>S. Policarpes</hi> dayes. For wheras before they only by permiſſion obſerued Eaſter with the Iewes, in <hi>Victors</hi> time they held it to be an Apoſtolical inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neceſſary to be imbraced by all other Churches. In which decree <hi>Victor</hi> was according to his name truly <hi>Victorious,</hi> the whole Church of Chriſt taking afterwards part with him, and numbring the Quartadeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans amongſt other Iudaizing heretikes: and the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, as S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> writeth in his booke of Synods, reclaymed multitudes of them, renewing Pope <hi>Victors</hi> decree of keeping Eaſter on the Sunday, and ordayning that the Patriarches of <hi>Alexandria</hi> for the Aegyptian skill aboue other Nations, in computing yeares and dayes, ſhould be appointed to order yearly the Paſchall Cicles, and by their Epiſtles firſt directed to the Roman Biſhop, and by him to other Churches, to determine the Sunday, on which Eaſter day was yearly to be obſerued by

Chriſtians, as is teſtified by <hi>S.

                  <p>But that thoſe birds and beaſts are not ſayd to haue beene then vncleane for food and vnlawfully to be eaten, as afterwards in <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Law they were declared to be, I proue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before the floud they ſeeme not at all to haue beene by holy people vſed for food, and after <hi>Noahs</hi> tyme vntill <hi>Moyſes</hi> Law giuen, all meats, but ſtrangled and bloud, were freely permitted. The former of theſe two aſſertions, I proue by this vnanſwerable argument. Holy people before the floud did only eate ſuch meats as God had licenſed and appointed them
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15085:35"/>
for food. But before the floud no fleſh or fiſh was by God licenſed, &amp; appointed vnto them for food, but only hearbs &amp; fruits of the earth as Gods owne words do expreſly import, <hi>Gen. 1. verſ.</hi> 29. ſaying: <hi>Behold I haue giuen you all kind of hearbs that ſeed vpon the earth, and all trees that haue in themſelues ſeed of their owne kind to be your meate &amp;c.</hi> not mentioning fiſh, birds, or beaſts, as afterwards he did to <hi>Noah</hi> and his poſterity <hi>cap. 9. verſ.</hi> 2. 3. Wherefore only hearbs &amp; fruits of the earth were then eaten by holy people.</p>
                  <p>And a double reaſon may be yealded, why ſuch hearbes and fruites of the earth were more ſufficient for mans ſuſtenance before the floud then after. Firſt for that the earth was by the deluge of ſalt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> waters corrupted, and altered from the former fertility therof, and yealded not ſuch wholſome and nouriſhing fruites as it did before, whilſt it purely remayned in that eſtate wherein God created it, and whilſt the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, as I may terme it, of hearbes and trees remayned, which God himſelfe had out of the earth produced Secondly alſo for that mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in proceſſe of time became weakned, and leſſe able by the fruites of the earth to be ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then it was before, when it newly came out of Gods own omnipotent hands, that did temper and frame the ſame in all naturall perfection, and ordaine it no doubt long after ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, as it appeareth by the laſting liues of our firſt humane progenitors, and their naturall

Secondly the endes for which this diſtinction of meates was holily ordained by God, do ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare it to haue byn cerimoniall then, and in no ſort now appertaining to the morall obſeruance of our Chriſtian duties. The firſt &amp; chiefeſt end therof expreſſed by God himſelfe, <hi>Deut. 14. verſ.</hi> 2. was, that this obſeruance of meates might be a note and diſtinctiue ſigne of his people. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moyſes) thou art holy to thy Lord God, and he hath choſen thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all other nations of the earth to be his peculiar people, eate not things vncleane.</hi> So that this <hi>Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icall</hi> difference of meates was part of that middle vnmortered wall of Cerimoniall and Iudiciall Precepts, ſeparating for a time Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills, vntill our Sauiour threw it downe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning in him ſelfe the foundation &amp; corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone both people in the ſpirituall edifice and building of his Church, <hi>ad Epheſ. 2. verſ.</hi> 14. &amp; 15. ſo that now as there is no diſtinction fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made betweene Iew and Gentil <hi>ad Rom. 3. verſ. 9. &amp; 29. Act. 15. verſ.</hi> 6. and as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and other diſtinctiue ſignes, cauſing enmity and diuiſion betweene thoſe two people, now vnited in Chriſt, are by his death on the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15085:37"/>
croſſe taken away and deſtroyed: So is the law of difference impoſed for that end, euacuated alſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as marriage with Gentills was forbidden to the Iewes, for that it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene by God to be an occaſion to ſeduce and drawe them from their faithfull profeſſion, <hi>Exod. 34. verſ.</hi> 16. as was lamentably experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in <hi>Salomon 3. Reg. 11. v.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. and many other Iewes by that meanes corrupted: So for the ſame cauſe, Almighty God was pleaſed to inioyne them ſuch a ſtrict abſtinence, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of ſundry meates, vſed by the Gentills round about them, and ſuch purifications for any that did either touch thoſe meates, or ſuch perſons as had eaten them, that the Iewes for a neceſſary obſeruance of their law, were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a manner to abſtaine from all ciuill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and conuerſation with ſuch Gentile nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as might be powerfull to ſeduce them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it a great abhomination euen to enter into them, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> tould <hi>Cornelius, Act. 10. verſ.</hi> 28. Which reaſon of forbidding meates is now taken away by the happy conuerſion of Gentile people to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly theſe vncleane foules and beaſts forbidden in <hi>Moyſes</hi> law, figured the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure manners and abhominable rites of the Gentills, as appeareth by <hi>S. Peters</hi> viſion <hi>Act. 10. verſ.</hi> 11. by which our Sauiour myſtically taught him to account no man vncleane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15085:38"/>
before he had done, <hi>ibid. verſ.</hi> 8. Wherfore as the Gentils ſpirituall vncleaneſſe was cleanſed by their faith in Chriſt, <hi>Act. 15. verſ.</hi> 9. ſo was the figure therof to ceaſe alſo. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, and all other endes of the cerimoniall law of meates, ceaſing at Chriſts comming, the obligation of the law it ſelfe was abrogated alſo. A third Argument to proue the legall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of meates to haue beene cerimoniall &amp; appertaining to the Iewes only, whilſt they remayned diſtinguiſhed from other people, may be gathered from theſe wordes ſo often repeated by God in the ordinance of that law, <hi>They ſhalbe vncleane to you, abhominable to you, execrable to you &amp;c.</hi> which manners of ſpeach import that in themſelues and to other nations they were not ſo, but by his forbidding of them only made ſo.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the ſame arguments by which <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> vſually proueth this law of meates to be morall, and not cerimoniall, proue many other Iudiciall partes of <hi>Moyſes</hi> law morall alſo, and ſtill to be obſerued by Chriſtians. <hi>Traskes</hi> common argument is, that the Scriptures being perfect, muſt expreſly containe a ſufficient and particuler rule to direct Chriſtians in all things, concerning their duty towards God, and ciuill conuerſation amongſt themſelues, as what to eate, what to weare &amp;c. but this particuler rule &amp; direction of meats, for example, to be eaten or not eaten by Chriſtians, is no where expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15085:38"/>
but in the 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Leuitic.</hi> and 19. of <hi>Deutr.</hi> Therefore the Law of meats conteyned in thoſe Chapters is morall, &amp; ſtill to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Chriſtians. The <hi>Maior</hi> of which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is falſe, that the Scriptures muſt expreſly &amp; particulerly inſtruct vs in all naturall actions as what to eate, what to weare &amp;c. For God hath giuen vs a naturall Law to direct vs ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently in ſuch particuler actions, according to moral and generall precepts of auoyding ſinne in them, as to eate only ſuch meats as are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome &amp; neceſſary to ſuſtaine our bodily forces, humbly thanking, and intending to ſerue our Creatour by them; to weare only ſuch gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are conuenient for our eſtate, &amp; need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to couer and keep our bodyes healthful &amp;c. leauing vs to holy liberty to exerciſe religious abſtinence and mortification in them: ſo as no other ſupernaturall rule is neceſſary to appoint either the particuler faſhions of our garments, the kinds of meats which are to be eaten, the manners of dreſſing them &amp;c. the Scriptures teaching vs not to be good Cookes or Taylers, but to be good Chriſtians, and to carry our ſelues morally, and without ſinne in all our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whereunto the ſpeciall nature of meats is wholy impertinent, as I ſhall declare more fully in my next Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> out of the generall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Chriſts graces and mercies, plentifully ordayned for faythfull, righteous, and penitent
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15085:39"/>
perſons, arrogantly preſumeth aſſuredly and infallibly to collect the particuler election of himſelfe, &amp; others of his diſciples, els why wil he ridiculouſly deny the ſufficiency of generall precepts and inſtructions to direct vs in moral and particuler actions? Or why doth he admit of many vnneceſſary trades imbraced by ſome of his chiefe diſciples, as the trade of Comfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, Perfuming &amp;c. tending in their own nature to luxury, and no where expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture, no not in ſuch places, wherein the delicacies of Kings themſelues are expreſſed, as <hi>Samuel 1. cap. 8. Paralip. 2. cap. 9. 3. Reg. cap. 10. &amp;c.</hi> Moreouer as there is no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer appointment of meats, but in thoſe Chapters of <hi>Leuitic.</hi> and <hi>Deutr.</hi> ſo is there no particuler determination of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts againſt malefactours, and particuler lawes to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for the ciuill gouernement of people, but ſuch as are contayned in <hi>Moyſes</hi> Law: yet will not <hi>Traske</hi> I ſuppoſe, be ſo very a Iew, as to introduce amongſt Chriſtians a neceſſary practiſe of ſuch Iudicial, and ſundry other ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall precepts, ſeeming more pertinent to the morality of Chriſtians, then the legall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance of meates, neither vncleane in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as the <hi>Minicheans</hi> and other hatefull Heretikes ſuppoſed them, nor defiling in any fort the ſoules of ſuch as do eat them, with thanks and a holy intention to honour God by a temperate vſe of them. Laſtly <hi>Iohn Traske</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:15085:39"/>
admitting the legall difference and vncleanes of meats yet to continue amongſt Chriſtians, is conſequently alſo bound to admit legall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications appointed to be vſed by ſuch as had eaten, or touched them, as waſhing of their cloathes, ſecluding themſelues from humane ſociety, till the euening &amp;c. which he ſeemeth not to do, but reiecteth them as cerimonious, and impertinent now to the morall direction of Chriſtians.</p>

My purpoſe therfore is in this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15085:40"/>
briefly to declare what the naturall light of reaſon is, more fully then I haue done in the 2. Queſtion of my firſt Controuerſy, ſhewing it is perfected by ſupernaturall knowledge, and ſtill remayneth a full and perfect rule to direct vs in all naturall and morall actions.</p>
                  <p>Naturall Reaſon is in it ſelfe the eſſentiall &amp; internall clarity of mans ſoule, by the vſe wherof we are diſtinguiſhed from bruit beaſts, taught to know what is morally good and euill in our actions, &amp; made capable of grace and all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall perfection. So that whilſt we continue naturally men heere in this life, we muſt guide and gouerne our ſelues thereby in humane and morall actions: Faith being a ſupernaturall light, graciouſly by God infuſed into our ſoule, not to deſtroy naturall knowledge in vs, but to perfect the ſame two Wayes. Firſt by helping vs to a more eaſy and certayne knowledge of ſundry naturall verities, then we can ordinarily in this life attayne vnto, from the bare experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our ſenſes. Secondly by notifying vnto vs the intellectuall power of our ſoule, &amp; incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it firmely and piouſly to beleeue many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed myſteries far aboue the naturall reach &amp; capacity thereof to be diſcouered or thought vpon by vs: yet are they alwayes found ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable thereunto, as no point of faith is to be accounted credible and worthy of our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and deuout aſſent, which is in true diſcourſe repugnant to naturall reaſon &amp; iudgment in vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:15085:40"/>So that <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> and his diſciples ſeeme to deale vnreaſonably, and without iudgment, in excluding naturall reaſon and iudgement from being any rule at all in morall and humane actions; contrary to the expreſſe doctrine of <hi>S. Paul ad Rom. 2. verſ.</hi> 24. 25. 26. where he affirmeth, that the very Gentils who wanted all knowledge of a written law, were a law to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, being naturally taught to obſerue that law, and to ſhew it written in their hartes (to wit, according to the morall precepts thereof) their owne conſciences ſufficiently ſeruing to approue them in good, and to condemne them in euill actions, and ſo conſequently to be a proper rule to guide and direct them in all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and humane actions. The ſupernaturall direction of fayth, being graciouſly by Chriſt ordayned, as I haue formerly ſayd, to facilitate and explane naturall knowledge many wayes corrupted, and obſcured in vs, and happily to conduce vs to a higher degree of heauenly knowledge and Euangelicall perfection, is idly and ignorantly confounded by <hi>Traske</hi> with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall morality, and falſely made the only and proper rule of humane &amp; morall actions, which Gentill people wanted not, according to the Apoſtle, who notwithſtanding are knowne not to haue had the light of heauenly knowledg &amp; euangelicall perfection reuealed vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Which true diſtinction of a morall and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall law ſuppoſed, I heere vndertake to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15085:41"/>
proue the law of meates mentioned <hi>Leuit.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp; Deutr.</hi> 14. to haue ben meerly cerimoniall, and no way now to appertaine to the morall or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupernaturall law and direction of Chriſtians. And that the Iudaicall obſeruance of meates appertayneth not to that internall law of reaſon written by God in the hartes of all men, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teaching them to knowe the morall good and euill of their actions, and to make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of them. I proue it firſt, becauſe neuer any Philoſopher, or Wiſeman among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills can be proued to haue taught or practiſed, amongſt many other morall and excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts deliuered &amp; obſerued by them, this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of meats: but they are contrarily knowne to haue indifferently eaten all ſortes of meates, which experimentally they found wholſome, &amp; fit to ſuſtayn their bodyes, as Connies, Hares Swines fleſh, and other meates, prohibited to the Iewes. Which naturall and daily experience <hi>10. Traske</hi> ridiculouſly denieth, falſely preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to be not only legally vncleane, but vnwholſome alſo for corporall ſuſtenance, and no more created by God for food, or leſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by any law to be eaten, then toades and ſerpentes, which by the naturall precept of not killing our ſelus, we are taught to refraine from; not for that they are in themſelues naturally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, but becauſe they are in experience found to be inconuenient and hurtfull to our nature, not nouriſhed but deſtroied by them: yet was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15085:41"/>
wiſe Iewes or Chriſtians ſo abſurd before, as to teach that, for the like moral reſpect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing our naturall life, Swines fleſh was as toads and ſerpents forbidden in that precept.</p>
                  <p>Secondly holy people after the floud ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, no doubt, the morall law and diuine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections giuen them, &amp; yet as I haue proued in my former Queſtion, were no other meats but ſtrangled and bloud, and thoſe alſo for myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and figuratiue reſpects, expreſly vntill <hi>Moyſes</hi> tyme prohibited vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly our Sauiour <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. 16. 17. from common reaſon and naturall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding collecteth this vniuerſall rule and morall poſition, that nothing entring the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can defile a man, who is only made impure by ſinneful acts proceeding from his ſoule &amp;c. <hi>S. Paul</hi> alſo <hi>ad Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. morally tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, that the kingdome of heauen, or the meanes of gaining heauen is not, or conſiſteth in meate and drinke, but in iuſtice, peace and ioy in the holy Ghoſt, and he that in this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Chriſt, pleaſeth God, to wit, what meats ſoeuer he eateth. <hi>For</hi> (ſayth he, 1. <hi>ad Corinth. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>meate commendeth vs not to God.</hi> Out of which holy texts I frame this argument. Nothing is morally vncleane, and vnlawfull to Chriſtians that defileth not their ſoules: But no meats entring their bodyes can accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Sauiours owne words defile their ſoules: Therefore no meates are morally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15085:42"/>
and vnlawful to Chriſtians. The <hi>Maior</hi> of my argument is certaine, becauſe Chriſtian morality conſiſteth in freedome from ſinne. The <hi>Minor</hi> likewiſe is out of reaſon it ſelfe deduced by our Sauiours blaming his diſciples for conceauing that any meate eaten by the mouth can of it ſelfe defile the ſoule, and ſo conſequently for any natural vncleanes be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to be vſed: wherefore the legall prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of them, cannot be morall but myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and cerimoniall. Secondly I frame this argument. That which neither commendeth men to God, nor appertayneth to the gayning of heauen, as Iuſtice and other vertues do can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belong to the morall or ſupernaturall duty of a Chriſtian: But meats according to S. <hi>Paul</hi> do neither of themſelues commend vs to God, nor ſo appertayne to the gayning of heauen, as Iuſtice and other vertues do: Therfore meats of themſelues cannot belong to the morall or ſupernaturall duty of Chriſtians, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no Chriſtian is now bound to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall obſeruance of them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly <hi>S. Paul</hi> 1 <hi>ad Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. ſpeaking againſt Heretiks teaching people to abſtaine from meats which God created to be receaued with thankeſgiuing by faythfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſuch as know the truth, yieldeth this reaſon of his doctrine. <hi>Becauſe euery creature of God is good, and nothing to be reiected</hi> (to wit for meat) <hi>which is receaued with thanksgiuing: for it</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:15085:42"/>
                     <hi>is ſanctifyed by the word of God and prayer.</hi> In which Text albeit it ſhould be graunted that the Apoſtle chiefly diſputed againſt the <hi>Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Saturnians, Marcionites,</hi> and other like Heretiks, who in, and ſoone after the Apoſtles times, taught many Creatures to be ill in their owne nature, as hauing been by an euill God created, and ſo to be deteſted by Chriſtians: yet the reaſon of his doctrine is moral and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew the legall impurity of meats abrogated by our Sauiour, which I proue by this argument.</p>
                  <p>Euery Creature of God that is good, and not to be reiected, being receaued with thansk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, may lawfully be eaten by Chriſtians: But euery Creature of God is good, acording to the Apoſtle, and not to be reiected being recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with thanskgiuing: Therefore euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may lawfully be eaten with prayer and thanskſgiuing by Chriſtians. Secondly I argue thus. No creature is to be accounted impure for food which is or may be ſanctified by him that eateth it: But <hi>S. Paul</hi> affirmeth, euery Creature to be ſanctified with the word of God, and by the prayer of him that with thankſgiuing recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it. Therfore no Creature is to be accounted impure for food, being with prayer and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing ſo receaued. If <hi>Traske</hi> aske me how it is to be vnderſtood, that all creatures may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified with the praiers &amp; thankſgiuing of ſuch as receaue them; I anſwere, that thoſe words of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15085:43"/>
                     <hi>S. Paul</hi> in their true ſenſe, do only importe, that whoſoeuer eateth any creature with prayer and thankſgiuing, maketh a holy vſe thereof, and ſo that Creature may rightly be called holy, or a cauſe of holynes to him that ſo receaueth it.</p>
                  <p>If he aſke me whether it be not alſo required to the holy vſe of any creature, that it be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of it ſelfe for food, and created by God to be ſo with prayer and thanksgiuing receaued; I anſwere yes, becauſe no vnwholſom creature, poyſonous, and hurtfull to our bodyes can for food be holily vſed, but wickedly againſt the naturall precept of not killing our ſelues &amp;c. And thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul, Euery creature of God is good, and nothing is to be reiected &amp;c.</hi> contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an vniuerſall ſenſe, without limitation or exception, do neceſſarily inferre euery whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom creature apt to noriſh our body, and to be conuerted into the naturall ſubſtance thereof, to haue beene created for that purpoſe by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who hath giuen vs naturall iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and experience to know what creatures are wholſom and apt to feed and ſuſtaine vs: els were the naturall knowledge of man indiuidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to preſerue himſelf by the externall vſe of creatures, more defectiue and imperfect then the naturall inſtinct which beaſts and other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures haue to chooſe wholſom food for themſelues, and to auoid thinges harmefull and contrary to their nature. And whereas eating and other acts tending to mens indiuiduall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15085:43"/>
are of all others belonging to our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man condition and eſtate meaneſt in themſelus and moſt connaturall vnto vs, <hi>Io. Traskes</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous folly may be worthily admired, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding naturall reaſon from being any rule at all, to guide and direct vs in them. And it may fitly be tearmed a deſperate and frantick kind of ignorance and impudency in him, to deny, againſt the generall experience of men, in all ages and countries of the world, that Swines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh, and other beaſts, foules, and fiſhes legally prohibited, being dreſſed and eaten, are apt to nouriſh and ſuſtayne our bodyes.</p>

                  <p>MY firſt argument prouing the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall law of meates to haue beene repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by our Sauiour and his Apoſtles in the new Teſtament, ſhall be deduced out of <hi>S.

chiefly it imported the cleanſing of the Gentills hartes by faith in Chriſt and ſupernall graces conferred equally on then and the Iewes (as is plainly teſtified <hi>ibid. verſ. 18. act. 15. v. 7. &amp;</hi> 14.) So likewiſe I affirme, that as <hi>S.

For as by this viſion <hi>S. Peter</hi> was inſtructed firſt concerning the generall and actuall vocation of the Gentills: ſo in like manner was he taught not to impoſe on them the cerimonious, and burdenſome law of meates, further then a neceſſary abſtinence from theſe three for a time already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond argument ſhalbe collected out of the Apoſtles decree <hi>Act.</hi> 15. wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as taught to introduce Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the obſeruance of <hi>Moyſes</hi> law <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. it was after a diligent conquiſition made of this queſtion, ioyntly by all the Apoſtles deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that the heauy and inſupportable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the old law ſhould be no further impoſed vpon the conuerted Gentills, then that they ſhould abſtaine from meates ſtrangled, ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Idolls, bloud, and fornication; and in ſo
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15085:44"/>
doing they ſhould do well. Whence I argue thus.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles determined in their decree all neceſſary abſtinence from meates to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by the Gentils: But the Apoſtles in their decree licenſed vnto them all ſortes of meates except ſtrangled &amp;c. Therfore only thoſe meats were neceſſary to be abſtained from by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills. The <hi>maior</hi> of my argument is certainly proued by the mayne drift and intention of the Apoſtles, expreſſed in the text it ſelfe, which was to determine how far <hi>Moyſes</hi> law did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the conuerted Gentills particulerly about meates, and vſing many women, as they had beene accuſtomed to do before their conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo that as the Apoſtles in their decree did tye them to the matrimoniall knowledge of one lawfull wife; ſo did they alſo fully inſtruct them in ſuch an obſeruance of meates, as they ſaw needfull to be impoſed for a time, to make faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iewes and Gentills to liue peacefully togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the vnity of one Church. The <hi>minor</hi> of my argument is euident by the decree it ſelfe, wherin it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and the Apoſtles, to impoſe no other burden on them then that they ſhould aſtaine from thoſe 3. ſortes of meates, and fornication: which decree had beene an inſufficient rule to direct them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning meates lawfull or not to be eaten, if other meats prohibited in <hi>Moyſes</hi> law had ſtill remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:15085:45"/>Secondly out of that Apoſtolicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, I frame this argument. If the legall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of meats had continued after Chriſt as before, and equally obliged faythfull Iewes &amp; conuerted Gentills to the wonted obſeruance thereof, then was the Apoſtles particuler and expreſſe prohibition of bloud, meats ſtrangled, and offered to Idols, needles and ridiculouſly impoſed to the conuerted Gentils, &amp; they were falſely tould, that in abſtaining from thoſe meats they ſhould do well: becauſe according to <hi>Iohn Traske,</hi> they were by God equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to abſtayne from other meats alſo. But it were blaſphemy to affirme this Apoſtolicall decree, to containe any falſe, abſurd, or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous doctrine: Therefore thoſe meats men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the decree, were only and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly prohibited to the conuerted Gentills. Thirdly neuer any ancient Father, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Deuine did before <hi>Traske</hi> vnderſtand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then that the Apoſtles intended in their decree to eaſe the Gentills from ſome burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome obſeruances of the law beſides Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, which the Iewes had beene before Chriſts comming tyed vnto, as may be playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered from the whole ſcope of <hi>S. Peters</hi> and <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſpeaches aſſented vnto by the other Apoſtles. But if the Moyſaicall Law of meats did generally oblige al Chriſtians after this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree as before, then were the Gentils nothing at all eaſed thereby from the burdenſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruances
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15085:45"/>
of <hi>Moyſes</hi> Law &amp;c. Therefore the Apoſtles certainely meant in that decree to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale the Moſaicall Law of meats, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite to the Gentills only ſuch as that decree particulerly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>My third argument ſhallbe the words of <hi>S. Paul. ad Galat.</hi> 2. whereas S. <hi>Peter</hi> is ſayd to haue eaten at <hi>Antioch</hi> with the Gentills <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. but afterwards being fearefull to offend certaine Iews ſent by S. <hi>Iames</hi> from <hi>Hieruſalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> he withdrew himſelfe, for which ſimulation S. <hi>Paul</hi> publiquely tould him <hi>verſ. 14. If thou being a Iew didſt liue Gentillike &amp; not Iewiſhlike, how doſt thou inforce the Gentills to Iudaize?</hi> which could not be vnderſtood of the Iewes in reſpect of Circumciſion, whereof no mention is made in that place, nor in reſpect of conuerſation wherin it cannot be conceaped how the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils could Iudaize or imitate the Iews: therfore it muſt neoeſſarily be vnderſtood of the Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obſeruance of meats wherein they imitated <hi>S. Peters</hi> example. Likewiſe when S. <hi>Peter</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Gentils is ſayd to haue liued Gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tillike and not Iewiſhlike, it cannot wel be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but in regard of eating ſuch meats as the Gentills did, and his not obſeruing that difference of meats which the Iewes obſerued.</p>
                  <p>My fourth argument to conuince <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> in his Iudaicall obſeruance of meats, may be taken out of <hi>S. Paul ad Hebr. 9. verſ.</hi> 10. num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the obſeruance of meates amongſt other
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:15085:46"/>
cerimonious rites, and carnall inſtifications of <hi>Moyſes</hi> Law impoſed only vntill the tyme of correction or reformation, which Chriſt was ordayned to make: Wherefore ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted obſeruances of meats are abrogated now by Chriſt and no longer to continue.</p>
                  <p>My fifth argument may be collected out of the ſame Apoſtle, who hauing in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Corinthians cap.</hi> S. giuen them a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to eate or abſtaine from meats offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, as their owne conſciences ſerued them, obſeruing mutuall charity therein, <hi>cap. 10. verſ.</hi> 25. he willeth them to eate without exception, all meats ſould in the ſhambles of the Gentill Citty, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake, that is to ſay, not regarding whether ſuch meats had beene offered to Idolls or not: <hi>For the earth</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is our Lords and the plenitude therof, and if any Gentill inuite you to a feast, and you will go, eate all things ſet before you &amp;c.</hi> In which place albeit <hi>S. Paul</hi> treateth only of meats offered to Idols, yet his licence is generally vnderſtood of all meats and <hi>a fortiori</hi> proueth all other things not offered to Idolls lawfully eaten, which I proue by theſe vnanſwerable arguments. Meats offered to Idols were not only prohibited to the Iewes as were other vncleane meats but alſo by the former decree of the Apoſtles <hi>Act.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. forbidden to all Chriſtians: But <hi>S. Paul</hi> licenſed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to eate ſuch ſacrificed meats without ſcruple or queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therfore
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15085:46"/>
other meates legally only prohibited may be eaten alſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly <hi>S. Paul</hi> willeth the Chriſtians of <hi>Corinth</hi> to eate all thinges ſould in the ſhambles; or ſet at Infidells tables: But it cannot be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably doubted that in the ſhambles, and at Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells tables many meates forbidden in <hi>Moyſes</hi> Law were vſually ſould, and eaten: Therfore <hi>S. Paul</hi> licenſed the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth</hi> to eate thoſe meates alſo. <hi>Io. Traske</hi> and his diſciples wil not ſticke ridiculouſly to retort the <hi>Maior</hi> of my argument, and to tell me, that if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at <hi>Corinth</hi> might eate all thinges ſould in the Gentills ſhambles, they might eate hornes and skinnes alſo. They will alſo foolishly deny that meates prohibited to the Iewes were ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſould in the Gentills ſhambles or ſet at their tables making ſo the differentiall law of meats particulerly giuen to the Iewes, to haue byn naturally obſerued by all other nations alſo. And for a ſhift they wil flatly deny meats prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to the Iewes, to be food at all for men, more then toades, or ſerpentes. Which fooleries againſt common experience, learning and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are to be derided, and charitably compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſioned in them, rather then anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly the reaſons why Chriſtians were licenſed by <hi>S. Paul</hi> to eate Idoll offeringes, are two expreſſed in the text it ſelfe; the firſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an Idoll to him that hath iudgement to diſtern it is nothing in the world able to pollute
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:15085:47"/>
the creatures therunto offered; the ſecond is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the earth is our Lords, and the plenitude thereof; that is to ſay, all creatures therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained are good and created by him. Which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon is effectuall alſo to proue other meates prohibited to the Iews to be good in themſelues and lawfully eaten by Chriſtians. Laſtly <hi>S. Paul ad Rom.</hi> 14. like a moderator, or peace-maker betweene the firme Chriſtians, who were the Gentills, and the infirme who were the Iewes weakely &amp; ſcrupulouſly ſtil inclined to obſerue the differentiall law of meats, &amp; feſtiuall dayes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> be exorteth the Iew not to condemne the Gentill, vſing his liberty in eating al ſorts of meats; &amp; the Gentil in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner not to condemne the ſcrupulous Iew, but rather to abſtaine from vſing his liberty, then offending the Iew, to be an occaſion to him of ſcandall and falling from his faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Him that it weake</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>v.</hi> 1) <hi>take vnto you, not in diſputation of cogitations: for one beleeueth that he may eate all thinges: But he that is weake,</hi> to wit the ſcrupulous Iew that will neither eate meates prohibited in <hi>Moyſes</hi> Law, nor ſacrificed by the Gentils, <hi>let him eate hearbes. Let not him that eateth diſpiſe him that eateth not, &amp; he that eateth not, let him not iudge him that eateth,</hi> to wit, all ſortes of meates, <hi>for God hath aſſumed him to himſelf &amp;c. and he eateth to our Lord (verſ. 6.) for he giueth thinkes to God. &amp;c. Why iudgeſt thou thy brother</hi> (ſpeaking to the Iew <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.) <hi>for his liberty of</hi>

                  <p>MY purpoſe in this Queſtion is not ſo much to refute <hi>Iohn Traske</hi> in his Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh and abſurd doctrine of meates, ſufficiently already in my former Queſtions diſcuſſed, as particulerly to ouerthrow the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanicall abſtinence of ſome perciſe people, who wholy grounding their faith vpon he au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripturs, &amp; litle crediting any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian practiſe or doctrine not expreſſed in them, are in many places knowne ſtrictly to obſerue the Apoſtolicall decree <hi>Act.</hi> 15. commaunding Chriſtians to abſtaine from ſtrangled meates bloud &amp;c.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Blandina</hi> alſo in her Martyrdome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Euſebius lib. 5. hiſt. cap.</hi> 1. telleth the Gentils that they did much erre in thinking Chriſtians to eate the bloud of infants, who (ſayd ſhe) vſe not the bloud of beaſts, which is teſtifyed alſo of Chriſtians by <hi>Minutius Felix in Octauio,</hi> by <hi>Origen contra Celſum lib.</hi> 8. &amp; ſundry later Councells haue vnder great penalties for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the eating of ſuch meates, Apoſtolically prohibited to all Chriſtians. So that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practiſe is not Iewiſhly grounded, as <hi>Iohn Traskes</hi> opinions are, on a cerimonious precept of the old law, certainly abrogated, as is already proued: but they obſerue it as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept giuen to <hi>Noah</hi> by God himſelfe in the law of nature, repeated in <hi>Moyſes</hi> law, and renewed by the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty alſo of this queſtion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and made more hard, and vneaſy to be ſolued, by reaſon, that the Aduerſaries againſt whome I am to diſpute, admit no infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any ancient or moderne Church, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Chriſts holy Spirit, and lead into all truth, ſo that faithfull people may ſecurely and without danger of erring imbrace her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,

follow her directions, &amp; reſt in her iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the ſupporting pillar &amp; foundation of Truth, according to the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. They admit no Apoſtolicall Tradition or certayne rule to know any vnwritten doctrin to haue byn held and practiſed ſince Chriſt ſucceſſiuely and vniuerſally by Chriſtians. Finally they little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any reaſonable diſcourſe or Theologicall deduction, not litterally and playnely expreſſed in Scripture, the only Rule of their faith and Iudge of controuerſies betweene vs. According to which their vſuall and vnreaſonable manner I cannot more forcibly endeauour to diſproue this their Puritanicall abſtinence from bloud and ſtrangled meates, then by orderly prouing three thinges. 1. That this precept giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Noah (Gen. 9. verſ. 4.)</hi> was myſterious and not morall in it ſelfe. 2. That it was not but for a time only, and for ends now wholy ceaſed, decreed by the Apoſtles <hi>(Act. 15. verſ. 20. 28.)</hi> 3. That it hath beene ſince by a holy and lawfull practiſe of Chriſts Church generally repealed, ſo as it is a ſingular fancy for Chriſtians now againe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the obſeruance thereof.</p>
                  <p>And that this abſtinence from bloud and ſtrangled meates was not a morall precept, I proue firſt by the reaſon for which God prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe meates to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Poſterity, which was chiefly by this horrour of bloud to make them deteſt man-ſlaughter, and bloudy cruelty, as appeareth by Gods wordes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly

Nomrod</hi> alſo and other mighty men in thoſe firſt ages of the world, ouer eaſily multiplyed that horrible o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffence againſt Gods intended propagation of mankind: whereas now to vs Chriſtians the example of our Sauiours meekenes, his expreſſe prohibition of killing, ſtriking, or miſcalling our Neighbours, his doctrine of pardoning ſeauenty times ſeauen our enemyes, of being quickly reconciled vnto them, of doing good for euill, and praying for ſuch as perſecute vs &amp;c. do ſufficiently inſtruct vs to abſtaine from effuſion of bloud and cruelty: ſo that ſuch a horrour of bloud in meates cannot for that end be longer neceſſary to be continued by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Secondly, if this precept had byn a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law, neceſſary to direct vs in humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation and manners towards God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our ſelues, it had no doubt byn included in that natural law, by which <hi>Noah</hi> and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full poſterity were ſufficiently inſtructed, and taught to know the morall good and euill of their actions, &amp; to refraine from ſinne in them: So as this precept had byn vnneceſſarily impoſed if perfect reaſon and naturall iudgment had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe taught it vnto them, as it did other morall precepts. Thirdly, neuer any Philoſopher or wiſe Gentill, ignorant of that poſitiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15085:50"/>
giuen to <hi>Noah,</hi> either taught or practiſed after Chriſts dayes or before, abſtinence from bloud &amp; ſtrangled meats, as a morall &amp; natural precept; neither can it be, as I haue els where declared out of naturall reaſon, the rule of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lawes, iudiciouſly conceaued, that bloud or ſtrangled meates entring the body, can defile the ſoule &amp;c. Neither was the Apoſtles Decree (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.) concerning abſtinence from ſuch meates, impoſed on the Gentills as a morall law perpetually to continue, but only as an eaſy obſeruance neceſſary for a time, the better to vnite Iewes and Gentills, in the vnity of one Church. For the Iewes hauing an eſpeciall hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Idoll-offerings, ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled meats, &amp; bloud, would haue abhorred al manner of ſociety with Gentils, if they had not obſerued ſome kind of order and conformity in meates with them.</p>
                  <p>And this is to be proued firſt out of the decree it ſelfe <hi>Act. 15. verſ.</hi> 28. wherin it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and the Apoſtles, to lay no further burden vpon the Gentills then that they ſhould abſtaine &amp;c. By which wordes <hi>(no further burden)</hi> is plainely inſinuated vnto vs, that the prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch meats was a part of that burden which the Apoſtles would not haue wholy laid on the Gentills neckes, to wit the cerimonious obſeruances of <hi>Moyſes</hi> Law, ſo many in number and ſo hard in practiſe, as few amongſt the Iewes obſerued them, <hi>ibid. v.</hi> 10. and ſo conſequently it was no morall precept
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:15085:51"/>
included in Chriſts law formerly imbraced and profeſſed by the faithfull Gentills. Secondly, the Gentills were by the ſame Apoſtolicall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and for the like reſpects commaunded to abſtaine from Idoll-offeringes, as they were taught to refraine from meates ſtrangled and bloud. But the ſame Gentills were authorized afterwards by <hi>S. Paul ad Rom. 14. 1. ad Corin. cap.</hi> 8. &amp; 10. to eate Idoll-offeringes without ſcruple or queſtion, as hath byn in my former Queſtion already declared: wherefore then might they not afterwards in like manner be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to eat indifferently meates ſtrangled and bloud? For (ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtin cont. Fauſtum lib. 32. cap.</hi> 13.) albeit the Apoſtles then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Chriſtians to abſtaine from bloud and ſtrangled meates, chooſing for a time an eaſy obſeruance, and not burden ſome to the Gentils, that the Iewes and they might be built on the ſame corner ſtone &amp;c. yet after the Church of the Gentills became ſuch, as no natural Iſraelite appeared therein, what Chriſtian now obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it ſo as not to touch black birdes, and other leſſer birdes, vnleſſe their bloud be effuſed, or not to eate a Hare or Conny killed only with a blow giuen in the necke, without any other bloudy wound? and if perchance ſome feare to touch thoſe meates, they are derided by other Chriſtians: ſo that in <hi>S. Auſtines</hi> dayes, eſpecially in thoſe Weſtern Churches, as Iews (for whoſe ſatisfaction and better gayning to Chriſt that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15085:51"/>
cerimoniall Abſtinence was conditionally and for a time only impoſed) ceaſed to imbrace the Chriſtian faith, ſo the obligation of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ceaſed alſo, &amp; began to be no longer obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Chriſtians. And as the Eaſtern Churches were neereſt to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> &amp; moſt ſtored with Iewiſh Conuertites; ſo the Apoſtolicall precept of abſtayning from ſtrangled meats and bloud was in thoſe Churches longeſt obſerued.</p>
                  <p>And in thoſe firſt ages after Chriſt, becauſe Chriſtians were by occaſion of the <hi>Carpocratians</hi> and other wicked heretikes, eating children ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, with abhominable rites, for their Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, exceedingly traduced and infamed to the Gentill magiſtrates; therefore to ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues innocent and fre from ſuch horible ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they holily, whilſt thoſe monſtruous Sects continued, tyed themſelues to a Chriſtian ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance of that Apoſtolicall decree, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned authorityes of <hi>Tertullian, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> and other producible teſtimonyes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity do certainely teſtify; which maketh nothing at all to proue the ſtill continuing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the precept generally anulled by the contrary practice of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in after ages.</p>
                  <p>If my aduerſaryes obiect, that as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Apoſtles was according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of Fornication therein contayned, a moral Law ſtill continuing: ſo was the ſame decree morall alſo according to thoſe inioyned abſtinencyes from meates &amp;c. I anſwere, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15085:52"/>
the prohibition of Fornication was a morall precept; reducible to the Commandment of not committing Adultery, contayned in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, neceſſarily impoſed at that tyme to inſtruct the Gentils newly conuerted in the Chriſtian law of Matrimony, and to deterre them from Concubiniſme, and vſing any more then one of thoſe many women whome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture they had ben accuſtomed carnally to haue known before their conuerſions: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as their inioyned abſtinence from bloud and ſtangled meates, was no more decreed as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and euer continuing law, then was their like prohibition of meates ſacrificed to Idolls, plainely repealed in the Apoſtles time by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and lawfull practiſe of Chriſtians. And whereas <hi>S. Paul ad Rom. 14. verſ. 1. &amp;c.</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it only weaknes in the Chriſtian Iewes of thoſe times to tye themſelues to the legall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of meates, and to be ſcandalized at the liberty of the Gentills, eating indifferently all thinges, it is now to be worthily reputed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauaga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t folly &amp; fancy for our pure Profeſſours of ſpiritual Sanctity and Euangelical Perfection to tye themſelues to ſuch a Cerimoniall, and burdenſome obſeruance of meats, neuer drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of in many ages paſt by their Chriſtian &amp; Catholike Predeceſſours, and nothing perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to their pretended adoration, and ſeruice of God in ſpirit and verity.</p>
