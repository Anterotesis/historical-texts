            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, the Introduction,<note place="margin">Firſt, the order of the question is naturall:</note> and that conſiſts of two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; firſt, wee will ſhew, that the order of the queſtion is very naturall: ſecondly, that the matter is of great weight and importance.

            <p>Firſt, in reſpect of God; for our faith hauing been firſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16091:5"/>
informed and inſtructed concerning God himſelfe, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and worker of all; it is then in the next place to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed touching his workes, and amongſt them firſt and principally of the firſt and chiefeſt of them all, that is, the Church. For the Church is Gods owne ſpeciall workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, formed by his owne hand, ſeparated as a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his owne Maieſty, conſecrated to his owne worſhip and ſeruice, gathered by his owne Word, purchaſed by his owne Sonne, quickned and directed by his owne Spirit, and ordained from all eternitie, in his owne ſecret Councell, to be partakers of his owne glory. Beſides, of all the workes that God exerciſeth towards his Creatures, the greateſt and beſt are they that God exerciſeth towards his Church, as Election, Calling, Iuſtification, Sanctification, Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. Yea further, whatſoeuer God doth worke beſides in the adminiſtration of the World, he doth it reſpectiuely to his Church, for the good and benefit of his choſen. There being then ſuch a neere coniunction betwixt God and the Church, and the Church carrying the precedency aboue all other of Gods works that are; who ſeeth not, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning the Church doth very cloſely depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Doctrine concerning God; and therefore hauing been informed and inſtructed in the Doctrine concerning God, it followes naturally that we now be inſtructed in the Doctrine concerning the Church.</p>

                  </gap>ect of Chriſt.</note>Secondly, the order is as naturall in reſpect of Chriſt in the ſecond queſtion; for there is a more immediate and farre neerer communion betwixt the Church and Chriſt in particular, then betwixt the Church and God in generall: for Chriſt is the King, the Church is the Subiect; Chriſt is the purchaſer, the Church his poſſeſſion; he is the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, they his Sheepe; he is the Vine, they the Branches; he is the Head, they his Body; hee is their Husband and they are his Spouſe: and therefore except we will dis-ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe whom God hath ioyned moſt neerely together, after we haue ſpoken of Chriſt, it followes next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly that wee ſpeake of his Church. You heard in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16091:5"/>
queſtion, that Chriſt was incarnate, and that hee was a fit Mediatour betwixt God and Man. Now in this third queſtion we are to heare, who they are for whom he was incarnate, and for whoſe ſake he doth accompliſh this work of Mediation, and thoſe are the Church. And therefore in reſpect of the Doctrine of Chriſt handled in the ſecond queſtion, it followes naturally, that now in this third queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we doe handle the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all the three queſtions together.</note> in reſpect of all the three queſtions compared and laid together, the order is very naturall; ioyne them all together, and they ſweetly and orderly expreſſe the ſumme of all Religion. God doth ſaue his Church by Ieſus Chriſt. God is the Author that ſaues: Chriſt is the Inſtrument or meanes by whom hee ſaues: the Church is the ſubiect or matter to be ſaued: God purpoſed to ſaue his Church, but not without the mediation of Chriſt: Chriſt came to ſaue the Church, but not without warrant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God: the Church is ſaued, but not without God, nor without Chriſt, but by God in Chriſt, according to that in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe:</hi> where God is ſet downe in the firſt place, Chriſt in the ſecond, and in the third the reconciled world, that is, the Church. So you ſee the firſt branch of the Introduction, the order of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in themſelues, and ſo our order to bee very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch is this,<note place="margin">The matter of the queſtion is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> that the matter of the queſtion is of great weight and importance. For firſt, the right knowledge and vnderſtanding of the true Church is very profitable, and of neceſſary vſe: and ſecondly, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or miſtaking of it is exceeding dangerous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the knowledge and vnderſtanding of it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and of neceſſary vſe, and that in many reſpects; firſt, for direction; ſecondly, for confirmation; thirdly, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation; and fourthly, for conſolation.</p>
            <p>And firſt for direction;<note place="margin">Firſt, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> for on the one ſide generally moſt men are endued with this principle, that they ought to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16091:6"/>
ioyne themſelues to the true Church, or elſe they can haue no ſaluation. And on the other ſide, generally all Heretikes and Schiſmatikes doe challenge to themſelues the name of the Church, as if they were the true Church and none elſe. What is to be done in this vncertainty? Wee muſt ſearch the Word of God: firſt, learne there what the true Church of God is, and that is the onely right Aſſembly that ſafely and boldly thou mayſt ioyne thy ſelfe vnto. Therefore for direction this queſtion is very profitable.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Secondly for the confirmation of our faith.</note>Secondly, for the confirmation of our faith: for howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Word and the Spirit are the beſt and moſt ſufficient witneſſes, that the Faith wee embrace is the true ſauing Faith; yet our weakeneſſe requires alſo ſome outward witneſſe to teſtifie the ſame vnto vs; the beſt and onely wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this kind is the true Church, which is the Pillar of Truth. Therfore we muſt firſt know what this true Church is, and then finding that it doth embrace the ſame Faith with vs, and we the ſame with it, we are thereby certainely aſſured that we are in the right Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Thirdly, for the confuting of Aduerſaries.</note>Thirdly, the knowledge of the true Church is profitable and neceſſary for the confuting of Aduerſaries: for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts on the one ſide, and the Browniſts on the other, doe lay hard againſt vs, that either we are no Church, or at leaſt a falſe Church; therefore it is moſt neceſſary for vs to know what the true Church is, that ſo we may diſcerne them, and to iuſtifie our owne Church, and our ſtanding in it againſt all the oppoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fourthly, for conſolation.</note>Fourthly, it is neceſſary for conſolation and comfort of conſcience: for what greater comfort to a Chriſtian ſoule, then to know that it reſts in the boſome of Gods owne Church? I muſt firſt therefore know what this Church is, before euer I can attaine to any ſound comfort in this Caſe. Therefore in theſe reſpects the queſtion is very profitable,<note place="margin">The ignorance and miſtaking of the true Church is exceeding dangerous in foure reſpects.</note> and of great waight and importance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ignorance and miſtaking of the true Church is exceeding dangerous and hurtfull: for firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men are careleſſe and wretchleſſe, and will not ioyne
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16091:6"/>
to any Church at all; aske them the cauſe, they wil anſwer,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  Firſt, that there is ſo much difference about the Church, that they know not what to make of it.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Secondly, others would faine ioyne to the true Church, but they dare not ioyne to this or that particular Church, becauſe they know not which or what is the true Church.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  Thirdly, others miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the falſe Church for the true, and ſo ioyne to the falſe in ſtead of the true, and ſo runne headlong from God to the Diuell, from truth and ſaluation to errour and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I dare ſay, that the very name of the Church mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderſtood, hath been one of the greateſt ſnares that euer the Diuell vſed, whereby to entangle men in Popery, and this one Allegation hath made more to become Papiſts, and to continue Papiſts, then any ten of their beſt Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pretences beſides. Laſtly, thoſe that doe ioyne themſelues to the true Church are doubtfull of their ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, whether they be in the right or not, and not knowing the true Church are eaſily carried away to another Church that is worſe, or to a falſe Church. So yee ſee how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it is to miſtake, or not to know the true Church; wee haue lamentable experience of theſe things amongſt vs in theſe dayes: ſome turne Papiſts, ſome Browniſts, ſome become of no Religion at all, euen for this that the true Church is either not knowne, or not rightly vnderſtood of them; yea, the beſt and moſt tender Conſciences amongſt vs are ſomewhat vncertaine and fearefull of their ſtanding, becauſe they are not rightly acquainted with this buſineſſe. My purpoſe is therfore (God willing) to trauerſe this whole controuerſie, ſo farre as ſtrength and time, and your capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie will permit; and ſo farre as I conceiue, I will deale plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſimply, and indifferently, without preiudice to the Aduerſaries Cauſe, or <hi>partialitie</hi> to our owne cauſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out traducing them, or flattering our ſelues; nor will I wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly conceale any of Gods Truth from you vpon any ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter affection or reſpect whatſoeuer. It is your duty alſo to trauell with me in this buſineſſe faithfully and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, both by prayer to God, and all other our beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16091:7"/>
with this reach alwaies in our eye, that euery one of vs be found members, euen of the Church, liuing members, euen of the true Church of God: for as it is of riches, it is comfortable ſpeaking of them when wee haue a part in them; ſo it is of the Church much more: It is ſweet and comfortable to ſpeake of it then, when we know ourſelues to haue our parts therein. And thus much for the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to prepare vs to the religious and ſanctified han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of the queſtion.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the queſtion it ſelfe; in the handling whereof, firſt, ſome generall Points art to bee laid downe: ſecondly,<note place="margin">Foure generall points concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church.</note> we are to come to the particular matter. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Points are theſe: Firſt, of the name; ſecondly, of the titles; thirdly, of the nature; fourthly, of the diuiſion of the true Church, and ſo wee will make a paſſage into the true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. The name.</note>Firſt, we wil begin with the name. Church is a word that we haue at the ſecond hand from the Saxons, for they call'd it Kirke, the very ancient ſound and pronunciation wherof many of our Nation in the Northerne parts retaine to this day:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide Field lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 12. 15. 16.</note> but it ſeemes to be fetcht originally from the Greeke; for as they call the Sabbath day (the time wherein God is worſhiped, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Lords, that is, the Lords day, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.10.<note place="margin">Muſculus <hi>555.</hi> Bullinger.</note> ſo the place too for the Lords publike ſeruice. <hi>Muſc.</hi> 555. <hi>Bulling.</hi> But this is not ſo vſed in the Scriptures: and therefore ſeeing wee are to ſpeake of religious matters, it is good to ſpeake as the Scripture ſpeakes; we will therefore inſiſt onely vpon the name that the Scripture expreſſeth it by. In the former Teſtament the Originall ſignifies a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Congregation, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>. And when it is ſo called, it is intended by way of excellency of the Church, as that being the aſſembly of aſſemblies, the moſt excellent Aſſembly in the World. In the new Teſtament it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 16 18. which ſignifies a calling, or a company called forth from amongſt the reſt, according to the cuſtome of the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, where certaine men were called forth by the voyce of a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16091:7"/>
Cryer from the reſt, by ſome ſpeciall meeting and buſineſſe; and ſo the holy Ghoſt ſeemes to tranſlate it from a ciuill ſenſe and vſe to a religious; intending another manner of Cryer and calling then was in Athens. And it doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie the company ſo called, but alſo the place where they are aſſembled for publike and religious exerciſes; which I cannot ſay that it ſo ſignifies in Scripture, but in vſe of ſpeech amongſt vs, and in ſome Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, <hi>Piſcat.</hi> on 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 22. <hi>Muſcul. pag.</hi> 556. <hi>Hyper. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</hi> 527. 528. When God tyed his preſence to a materiall building, as in the former Teſtament, the Temple might more properly be called the Church; but now that hee is tyed to a ſpirituall building onely which are the faithfull, it is not ſo properly called ſo: but yet Synagogue ſignifies as well the place as the company <hi>Luk.</hi> 7 5. And by a figure we may call the place by the name of that it containes: This I ſpeake to iuſtifie the vſe of the word Church amongſt vs; though as I ſaid I cannot ſee that it ſignifies ſo in Scripture.</p>
            <p>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </label>  And from hence, from the name of the Church, I will draw this obſeruation, namely, That thoſe which are of the Church are called forth of God from amongſt the reſt, to the knowledge and obedience of his will. To open the way to the eaſier and fuller vnderſtanding of the point, we muſt conſider and make ſome diſcourſe of callings: this word is vſed much in Scripture, and hath diuers ſignifications.<note place="margin">Foure diviſions of callings.</note> Wee will make foure diuiſions of Callings: Firſt, there is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall calling and a particular calling: Secondly, there is an extraordinary, and an ordinary calling. Thirdly there is an inward, and an outward calling: Fourthly, there is an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16091:8"/>
and a not effectuall calling.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Firſt, generall and particular.</note>Firſt, there is a generall and a particular calling. A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that is, when God doth proffer the meanes of ſaluation to a whole Citie or a Nation, or to the whole world, as it is <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. but now God admoniſheth <hi>all men euery where</hi> to repent, or elſe when God onely giues to ſome particular men ſome generall or confuſed notice of ſauing grace. A par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling is, when God tenders occaſions and a meanes of grace, in ſome particular manner to ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, comming neerer to ſinne, and dealing more directly with ſinne. Examples wee haue of this <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.6. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, thou haſt taught <hi>me</hi> wiſedome in the ſecret of mine heart: And ſuch a calling had the Iaylor <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. there God deales particularly and directly with ſin, Beleeue in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt and <hi>thou</hi> ſhalt be ſaued. Now if this particular Calling bee apprehended and layd hold upon when God tenders it, then we are ſaued; if not, it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Secondly, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and ordinary.</note>The ſecond diuiſion of Callings is extraordinary and ordinary. Extraordinary calling is when God calls men, euen many times without meanes, or by ſome by-meanes, or by weake meanes not tending or at leaſt not ſufficient, vſually to ſuch effects, or elſe by ſome rare and ſtrange meanes, as when <hi>Paul</hi> was called by a voyce from heauen. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.3. An ordinary calling is when the means, time, place, and effect of grace is ſuch as they are vſually wont to bee in that caſe: if any of them be away it is extraordinary in that reſpect; yet if the meanes be ordinary, that is the preaching of the Word, the calling is ordinary too, becauſe God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſeconds the preaching of his Word with the worke of the Spirit as we may ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44. while <hi>Peter</hi> yet ſpake the Word, the holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard him, and <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.</p>

                  </gap>ard.</note>The third diuiſion of callings. There is an outward and an inward calling. An outward calling is when the meanes are outward, as by the Word, Sacraments, Corrections, Bleſſings, Miracles, the workes of Creation and prouidence,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16091:8"/>
the Edicts of the Magiſtrates or State wherein wee liue, the naturall conſcience, and the common gifts of the Spirit, all which of themſelues onely goe to the outward man, and procure an externall obedience to Gods call. Examples might be giuen of euery one of theſe; and this is it our Sauior ſpeakes of <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.24. Many are called but few are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. An inward calling is when the meanes and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them enters into the very Spirit and inmoſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a man, and this is onely by the Spirit of regeneration, when God by his Spirit workes with the outward meanes in our calling. Such a calling had <hi>Lidia, Act.</hi> 16.14. while ſhe heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach, the Lord opened her heart, &amp;c. The outward calling without this inward onely leaues vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, and aggrauates our damnation oft-times in the Church viſible: the inward calling without the outward is auaileable to ſalvation, as in the Church inuiſible. But both together are more comfortable and effectuall as in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing members of the Church viſible.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there is an effectuall,<note place="margin">Fourthly, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall and not effectuall.</note> and a not effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: A calling effectuall is, when the meanes of grace is both tendred powerfully vnto vs: and when it is truly receiued and embraced and continued in vnto the end, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.9. there was an effectuall calling when as our Sauiour called <hi>Matthew,</hi> and hee aroſe preſently and followed him; and this calling is proper onely to the elect. A not effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is, when the meanes of grace which are able to ſaue vs are offered vnto vs of God, but we doe not accept of them, nor yeeld vnto them.<note place="margin">Calling not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall fiue wayes.</note> A calling may be not effectuall divers wayes, as  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  firſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is vtterly refuſed, as it was amongſt the Gadarens that deſired Chriſt to depart from them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.34. or  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  ſecondly when it is deferred; ſome will not vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the meanes of grace, but they will deferre them, as <hi>Foelix</hi> that would heare <hi>Paul</hi> another time, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.26. or  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  thirdly, when it is accepted to the halfes, as it was with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa, Act.</hi> 26.28. <hi>thou haſt perſwaded me almoſt to become a Chriſtian,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Paul;</hi> or  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  fourthly, when it reduceth vs onely to ſome outward formall obedience without truth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16091:9"/>
and ſingleneſſe of heart: And thus it was with the fooliſh Virgins <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.3 And thus it was alſo with <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13.21. hee made an outward profeſſion of faith, he beleeued and was baptiſed, verſe 13. but his heart was not right in the ſight of God, verſ. 21.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  Laſtly, or when it is not continued in to the end, and thus it was with <hi>Demas</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. that forſooke Religion and embraced this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world: and theſe are in all the Reprobate, yea many of them are in ſome of the elect for a time.</p>

            <p>To come to the note. All that are of the Church are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God to the obedience of his will: here are three things to be conſidered. Firſt, they are called, there is the worke; ſecondly, they are called of God, there is the Author of the worke; And thirdly, to the obedience of his will, there is the end of the worke. Firſt the Church of God is <hi>called,</hi> for ſo the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. ſpeaking of the Church calls them Saints by <hi>calling,</hi> or as it is in the originall <hi>called Saints,</hi> and <hi>Rom</hi> 8 28. <hi>called</hi> of his purpoſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. euen as many as the Lord God ſhall <hi>call,</hi> that is, his whole Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. whom he predeſtinate them alſo hee <hi>called:</hi> So yee ſee the Church is a called company; now whether God deale mildly or roughly, drawing vs or leading vs, yet ſtill it is a calling, the worke is the ſame. Secondly, the Author of this calling, that is God 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God</hi> is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>who</hi> hath called you, and in this reſpect he is ſaid to be the caller, as it is in the originall: Now whether God call immediatly by himſelfe, or by meanes, whether the calling be outward or inward all is done by God, the author is the ſame ſtil. Thirdly, the end of this calling is, to the knowledge and obedience of Gods will 1. <hi>Theſſ</hi> 4.7. God hath not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs to uncleanneſſe but to <hi>

end of our calling is to be made partakers of his glory, but the immediate end of our calling is to vertue &amp; grace, as they are ioyned in the 2. <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.3. through the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of him that hath called vs <hi>to glory and vertue:</hi> and hence it is that our whole ſtate and profeſſion is called our calling as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. walke worthy of the <hi>vocation</hi> whereunto yee were called: yea for this end it is called an <hi>holy calling,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. and it is ſo called firſt in reſpect of the caller, who is holy: ſecondly, in reſpect of the worke, our calling which is holy; Thirdly, in reſpect of the meanes, which are ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus doth God deale with euery one of vs when he doth effectually call vs, either at one time or another in the courſe of our life. Many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16091:11"/>
might amplifie the mercy of God to vs in this kind; as that firſt God doth call vs by ſo many and ſundry meanes, by the Word and by the Sacraments, by his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and by his Corrections, ſo that if one preuaile not, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall; if faire meanes will not, foule ſhall. Secondly, he doth vſe theſe meanes continually, <hi>all the day long hee ſtretcheth out his armes to vs, early and late, day and night, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> renewing his call to day and to morrow, and ſo continually ſtill drawing vs on. Thirdly, he doth it earneſtly, calling, commanding, beſeeching vs, that wee would bee aduiſed by his Miniſters; and this hee doth with ſuch ſerious obteſtations, as we loue heauen, and feare hell, and as we would eſcape damnation, that we would bee aduiſed by him. Thus earneſtly God deales with vs, and ſo he had need, partly becauſe the matter is ſo hard, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe we are ſo dull. Fourthly, he doth often worke violently with vs, haling, drawing, plucking vs out of the fire of hell, euen as a man that is pluckt violently out of the fire when hee is in danger to bee burnt, and knowes not of it: ſo God pulls vs out of our ſinnes, and out of our vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and will not let vs goe till he preuaile with vs. Laſtly, God doth this particularly and onely to the choſen, to them and to none other, the reſt he leaues as droſſe in the dreggs of their filthineſſe; but God fines theſe, and fetcheth them out as pure Gold for the Lords Temple.</p>

No, let vs be thankefull for it, it is a pretious Iewell, and let vs take heed we doe not relinquiſh our Calling, let vs not looke backe; for no man that putteth his hand to the Plough, and looketh backe, is fit for the Kingdome of God.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label>  Fourthly, by this we may know whether wee are of the Church of God, or no. Euery one that liues in the Church, pretends to be of the Church: but here is the tryall; Art thou called? Yes: Why then thou art of the Church in ſome ſenſe; ſo farre as thou art called, ſo farre thou art of the Church. If thou haſt onely an outward calling, thou art but an outward member: but if thou haue an inward and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling, then thou art a true and liuing member of it. But you will ſay, how ſhall I know whether I haue this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall calling, or not? I anſwer; It is eaſie to know it: doeſt thou finde Gods Spirit worke effectually in thee, to cauſe thee to leaue thy ſins, to ſtirre thee vp to repentance, and to faith, and to doe good workes? As thou haſt a new name, ſo haſt thou by this calling a new heart, and a new life, and new motions and affections, &amp; new courſes. If thou haſt, then thy calling is effectual, elſe it is but a dreame. The ſureſt marke of all is thy Conſcience. Doth that check thee for euery knowne ſinne and infirmitie? And doeſt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in truth to obey it, and renounce and ouercome that ſinne thy Conſcience checks thee for? This is the ſureſt mark of an effectuall Calling. For when the Spirit hath thus quickned and purged thee, and doth inſtruct thee, and deale effectually with thy Conſcience, and frames thee to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it; here is a ſure marke of an effectuall calling. If we flee the Corruptions that are in the world through luſt, and if we giue our ſelues diligently to a courſe of grace and ſanctification, if we ioyne with our vertue, faith, &amp;c. this makes our calling ſure, and our Election too. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 9, 10. <hi>And if we doe theſe things we ſhall neuer fall.</hi>

ſanctification, by the Word and Sacraments, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; therefore we are a true Church. This they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> and others amongſt themſelues confeſſe, that they had their Calling here, yea their effectuall Calling, and they will not ſay but theirs is a true Calling; therefore ſo is ours, and ſo our Church a true Church. Yea, but ſay they, this calling is extraordinary. I anſwer, What is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in it? The meanes are ordinary, as the Word preached, read, and conferred on; the Sacraments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and Prayers offered vp to God. It is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary when wee are called without meanes, or by rare and ſtrange meanes: but the meanes here are ordinary; therefore the calling is ſo too. Beſides, many thouſands in our Church haue a true and effectuall Calling; The meanes is dailie powerfull through Gods mercy, either to winne, or to confirme, not a few, but many thouſands; therefore the commonneſſe of it proues it to be ordinary. Yea, but ſay they, It is ſo in the Church of Rome too; many are called there, and yet that is no true Church. It is ſtrange that they will blind themſelues ſo wilfully, and not diſcerne betwixt things that ſo notoriouſly differ. For firſt, in the Church of Rome, few, or none are conuerted; here in our Church are many. Secondly, they haue onely a generall call to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed notice of God; wee to the particular and preciſe knowledge of every Article and Point of Religion, needfull to ſaluation. Thirdly, they haue not the meanes, the Word truly preached, nor read in a knowne Tongue; wee haue. Therefore it is ſtrange that they ſhould once open their mouthes to make ſuch an abſurd compariſon.</p>

Paul,</hi> there is his name; <hi>an Apoſtle, &amp;c.</hi> there is his title: and ſo it is generally with all things of any great note, they haue their names whereby they are ordinarily called, and their titles whereby ſome extraordinary or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall matter is attributed to them, and affirmed of them.

            <p>There are many worthy and goodly titles aſcribed to the Church, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 87.3. <hi>Goodly and glorious things are ſpoken of thee, Oh Citie of God.</hi> Many, as being much variety of matter to be conſidered in the eſtate of the Church; and glorious, as euery title commending the grace, beauty, and glory of the Church after a ſpeciall manner.<note place="margin">Many titles gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her for three reaſons.</note> And the Lord doth adorne her with theſe many glorious titles for many cauſes;  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  As firſt, to giue vs a more full and perfit view of the whole Doctrine concerning the Church; no one title is able to expreſſe all the particulars that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Church; therefore the Lord vſeth many, that

what is wanting in ſome may be ſupplied by the reſt.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he might expreſſe, and ſet forth the greatneſſe of his loue to his Church, which being infinite, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in many excellent kinds, requires many and glorious ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to expreſſe it by.

It is called <hi>a Garden incloſed, a Spring ſhut vp, a Fountaine ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp.</hi> Here two titles are giuen to it; firſt, it is called a Garden: for as in a Garden growes many fragrant and goodly flowers, pleaſant to the eye, and ſweet and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the ſmell: ſo in the Church many goodly graces like fragrant flowers doe grow and flouriſh; the Word and the Sacraments, Faith and Obedience, Iuſtification and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, &amp;c. theſe ſpirituall flowers caſt a wondrous pleaſing ſight vpon the eye, and a ſweet ſmell to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of euery ſpirituall man that is able to ſee into, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them.

                  </gap>aine.</note>Secondly, it is calld a Spring or Fountaine; firſt, becauſe as a Spring hath water in it, ſo the Church hath water, excellent water, euen the water of life. This is it our Sauiour ſpeaks of, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.38, 39. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues in me, out of his belly ſhall flow Riuers of water of life:</hi> this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that beleeued in him ſhould receiue. Theſe waters are the ſpiritual gifts and graces which God beſtowes vpon his Church. Secondly, it is called a Spring or a Fountaine, becauſe as a Fountaine hath water, ſo it hath cleare water: ſo the waters in the Church, the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit wherewith it is adorned, are cleane and pure, not ſtained with puddle and dirt of ſinne and errour. Thirdly, as a Spring or Fountaine hath waters in it ſelfe at the firſt hand, and hath it not deriued to them by any channels or ſecondary meanes: ſo the gifts and graces of the Church, they haue them conferred vpon them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Chriſt himſelfe, who is the Fountaine of the Gardens, as in that <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.15. And there is one common adiunct affirmed of each of theſe titles, A Garden incloſed, a Spring ſhut up, or a Fountaine ſealed vp. And this is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſhew the priuateneſſe, or ſeueralneſſe of it in it ſelfe, that it is hedged in, or ſhut vp. This ſhewes, firſt, the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all protection of God ouer his Church or People; He hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and walles, and incloſeth them in, and ſeales and ſhuts them vp, ſo that nothing can come at them to worke their annoyance. Secondly, this intends a ſeparation betwixt them and the World; firſt, a ſeparation of them from the World, that they may not communicate with them in their corruptions, in their manners and faſhions, but that they may continue within the compaſſe of their owne ſocietie. Secondly, a ſeparation of the World from them, that they cannot communicate in their pleaſant fruits and pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; prophane and graceleſſe people, they can haue no part in the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit, they are reſtrained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Church, and to the choſen.

            <p>Now that wee haue paſt ouer the Titles giuen to the Church, and ſhewed them in their ſeuerall rankes, wee will draw them into a head, in an obſeruation, and that is this: Namely, That the Church of God, (that is, the Company  <label type="milestone">

The Scripture is plentifull in this argument, to teach vs that we muſt enlarge our hearts and thoughts to the more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and full vnderſtanding of it. Beſides the Titles we ſpake of before, which all proue this, there be many other proofes in the Scripture: I will giue you one place which is not in the Canonicall Scripture, which though it bee not to bee read in the Church yet you may reade it priuately, and that is in the 2. <hi>Eſdras</hi> 5.22. &amp;c. <hi>And I had a deſire to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againe, and I began to talke with the most High againe; And I ſaid, Oh Lord, of euery Forreſt of the Earth, and of all the Trees thereof, Thou haſt choſen Thee one onely Vineyard; and of all the Landes in the World thou hast choſen thee one Pit; and of all the flowers of the ground thou haſt choſen thee one Lillie, &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5.

aboue all people; as if many Pearles and pretious Stones were enameled in beaten Gold, and framed together into one body, would not this be a glorious body? But ſuch is the Church in the eyes and acceptance of God. God doth more highly eſteeme of the Church, then of all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; all the reſt are but traſh, &amp; droſſe, and dung; the Lord ſets nothing by them in compariſon of the Church, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.5. <hi>The Lord ſhall create vpon euery place of mount Sion, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aſſemblies thereof, a Cloude and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night: for vpon all the glory ſhalbe a defence,</hi> that is, the glory of God, and the glory of all the world; the whole body, and euery part thereof is glorious, yea, glory it ſelfe; all other pompe and glory without the glory of the Church, is baſenes, and ſmoke, and miſerie.

Laſtly, there was the golden Candleſticke with ſeuen bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which ſignified the manifold gifts and graces of Gods Spirit, which hee beſtowes vpon his Church: And if the Church was thus glorious being ſhadowed vnder the Law, how much more glorious is it now in the time of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell? The Apoſtle making the compariſon in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. ſhewes plainely, that the Church now, in the time of the Goſpell, is farre more glorious, then in the time of the Law. In the 22, 23, and 24 verſes, he ſaith, <hi>But yee are come to Mount Sinai, the Citie of the liuing God, the celeſtiall Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; And to the Company of innumerable Angels; And to the Congregation of the firſt borne, which are written in heauen; And to God the iudge of all; And to the Spirits of iuſt and perfect men; And to Ieſus the mediator of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And to the blood of ſprinckling that ſpeaketh better things then that of Abel.</hi> See how glorious the Church is here: for here is whatſoeuer may make vp a perfect glorie.

So ſecondly, in regard of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, it is glorious and beautifull; for they are religious to God, wiſe to themſelues, charitable to their brethren, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to all, depending on God, beleeuing in Chriſt, obeying his Spirit, praying, bleſſing, exhorting, inſtructing, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both themſelues and others, making conſcience of all their waies, hauing and keeping themſelues vnſpotted of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe and vncleanneſſe, and of the corruptions of the

Thirdly, for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they are glorious and gracious, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 68.24, 25. <hi>They haue ſeene (O God) thy goings the goings of my God, and my King which are in the Sanctuary. The Singers going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Players of Inſtruments after; In the midſt were the maides playing with the timbrels.</hi> This was but in a ſhadow, much more is it ſo in the true Church. <hi>Cant</hi> 4.2. the Church is compared to a flocke of Sheepe, which goe vp in good order from the waſhing. Now wee muſt vnderſtand this ſpiritually; for it is not the orderly ſtanding in the Church, but when euery one keepes his owne ranke, not being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, nor meddling in other mens buſineſſe, not looſe nor negligent in their owne place, but euery one is carefull to doe his duty impoſed on him; the ſuperiours they rule with modeſtie, the vnderlings they obey reuerently, and Chriſt himſelfe as their King keepes them all within their compaſſe. The Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. in the whole Chapter ſpeaking of this order, ſhewes what an excellent thing it is, euen as it is in the body of a man; there is the eyes, and the hands, and the feete, &amp;c. Now <hi>ſhall the foote ſay to the head, I am aboue thee; or the eye to the hand, I haue no need of thee?</hi> no, but euery member keepes his ranke, and is carefull to do the office impoſed vpon it: and ſo it is in the Church; and therefore in this reſpect it is a glorious Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3, 4.<note place="margin">Fourthly, in her vnitie.</note> &amp;c. Fourthly, in reſpect of their vnitie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.2, 3. The Prophet ſaith, that Ieruſalem is built as a Citie, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, or at vnitie together in it ſelfe; meaning, that Gods Church, the heauenly Ieruſalem, whoſe members are all knit together by a neere vnion, being one body, hauing one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4 5 6. hauing a ſweet and louing communion all of them with Chriſt their Head, and each of them with another: <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>what a goodly thing it is for brethren to dwell together in vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16091:17"/>
they pray, and giue thankes to God one for another; they reioyce for the good one of another, and are ſorrowfull and mourne for the hurt one of another. And ſo much for the proofe of the Point.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of the Point, why they are ſo beautifull and  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label>  glorious, are many. The firſt and the ſumme of all is this, becauſe they haue the Lord to be their God, <hi>Pſal</hi> 144.15. <hi>Bleſſed is the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> They haue God to be their Lord: Firſt, in reſpect of God, he promiſing and performing to them, that hee will be their God, and giuing them many tokens of his loue. Secondly, in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they being his by couenant and obedience; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are bleſſed and glorious, becauſe God is their Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt is theirs, and they are his: as it is in  <label type="milestone">

Chriſt is theirs, and whatſoeuer elſe may make for their bleſſedneſſe or glory is conferred with him. Ieſus Chriſt is preſent in his Church, and he inlightens them with his glory, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21.9. and therefore they are glorious; He waſhes them with his owne blood, and therefore they are gracious; Hee clothes them with his righteouſneſſe, and therefore they are beautifull; He couers, and imputes not their ſinnes, therefore they are bleſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. yea, they being his owne body, therefore as his naturall body was farre more excellent then any mans elſe, ſo his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body, the aſſembly of the Saints, is farre more glorious then all the World beſides.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gods Spirit hee teacheth them a gracious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, <label type="milestone">

            <p>Fourthly, they are moſt beautifull and glorious, becauſe  <label type="milestone">

all the liuing members of the Church are new Creatures; Gods Image is repayred in them, that wiſedome and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and holineſſe is renewed in them, which they had in their firſt Creation. If <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and ſo all his poſteritie till now: what a glorious Sight and company would they haue beene? <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo many of his poſteritie as are of the Church of God, are in ſome meaſure renewed to Gods Image, as it was at the firſt: And therefore what a glorious and bleſſed aſſembly is the Church of God, the aſſembly of the Saints.</p>
            <p>The vſes of this point are theſe: Firſt, it ſhewes the loue of God to his Church and people, and his delight in them; Firſt, his loue to them, in that, firſt, he is pleaſed to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his owne beautie and graces to them: to make them beautifull he faſtens on them many pledges of his fauour, he vouchſafeth them his protection, bleſſing, grace, and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all his promiſes, both for this life, and that which is to come, yea, and that for them alone: he thinks nothing too good for them, he affords them his owne preſence, and the comforts thereof; he beſtowes his owne Sonne vpon them, and all his merits and benefits; hee giues them his owne Spirit, and all the gifts and graces, and operations of the ſame: What ſhould he doe more for his Vineyard, as hee ſpeakes in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. and what could hee doe more for his Church, to make vp the perfection of her Beauty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.2. <hi>The Lord loueth the gates of Sion, more then all the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Iacob.</hi> Secondly, his loue appeares to them, in that he accepts of them as if they were perfectly glorious, for they are but men (I ſpeake of ſuch members as moſt concerne our ſelues; for the Angels are members too) and therefore though God giue them neuer ſo much, they can receiue it but in ſome meaſure, ſo farre as they are capable of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they haue many ſinnes, wants, and infirmities, the leaſt whereof (if it were ſtraightly ſtood vpon) in the cenſure of iuſtice, would deface all their glory, and cut them off from all their grace, and bleſſedneſſe: but the Lord paſſeth by, and winkes at theſe blemiſhes, beholding them in the face
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16091:18"/>
of Chriſt, couers all their defects with the Mantle of loue, and ouerſpreads them with the white Robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and freely forgiues them all their ſinnes, ſo that nothing may impeach their bleſſed and glorious eſtate. Secondly, God delights in his Church, being ſo beautifull and glorious, as he himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.14. <hi>This is my reſt for euer, here will I dwell, for I haue a delight therein.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.11. <hi>The King ſhall haue pleaſure in thy beauty.</hi> God delights in their perſons, graces, welfare, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; all their prayers, bleſſings, meditations, true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeauours, are a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice in the noſtrils of God, wherewith he is well pleaſed in Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.1, 2.</p>
            <p>The ſecond vſe. Is the Church ſo gracious and ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? <label type="milestone">

Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> profeſſeth his loue to Gods Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.8. <hi>Oh Lord, I haue loued the habitation of thine houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.1.10. <hi>Oh Lord of Hoaſts, how amiable are thy Tabernacles;</hi> and, <hi>A day in thy Courts is better then a thouſand elſewhere.</hi> And ſo likewiſe we ſhould ſhew our loue to her, in bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her deſolations, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> doth; <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.4. <hi>the wayes of Sion lament, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Lament.</hi> 2.6, 7. and 5.17, 18. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our heart is heauie</hi> for theſe things; <hi>our eyes are dim, becauſe of the mountaine of Sion, which is deſolate.</hi> And ſo we ſhould ſhew our Loue to her, in bewailing our abſence from it, as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.4. <hi>when I remembred theſe things, I poured out my very heart, becauſe I had gone with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and leade them into the Houſe of God, &amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> laments his abſence from Gods Church; and thus ſhould we doe, when by perſecution, or any other ſuch let, we are forced to be abſent.

               <note place="margin">Firſt, by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe.</note>Firſt, by the efficient cauſe of their being of the Church: for the principall reaſon why any man is a true member of the true Church, is, becauſe God hath choſen him to it: Firſt, to ſaluation and glory, as the end; ſecondly, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be of the Church, as the means to the end. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church ofttimes is called Gods choſen, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.12. <hi>Euen the people whom he hath choſen for his inheritance:</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.13. <hi>The Lord hath choſen Sion;</hi> that is, his Church. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Church, calls them by that expreſſe name, <hi>Gods choſen:</hi> And hence it is, that the Faith of Gods Church is called the Faith of Gods choſen; <hi>Titus</hi> 1.1. And therefore they are called <hi>The firſt borne, whoſe names are written in heauen, Heb.</hi> 12.23. Which what is it elſe, but to bee written in the Booke of life? That is to be Gods choſen. It is true, that it is much more agreeable to the name of the Church to bee defined by their Calling, rather then by their Chooſing, as in the firſt Lecture, becauſe they are a Company called: But yet it is more agreeable to the right nature of the Church to be defined by their <hi>chooſing,</hi> rather then by their <hi>Calling,</hi> and that for theſe Reaſons: firſt, many of the Church are choſen, that are not yet called, <hi>as Paul</hi> an Elect veſſell before his conuerſion, and yet not called; and ſo all the Elect before their conuerſion: nay, many are choſen that ſhall neuer be called; as the Angels which belong to the Church too, and are a part of it. And therefore the Church in the nature of it is to be deſcribed by their choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and not by their Calling. Secondly, many are Called that are not choſen, ſo ſaith our Sauiour; and therefore if we ſhould deſcribe them by their Calling, we ſhould make ſuch to be of the nature of the true Church which are not choſen, and ſo are no true members of Chriſt, nor ſhall euer enter into the heauenly Ieruſalem. Thirdly, thoſe which are choſen are called too; their Election and chuſing is the cauſe of their Calling, and not their Calling the cauſe of their chuſing, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.30. <hi>whom he predeſtinated, them alſo hee called.</hi> Therefore in theſe reſpects, it is fitteſt, and moſt

               </label>  Now to make this matter more plaine, I will draw it into an obſeruation, and that is this; Namely, That the holy Angels that kept their firſt eſtate, are parts and members of the true Church as well as we are. The Scripture is plaine for this; Firſt, in expreſſe wordes; ſecondly, by neceſſary conſequence. Firſt, by expreſſe words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23. <hi>But ye are come to Mount Sion, &amp;c. and to the innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels.</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Church, takes the holy Angels as Limmes of that Body, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Company. And <hi>Reuel</hi> 19.10. The Angell tels <hi>Iohn, I am thy fellow Seruant, one of thy Brethren; I haue the teſtimony of Ieſus, the Spirit of Propheſie: I am thy fellow Seruant:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, A fellow of the ſame Houſe and Family with vs, that is, the Church: <hi>A Brother,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſame Father, God; and the ſame Mother, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Ieruſalem, that is, the Church: <hi>hauing the teſtimony of Ieſus:</hi> that is, communicating in the ſame gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, as the Spirit of Propheſie, which is peculiar to the Church onely, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. So wee ſee by expreſſe Scripture, that they are members as well as wee. Secondly, by neceſſary deduction and conſequence. Firſt, the Angels are elect, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21, and therefore they are parts of the Church. Secondly, Chriſt is their Head, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. <hi>yee are complete in him (that is in Christ) who is the head of all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers:</hi> therefore they muſt be parts of his

Body, Which is his Church. Thirdly, the Angels peepe and prie into the miſteries of our redemption by Ieſus Chriſt, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. therefore except we will make them bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi-bodies, to prie and meddle with that which they haue not to doe in, which is vtterly againſt their wiſedome and vprightneſſe, they muſt needes be parts and members of the true Church; and ſo much of the Proofes.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the Church is that fulneſſe of Chriſt, that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth  <label type="milestone">

            <p>Thirdly, it is againſt the bountifulneſſe of Chriſt, and  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label>  the worthines of his obedience, that any Creature ſhould know and embrace the Doctrine of the mediation of Chriſt, and yet not receiue benefit thereby for themſelues: But the choſen Angels do know and embrace it, worſhipping him, and doing him all the ſeruice they could in the dayes of his fleſh whilſt he was working this mediation. And therefore they haue benefit thereby to themſelues: And ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they muſt needes bee parts and members of the Church; For to them are all ſauing benefits peculiar and properly belonging.</p>

Secondly, here is comfort to vs, in that they being fellow-members with vs, they doe not careleſly, or vnwillingly labour for vs, but they affect our buſineſſe thorowly, and take our welfare ſoundly to heart as their owne; and as feeling members of the ſame body, they are very ſenſible of euery good thing that befalls vs, and reioyce in it as much, or rather more then we our ſelues, knowing it will turne to their benefit, they being members of the ſame body with vs.</p>

               </label>    That Chriſt is not ſaid in Scripture to be Mediator betwixt God and Angels, but betwixt God and Man, then why doe you ſay, That he is their Mediatour too?   <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label>   I anſwer, That it is true, he is ſo vſually called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the reaſon is, Firſt, becauſe that is the mediation that concernes vs moſt to know; Secondly, becauſe the moſt ſenſible workes and offices of his mediatorſhip are moſt apparant in that reconciliation that was made for Man;<note place="margin">That Chriſt is Mediator for the Angels, and how?</note> yet this hinders not but that hee may be a Mediator for the Angels too: for it is no where denied in Scripture, though the other onely be expreſſely affirmed. The Caſe is thus; Their eſtate differs from ours in many kinds, and the mediation muſt bee anſwerable to the eſtate of the parties that are mediated for; and therefore Chriſts mediation for them in ſome maine circumſtances is diuers from ours too, and it differs in two maine things; firſt, in the worke; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the meanes. Firſt, in the worke; There is not the ſame worke done for them, as for vs, as Redemption: for they neuer fell, and therefore need no Redeemer; wee are fallen, and therefore he is the Mediatour for vs; he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs, elſe wee can haue no ſaluation. Secondly, it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in the meanes, for that is not the ſame: for whereas ſome of the Angels fell as well as we,<note place="margin">The Angels fall was perſonall.</note> that was but a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fall, onely chargeable on them that did fall: but when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, beſides his perſonall ſinne, it was the common ſinne of all mankind, we being all wrapt in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes; and therefore he that was to mediate for vs, was to take our very nature on him, and to be incarnate, that ſo according to the courſe of Gods Iuſtice, the ſame nature that ſinned might bee puniſhed, and make ſatisfaction for our ſinnes. Theſe bee the differences betwixt vs and them in regard of the worke, and the meanes of it. But yet they alſo haue their part in Chriſt, and in his mediation, ſo farre as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16091:24"/>
to their eſtates, and that in two reſpects; firſt,<note place="margin">The Angels haue their part in Chriſts mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in foure things, in reſpect of things done to vs, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to them.</note> in the things done to vs, which redound to them; ſecondly, in the things done more directly to themſelues. Firſt, the things done to vs that redound to them; for firſt, by this mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on done for vs, their knowledge is aduanced, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>To the intent</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that now vnto Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers in heauenly places might bee knowne by the Church, the manifold wiſedome of God.</hi> Now this is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  benefit to them, that they haue more knowledge by this meanes. Secondly, their ioy is increaſed by our conuerſion: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  for if they reioyce ouer one ſinner that is ſaued, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.10. how much more then when a doore is opened for many ſinners to come to ſaluation by. Thirdly, by this meanes  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  their ſeruice and office is inlarged: for if wee were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, what vſe were there of them, either in regard as they are Meſſengers, ſeeing they bring their meſſages onely or chiefly to the faithfull? or of them as they are Miniſters; this being their taske chiefly, if not onely, to miniſter for their ſakes which through Chriſt are heires of ſaluation. Fourthly, by our redemption through Chriſt this benefit  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  redounds to them, that their ruines are made vp, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is filled vp againe by many Men which are ſaued by Chriſt, in ſtead of thoſe Angels that fell away. Secondly, ſome things are done more directly to themſelues by Chriſts mediation: for firſt they are elected, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21.<note place="margin">And in diuers things done more directly to themſelues.</note> they are called <hi>Elect Angels,</hi> and that no doubt in Chriſt in whom we were elected, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. for the worke beeing  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  the ſame both to them and vs, therefore the ground muſt needes bee one and the ſame. They are choſen, and who choſe them but God? And in whom are they choſen, but in Chriſt? for all that are choſen, are choſen of God in Chriſt. Secondly, their creation is by Chriſt; that excellent eſtate of  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  theirs which they had by creation, they did not deſerue it, no, they had it beſtowed vpon them reſpectiuely to Chriſt, who is called <hi>The firſt-borne of euery Creature, Coloſ.</hi> 1.15. becauſe euery Creature had their being by him. Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  their preſeruation is by him, that they did not fall when
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16091:25"/>
their fellowes fell; and their confirmation in the eſtate of Grace, that they neither ſhall nor can fall away, is becauſe they are vpheld by Chriſt, and by his mediation they haue aſſurance that they ſhall neuer fall; elſe in reaſon theſe might haue fallen as well as the other, the other being as excellent, and hauing freewill as well as they; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if theſe had not been vpheld by Chriſt, they had fallen  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  too. Laſtly, their glorification ſhall be fully perfected by the finiſhing of Chriſts mediation at the laſt day, when a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l things ſhall be ſubdued vnto him; and when he ſhall bee an abſolute and perfect Conquerour, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. then ſhall the bleſſed Angels triumph ouer the wicked Spirits: for as the euill Angels, though they be damned already, yet they are not fully and perfectly tormented till after the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day; for then they ſhall haue it in full meaſure, they ſhall be then ſtowed vnder the hatches, and as it were fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Dungeon: ſo the good Angels, though they bee already glorified, yet their glory is not fully perfected till the laſt day; when our glory is perfected, then ſhall theirs bee perfected alſo. And ſo much for the firſt Point, That Angels are parts and members of the true Church.</p>

Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went <hi>Helias</hi> at his departure?

And ſurely this is the Lure and baite which God holds forth vnto vs, to prouoke and draw vs to come to him, and to obey his will, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.10, 12. <hi>Bleſſed are they that ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake, for theirs is the Kingdome of Heauen. Reioyce and be glad, for great is your reward in Heauen.</hi> And <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.22. <hi>Sell all that thou haſt, and diſtribute to the poore, and thou ſhalt haue treaſure in Heauen.</hi> And this is true, that Heauen is the place of receipt for all the faithfull after this life, not onely in reſpect of their ſoules, but alſo in reſpect of their bodies too, though in a diuers manner; the ſoule neuer dying, preſently after it is departed out of the body, as the ſoule of <hi>Lazarus, Luk.</hi> 16.22. the body dying and turned to duſt, yet it ſhall bee raiſed againe at the laſt day by the power of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo vnited to the ſoule, and placed in Heauen. <hi>Iob</hi> 19.26. <hi>Though after my skinne wormes deuoure this body, yet ſhall I ſee God in my fleſh.</hi> And both theſe are verified in Chriſt already, his ſoule went preſently into Heauen, his body after his reſurrection. So that Heauen is the place of receipt for all Gods choſen, of their ſoules preſently after their departure, and of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies after the reſurrection.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of the Point are theſe. Firſt, Heauen is Gods  <label type="milestone">

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>  The Vſes are theſe. The firſt Vſe is againſt them that dreame of Purgatory: for it is a meere Popiſh dreame and fancy; the Scripture is ſilent in it, ſo is God and his true Church, they know it not; &amp; therfore their Church ſhewes her ſelf to be a preſumptuous harlot, and not Chriſts ſpouſe, to affirme it. And if men would be awakened by the voice of the word, as a dreame it would vaniſh out of their thoughts. Chriſt reconciled things both in heauen and earth; therefore if Purgatory be not in heauen nor in earth, as the Papiſts deny both, ſurely the Church and ſoules in it haue no benefit by Chriſts reconcilement. Let the matter of it be what it will, be it fire, or be it water; or let the place of it be where it will, either in the Aire, or in ſome Caue or hole in the earth; let there be in it what ſoules there will, many or few, pure or vnpure, men, women or children, yet ſure it is that none of Gods children ſhall euer come there; no, they are either in heauen or in earth; there is no Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory for them, God loues them more dearely then ſo; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it ſelfe is their receptacle and manſion place, after once they are departed this life. So you ſee this is a fooliſh dreame of theirs, and ſo conſequently is all that is built vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, their Prayers, Dirges, and ſuch like, they are built vpon a dreame, and ſo are vaine, prophane and ſinfull: lay once a falſe ground, and a thouſand abſurdities will follow vpon it:

grant once that there is a Purgatory, and then Maſſes and Dirges, and many ſuch trumperies will follow. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know, that Gods Choſen which are departed this life are in heauen, and let vs account better of them, then to thinke they are in any ſuch place.</p>

We ſhewed, that that part of Gods Church which is in heauen, contained as well Angels as men, and therefore we ſpake of them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and proued that the Angels were a part of Gods Church as well as men: then we came to ſpeake of that part of Gods Church which conſiſts of men; and in handling this Point, we propounded three things to be ſpoken too; Firſt, to ſpeake of that part of Gods Church conſiſting of men which are in heauen by themſelues: Secondly, of thoſe which are in earth by themſelues.

You ſee that the obſeruation conſiſts of three parts: firſt, <hi>that God euer had;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>that he hath now;</hi> and thirdly, <hi>that he ſhall haue to the worlds end a Company, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, <hi>God alwayes had.</hi> In matters of fact, examples are fitteſt and ſtrongeſt proofes; this being then a matter of fact al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, it is beſt to be prooued by examples taken out of Hiſtories of ſeuerall times: we will begin with the firſt beginning; God had his Church in Paradiſe. How prooue you that? Why firſt there was God, the Preacher; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there was our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> the hearers; and thirdly, there was the Word and Commandement, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17. There is the Doctrine of ſaluation, and the ſtrict forme and manner of worſhip preſcribed by God, which he will bee honoured by. Now what is here wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the full being of a true Church? For here is a Paſtor, and a People, and the Word, and ſuch a Word as is fitting for their ſaluation: Therefore in Paradiſe God had his Church. Alſo out of Paradiſe God ſtill had his Church: for there is ſtill the ſame Preacher God; the ſame hearers, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue;</hi> the Doctrine of ſaluation, though not the ſame it was before; yet here is that Doctrine of ſaluation
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16091:28"/>
fitting their preſent ſtate and condition, a Doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and of puniſhment of ſinne, and ſpecially the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell, a Doctrine of Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>The Seede of the Woman ſhall breake the Serpents head:</hi> ſo here God had his Church ſtill.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hyper.</hi> 535.</note> To paſſe from them to <hi>Abel;</hi> there was <hi>Abels</hi> ſacrificing, and his Faith, and there was Gods preſence and acceptance, as we may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. Now where theſe are, there is a true Church. Afterward in the time of <hi>Seth</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4 25. <hi>that then men began to call vpon the Name of the Lord;</hi> that is, men did then begin more zealouſly to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God: ſo here God had his Church ſtill. Let vs paſſe from <hi>Seth</hi> to <hi>Enoch;</hi> It is ſaid of him, <hi>that he walked with God, beleeued in God,</hi> and <hi>that he pleaſed God, Geneſ.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. Now where there are men walking with God, beleeuing in him, and pleaſing him, there is a true Church. So in the time of <hi>Noah, Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and in the time of the Patriarches, God had his Church ſtill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6, 7, &amp;c. to the end of the Chapter; there the ſucceſſion of the Church in the faithfull is ſet downe, as it were of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to proue this Point which we haue in hand, namely, that God had a Church from the beginning of the world. To proue this Point further, we will omit to ſpeake of the flouriſhing times of the Church (for of them there is no queſtion, there being then not embracers onely of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly truth, but profeſſors too in great number) and we will inſtance in thoſe times that were moſt obſcure, when there was the leaſt likelihood of a Church; and if we can prooue that God had his Church in thoſe times, then the Point will be prooued, that God hath alwayes had a Church. We will therefore inſtance in them; firſt, at the Flood, when all fleſh had corrupted their wayes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.12. and that the earth was filled with cruelty, Verſ. 13. yet in that deſperate time there was found <hi>Noah,</hi> a iuſt and vpright man in that generation, Verſ. 9. So God had his Church then. Let vs paſſe from theſe times, and come to the bondage and ſlauery of the Children of Iſrael in Egypt when Gods peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16091:29"/>
were in the hands of a moſt prophane, idolatrous, and cruell Nation, ſo that they had neither liberty, nor time, nor meanes of Gods true worſhip; yet as there was a light in Goſhen, when palpable darkneſſe was ouer all the Land of Egypt beſides; ſo when all the World was ouerwhelmed with groſſe ignorance, ſinne, and error, yet then God had his Church: amongſt the Iſraelites there were ſome Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues fearing God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.21. and there were ſome that cryed, and prayed, and ſighed to God, and were heard of him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.23, 24. So God had his Church in thoſe times. Likewiſe in the dayes of <hi>Elias,</hi> when the Church was brought to a low ebbe, the Prophet could ſee no more left but himſelf (and yet he had eyes to diſcerne it) yet he was a true worſhipper of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vogel.</hi> 751.</note> and ſo God had his true Church then, if there had been no more then he, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.10. But the Lord ſaw ſeuen thouſand more that were true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and had not bowed their knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> verſ. 18. In this deſperate time when they killed Gods Prophets, and brake downe his Altars, and ſought the life of <hi>Elias,</hi> yet in this very time God had his Church, and a flouriſhing one too in his eyes, though men could not diſcerne it. Afterward in that generall Apoſtaſie, when Iſrael and Iudah were both fallen from God; yet here is a true Church ſtill; here was one out of a Citie, and two out of a Tribe to worſhip God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.13, 14. So in the Captiuity of Babylon, when the Church is quite ouerwhelmed as it were, Ieruſalem was ſo diſtreſſed, Religion defaced, all turned into a miſerable deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſo as there was neuer the like: <hi>Is there any ſorrow like vnto my ſorrow</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, ſpeaking in the behalfe of the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12.) yet then God had his Church, there were both teachers and embracers, as <hi>Ieremy, Haggai, Zechariah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and many others. At our Sauiours comming in the fleſh, when the Law and the Temple, Prieſts and people, the Church and Common-wealth were vtterly corrupted and defiled, yet ſtill God had his Church; there was <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Marie, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> true beleeueres and right worſhippers of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16091:29"/>
God. Laſtly, in the height of the pride of Antichriſt, the abomination of deſolation ſtanding in the holy place for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yeeres, when all the Nations in the earth were made drunke with the Cup of fornications by the Whore of Babylon, the Synagogue of Rome, yet God had ſome from time to time that lothed her golden Cup; ſome that were not defiled with her fornications, but kept themſelues pure Virgins, and a chaſte Spouſe to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſweetly embracing his ſauing truth. And ſo much for proofe of the firſt part of the obſeruation, That God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had a Church and company of choſen people, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part is, that as God euer hath had, ſo he <hi>now hath a Church, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall not neede to ſpeake much for proofe of this point; for it cannot be denied, but that (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) there be many flouriſhing Churches at this day in Germany, France, England and Scotland; many in all theſe places that worſhip God in Spirit and Truth; yea vnder Popery no doubt but there are many true Chriſtians: yea euen amongſt the Turkes, and Iewes, and Infidels I doubt not, but that there are ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> remaining ſome that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God with vs: no queſtion but there are ſome ſparkes of fire amongſt thoſe burnt aſhes; ſome poliſhed ſtones of theſe decayed Churches; ſome gold amongſt all that droſſe; ſome that ſerue the Lord, amongſt ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeruants of ſinne and ſlaues of Sathan; we haue many inſtances now at this day of ſome that liue vnder Popery, and amongſt the Iewes, that profeſſe our Religion. So the ſecond part is proued, that God now hath his Church and choſen people.</p>
            <p>The laſt part, and <hi>ſhall haue to the worlds end, &amp;c.</hi> Wee cannot prooue this point by examples as we did the former, becauſe it is not yet throughly fulfilled; yet wee haue as ſure proofes for it, as examples; we haue Gods own Word for it, and that which God hath ſpoken is as ſure, as if it were already done; and therefore the Prophets deliuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny predictions in the Preterperfect Tenſe, as if they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, becauſe of the certaintie of it. I ſay wee haue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16091:30"/>
Gods Word for proofe of this point, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.13, 14. For <hi>the Lord hath choſen Sion, and loueth to dwell in it, ſaying, this is my Reſt for euer, here will I dwell, &amp;c.</hi> God will dwell and reſt and that <hi>for euer</hi> in his Church; as himſelfe is for euer, ſo his Church is for euer. So <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20. <hi>I am with you euer, euen to the worlds end.</hi> It is more then if hee had ſaid, I wilbe with you, &amp;c. It is as much as if he had ſaid thus; As ſure as I am actually preſent with you now, ſo I will ſtill continue vnto the very end of the world. And whereas in reſpect of his bodily preſence it was nor ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was to aſcend into heauen; yet by his Spirit hee is with vs effectually to all ſauing purpoſes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall giue you another comforter, that he may abide with you for euer,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>euen the Spirit of Truth, &amp;c.</hi> And whereas there are many oppoſers of Gods Church, men and Deuils, and many times they haue a great hand ouer the Church; yet they are ſtill bridled and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and the Church ſtill ſo protected and defended, that the gates of Hell ſhall neuer preuaile againſt it, that is, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to diſanull it, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.18. There are many other proofes for this Point, but becauſe we ſhall ſpeake of them in the Reaſons, therefore we will paſſe to them.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of the point (that God euer had, now hath, and ſhall haue a Church to the worlds end) are theſe.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label>  Firſt, we haue Gods promiſe for it, who is truth and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie. If that be too little, we haue his Oath for it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is impoſſible he ſhould lie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.11, 12. <hi>The Lord hath ſworne in Truth to Dauid, and will not ſhrinke from it, ſaying, of the fruit of thy Body will I ſet vp thy throne for euer.</hi> He hath ſworne it, and will not ſhrinke from it, that is, hee will not recant: which although it be typically ſpoken of <hi>Dauid</hi> and his ſeede, yet in truth &amp; ſubſtance of it, it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Chriſt and his Church. The ſame promiſe is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Ier.</hi> 33.17, 18. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Dauid ſhall neuer want a man to ſit vpon the Throne of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> And in the 20. and 21. verſes, it is ſaid, <hi>If yee can breake my Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the day, and my Couenant of the night, then my Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

            <p>Secondly, the ſauing Truth and doctrine of ſaluation  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label>  ſhall neuer periſh from the earth: therefore the Church that is the pillar of Truth ſhal neuer be aboliſhed from the earth, If the truth of God could faile, then the Church might faile; but that can neuer faile, for ſtill there ſhall be ſome witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Gods Truth, to feele the ſauing power of it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to teſtifie it to others; and therefore the Church ſhall neuer faile.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, he doth preſerue his Church on earth for the  <label type="milestone">

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>  The vſes: Firſt, this ſhewes the antiquity of the Church, that it hath been from the beginning. Truth is elder then falſhood, righteouſneſſe was before ſinne, Gods Church is ancienter then all prophane Aſſemblies whatſoeuer: <hi>Caine</hi> is ancient being of the malignant Church; but his Parents, the Church in Paradiſe is ancienter. <hi>Eue</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> harke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the voice of the Serpent, and ſo committed ſinne ſoone after the Creation; yet there was a time before their fall, when they beleeued, and reſted on God and his Word, and were righteous.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie; elſe it could not haue been peruerted with his Lye. This ſerues, firſt, to ſtop the mouth of all Gainſaiers, and aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods Church, that Charge vs with nouelty, to bee a new ſect, and challenge antiquitie to themſelues, that they are the ancient and true Church, which are both lies, for they are the nouelliſts, not wee. We are from the beginning, before they had any being; ſo that we are more ancient then they, and their religion is nouelty, and a new Sect. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may ſerue to confirme vs in the vndoubted aſſurance of the Truth, and of that Faith and Religion which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. That which is moſt ancient is moſt true, as being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly and originally from the pure Fountaine, the pure hands of God himſelfe, who is the ancient of dayes. And contrarily, all Religions which are leſſe ancient, are from ſome corrupt Channels, degenerate from the originall ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Now our Religion which we profeſſe is moſt ancient and moſt pure; and therefore let all contrary Doctrines and Religions hide their heads, and be aſhamed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and yeeld the preheminence of pure Truth to our Religion that is moſt true and rightly ancient.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>  Secondly, as this ſhewes the Antiquitie of the Church, ſo likewiſe it proues the perpetuity of it. As it was from the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16091:31"/>
beginning of the world, ſo it ſhall continue by ſucceſſion to the end of the world, as it was before all other Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo it ſhall ſee the riſing and fall of all other Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but it ſelfe ſhall continue one and the ſame by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſucceſſion: where the Fathers are gone, there Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall ſtand vp in their ſteads, and ſo Childrens Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the worlds end. There ſhall bee many changes and alterations from time to time, yet ſtill there ſhall bee a Church in all theſe changes. If the Church faile in Paradiſe, it ſhall be found out of Paradiſe: If Iſrael fall away, yet Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah ſhall ſtand: If the Iewes bee caſt off, yet the Gentiles ſhalbe taken in: Though Popery, Turciſme, and Iudaiſme, and Paganiſme abound and fill the world, and are vp in Armes againſt the Church, yet there are ſome corners in the world that God hath reſerued to ſhelter his Church in, wherein they ſhall be preſerued both from their perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and infection.</p>
            <p>The third Vſe, Is matter of Comfort to the faithfull;  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label>  Firſt, in regard of themſelues, for they are the onely people  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  of continuance that are in the world, they onely are ſure of their eſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, and none elſe. It is true, that the wicked may flouriſh a long time in great proſperitie like to a greene Bay Tree; but in time, and ſometimes very quickly, they ſhall vaniſh away like ſmoke, and conſume as the fat of Lambes, and nothing ſhall remaine of them: but the faithfull ſhall ſtand faſt for euer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.28. they may be afflicted, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and diſtreſſed on euery ſide; yet they ſhall neuer be forſaken, nor giuen ouer vtterly as a prey to their enemies. If the wicked murder ſome of them, yet God wil haue ſome of them remaine ſtill: let perſecutours draw out the blood of Gods Children as long as they will or can, yet ſtill there ſhalbe found ſome that will offer themſelues to their bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hands for the maintenance of Gods Truth: as ſome are taken away, God will ſtill ſend them a new ſupply. So then it is Comfort to them in regard of themſelues, that they ſhall neuer periſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is comfort to them in regard of their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:16091:32"/>

And as for the Truth of God, the Goſpell and the graces of the Spirit, which themſelues are ſeized on in their life time, God will diſpoſe of them to the right heires, heires of his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting add raiſing vp; he will find heires for them ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely from age to age to the laſt end. Then Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe ſhall come, and hee ſhall ſtand laſt; vpon the earth, and ſo the Church ſhall be the firſt and the laſt; The firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt man on earth, beginning the Church on earth; And the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the laſt man vpon the earth, finiſhing it vp by his perſonall preſence, hauing continued and maintained it by his owne power from the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the worlds end. And ſhall the Church haue an end then? No, though all things bee then at an end, yet the Church ſhall not yet be at an end: but as it is for euer here, ſo it ſhall continue for euer in heauen too, and that in a farre ſafer, and happier, and more glorious eſtate, then euer it did in this world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.28.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label>  The fourth Vſe is for diſcouragement to wicked men and Perſecutors, in that which they doe againſt Gods Church. What can they doe againſt it, roote it out, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they ſay they will? No, doe they what they can by themſelues, by their Inſtruments, they can neuer roote it out; Let Kings, and Rulers, and Gentiles, and people fret, and rage, and band themſelues together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Annointed, it is to no purpoſe, they ſhall not preuaile; it is all but the imagination of a vaine thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1. Yet I wil tell them what they ſhal preuaile in; they ſhal preuaile thus farre to make the Church more in number, and more zealous for God, and conſtant in his truth, contrary to their end. For behold, when they haue done what they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16091:32"/>
can againſt the faithfull, when they haue burnt them to aſhes, God will raiſe out of thoſe very aſhes a new ſeed to call vpon his Name, and the blood of the Saints ſhed ſhall fatten the Church, and make it more fruitfull, and be a cauſe of the greater increaſe of the Faithfull. It is a vaine thing therefore for them to threaten them, and to ſay (as many times they doe) that they will root out theſe Profeſſors. It is more then they can do, nay it is more then the Diuell (their good Maſter) can doe himſelfe, and therefore let them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinke to doe it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, this teacheth vs not to Iudge of the Church by  <label type="milestone">

that they haue a Communion among themſelues; both theſe are intended when it is ſaid, they are a Communion of Saints. Laſtly, that they are knowne onely to God and themſelues.

there is but one Spirit, therefore but one Church, as there is but one ſoule, and therefore but one man. There is but one hope, at which all Gods people ioyntly aime, and therefore they are one corporation; one Lord, and therefore one family; one Faith, which is the life of the Church, and if there be but one life, then there can be but one Church; one Baptiſme, and therefore but one Promiſe and Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which all doe make to God as one man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Church is the Body of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. <label type="milestone">

Now, Chriſt ſhould haue many wiues, if there were many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which is abſurd; and therefore there is but one Church ſtill.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they haue all one Shepheard, and therefore they  <label type="milestone">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16091:34"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> before the Law, and <hi>Dauid</hi> vnder the Law, and the Apoſtles whileſt Chriſt was on earth; the ſame ſaith are we and all the faithfull ſaued by from Chriſts aſcenſion till his returne to Iudgement. And therefore that is a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doctrine that ſome hold, that euery man ſhall bee ſaued by his owne Religion, whatſoeuer it be, if he bee zealous in it: no, diuers Religions make diuers Churches; but there is but one Church to be ſaued, and therefore but one Truth and Religion to be ſaued by.</p>

Then wee ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to maintaine the oneneſſe of the Church, to keepe the vnitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.3. Beware of factions and diuiſions, either of making or following them: for they are the very bane of this oneneſſe of the Church; and take heed of pride and ſingularitie, for that is the common Mother and Nurſe of diſſenſions and rents in the Church; and doe not receiue the Word with reſpect of perſons, as when one ſaith, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> another, <hi>I am of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos, &amp;c.</hi> What is <hi>Paul?</hi> and what is <hi>Apollos?</hi> but Miniſters by whom yee beleeue.

What if God beſtow diuers gifts on diuers perſons, and one more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then another? Wilt thou abuſe Gods gifts to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of rents and factions in the Church? No, thou muſt know that thou art bound to profit the more by him that hath more gifts, and to glorifie God the more for them, and not to dote vpon them, and maintaine Sects by them: for that is not the end why God giues them, but it is the malice of the Diuell that doth thus abuſe them to a wrong end.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label>  Thirdly, this reprooues the Papiſts; for they make two Heads, and conſequently two Churches: except they will make a monſter of the Church to haue two Heads, and but one body. Yea, but ſay they, the Pope is the Head of the Church in earth. I am ſure hee is not Head of the Church in heauen, and therefore not Head of the Church on earth;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16091:34"/>
for they make but one Church, and therefore can haue but one Head. Some of the Ieſuites hauing been preſſed with this Argument, and not knowing how to anſwer it, haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the Pope is Head of the Church in heauen; ſo groſſe and blaſphemous haue they been. So the Turkes and the Iewes that erect Churches of their owne, and haue no fellowſhip with this Church, they are not the true Church, nor haue any part in this oneneſſe of the Church; and whatſoeuer they are that haue no part in this Church, they are none of Gods Church, but of the Synagogue of Satan.</p>

Firſt, difference of ſtates doe not cut off from the true Church: though ſome Churches are greater, ſome ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, though ſome are in their cradle, others in their full age, ſome before Chriſt, others after Chriſt, ſome purer, ſome impurer; yea though ſome be in heauen triumphing, other ſome in earth fighting; yet all are but one Church, all are the ſame Wheate threſhed in the floore, and laid vp in the Garner, and the ſame Gold digged out of the Mine with ſome droſſe, and tried and fined by the fire. Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, of times.</note> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of times doe not cut off from the true Church, before the Law, vnder the Law, and after the Law; the firſt and the laſt Churches all are one.

               <note place="margin">Second Head; The Church is holy.</note>The ſecond Note or qualitie of the Church is. That it is holy. Wee will draw it into an obſeruation, as wee did the former, and that is this, Namely; That the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the faithfull both in heauen and in earth are a holy Company and euery part and member thereof is holy; 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. They are called a <hi>holy nation;</hi> and in the fift Verſe, a <hi>holy Prieſthood.</hi> And it is ſaid of Ieruſalem, that it is a holy Citie; not that in heauen onely, <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 21.2. but that on earth too, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.5. And in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. the Church is ſaid to be <hi>holy and without blame,</hi> &amp;c. And hence it is, that thoſe which are parts and members of the Church are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Saints on earth,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. And ſo the whole Congregation is called <hi>the Congregation of Saints, Pſalm.</hi> 89.5. And their Head and Ruler is the <hi>King of Saints;</hi> and they are not holy in profeſſion onely, for ſo are hypocrites too, that are no part of the true Church; but they are holy indeede, they are truly ſanctified; therefore the Apoſtle calls them <hi>holy brethren Heb.</hi> 3.1.

            <p>Fifthly, the effects which they feele in themſelues are  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>5</label>  holy effects, holy motions, and holy deſires, holy life, and holy obedience, and their ſpirituall life (that is to ſay, their faith) is moſt holy, <hi>Iude</hi> 20. therefore they are holy.</p>

And this Holyneſſe carries a kind of Reciprocation with Gods Church; for euery Church of God is truly holy, and euery Congregation that is holy is the true Church of God. And ſo whereſoeuer there bee any men or women that bee truly holy, though they be out of the knowne Church, yet they are liuing members of the true Catholike Church. And on the contrary, whereſoeuer there are any that are not holy, though they liue in the viſible Church, and are in great place, and of great gifts; yet they are no members of the true Church of God. So then here is the triall whether we be of the true Church or not; if wee haue holineſſe in our hearts and in our deſires, then wee are of the true Church, elſe we are not. But you will ſay, Is euery one holy that is of the true Church? I anſwer; Yes, in ſome meaſure, firſt or laſt.</p>

But firſt let them know, that they haue no part in Gods Church, for all the parts and members thereof are holy. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let them know,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 3.</note> that they muſt be either Saints or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, either of the ſeede of God, or of the Diuell. And therefore let them know, that as they ſcoffe at vs vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo the Lord from heauen doth moſt iuſtly deride them, and will one day laugh at their deſtruction, and this is to them a token of perdition, and a moſt certaine token too, becauſe they are not onely without holineſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but they hate it, and deride it in others: but to vs it is a ſigne of ſaluation, both that we are endued with holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and alſo that we ſuffer perſecution for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.3. The Apoſtle vſeth this word very grauely, which they doe ſo deride, he calles them holy Brethren. And therefore in the ſecond place, let vs bee ſo farre from being daunted by their ſcoffing at vs, as that it may rather incourage vs to be more holy. Let vs ſay as <hi>Dauid</hi> did to <hi>Michal,</hi> when ſhe ſcoft at him for dancing before the Arke, <hi>Am I vile in thine eyes for this?

            <p>Firſt, the word is wronged, in that they of the Romiſh  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  Church do falſly challeng and appropriate it to themſelues, as if their Church were Catholike, and none elſe; and as if their faith were Catholike, and none other; and as if they were the onely Catholikes, and none but they. If they were Catholikes as they pretend to bee, yet they might giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers leaue to be called ſo as well as they; but they are not ſo, onely the name of Catholikes is falſely arrogated to themſelues, and flatteringly yeelded vnto them by their friends and fellowes, but indeed and in Truth they are no Catholikes at all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is wronged by them, in that they boaſt and  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  vaunt themſelues of it as their Crowne and glory; and they take it in great ſnuffe, if they be not ſo called; yea if you call them Papiſts, or ſuch other like name, I know it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, they wilbe ready to fly in your face.

But it is to be conſidered, that the name makes not the man to be ſuch as he is called, but on the contrary becauſe a man is ſuch an one as the name imports, therefore hee is ſo called.

Therefore we muſt firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our ſelues, whether we are ſuch as the name imports, and then we may haue Comfort in our States whether we bee ſo named or not; if the name be vpon vs without cauſe, we are nothing the neerer to ſaluation.

            <p>Now ſecondly, we are to right the Word,<note place="margin">Secondly, the word Catholike righted, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof three things are to be conſidered of.</note> and reſtore it to the originall ſenſe, that ſo we may frame vs to a reuerent and ſober eſtimation of it, and neither eſteeme of it too much nor too little: and to this end, firſt therefore wee will conſider of the antiquitie of the Word; ſecondly, wee will ſhew the right meaning of it; and thirdly, the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vſe of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider the antiquitie of it;<note place="margin">Firſt, the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of it.</note> this word is not found in any of the bookes of Scripture, onely it is found in the preface of the Epiſtles of <hi>Iames, Peter, Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iude;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>id.

But come to the Creed, and there this word is plainely found, and that as an adiunct of the Church: I cannot ſay that it was the Apoſtles owne doing, but ſurely it was very neere to the Apoſtles times. So likewiſe it is found in the Nicene Creed, and alſo in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Creed,<note place="margin">Morney de ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia, p. <hi>13. 14.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>19.</hi> ad <hi>25.</hi> &amp; <hi>29.</hi> vid.

The Faith profeſſed by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, is the Catholike Faith. So wee ſee that the word is very ancient.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to right it, we are to conſider the right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the word, Catholike, which is, generall or vniuerſall; for ſo the Ancients expound the Prefaces to the generall Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the generall Epiſtle of <hi>Iames,</hi> as dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not to any particular Nation or Citie, as <hi>Paul</hi> did his Epiſtle to the Romanes, but generally and vniuerſally to all the faithfull, or to the faithfull generally diſperſed, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is plaine in thoſe Epiſtles of <hi>Iames, Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude,</hi> and in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but not in the two laſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of <hi>Iohn,</hi> they being directed to one ſingle perſon.

            <p>Thirdly, to right the word, wee are to conſider the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon receiued vſe of the word. It is ſuch as degenerates from the right meaning and firſt antiquitie of it, and yet with conſtruction it is allowable enough. The Ancients vſed this word Catholike, for true beleeuing, as diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Heretikes and falſe beleeuing; ſo that Catholike Church was as much to ſay, as a true beleeuing Church: and ſo from the Church to a particular member, a Catholike, that is, no Heretike, but a right beleeuer: and that ſpeech which was ſo common in the Primitiue Church, Chriſtian is my name, and Catholike is my Sur-name, ſhewes that none all that while were called true Catholikes, but true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath this ſaying; The very name of Catholike, ſaith he, containes me in the lap of the Church; that is, as if I ſhould ſay, The very name of Chriſtian containes mee within the lap of the Church, that is, it is one motiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome others to keepe me in the lap of the Church, not that the name is ſufficient only, but I knowing my ſelfe to be of the true Church, one motiue amongſt others that containes me in it, is the name of Chriſtian, &amp;c. And this is <hi>Auſtins</hi> meaning. So you haue ſeene how this word hath been wronged, and how it is righted.</p>
            <p>Now we will here take it in the right meaning, and firſt antiquitie of it, and ſo draw ſuch obſeruations as ſhall fitly follow vpon it, which is the third generall Point to bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to. Therefore when we ſay, the Catholike Church, it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16091:39"/>
intends two things: firſt, that the Church is generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through the world; ſecondly, that euery true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer whereſoeuer or whatſoeuer hee is, hee is a member of the true Church.</p>
            <p>Wee will draw it into an Obſeruation, and that is this;  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
               </label>  The true Church of God is Catholike or generall, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelfe to all beleeuing perſons of all times and places whatſoeuer. That the Church was of all times wee haue ſhewed before, here we are to ſpeake only to this Point, that the Church of God is of all perſons and places. This was ſo propheſied, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 72.8. <hi>His Dominion ſhall be from Sea to Sea, and from the Riuer to the end of the Land.</hi> This indeed is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically ſpoken of <hi>Dauid</hi> and his Kingdom, but it is applyed to Chriſt and his Kingdome of Grace, which is his Church. And ſo this was promiſed to our Sauiour Chriſt by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I will giue thee the Heathen for thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the vtmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> What is Chriſts heritage and poſſeſſion, but the Church? but his poſſeſſion ſhall reach to the vtmoſt parts of the earth, and therefore his Church muſt reach as farre, to all places and people that beleeue, euen to the fartheſt parts of the earth. So likewiſe our Sauiour himſelfe foreſhewes it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſit downe with Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen.</hi> Many ſhall come, that is, there ſhall bee a generall confluence from the Eaſt and Weſt, that is, from all places in the World; And what ſhall they doe? They ſhall ſit downe with <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. that is, they ſhall beleeue in Chriſt, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> did, and ſo become members of the ſame Church of God, as they were. So yee ſee how farre the Kingdome of heauen inlargeth it ſelfe. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Other ſheepe I haue alſo</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>which are not of this Fold, them alſo muſt I bring, and they ſhall heare my Word, and there ſhall be one Sheepfold and one Shepheard.</hi> Other ſheepe I haue, let them wander where they will in Deſerts or vnknowne Mountaines, Faith they haue, and therefore ſheepe; ſheepe they are, and therefore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16091:40"/>
haue Chriſt for their Shepheard, and his Church the Sheep-fould that they belong to; and as hee promiſeth to bring them to his ſheepe-fould, ſo hee effects, firſt, by himſelfe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He is our peace</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which hath made of both one, and hath broken the ſtop of the partition wall;</hi> the partition wall is pulled downe, and now Gentiles, and all ſorts of people come to bee members of the Church: ſo likewiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will giue you one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtance to the Point (that the Church is generall of all beleeuing perſons, and of all places) in the caſe of <hi>Cornelius, Act.</hi> 10.1, 12, 34, 35. he was a Gentile, and a Heathen, and accounted vncleane; yet his prayers and his almes were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, which they could not haue been vnleſſe hee had beleeued. And <hi>Peter</hi> in a Viſion ſaw a great ſheete let downe from heauen with foure corners, which ſignified the foure quarters of the World, and in it were all manner of creeping beaſts: and the meaning of the Viſion was this, that God would extend his Church to all parts of the World, and bring ſome of all Nations into it. So that the Viſion was not onely for <hi>Cornelius,</hi> but generally to ſignifie, that the Church ſhould be of all Nations, and ſo <hi>Peter</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in theſe 34. and 35. Verſes; <hi>Of a truth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I doe now perceiue that God is no accepter of perſons, but in euery Nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteouſneſſe, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him.</hi> The Rule is pregnant, and preciſely to the Point, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. <hi>There is neither Iew nor Grecian, bond nor free, male nor female, but ye are all one in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> And ſo they ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.31. The
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16091:40"/>
Angels ſhall gather the bodies of the Elect from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and corners of the World; then there muſt needs haue been a Church in all Corners of the World, and ſo they ſhall be found in heauen after the Reſurrection, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 7.9. for there the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>I beheld, and lo, a great multitude which no man could number of all nations, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; tongues ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lambe, prayſing God,</hi> and <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21.13. So the Church is Catholike, generally diſperſed ouer the face of the whole world, and euery beleeuing man is a true member of it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons are theſe. Firſt, God is the Lord and Ruler  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label>  of all the world; and therefore the Church, the body of his Sonne, (who is Heire of the world) muſt be as large too, at leaſt for ſome of all parts: For ſhall the Kingdome of Gods power reach euery where, and not the Kingdome of his grace proportionably? In ſome meaſure (though not in that generality altogether) it is to reach as farre too.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods mercy and Chriſts merits requires it, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label>  that the Church ſhould bee generally diſperſed ouer the whole world. Gods mercy requires it, who would that all men ſhould be ſaued, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. that is, all ſorts of men, of all places. So likewiſe Chriſts merits require it, for that was for the ſinnes of the whole world, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. that is, for ſome of euery part of the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God is glorified in the higheſt degree onely in  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label>  thoſe that are members of the Church, that are ſaued. It is true, God is glorified much in the Reprobates that are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but he is glorified in the higheſt degree onely in thoſe that are ſaued. And ſhall there be any place, or Nation, or Tongue in the world, that the Lord will not be glorified in ſome portion of it, euen in the higheſt degrees? That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be beleeued; therefore the Church is generall, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Satans Kingdome is generall, and euery wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label>  perſon is a member of his curſed Synagogue; therefore Chriſts Kingdome is generall too; and euery Beleeuer through the whole world is of his Church.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the Church is thus generall, to leaue the wicked  <label type="milestone">

The firſt Vſe is matter of Reproofe, and firſt againſt the Iewes, that would haue the Church, and ſo the ſauing faith confined to their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if they were the onely people of God, and none but they. It is true that ſo it was for many hundred yeeres, the Lord chuſing them from all the nations of the earth, as his onely peculiar people, to be glorified by them alone in his ſeruice and worſhip, that ſo they might bee glorified alone (as it were) by him in heauen. Yea, but the greater the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God herein was to them, the greater was their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe to him, in that they ſhooke of his yoke, and would not receiue Chriſt Ieſus, though he were ſent ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to them; but reiected him and crucified him, and to this day (for the moſt part) they doe abandon him as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor.

hath ſpirituall Altars for a cleane ſacrifice to be offered on, and that now is come to paſſe that which the Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>that in the place where it was ſaid vnto them ye are not my people, it ſhalbe ſaid vnto them, ye are the Sonnes of the liuing God.</hi> And as it is <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. That <hi>where two or three are gathered together in the Name of Chriſt, he is in the midſt of them.</hi> And as our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and Truth.</hi> And that now is fullfilled the ſaying of <hi>Iſaiah, Iſai.</hi> 54.1. which he foretold, that the <hi>Barren hath more Children then the fruitfull woman;</hi> that is, that there ſhould be more Gentiles of the Church, then euer there were Iewes. And as it reproues them, ſo it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues the Donatiſtes, that would haue no Church, but in Affrica, no Church but theirs; ſomewhat like vnto the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Separatiſts at this day, that would haue no Church but theirs. Principally it reproues the Papiſts, that would haue no Church but that of Rome; affirming, that they that are not of the fellowſhip of that Church, are in the certaine eſtate of damnation. But this is againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Catholike Church to be reſtrained within them. And let not them take vpon them to reſtraine that which God hath inlarged; but as they brag of <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo let them learne to be ruled by God as <hi>Peter</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.15. not to account thoſe vncleane, whom God accounts and calls cleane. And therefore ſeeing God hath ſo far inlarged his bounty, that he hath purified the whole world, ſo that ſome of all parts and places ſhould be members of his Church; for ſhame let them not ſcantle his goodneſſe, and pollute all other Churches as vncleane, except their Church: But let them leaue all others to God, and let them labour to ſee that themſelues be purified, leſt (as I ſaid before of the Iews) they proue themſelues of all other Churches to be none of Gods Church.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Vſe is for Inſtruction, teaching vs what  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>  Church it is that we muſt eſteeme and repute Catholike; ſurely not any particular Church in the world, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16091:42"/>
ſo pure and ſound, but that which is generall, that which is ſcattered ouer all the world. It is true that a particular Church may be called Catholike, that is, a right beleeuing Church; or Catholike, that is, a part of the Catholike; but properly and rightly it is not ſo. Alſo there may be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike viſible Church, that is, all the particular parts of the viſible Church beeing conſidered in one common Notion in the minde: But it is moſt truly and properly affirmed of the inuiſible Church; for that is the Catholike Church, which is holy and Apoſtolike, which in the true ſenſe containes onely thoſe that are truly ſanctified, and built on the foundation of the Apoſtles doctrine. Thus you ſee what Church to repute Catholike, namely, that which is generall, ſcattered and diſperſed ouer all the world, and not any particular Church, much leſſe may any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man be called properly Catholike. And therefore it is a vaine brag of the Papiſts, to ſay, that their Church is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike. It is a particular Church. For firſt, it is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſperſed ouer all the world, and beſides there was a time when there were other Chriſtian Churches, at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem and Antioch, &amp;c. before euer their Church was; and therefore there was a time when theirs was not Catholike, and ſo not Catholike now, becauſe that which is Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,<note place="margin">Sheldon.</note> is one and the ſame at all times. I ſay not in one place, but thoſe that profeſſe the ſame true faith that others did, are ſtill the Catholike Church. A Prieſt of their owne hath well anſwered them, that ſo long as they were gouerned by generall Councels, they might bee called Catholikes; But now ſeeing they are gouerned by one man, (namely the Pope) it is fitter that they be called of him Papiſts. And ſo much for the ſecond Vſe.</p>

But then you will ſay, there is but a little Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith; there is ſcarce any one Point Catholike; for in what one Point of Religion haue all the faithfull agreed?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16091:42"/>
I anſwer, firſt, Yes, euery fundamentall Point was alwayes held by al the faithul, els they were not faithful, if they were cut off from the foundation; ſo that howſoeuer in ſmaller matters, as of Ceremonies and circumſtances and ſuch like, ſome differences and ſome errors were betwixt thoſe that were faithfull, yet in the maine ſubſtance there was none at all. Secondly, I ſay, all times are not alike; for the meanes and occaſions of knowledge of ſome fundamentall Points, in that cleereneſſe as they ſhould bee knowne, the light of ſaluation breaking out euery day more cleerely then other; Therefore it is ſufficient if they all beleeued the ſame things that we doe, ſo farre as they did and might attaine to the knowledge of them; or if they were ignorant of ſome, yet it is ſufficient that they followed the reſt, and did not oppoſe againſt that which they knew not, but did renounce and repent of their ignorance, and this their very repentance of their ignorance is an acknowledgement of ſuch Truths as they were ignorant of. By this it appeares plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the faith of the Church of Rome is not Catholike, becauſe none of thoſe Points wherein they differ from vs haue been vniuerſally held, no nor ſpoken by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as Purgatory, Inuocation of Saints, Tranſubstantiation, Iuſtification by workes, worſhipping of Images, and ſuch like. But they will ſay, If our faith be not Catholike,  <label type="milestone">

               </label>    then yours is much leſſe Catholike, being gainſaid generally by the Church for many hundred yeeres? I anſwer; Firſt,  <label type="milestone">

               </label>   it is gainſaid indeed by many that profeſſed themſelues to be of the Church, but thoſe that were truly of the Church of Chriſt held and maintained that in effect which wee doe, as we can inſtance in many particulars of euery Age.

Not by thoſe that were truly faithfull, but by thoſe that made diſſenſions in the Church. But if this will not ſatiſfie them, then let this

controuerſie be decided by that other adiunct in the Nicen  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Creede, where it is called Catholike and Apoſtolike; for that alone is truly Catholike which is alſo Apoſtolike; and then it is cleere on our ſide. For if the Apoſtles beleeued and taught as we doe (as we haue and can plainely proue) then our faith is Catholike; and whatſoeuer Church or Perſons ſince them haue not ſo taught and beleeued muſt not bee held Catholike nor Apoſtolike, nor yet their faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Therefore our faith being Apoſtolike, muſt needs be truly Catholike; and howſoeuer, though none had belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſince the Apoſtles dayes, yet we holding the fame faith with them, wee muſt needs haue the true Catholike faith. Indeed this is a reaſon to fleſh and blood which they make, when they ſay, Where was your Church ſo many hundred yeeres? We anſwer, Wee euer had a Church, for we euer had ſome that oppoſed them and their courſes, and ſtood for the maintenance of this faith which we profeſſe. But if neuer any ſince the Apoſtles dayes had ſtood for this faith which we profeſſe, yet we ſay and can proue, that the Apoſtles beleeued and taught the ſame that we beleeue and teach; therefore our faith is truly Catholike and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.

Of that which paſſeth betwixt the members and Chriſt the Head, you haue heard already: now in the next place wee are to ſpeake of the communion the members haue one with another. It is here aduiſedly to bee recalled to minde, what Church it is that we here ſpeake of, that is, the Church of choſen men both in heauen and earth; for ſo it was propounded to be ſpoken to in the entrance vpon this Point; and ſecondly, euery one of theſe ſixe adiuncts in that Article of the Creed concerning the Church, agreeth to each, both to the choſen men in heauen, as well as to the choſen men on earth. For firſt, the Church of choſen men in heauen is one with that on earth; ſecondly, they are holy alſo, though not in a truer ſenſe, yet in a higher degree, for they haue attained to the perfection of that holineſſe, which theſe on earth haue but in a ſmall meaſure. Thirdly, they are Catholike too, as well as we, conſiſting of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

People and Kinreds, as <hi>Reuel.</hi> 7.9. Fourthly, they in heauen haue a communion with Chriſt their Head, as well as we on earth, and that in a more ſpeciall manner then we haue; for Chriſt is preſent with them, not onely by his Spirit, as hee is with vs, but alſo hee is bodily preſent with them, which wee doe not yet enioy, therefore they haue a more ſpeciall communion with him then wee yet haue. Fifthly, they haue a communion with vs,<note place="margin">Caluin inſtit. lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>5 1. 2.</hi> Morney de ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. pag. <hi>8.</hi>

So we ſee, that theſe ſixe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts agree to the Church of choſen men in heauen as well as on earth: yea further, moſt of theſe agree to the elect Angels too, for they haue an vnitie amongſt themſelues, and ſo are one, alſo they are holy; and ſo like wiſe they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Chriſt to be their Head as we haue, no doubt but they haue a communion with Chriſt, and Chriſt with them: and when our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.10. <hi>that they reioyce ouer a ſinner that is conuerted;</hi> it is plaine that they haue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with vs alſo.

The third kind of wants that we Communicate in, are the infirmities one of another; hee that is weake goes to him that is ſtrong, and acquaints him with his weakeneſſe, and intreates his patience and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; the ſtrong receiues him as a weake Brother, and beares with his weakneſſe; this the Apoſtle exhorts thoſe that are ſtrong vnto, as their duty, <hi>Ro.</hi> 15.1.2.3. <hi>we which are ſtrong ought to beare the infirmities of the weake, and not to pleaſe ourſelues, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. <hi>beare ye one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, condeſcend to his weakeneſſe, and beare it as your owne burthen; And <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.13.<note place="margin">Thirdly, this communion of practiſe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their doings.</note>

They reioyce at the welfare of Gods children, they ſorrow and grieue at their harmes, euen as if themſelues did partake with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Remember them that are in bonds, euen as you your ſelues were in bonds.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sixthly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and all they haue.</note> Laſtly, there is a communion in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and all that they haue, euen in their liues; they thinke not their liues to deare for the good of their brethren. And this is it the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.17. <hi>That though he be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp vpon the ſacrifice and ſeruice of their faith, yet hee is glad, and reioyceth with them all.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. the ſame Apoſtle wiſheth himſelfe to bee ſeparate from Chriſt for his brethren the Iſraelites: not that hee did wiſh himſelfe to be out of the loue and fauour of God in Chriſt (for that were ſinfull ſo to wiſh) but this is a kind of hyperbolicall ſpeech, ſpoken in the higheſt degree, to ſhew forth his great loue to them; as if he ſhould ſay, ſuch is my great loue to my brethren, that if my life, or any thing I haue could redeeme them, I would part from it. Whereſoeuer is any failing in any one of theſe, ſo farre forth it is ſinne in the offender.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Thirdly, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note>The third thing conſiderable in this communion is, how farre forth it is to bee extended or inlarged, and that is in generall to all duties, times, places, perſons; but yet with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16091:51"/>
theſe due circumſtances and cautions:<note place="margin">Cautions herein to be obſerued.</note> Firſt, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we doe herein, wee muſt doe it deliberately with good aduiſe and diſcretion; wee muſt doe it ſeaſonably, taking  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  the beſt opportunities, yet letting none ſlip. The righteous man, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 1.3. is compared to the Tree planted by the Riuers of waters, that brings forth his fruit in due ſeaſon. Secondly, as we muſt doe it ſeaſonably, ſo wee muſt doe it  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  not coldly, but out of zeale, and in loue to them; nor yet deſperately and wretchleſly without any regard of our owne eſtate, either temporall, ſpecially ſpirituall, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.39. <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe;</hi> that is, thy ſelfe firſt, and then thy brother as heartily as thy ſelfe. Thirdly, we muſt doe it alſo with an eye to Chriſt, and to  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  the Religion of thoſe we doe good too, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.41, 42. We muſt receiue a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, and a righteous man in the name of a righteous man; and if wee giue but a Cup of cold water to a Diſciple in the name of a Diſciple, we ſhall not looſe our reward. We muſt giue it in the name of Chriſt, and wee muſt doe it as vnto Chriſt. <hi>Philem.</hi> 4.5, 6. the Apoſtle giues thankes to God for the loue and faith which <hi>Philemon</hi> had towards the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and towards all Saints; that which <hi>Philemon</hi> did to the poore Saints, he did it with an eye to the Lord Ieſus, and the Religion they did profeſſe. Fourthly, theſe duties  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  are to bee done chiefly to thoſe to whom wee are tyed by a further band, beſides that of faith and loue; as firſt of all to our Teachers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. <hi>We muſt make them partakers of all our goods.</hi> It is an hiperbolicall ſpeech, noting that wee are eſpecially bound to them. Secondly, Miniſters to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Miniſters are tied in a ſpeciall band, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Iames, and Cephas, and Iohn, when they knew of the grace which was giuen vnto me</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) they gaue vnto mee and Barnabas the right hand of fellowſhip.</hi> So in the third place, to thoſe with whom we communicate in their goods and things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.26, 27. <hi>If the Gentiles be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their ſpirituall things, their duty is to minister to them in their carnall things.</hi> Fourthly, to thoſe that are in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16091:52"/>
or tribulation; we muſt haue an eſpeciall care to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter comfort vnto them, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.9. <hi>I Iohn, euen your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and companion in tribulation, and in the Kingdome and patience of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. <hi>As yee are partakers of the ſufferings, ſo ſhall yee be alſo of the conſolation.</hi> We muſt bee companions and partners with them in their ſufferings.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  Fifthly, we muſt take heed we bring in no confuſion, as the Anabaptiſts, that hold a community in poſſeſſion, but wee muſt hold it onely in vſe; for communitie in poſſeſſion was free, as we may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.34, 35. they ſold their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſtributed to euery one according to their need: and <hi>Acts</hi> 5.4. <hi>Whileſt it remained, appertained it not to thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias) and after it was ſold, was it not in thine owne power?</hi> They made all things common, that is, in vſe, not in poſſeſſion; for it was their owne before they ſold it, and before they gaue it, and they did it voluntarily, not by conſtraint: ſo that we muſt not bring in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of poſſeſſion, but of vſe onely. As for example, a man hath a houſe, now hee communicates the vſe of this houſe to another, but yet keepes the poſſeſſion to himſelfe. Laſtly, this communion reacheth to the Saints in heauen too;<note place="margin">This communion extends to the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note> for no doubt they in generall pray for vs, and wee in generall giue thankes for them: the generall ſtate of each requires this duty, but in particular neither doe they pray for vs, nor we giue thankes for them; therefore hee that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this further, doth that which is preiudiciall both to their ſtate and ours. And ſo much for the proofes and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Point.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Reaſons are of fiue ſorts. firſt, in reſpect of God.</note>The Reaſons why there is ſuch a communion are theſe: firſt, there are particular Reaſons in reſpect of God; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of Chriſt; thirdly, in reſpect of the ſpirit; fourthly, in reſpect of the faithfull themſelues; and laſtly, there are Reaſons in reſpect of the aduerſaries to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  Firſt, in reſpect of God, the Reaſons are theſe: Firſt, that Gods worſhip and ſeruice may be the more ſoundly, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and effectually performed to his greater glory; and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16091:52"/>
that is done when all the faithfull ioyne together to lift at it, as with one ſhoulder, as it is in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3 9. for ſo the word Conſent, in that place doth ſignifie in the Originall; and with one minde and mouth, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6. And this not onely in one particular place or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but generally in all places, in all the aſſemblies of the Saints both here in England, and alſo in France and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, and all other places where the name of the Lord is called vpon; for the faithfull in all places doe in effect and for ſubſtance the ſame duties to God, it is fit that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God ſhould be ſoundly, effectually, and ſufficiently performed. Now that it may be thus performed, there muſt be this communion amongſt the faithfull. The ſecond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Reaſon in reſpect of God, is, becauſe God is the common Father to all the faithfull, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. And the faithfull they are all brethren, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.8, 9. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as brethren that haue one Father, they are to hold and exerciſe this communion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in reſpect of Chriſt; and firſt as he is the head,<note place="margin">The ſecond ſort of reaſons in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſt.</note> the faithfull they are the body or members, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>grow vp in him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which is the head, that  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  is, Chriſt, by whom all the body being coupled and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> Now looke what communion there is betwixt the members that belong to one head, the ſame is amongſt the faithfull. Secondly, he is the head corner-ſtone, and we  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  are all liuing ſtones of the ſame building, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. Now looke as the head corner-ſtone makes all the building hang faſt together, ſo we are faſtened together in Chriſt. Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  it is ſo, becauſe Chriſt hath prayed that it may be ſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.20, 21. that they may bee one, as the Father and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe are one, and therefore it cannot but be effected.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is ſo in reſpect of the Spirit;<note place="margin">The third reaſon in reſpect of the Spirit.</note> we communicate in one and the ſame Spirit, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. and 11.13. there are diuerſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit. And Verſ. 11. <hi>all theſe things worketh the ſelfe-ſame Spirit.</hi> And Verſ. 13. <hi>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, &amp;c.</hi> One and the ſame Spirit dwelleth and worketh in all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16091:53"/>
and this is one reaſon of their neere communion. The Heathen accounted it a neere fellowſhip and friendſhip for one ſoule to bee in two bodies: but this is a farre neerer communion then that; this is a neerer communion then that of man and wife; for they twaine are one fleſh, but theſe are all one Spirit. For looke how it is betwixt vs and our Lord Ieſus, as wee are ioyned to him, ſo proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly are we ioyned one with another. But we are one Spirit with him, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. ſo we are onely one Spirit amongſt our ſelues; ſo that in reſpect of the Spirit the faithfull haue a mutuall communion amongſt themſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fourth ſort of reaſons are in regard of the faithfull them ſelues, in diuers reſpects.</note>The fourth Reaſon is, in reſpect of the faithfull them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and that in many reſpects; firſt, becauſe of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities; euery member of the Church hath need of euery grace, but no one is capable of euery grace in himſelfe, at leaſt not to receiue and diſtribute too; and therefore there  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  are many members, and yet all in one body, that euery one may haue their ſeuerall gifts, one to receiue in one kind, another to giue in another kind, that ſo all our wants  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  may be ſupplied. Secondly, in reſpect of the faithfull, there is this communion in regard of their helpe; that if one fall into ſinne, another may helpe him vp againe, and that they  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  may build vp one another in faith and obedience. Thirdly, it is needfull for the comfort and incouragement of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the worſhip and ſeruice of God, that one may be  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  whetted on and prouoked by another. Fourthly, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the maintenance of loue amongſt the faithfull, which can no way ſo well be maintained, as when wee all  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  ſee, that we haue need of one another. Laſtly, it is needfull in reſpect of the faithfull for the declaration and exerciſe of their faith that our faith may haue ſome fruits to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in, <hi>Philem.</hi> Verſ. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fifrh ſort of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries.</note>Fifthly and laſtly, there is this communion in reſpect of our Aduerſaries, and firſt for defending our ſelues; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrongly vnited together as one man, they cannot ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  vs, whereas if we were ſeparated and diſioyned, they  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  would eaſily ouercome vs. Secondly, for the offending
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16091:53"/>
and oppugning the enemies, who band themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt them; and therefore they are to ſet themſelues all together as with one heart againſt their aduerſaries: otherwiſe they will be ſo farre from ouercomming them, as that they will bee ouercome of them. And ſo much for the Reaſons why there is ſuch a mutuall communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the faithfull.</p>
            <p>The Vſes of the Point are theſe. Firſt, this teacheth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>  one of vs to labour to bee one of the members of Gods Church, that ſo thou mayſt haue thy part in this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that thou mayſt haue thereby a right to God and Chriſt, and the Spirit, and to faith &amp; to iuſtification, and to ſaluation, and to all the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit, and to all the promiſes and priuiledges of the faithfull, and to all the meanes of grace here, and glory hereafter: theſe are no where to be had but here; therefore if thou art not one of this communion and ſociety, thou haſt no right in theſe things. And here they are certainely to be had and inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore let euery one of vs labour to be liuing-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this communion and ſociety, and ſo we ſhall haue a rich and a gracious portion with the faithfull, wee ſhall be made partakers of the ſame grace with them here, and of the ſame glory hereafter. Maruell not then that <hi>Dauid</hi> and other of the Saints were ſo much grieued, when they were depriued of this bleſſed communion: though they were neuer depriued of this inward communion, yet it was their griefe, and the very breaking of their hearts, when they were depriued of this outward fellowſhip. And no maruell alſo though they did ſo reioyce, when they could come to Gods Houſe to bee partakers of this fellowſhip; for then they could reach out their hands to partake of the pledges of Gods loue ſenſibly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as this teacheth vs to labour to be one of this  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>  ſociety and communion, ſo it teacheth vs alſo to labour to maintaine this communion, that as wee bee intitled to it, ſo we muſt bend all our forces to contribute to it, and to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, and not to content our ſelues with the bare Title
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16091:54"/>
onely, but to be as we are called, and to practiſe as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe; that as wee profeſſe to haue a communion of ſtate, ſo we may haue a communion of practiſe alſo. And this is it which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Keepe the vnitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, As thou haſt found that fauour with God, that thou art aſſociated by a calling to the Church, and the communion thereof, ſo let it be thy chiefe and principall endeauour to maintaine and keepe that vnity and communion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Continue in one ſpirit and in one mind:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Flinch not from it, but as you haue this communion, ſo ſtand in it, and maintaine it.<note place="margin">Things to be done that we may maintaine this communion.</note> And that we may ſo doe, we muſt take heed, firſt, that we ſeparate nor cut off our ſelues, nor be drawne from this communion; this is forbidden, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25, 39.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Not forſaking the fellowſhip we haue amongſt our ſelues, as the manner of ſome is.</hi> And in the 39. Verſe; <hi>But wee are not they which withdraw our ſelues vnto perdition.</hi> If wee ſeparate, we cut off our ſelues from the body, and ſo from the head too, and then we haue no part in Chriſt (for hee is a head to none but his owne body) nor in God, nor in the Spirit, nor in any of the promiſes and priuiledges and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that belong to this ſocietie. And therefore this is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall matter that euery one of vs is to take heed of, namely, that wee entertaine not the leaſt thought of leauing the Church; though we doubt of the truth of it, yet wee muſt  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  be well aduiſed before we leaue it. Secondly, we muſt take heed wee giue no offence to the faithfull, to cauſe them to alienate themſelues from vs, by walking inordinately, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. the faithfull are commanded to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from euery brother that walketh inordinately, or by contention, for the Church hath nothing to do with ſuch, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. nor by any other miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  Thirdly, as we muſt take heed that we giue no offence, ſo we muſt take heed we bee not too apprehenſiue of offence; that we be not ready to breake out vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little quarrell and diſcontent; but wee muſt reſolue to beare any thing (ſo that it be not againſt conſcience) rather

then to trouble that communion, or to interrupt that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip. Laſtly and principally, wee muſt take heed that  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  we repaire to the publike aſſemblies, and that wee gather together with theſe aſſemblies for the worſhip and ſeruice of God, to heare the Word read and preached, and to ioyne together in prayer: for this is it that the Apoſtle approues, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>When yee are gathered together, &amp;c.</hi> And this is it that is commended in the Church at Ieruſalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>that they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and breaking of bread and prayer, Matth.</hi> 18.22. <hi>Where two or three</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midſt of them:</hi> he promiſeth his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall preſence to this communion and ſocietie; therefore we muſt be carefull to ioyne with ſuch aſſemblies, for there is no better way to continue this communion then this. And as we muſt come to theſe places our ſelues, ſo we muſt call vpon one another to doe ſo too; for ſo it was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, that the faithfull ſhould doe in the laſt dayes, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.3. that they ſhould ſay, <hi>Come, let vs goe vp to the Mountaine of the Lord to the Houſe of the God of Iacob, &amp;c.</hi> and wee muſt alſo reioyce at ſuch occaſions, when wee heare that men come willingly to the houſe of the Lord, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.1.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is matter of examination, whereby wee  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label>  may try whether we be true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church, or not. Doeſt thou practiſe this Communion and fellowſhip? then thou art a true member; Elſe thou canſt neuer truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thy ſelfe that thou art a true member, vnleſſe thou practiſe this Communion: proue, and try, and examine your ſelues therefore, and that by theſe particulars; Firſt,<note place="margin">Trials whether we practiſe this communion.</note> let vs examine our ſelues vpon this point; doe we vſe the meanes of Saluation Iointly, and particularly, and continually? Doe wee willingly bring our ſelues and our Families, to partake  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  in the Word, Sacraments and Prayer? The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaking of the members of this Communion, ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall come williegly at the time of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling:</hi> And doe we profit by theſe meanes? Haue they the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16091:55"/>
ſame effect in vs, as they haue in Gods Saints? If they haue,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  then we are of this Communion of Saints, elſe not. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let vs examine our ſelues concerning our Gifts. Hath God diſtributed to thee any gift or grace whatſoeuer, and art thou willing to imploy it and Communicate it to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of the reſt of the Saints, as the Apoſtle was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11. that did long to bee with the Romanes? And why did he ſo long? Why, becauſe he had ſome ſpirituall gift to beſtow amongſt them; if it be thus with thee, then thou art a member of this Communion. This is that our Sauiour commandeth <hi>Peter, Luk.</hi> 22.32. <hi>When thou art conuerted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Make  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  others partakers of the ſame grace with thee. Thirdly, wee muſt examine our ſelues in reſpect of the wants of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low members. Are we willing to relieue them in their wants, to ſupply them in their neceſſities, according to our ability? If wee are, then this is a token to vs that wee truly practiſe this Communion of Saints. This is it that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle commends as a thing wel done, that the Philippians did Communicate to his affliction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.14. And this alſo he Commandes, <hi>Ro.</hi> 12.13. <hi>that they diſtribute to the neceſſities of the Saints, and that they giue themſelues to hoſpitality.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. <hi>To doe good, and to diſtribute forget not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for with ſuch ſacrifices God is wel pleaſed.</hi> And this is the charge that the Apoſtle wills <hi>Timothy</hi> to lay vpon Rich men, that <hi>They be Rich in good workes, ready to diſtribute.</hi> And this he commends in them of Macedonia, <hi>That beyond their power they were willing, and prayed vs with great inſtance,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.3, 4. <hi>that wee would receiue the grace and fellowſhip of the miniſtring which is towards the Saints.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.26, 27. And <hi>Act.</hi> 4. <hi>Men ſold that they had and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  to euery one as they had need.</hi> Fourthly, wee muſt examine our ſelues in regard of our affections. Are we like minded to them? Doe wee ſuffer when they ſuffer? Haue wee a fellow-feeling of the afflictions and miſeries of our fellow-members? If we haue; then we are fellow-members with them. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. <hi>If one member ſuffer, all ſuffer with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16091:55"/>
it:</hi> This is a liuely token of a liuing-member, if they haue a feeling of the ſufferings of their fellow-members; euery li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing-member of the Church hath the Bowels of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.12. mooued with a liuely feeling of the miſeries of others, elſe they are no liuing, but rotten and dead mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Fiftly, we muſt examine our ſelues, whether we pray  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  for our fellow-members, as for our ſelues; whether we pray for the good of Gods Church, as wee are exhorted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.6. <hi>pray for the peace of Ieruſalem.</hi> Sixtly, wee muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  our ſelues whether wee exhort others, comfort them, prouoke them, and ſtirre them vp to loue, and to all good workes, as the Apoſtle willeth vs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Prouoke one another daylie.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24, 25. <hi>Let vs conſider one another to prouoke vnto loue, and to good workes, not forſaking the fellowſhip that is amongſt our ſelues.</hi> If we do exhort one another thus, this is a ſigne wee are of this fellowſhip, and a meanes to continue vs, that wee forſake not this fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Seuenthly, we muſt examine our ſelues whether we  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>  vſe our Chriſtian Liberty Chriſtianly, to the edification of our Brethren, and not to their deſtruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.13, 15. The laſt Rule that we muſt examine our ſelues by, is this;  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>  If wee labour not for our owne good onely, but for our Brethrens alſo; if wee ſeeke not our owne, but euery one anothers wealth. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.24. <hi>If we looke not euery one on our own things, but euery man alſo on the things of other men, Philip.</hi> 2.4. If wee labour to profit others as well as our ſelues, this is a true Note that we are true and liuing-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>The fourth Vſe. Here is matter of Comfort to vs that  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label>  are of the Church, not onely that God hath giuen vs a Communion of eſtate amongſt his people; but withall hath inioyned vs to practiſe all ſuch duties, as may make for the vpholding, thriuing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and continuing in this ſtate. Here then is our Comfort; Art thou in want? Why God hath giuen to others purpoſely for thy ſupply. Art thou in temptation, or at the point of death? Happily then thou art not able to pray for thy ſelfe; yet Comfort thy Soule, thou art a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16091:56"/>
member of the Church; and therefore thou art pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for of all the Faithfull, and God will heare their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for thee. Laſtly, Art thou depriued of Gods Houſe, by Trauell, or ſickneſſe, or perſecution? Yet here is thy Comfort, thou art there in Spirit, and thy cauſe there in ſome kinde is as effectually handled, as if thou wert there bodily preſent, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 4. <hi>When you are gathered together, and my Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> No diſtance of place, though it be as farre as heauen from earth, diſſunders this Communion, nor debarres vs the benefit of it, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit being euery where. So that the prayers of Gods Church (though I be neuer ſo farre off) are as effectuall for mee, as if I were there my ſelfe, ſo I be there in Spirit.</p>

            <p>The vſes are theſe, firſt, this ſerues to refute thoſe that hold this opinion, that we that are of the Church may know o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be ſo too, and that take vpon them to affirme, that ſuch and ſuch ſhalbe ſaued. Where God hath ſaid it, wee may boldly affirme it too, as of <hi>Dauid, Abraham, Peter, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> but wee muſt meddle no further, leaue the reſt to God; we may ſay of others, that wee are perſwaded that they are Gods; but wee cannot ſay, that we know it to be ſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.21, 22. when <hi>Peter</hi> would inquire of another what he ſhould doe; Our Sauiour anſwers him, <hi>What is that to thee follow thou mee.</hi> For the exceptions made out of 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.10. where the children of God are ſaid to bee knowne, and the children of the Diuell; <hi>Whoſoeuer doth not righteouſneſſe is not of God, &amp;c.</hi> And that in the 2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. where the Apoſtle calles the Lady he wrote to, <hi>Elect Lady.</hi> And in the 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>knowing beloued</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that ye are Elect of God.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like places are thus anſwered; that either this is ſpoken out of a Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſwaſion, or elſe it is ſpoken ſo of all, becauſe ſome are ſo, (for that ſeemeth to be the caſe, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4.) or if he had any certaine knowledge of any particulars, it was by diuine Reuelation; wee cannot ſay therefore out of a certaine knowledge, that any particular man is a true member of the Church.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>  Secondly, the Papiſts are here refuted; for they ſinne hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly in this kind, in that they pray to ſuch and ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, as Saints; whereas many of them (it is to bee feared) are damned Spirits in Hell; for falſe Teachers may be knowne by their fruits, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.19.20. Againe, this refutes three other errors of Popery, that do directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict theſe three branches of the Obſeruation: Firſt, they make Predeſtination to be contingent, and ſo they ſay, God
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16091:58"/>
himſelfe doth not preciſely know who are his; for if Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination do depend vpon mans will, that if man will he ſhal be ſaued, then God knows nothing till he ſee what man wil doe. Secondly they deny certainety of ſaluation, and ſo the faithfull themſelues cannot know themſelues to be Gods; they will haue no man ſay certainely of himſelfe that hee ſhalbe ſaued; and yet they will ſay it of others, that they are ſaued. And that is the third error which contradicts the third branch of this Obſeruation, in that they ſay, the Church is alwaies viſible, and ſo generally others may know who are true members of the Church as well as themſelues. But we ſee all theſe errors are here refuted by this Doctrine, wherein we haue taught and proued, that the faithfull are onely knowne to God and themſelues, and to none other. But if any man aske me, How then ſhall wee loue one another, and do good one to another as Brethren, if we know not who are Brethren. I anſwer, we muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelues of others, that they are Gods vpon good grounds, and good hope, becauſe wee ſee the fruits of faith and Repentance, and loue in them, ſo farre as can outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcerned; therefore we muſt be perſwaded they are Gods, and ſo we muſt loue them, and doe good to them as Brethren.</p>
            <p>The third Vſe teacheth vs, that if euery one may know  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label>  himſelfe to be Gods, then euery one of vs ſhould labour to learne this, and know it for himſelfe. But you will ſay, how ſhall we know this? I anſwer, by a due examination of thy ſelfe whether thou haſt Gods Spirit, the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which maketh vs to cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> that is, which maketh vs go to God as to our father, and to call vpon him as our father: for that ſame Spirit beareth witnes to our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that we are the Children of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16. And in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>What man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>knoweth the things of man, ſaue the Spirit that is in man; euen ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God: now we haue receiued not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are giuen vs of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16091:59"/>
God.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, no man knowes the things of God, that is, the ſecrets of God, but the Spirit of God. Now this is one of Gods ſecrets, to know whether we are Gods; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing this Spirit, wee may know our ſelues to bee Gods. And that wee may further ſeale this vnto our ſelues, let vs labour to make our Election ſure vnto our ſelues, by walking in good workes, ſtriuing againſt ſin, and working the workes of Holineſſe, and Righteouſneſſe, and obedience to God, which are the fruits of the Spirit of God, and ſo ſhall we aſſure our hearts that we are Gods.</p>

               <note place="margin">The fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Head in this queſtion, which is the diuiſion of the Church, which is partly of the name, partly of the thing it ſelfe. Firſt, of the name.</note>Now wee come to the fourth generall Head propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be handled in the Doctrine of the Church, and that is the diuiſion of the Church. Now the diuiſion of the Church is partly of the name, and partly of the thing it ſelfe. Firſt, of the name; The name is doubtfull, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries many ſignifications, yea and many contrary ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore is to be diuided accordingly. In the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſenſe it may be applyed to any multitude or company of people whatſoeuer; whether in caſe of Religion, or not in caſe of Religion; and the originall word both Hebrew and Greeke in the old and new Teſtament will beare it. In the old Teſtament, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32.22. there the name is applyed to <hi>Aſhur</hi> and his company, to a company of men not in caſe of Religion. And the ſame is applied, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.4. in caſe of Religion to the Congregation of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that is, to the Church of God. Nay further, that name is extended to thoſe that maliciouſly oppoſe the Church of God, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Religion, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 26.5. <hi>I haue hated the aſſembly</hi> (or Church) <hi>of the wicked.</hi> So that the Hebrew word in the old and new Teſtament beares it as well for a company, not in caſe of Religion, as for a company in caſe of Religion. So likewiſe the Greeke word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beares it in this generall ſenſe, as <hi>Act.</hi> 19.32. where it is applied to a diſordered aſſembly in a caſe of mutiny; <hi>The aſſembly</hi> (that is, the Church) <hi>was out of order.</hi> And
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16091:59"/>
in the <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. the ſame word is applied to the company of Beleeuers, that is, to the Church of God; <hi>The Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Church.</hi> So wee ſee how this word hath been applied in the old and new Teſtaments, to any multitude or company of people whatſoeuer, either in caſe, or not in caſe of Religion. Yea, but yet it is reſtrained in ordinary vſe of ſpeech, and ſo hath been for many yeeres, vnto a company of people as profeſſing ſome certaine Religion: whatſoeuer Religion it bee, the Church is accordingly ſo called; for there is a true Religion, and euery Church that imbraceth that Religion is a true Church. And againe, there are falſe Religions, and they that embrace any of them are falſe Churches; ſo euery Church receiueth her denomination from the Religion ſhe embraceth. As for example, we call thoſe Iewes which are borne Iewes; but thoſe onely are of the Iewiſh Church, which embrace the Iewiſh religion; ſo that if a Iew borne doe embrace the Chriſtian religion, he is not of the Iewiſh Church; though he be of the Iewiſh Nation, yet he is of the Chriſtian Church. So likewiſe if a man bee a Chriſtian borne, and yet ioyne with the Iewiſh Church in their religion, hee is not of the Chriſtian, but of the Iewiſh Church; and ſo it is of all others. So then the name of Church and Religion are in ſome ſenſe yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, all Churches receiuing denomination from the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profeſſe. Now then Religion being as the forme of the Church, giuing it name and being, therefore looke what Religion it is that the Church profeſſeth, and ſuch is the Church to bee reputed. There is a true Religion, and euery Church embracing and profeſſing the ſame, is to bee reputed a true Church, as the reformed Churches. There are many falſe Religions, and euery Church profeſſing ſuch Religion, are falſe Churches: as the Churches of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that worſhip falſe Gods, and ſo embrace falſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And ſo the Churches of the Saracens, that erect and ſet vp <hi>Mahomet</hi> againſt Chriſt; and of the Iewes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the comming of the Meſsiah in the fleſh, are falſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But there are ſome Churches that embrace party
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16091:60"/>
Religions, in part true, and in part falſe: yea, what Church is ſo pure, that is not tainted with ſome error? and what Church is there ſo impure, that profeſſeth not ſome notable heauenly Truths? We muſt therefore conſider what truths and what errors they hold, and ſo the truth will bee ſoone decided. Without Chriſt there is no ſaluation, and ſo no true Church, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Sonne, hath life; and he that hath not the Sonne of God, hath not life.</hi> If yee aske me, whether one and the ſame Church may not bee a true Church, in reſpect of ſome in it profeſſing the truth; or in reſpect of ſome fundamentall truths profeſſed in it; and yet a falſe Church in reſpect of ſome profeſſing falſhood in it, or in reſpect of ſome fundamentall truths ouerthrowne in it? I anſwer; Surely it may, till ſuch time as the falſe Church hath gotten the vpper-hand, and makes lawes for her errors, and againſt the others truths, with ſentence of abandoning all thoſe out of their Church which doe hold the truths. So it was with the Church of Rome before the Councell of Trent. And thus it was with the Church of Sardy, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.1, 4. <hi>ſhe had a name to liue, but was dead:</hi> and yet in the fourth Verſe the Lord ſaith, <hi>He hath a few names in Sardy, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore take this for a Rule, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer Church embraceth Chriſt Ieſus God and Man, the onely meanes of ſaluation, is a true Church, though tainted with many errors beſides; and on the contrary, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Church beleeueth not this is a falſe Church, though it hold many other excellent truths beſides. So much of the diuiſion of the name of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Secondly, of the thing it ſelfe.</note>Now wee come to ſpeake of the diuiſion of the thing it ſelfe, that is, of Gods Church; which is not ſo to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if God had ſo many ſeuerall kinds of Churches: for the Church (as I haue ſhewed before) is one and the ſame from the beginning of the world to the end: that Church of God which was in the beginning, and remaines now, and ſhall continue to the worlds end, is but one and the ſame Church; therefore when we mention the diuiſion of the Church it ſelfe, we meane not that it is ſeuerally diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16091:60"/>
into diuers and ſeuerall kinds, but diſtinguiſhed in it ſelfe, in diuers and ſundry reſpects; and principally for theſe, firſt, in reſpect of the bounds and limits,<note place="margin">Three wayes how the Church is diſtinguiſhed.</note> or compaſſe of it; ſecondly, in reſpect of the ſeuerall portions belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to it, in the ſeuerall eſtates that it is ordained vnto; thirdly, in reſpect of the outward ſtate of it to the world, ſometimes knowne, ſometimes vnknowne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is diſtinguiſhed in it ſelf, in reſpect of the bounds and compaſſe of it, and ſo it is either vniuerſal or particular; vniuerſall, that is,<note place="margin">Into vniuerſall,</note> the whole company of Gods choſen both in heauen an earth. But this hath no limits, but is diſperſed farre and wide ouer the face of the whole earth, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to heauen it ſelfe. But becauſe I haue ſpoken of this before, both in the Adiunct Catholike, and alſo in han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling the generall nature of the Church, therefore I will truſt your memories for that Point, and not ſpeake more here of it. In the next place a particular Church, that is,<note place="margin">or particular.</note> euery particular company of the faithful, or at leaſt of thoſe that are called to the profeſſion of the faith, which being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall by themſelues, of ſeuerall times and places, are but particular Churches. But becauſe wee ſhall ſpeake more properly of this, when wee come to ſpeake of the viſible Church; therefore we will reſpit it till then.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is diſtinguiſhed in it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Secondly, it is diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church Militant and Triumphant. What the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church is, defined.</note> in reſpect of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall portions that belong vnto it, in the ſeuerall ſtates that it is ordained to, and they are two. The firſt is on earth, or in this life, and that is a fighting or warfare: and the ſecond is in heauen, in the life to come, crowned and triumphing. And accordingly the Church is diuided into the Church Militant, and the Church Triumphant. To begin with the firſt, the Church Militant is the Congregation of the faithfull on earth, that doe continually exerciſe a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall warfare againſt ſinne and Satan, and all the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of God, and of his Religion. Marke the parts of the definition; I ſay, it is a Congregation of the faithfull that doe thus fight; for though Hypocrites, and ſometimes thoſe that doe perſecute the Goſpell doe fight the Lords Battels
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16091:61"/>
and ſo in a generall ſenſe may be reputed parts of this Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church, yet that is but colourably and outwardly for ſome ſiniſter reſpect, not in truth and ſingleneſſe of heart, nor in true hatred of ſinne, nor in a true deſire to obey God, and to aduance his Kingdome and glory. And therefore to ſpeake properly, none are true parts of this Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,<note place="margin">This warfare is ſpirituall in three reſpects.</note> but the faithfull onely. Secondly, I ſay, it is a ſpirituall warfare, and that in many reſpects: Firſt, it is ſpiritual in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the end of it; for though ſometimes the aduerſaries  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  of the faithfull oppugne them in their bodies and outward ſtates, yet it is meerely in a ſpiritual reſpect, either directly or indirectly to hurt their ſpiritual eſtate, or life of Grace, &amp; ſo likewiſe when the faithfull defend their bodies, or outward eſtate againſt their aduerſaries, when they maintaine their reputations or their liues, it is not ſo much for the thing it ſelfe, as to defend and maintaine our ſpirituall eſtates. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  it is ſpirituall in reſpect of the weapons that are vſed in this fight, for they are chiefely ſpirituall on both parts; the aduerſaries weapons are temptations, &amp;c. the faithfull, their weapons are the whole Armour of God.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  Thirdly, it is ſpirituall in regard of the Generals of the Field on both ſides, which are Spirits: Gods good Spirit on the ſide of the faithfull; and Satan and ſpirituall wickedneſſes on the wickeds ſide. The third thing in the note is this, that this warfare muſt be exerciſed continually; for the enuious man ſleepes not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. he and his are alwaies vp in armes againſt vs, therefore we muſt be ſo againſt them. And take this for a Rule, that looke whenſoeuer wee intermit out fight, wee doe ſo farre forth for the time ſuffer our ſelues to bee ouercome; if once wee ſtart aſide, the enemy gets the more vantage of vs. Laſtly, it is generall againſt all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries of God and of his Religion: for Satan and all his forces bend themſelues againſt God, and againſt his Church; and therefore the faithfull muſt bend all their forces againſt Satan, and all the aduerſaries of Gods Church. God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12.3. that he would bleſſe them that bleſſe him, and curſe them that curſe him. And ſo muſt all
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16091:61"/>
               <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, the faithfull, doe for God; as they muſt loue all that loue God, ſo they muſt fight againſt all that fight againſt God.</p>
            <p>A queſtion may be demanded here,<note place="margin">That the good Angels are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in ſome ſenſe, though no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> parts of it.</note> Whether the good Angels be not alſo parts of this Church Militant? I anſwer: They are parties in this buſineſſe in ſome ſenſe; for though the enemies cannot annoy them, and therefore they need not, neither doe they fight for themſelues, yet doe they fight for vs as true guardians and aſſiſtants, and as Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Meſſengers to ſuccour vs, or to diſcloſe and deſtroy our enemies, and their enterpriſes againſt vs. They are heauenly Souldiers, not onely in generall as the Starres and all the Hoaſt of Heauen are; but in particular aſſiſting vs in our ſpirituall warfare, and that perſonally, and by their office; they comfort vs in our temptations, as they did our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.11. after his temptation. And ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43. they comforted Chriſt in his agony, there appeared an Angell from heauen comforting him. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. the Angels are ſaid to pitch their tents round about them that feare God. So that the Angels are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about vs, but they pitch their tents about vs to fight for vs, and they do alſo deliuer vs. So then in ſome ſenſe they are parties in this warfare; yea, but yet becauſe they are out of the danger of the enemies that they cannot annoy them, therefore they cannot properly bee ſaid to be any part of the militant Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Church Triumphant, what is that?<note place="margin">What the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant is.</note> That is the Congregation of Saints in heauen, that haue already finiſhed their warfare, and ouercome their enemies, and do now raigne and triumph in glory together with Ieſus Chriſt in his Kingdome. But becauſe I haue ſpoken of this Point before, therefore I will not now ſtand vpon it; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we will here ſhew ſome differences betwixt the Church Militant, and the Church Triumphant; and ſo come to an obſeruation ariſing from hence.</p>
            <p>The differences are theſe following.</p>

               </label>  The Obſeruation from hence is this, That ſeeing there is firſt here a Church Militant on earth, and then a Church Triumphant in heauen; hence I ſay ariſeth this Obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That none can euer come to be members of the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Church in heauen, except firſt they bee members of the Militant and fighting Church on earth. This was figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the paſſage of Iſrael out of Egypt into Canaan; they muſt incounter with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoaſt, they muſt paſſe through the Red Sea, they muſt wander in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe many yeeres, and ſuſtaine hunger and thirſt; they muſt warre with their enemies, euen whole Nations by the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16091:62"/>
way. All this they muſt doe before they can enter into this earthly Canaan: euen ſo it is with vs in our paſſage to the heauenly Canaan. We muſt meet with many enemies, and ſuſtaine and vndergoe many miſeries, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Through many afflictions wee muſt enter into the Kingdome of heauen. Act.</hi> 14.12. What are afflictions, but aſſaults, troubles, temptations and fights? Why, through theſe wee muſt enter, and through many of theſe, ſaith the Apoſtle; we ſhall meet with many of them here in this life; yea, we muſt paſſe through them, ſaith the Apoſtle; there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of it, it is vnauoidable. The end we ſeeke after, is Gods Kingdome; why, this is the way thither (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) theſe are the Pikes you muſt paſſe through, euen many afflictions. So in the 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. the Apoſtle ſaith, that all that will liue godly in Chriſt ſhall ſuffer perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All thoſe that looke to triumph in heauen, muſt liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus; now all that will doe ſo ſhall ſuffer perſecution whether they will or not, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>For our light afflictions, which are but for a moment, cauſe vnto vs a farre more excellent, and an eternall weight of glory:</hi> not that our afflictions doe cauſe it by way of efficacy or merit; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. that the afflictions of this preſent life are not worthy of the glory which ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to vs. What is the meaning then of this place? It muſt be vnderſtood by way of order and conſequence, that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions muſt of neceſſity goe before, or elſe the eternall weight of glory cannot follow after, <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Yee ſhall haue tribulation, but bee thou faithfull vnto the death, and I will giue thee the Crowne of life.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Thou ſhalt haue trials and tribulations, but be thou faithfull and fight, and thou ſhalt haue the Crowne of life. And the promiſe of life is reſtrained onely to thoſe that ouercome, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.7, 11, 17. And hence it is, that the whole courſe of the faithfull is called the Fight of Faith, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Fight the good fight of Faith, lay hold on eternall life:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Whoſoeuer thou art that haſt faith, fight for it, or elſe thou ſhalt neuer lay hold on eternall life, neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16091:63"/>
the end of thy faith, which is the ſaluation of thy ſoule. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.21, 22. the Mother of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> children came to Chriſt, and beſought him that her two ſonnes might ſit, one at his right hand, and the other at his left in his Kingdome: But Ieſus anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Yee aske yee know not what; Are yee able to drinke of the Cup that I ſhall drinke of, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Can yee participate with me in my afflictions? Shewing plainely, that we can neuer come to heauen to partake with him in glory, vnleſſe firſt we drinke of his Cup, and partake with him here in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſo much for the proofe of the Point.</p>

As a man that is to fight againſt his enemies, will fit and prepare, and arme himſelfe to the Battell: ſo muſt we; Our enemies will be ſure to be prepared againſt vs, and therefore if we be not prepared againſt them, how ſhall we be able to withſtand them, and therefore we muſt be continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring our ſelues to incounter with ſinne and Satan, and all our ſpirituall Enemies.

Secondly, we are to conſider what weapons we are to vſe; we muſt put on the whole Armour of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. And ſpecially we muſt labour to be furniſhed with theſe two parts of this Armor, Prayer and Watchfulneſſe: nothing is more neceſſary to a Souldier in time of warre then watchfulneſſe; for if he fall, aſleepe, his enemy comes and kills him; or elſe if his Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell comes and findes him, hee kils him. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. exhorts vs to watchfulneſſe, <hi>Bee ſober and watch; for your aduerſary the Diuell, like a roaring Lyon, walketh about ſeeking whom he may deuoure.</hi> But what kind of watching is this? This is not to watch with a Bille on our  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  ſhoulder; but it is to watch ouer our owne hearts. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are to conſider how far forth we are to fight, euen to the death, not onely of ſinne, but euen to the death of the body too if neede bee, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Bee thou faithfull vnto the death, and I will giue thee the Crowne of life.</hi> And we muſt reſiſt euen vnto blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4. wee muſt fight till wee ſtand vp to the knees in blood, and not yeeld to ſinne; wee muſt fight till we ouercome; wee muſt not onely fight, but we muſt fight ſo long, ſo hard, ſo happily, that wee may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome. But how ſhall we ouercome if we fight till death, if we die in the fight? I anſwer; Wee may ouercome for all that: for that death is but to the outward man; It is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and inward man that ouercommeth, and therefore  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  though we be ſlaine, yet we ouercome, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.1. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee muſt conſider what helpes and forces wee haue on our ſides, ſurely more then are againſt vs; we haue ſuch an Army, that all the world cannot yeeld the like, wee haue

God and Chriſt, and the holy Spirit, and all the holy Angels to helpe vs; we haue the prayers and wel-wiſhings of all the faithfull in heauen and earth; we haue the Word, the Sacraments, the examples of Chriſt himſelfe, and all the faithfull to incourage vs. And who would not fight, hauing all theſe to fight for him and with him? And who would or can doubt of the victory, ſeeing we haue all the powers and forces of heauen and earth to aſſiſt vs, and to take part with vs? Onely the powers of hell are againſt vs, and how can they hurt vs? Fiftly, and laſtly, we are to conſider with  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  what minde wee are to come into the field, and to defend our ſelues, Not for faſhion, nor for company, nor to bee ſeene, nor to get profit: but we muſt come with this mind, to obay and to glorifie God, to maintaine his Lawes and kingdome, and to vphold that ſpirituall life, that God hath endued vs withall, and to deſtroy and keepe vnder the power of Satan, and the malignant Church; and not with any ſiniſter intention whatſoeuer. And thus if wee obſerue theſe Rules, they will be good meanes to fit vs to this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and to direct vs in it, as alſo to helpe vs to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N handling the diuiſion of the Church, which was the fourth generall Head, I ſhewed that it was partly of the name, partly of the thing it ſelfe. Of the name we ſpake fully. For the diuiſion of the thing it ſelfe I ſhewed you that it muſt not bee vnderſtood ſo, as if God had many kinds of Churches, for the Church is but one as I haue formerly prooued: But this diuiſion is a diſtinction, which puts a difference betwixt one and the ſame Church in one reſpect, and betwixt the ſame Church in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. We conſidered of it, as it was diſtinguiſhed in three reſpects. Firſt, in reſpect of the bounds and compaſſe of it: and ſo we ſhewed that there was a generall, and a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church. Of the generall we had before ſpoken; of the particular we were hereafter to ſpeake, when wee come to ſpeake of the viſible Church. Secondly, it was conſidered in reſpect of the ſeuerall portions and ſtates allotted to vs, and that was twofold; the firſt in this world, which is a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16091:66"/>
fight or warfare: the ſecond is in the world to come, which is a Crowne or Triumph. In the firſt reſpect the Church is called the Church Militant; In the ſecond, the Church Triumphant; of this we ſpake the laſt time.</p>
            <p>Now we are to ſpeake of the diuiſion of the Church in the third reſpect,<note place="margin">A third diuiſion of the Church into viſible and inuiſible.</note> And that is in reſpect of the outward ſtate of it in this world: and ſo it is viſible, and ſometime ſeene vnto the world; and inuiſible, ſometime not ſeene to the world. The Church of God doth ſometime attaine to ſuch a flouriſhing &amp; proſperous eſtate in this world, as that firſt her members are many in number; ſecondly, they haue an outward forme of ſetled Gouernment; thirdly, their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is countenanced, at leaſt not violently oppoſed by the State and Authority where they liue; Fourthly, they make open profeſſion of their faith and Religion; Fiftly, they haue publike and ſolemne Aſſemblies at ordinary and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable times, and in due and conuenient place, where the Miniſters teach the Word, and where the people heare the Word preached, and where the Sacraments are adminiſtred and Diſcipline executed, (at leaſt in ſome meaſure) and that without danger and without prohibition. I ſay, the Church doth oft-times attaine to this ſtate euen in this world, and then it is called viſible. On the other ſide, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is brought to ſuch a low and diſtreſſed eſtate, that ſcarce any of theſe are found there, but rather all quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Firſt, their number is ſmall; ſecondly, they haue no ſuch outward forme of gouernment ſetled amongſt them, at leaſt not ſo exerciſed, as that thereby the world ſhould take notice of them, that they are ſuch a holy Society; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they and their Religion is diſtaſted, diſgraced, derided, hated and perſecuted euen to the very death; Fourthly, their profeſſion is ſecret; Fiftly, their aſſemblies and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for Religious exerciſes are ſeldome or none at all, or at leaſt very priuate, at ſuch vncertaine times, and in ſuch priuy and cloſe places as they can light vpon, and that are beſt and fitteſt for their owne ſafety; Laſtly, they are depriued and debarred of the publike vſe of the miniſtry of the word, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16091:67"/>
of the Sacraments and diſcipline: And in this caſe it is called an Inuiſible Church. So you ſee in generall how the ſtate ſtands between the Church viſible and inuiſible; Now we are to ſpeake of them in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Of the Church inuiſible, and of the inuiſibilitie of it in fiue ſenſes.</note>Firſt, of the Church inuiſible. The Church of God is ſaid to be inuiſible in theſe fiue Senſes: Firſt, it is inuiſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſeene nor acknowledged by the men of the world, neither is it poſſibly to be diſcerned by the ſenſe of  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  the naturall man: but whoſoeuer ſees it, and knows it to be the Church of God, muſt haue a better light then that of  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  nature; Secondly, it is inuiſible in reſpect of the inward graces it is endued withall, as their Election, Faith, &amp;c. for theſe are not viſible at all; and ſo it is inuiſible, euen then  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  when it is moſt viſible. Thirdly, it is inuiſible in this ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the greateſt and chiefeſt part of it is in heauen, and ſo  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  not to be ſeene by mans eye. Fourthly, the Church is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in this reſpect, becauſe that Congregation that profeſſe themſelues to be the true Church of God, are indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times no better then the very Synagogue of Satan, ſuch as ouerthrow the foundation, and perſecute that which is the true Church of God indeede, and ſo vpon Tryall proues a falſe Church, and ſo makes the true Church inuiſible, not to bee ſeene of men; whiles the falſe Church intertaines mens eyes and thoughts doting vpon her, deluding them, and blearing and dazelling their ſight, they cannot, nor do not looke after any other; and ſo the right and true Church lies hidden from their ſight, euen as the painted Harlot carries away mens eyes from beholding the modeſt Spouſe. So while men dote vpon the painted ſhewes  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  of a falſe Church, they cannot behold the true. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Church is inuiſible in this ſenſe, becauſe, though there bee ſome true profeſſours, yet there is no publike profeſſion at all, or elſe it is very ſecret, ſo that there is no certaine outward Teſtimonies, whereby it may bee knowne to be the true Church. In theſe fiue reſpects the Church may bee ſaid to bee inuiſible. Marke this well, for herein ſtands the difference betwixt vs and the Papiſts. The
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16091:67"/>
Church ſay they, muſt be ſo notoriouſly viſible, that there muſt be a great number of them, and they muſt make open profeſſion of their Faith, and muſt carry themſelues ſo, as that euery man and woman may know that they are the Church, and that euery one may know which is the true Church whereunto hee is to ioyne himſelfe. Oppoſite to this we ſay, the Church is ſometimes inuiſible, in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects before ſet downe. So howſoeuer there may bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a Church, yet it cannot bee alwaies ſo notoriouſly knowne to all the world.</p>
            <p>Further we muſt conſider,<note place="margin">The Church ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall company of Gods choſen in heauen and earth, in this ſenſe it is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible actually and potentially.</note> that the Church doth ſomtime ſignifie the vniuerſall Company of Gods choſen in heauen and in earth; ſometime onely the Company of Beleeuers on earth. When it ſignifies the vniuerſall Company of Gods choſen in heauen and earth, in this ſenſe it is ſimply inuiſible and that both actually, that is, it is not ſeene, and alſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially, that is, it cannot be ſeene, as in the firſt, ſecond, and third ſenſes we haue ſhewed. For firſt, neither can the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man ſee them; nor ſecondly can their graces be ſeene; neither thirdly can the greateſt and chiefeſt part of them be ſeene being already in heauen. Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, the Church ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the company of beleeuers in earth is inuiſible ſimply, or after a ſort.</note> when the Church ſignifies the company of Beleeuers on earth, it is inuiſible, either ſimply, or after a ſort; ſimply, and ſo there is no Church on earth inuiſible, but in the firſt and ſecond ſenſes onely; or elſe after a ſort, that is, as oppoſed to famous viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, generally pretended by the Papiſts; namely, that there is a great multitude alwaies openly profeſſing the true Religion, and that in ſuch outward ſhew, ſtate and carriage, that it is, or may bee generally knowne to bee the true Church, and that any faithfull man may point with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſuch a Congregation, and ſay boldly, This is the true Church; and ſo may ſee and know which is that holy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety amongſt men, where he may ſafely, and where he muſt ioine himſelf for his ſaluation. And in this ſenſe, that is, as oppoſite to the Popiſh Church, the true Church is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (though not alwayes) inuiſible, which is partly in the Fourth and Fifth ſenſes aboue ſpecified. So that the Church
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16091:68"/>
euen then when it is after a ſort inuiſible, is alſo after a ſort viſible too; that is, it is inuiſible, becauſe it is not eaſie and plaine to be diſcerned; and viſible, becauſe it is diſcerned by ſome, though hardly: and ſo conſequently thoſe Papiſts that make the viſiblenes of the Church to be ſomtimes ſuch, that it can hardly be knowne, agree with vs in the thing direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though they differ in the phraſe and manner of Speech.</p>

vtterly rooting it out in ſome particular places, as we ſee in the Churches of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the ſecond and third Chapter of the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> They may preuaile againſt the viſible Church, to the horrible defiling and deſtroying of them: But ſo they cannot do againſt the inuiſible Church, for that is out of their Reach.</p>
            <p>The ſecond aduertiſement is this, That the inuiſible  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Church on earth is the whole Company of Gods choſen liuing in the world, whether profeſſing or not profeſſing the truth: whereof though ſome parts bee viſible, that is, ſuch as make open profeſſion, yet all cannot be ſeene; Or more particularly, it is a company of faithfull, or profeſſors (for this being partly viſible may haue Hipocrites in it, euen whole hundreds) that make profeſſion of ſauing faith, yet ſo ſecretly, either by reaſon of the fewneſſe of their number, or feare of perſecution, or the timorouſneſſe of their nature, that they can hardly be diſcerned to be ſuch. So that one and the ſame Church may be viſible and inuiſible at once; viſible, as making ſome profeſſion, that may be and is ſeene to ſome; and yet inuiſible too, as not making that open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that publike notice may be taken of it: yea, one and the ſame man may be a member of the Church viſible and of the Church inuiſible at once; of the viſible, as his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being partly ſeene; and of the inuiſible, that is, of the vniuerſall Church, as his Election, faith, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward graces are not ſeene.</p>
            <p>The third aduertiſment is, that thoſe that are of the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  Church both viſible and inuiſible, are therefore ſaued not ſo much becauſe they are of the viſible Church, (for then all of that Church ſhould be ſaued, which is not ſo (but becauſe they are of the inuiſible Church too (for there is none of that, that is, of the inuiſible vniuerſall Church, but are and ſhalbe ſaued) So likewiſe a man may bee no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber either of the viſible or inuiſible, and yet hee is not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe he is not of the viſible, but becauſe he is not of the inuiſible vniuerſall Church.</p>
            <p>The fourth Aduertiſement is this: How we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:16091:69"/>
ſome things that are affirmed of the Church in the Scripture; for it is ſpoken of in diuers ſenſes in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: as firſt, ſome things are affirmed of the viſible Church onely, which cannot be vnderſtood of the inuiſible; as that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.47, 48. where the Kingdome of heauen, that is, the viſible Church, is compared to a Net, which gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both good and bad fiſh; for the inuiſible vniuerſall Church, containing onely the Elect, hath no bad fiſhes in it. Againe, ſome things are affirmed of the inuiſible Church onely, which cannot be affirmed of the viſible Church, as that in <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Thou art all faire my Loue, and there is no ſpot in thee.</hi> No viſible Church but hath many ſpots; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is to be vnderſtood of the inuiſible onely. And ſo likewiſe that which I haue ſpoken of heretofore, that they are knowne onely to God and themſelues, is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the inuiſible Church onely. Againe, ſome things of both, and that in many reſpects: Firſt, ſome things which are principally ſpoken of the viſible Church, are abuſiuely applied to the inuiſible vniuerſall Church, the whole ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king denomination of the greater part, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. <hi>The children of the kingdome ſhall be caſt out.</hi> This is ſpoken principally of the viſible Church of the Iewes that ſhould be caſt off; and yet is applied abuſiuely to the inuiſible, to the children of the Kingdome, whereas none of them can be caſt off, but ſhall certainely bee ſaued. So <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.1, 4. in the firſt Verſe, the Lord ſaith to the Church of Sardy, <hi>Thou haſt a name that thou liueſt, but art dead.</hi> Here is a dead Church, yet in the fourth Verſe the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt a few names in Sardy which haue not defiled their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</hi> Here is a liuing Church, how is this to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood? This is ſpoken principally of the viſible Church, that it is a dead Church, but is abuſiuely applyed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible Church which was amongſt them, the whole taking denomination of the greater part. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. In the tenth Chapter and laſt verſe, Iſrael is ſaid to be a diſobedient and gainſaying people. In the eleuenth Chapter and firſt Verſe they are ſaid to bee
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16091:69"/>
Gods people, which is to be vnderſtood as the place before. Some things are principally affirm'd of the inuiſible Church, but analogically are applyed to the viſible Church, as the whole taking denomination from the better part. As for example, If I come into the Barne, and ſee a heape of Corne among the chaffe, I may ſay truly, It is a heape of Corne, though the moſt of it be chaffe, naming it from the better part. And in this ſenſe when the viſible Church receiueth her denomination from the better part, the Church may bee called the Body of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22, 23. compared with 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. Saints, holy, Catholike, the Pillar of Truth, &amp;c. theſe are principally affirmed of the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, but proportionally applyed to the Church viſible,<note place="margin">Vid.

               </label>  Theſe things premiſed,we come now to the Obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is this, That the true Church of God is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time brought into ſuch ſtraits, that the outward face of it doth either not appeare at all, or at leaſt it doth very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare to the ſight of the world. I ſay the outward face of it doth hardly appeare: for the inward graces of it are neuer ſeene, as faith and election; for the heart wherein theſe are cannot be diſcouered. As theſe are alwayes inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſo likewiſe the outward face of the Church is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time hidden. Againe I ſay, it is ſo but ſometime; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it is very plaine and apparant, and glorious in the eye of the world. We doe not here take vpon vs to prooue peremptorily, that there is a time when there ſhall bee no viſible and apparant Church in the World: the World is large, and many things are done in ſome places of the World, that we neither doe, nor can know; and therefore in regard of vs, we may ſay, there is no ſuch matter. For the Point muſt ſtand thus, That euen in thoſe places, and in ſuch times where the Church is moſt likely to be, as where the true Church hath lately been, and where it hath flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or where the beſt meanes are, the Word and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and the Miniſtry; or where they profeſſe to bee the true Church; yet euen then and there the true Church
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16091:70"/>
may lie hidden, and not bee outwardly diſcerned. And ſo conſequently if it may be in ſuch a ſtate, in ſuch places, and at ſuch times, much more is it ſo at other places and times, where there is no ſuch probabilitie of a Church. And this ſtrikes home at the Papiſts, that will haue the outward face of the true Church ſo notoriouſly apparant and viſible to the world. But as I haue ſhewed, in ſuch places, and at ſuch times where it hath been moſt like to haue been, euen then and there the true Church may be hidden, and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant to the World. This I will prooue in the caſe of the Church of Iſrael in <hi>Elias</hi> time, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.10. where the Prophet complaines of ſuch a ſcarcitie of the faithfull in his dayes, as that hee ſaith, <hi>be himſelfe was left alone.</hi> If there had been a Church any where in thoſe times, ſurely it ſhould haue been in Iſrael, where the beſt meanes were: but there was no outward appearance of a Church, and ſhall we thinke then it was any where elſe? So likewiſe in the 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.3. Iſrael had been for a long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a true God, without a Prieſt to teach, without Law; then they had no true viſible Church of God amongſt them. And if it were not to bee found in Iſrael, where ſhould it be found? The Papiſts will reply, in Iudah; if not with Iſrael; Iudah preuailed againſt Iſrael, becauſe they ſtayed vpon the Lord God of their Fathers, as wee may ſee in the 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.18. Well, yet they were bad enough too, as wee may ſee in the 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.3, 5. they had their ſtrange Gods, and their Images and high places, and Groues in all their Cities which <hi>Aſa</hi> tooke away. But yet if it were thus with Iſrael, that they had no outward face of a true Church, might it not be ſo with Iudah too, and ſo in other Churches: yea, we will proue that it was ſo with Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah afterward, as we may ſee in the 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.23, 24.25. where it is ſaid of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that he ſacrificed to the gods of Damaſcus, and to the gods of the King of Aram, hee brake the veſſels of the Houſe of God, ſhut vp the dores of the Houſe of the Lord, and made him Altars in euery corner of Ieruſalem, and in euery Citie of Iudah hee made high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16091:70"/>
to burne Incenſe to other Gods, &amp;c. So Iudah was worſe then Iſrael, nay, then the very Heathen that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as wee may ſee 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.9. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> made Iſrael to erre, and to doe worſe then the Heathen whom the Lord had caſt out before them. So you ſee here was no outward face of a Church, neither in Iudah, nor in Iſrael; if not in them, where could there bee any? Who could now point with his finger, and ſay, I know which is the true Church of God, whereunto I may, and muſt ioyne my ſelfe? If it were ſo with them that were the naturall branches, then there is no priuiledge for any other Church, but that it may be ſo with them too. But the Papiſts will obiect, that this was ſo vnder the Law one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it ſhall not bee ſo vnder the Goſpell; or if it bee ſo ſometimes, yet it ſhall not be ſo often to the end of the world. I ſay, I will proue that the ſtate of the Church was ſo alſo vnder the Goſpell, and ſhall bee ſo, not ſometimes onely, but often to the end of the world, that there ſhall be no outward face of a true Church, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.6, 14. the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is ſaid there to be fled into the wilderneſſe, which is meant of the Church, that at ſeuerall times to the worlds end ſhall bee driuen to liue in Deſert and forlorne places; how then ſhall men ſee it, and take notice of it, and ioyne with it, when it is in ſuch a ſecret place? So in the <hi>Reuel.</hi> 13.7, 8. <hi>The Beaſt made warre with the Saints and ouercame them, and power was giuen vnto him ouer euery Kindred and Nation, and Tongue.</hi> Therefore all that dwell vpon the earth worſhip him, whoſe names are not written in the booke of life of the Lambe: Where was the outward face of a Church in theſe times? And in the 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5. the Apoſtle ſheweth, that Antichriſt ſhall come, and ſit in Gods Temple, as God, &amp;c. The Diuell ſhall bee ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that he ſhall ſet vp Antichriſt in Gods Temple, that is, in Gods Church, where there hath been an outward face of a Church continued for many yeeres, and yet hee ſhall not be knowne but to be God, but onely to thoſe that are ſpiritually-minded; for he ſhall ſit as God, ſo that then there
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16091:71"/>
ſhall be no outward face of a true Church there. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that in <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8. proues this Point, where our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith, <hi>When the Sonne of man commeth, ſhall he find faith on the Earth?</hi> If faith be ſo ſcarce to be found, which is the life of the Church, where then ſhall the Church be found? But where ſhall hee not find faith? In India, or in Rome onely? No not onely in one or two places, but not in the earth. And who ſhall not find it? The Sonne of Man. When the Sonne of Man commeth, ſhall hee find faith on the earth? Then the Church is not ſo palpable, as that it may be outwardly diſcerned to the worlds end. And this is it that <hi>Auſten</hi> and the Fathers meane,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſ. <hi>10</hi> Hierom. cont. Lucif.</note> when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Church to the Moone, that is ſometimes in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe ſo darkened that it cannot be ſeene. So we ſee we haue the conſent of the Fathers too againſt the Papiſts. And ſo much for the proofe of the Point.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons are many, and they all ſtrengthen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially the firſt three muſt be laid together, elſe they are not ſufficient apart to proue the Point.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label>  The firſt Reaſon is this. The members of the Church are ſometimes very few; they are alwayes few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to the wicked, but ſometimes they are few ſimply in reſpect of themſelues, as in the old World, when the Church was in <hi>Noahs</hi> Family.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label>  Secondly, as they are few, ſo withall for the moſt part they are but meane perſons; <hi>the poore receiue the Goſpell.</hi> Now that which poore and meane Ones doe, is generally neglected, not taken notice of, except it be ſome notorious exploit, and therefore,</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label>  Thirdly, that which they doe, the profeſſion of Chriſt is no ſuch notorious thing that the World regards it, or takes notice of it; and therefore it is not ſought after, except it be either by the true members that ſeeke to ioyne with it, and they are but very few; or elſe by perſecutors, and ſuch ſeeke after it onely to deſtroy it, as <hi>Herod</hi> did after Chriſt,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16091:71"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.13. not to bee members of it. And hence it is, that they are ſo hardly diſcerned.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, their Perſecutors many times bring them to  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label>  this low ſcantling, and ſo it was in the dayes of <hi>Eliah</hi> the Prophet, the Prophets were ſlaine with the ſword, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.10. and that was the reaſon of the ſcarcity of the faithfull in thoſe times. And ſo it was in <hi>Diocleſians</hi> time, all the Chriſtians that were found were put to death, their bodies were burnt, and their Temples were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne; where was the face of the Church at this time? Perſecution had brought it to this low ſcantling, that it was not to be diſcerned. And this is ſhadowed to vs in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.24. by the ſhip that our Sauiour and his Diſciples were in, that was couered with waues, ſo that it was hardly to be diſcerned, yet it ſanke not: ſo is the ſtate of the Church of God in this world, that ſometimes it is couered with the waues and rage of perſecutors, like to be ſwallowed vp, hardly to be diſcerned, but yet it liues.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, ſometimes Hereſies and Schiſmes ariſe in the  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>5</label>  Church, and they ſway the world after them, ouercomming the true doctrine, and the communion of the Church; as it was in the time when <hi>Arius</hi> with his Hereſie ouer-ſpread the whole world; in ſo much that the World did wonder at it ſelfe to ſee it ſelfe become an Arian, as the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hiſtory ſets it downe. Where could a man ſay now, This is the true Church, whereunto I muſt ioyne?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, thoſe that make profeſsion to be, and indeed  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>6</label>  are of the Church, are but men, and therefore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fearefull, and will not ſtand to their profeſſion, but flie away as the Diſciples of our Sauiour did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.56. they all forſooke him, and fled like fearefull men: where was the face of the Church then?</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, Counterfeits and Deceiuers are very cunning, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>7</label>  and will ſet as good a face on idolatry and ſuperſtition, on hypocriſie, and on the Synagogue of Satan, as the Church of God can doe on the ſauing faith and Religion; the falſe Apoſtles can transforme themſelues into the Apoſtles of

Chriſt, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. our Sauiour ſaith, that falſe Chriſts and falſe Apoſtles ſhall ariſe, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders, ſo that if it were poſſible, they ſhall deceiue the very elect.

As alſo thereby hee tries the faithfull whether they will walke by faith, as well as by appearance; for whilſt there is an outward face of a true Church, many wil make an outward ſhew of the profeſſion of faith and religion: But when there is none, then here is the triall, whether men will walke faithfully or no. Likewiſe God doth it for the iuſt condemnation of the reprobate; he leaues them iuſtly without any apparant teaching or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of better Religion, to periſh in their owne ſinnes and ignorance, flattering himſelfe that he is in the right, becauſe he can ſee no better any where elſe; for when they heare of no better religion then their owne, they harden themſelues in it, and ſo iuſtly periſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:16091:72"/>Laſtly, God hath paſſed his promiſe onely for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity  <label type="milestone">

The Moone is a Light, and yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes viſible; for ſometimes it is eclipſt, and yet then it is as good a Light as when it is in her full brightneſſe; and therefore if this were to be vnderſtood of the Church, it doth not proue that it is alwaies viſible becauſe it is a Light. Further I ſay, that by that reaſon their life (for that is as well if not chiefely vnderſtood by the Light, as verſ. 16.) is alſo without error too, as well as their Doctrine; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, which is not ſo. Laſtly, if it doe giue Light alwayes, yet it is but to thoſe that are in the houſe, verſe 15. that is, to thoſe that are members of the Church, and that wee eaſily grant: but what is this to proue the notorious viſibleneſſe of the Church to the world?</p>

I anſwer: It is true; they muſt profeſſe alwaies, and ſo they doe, except it bee in time of their infirmity, But muſt they do it to all the world?
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16091:73"/>
No, they may doe it among themſelues alwayes, though there bee but two or three of them; yea, and when they are many, they may doe it to the eye of the World too, if there bee no certaine danger in it; yea, though there be certaine danger in it, yet if they haue a calling to it, they are reſolute euen to die for the profeſſion of it, and that is as much profeſſion as is required. And yet becauſe their number is but few, and that they liue in certaine places, and are in this caſe for the moſt part obſcure and ſimple men, therefore it is not poſſible that any ſuch generall notice ſhould bee taken of them; and thoſe that doe heare of them, or ſee them, are vſually little mooued by their example, at leaſt they are ſeldome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they are the true Church, and ſo ioyne with them. Therefore there is no ſuch perpetuall notorious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſſe of the Church, as they would haue. We will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vpon them with theſe two Points, and choke them with theſe two bones.. Firſt, wee aske them where the Church ſhall be when Antichriſt comes? for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues confeſſe, that in Antichriſts time there ſhall bee a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of the Church; therefore by their owne confeſſion it may, and ſhall be ſometimes inuiſible. Yea, but ſay they, ours is the true Church ſtill, though it be then obſcured: and we ſay then that Antichriſt is come, and our Church obſcured, therefore by their owne reaſon, our Church is the true Church. The ſecond is from their Church which they haue here among vs; they haue a Church here among vs, here be Papiſts, and Maſſes, Arch-prieſts and Prieſts, this themſelues will not deny, nay, they boaſt of it ſometimes; yet is their Church viſible among vs? They will not affirme it, at leaſt they will not ſay it is viſible in their ſenſe, that is, that the world may take notice of it, neither was it euer countenanced nor tolerated in our State, ſo that in our ſenſe and to vs it is inuiſible, and ſo may our Church bee to them.</p>

Nay, euen in the generall Apoſtaſie and reuolt from all Grace and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when there ſhall bee no honeſty nor conſcience found amongſt men, yet be not diſmayed, but reſt thy ſelfe fully contented and ſatisfied with this truth, that ſurely ſtill God hath his Church in the World, though there bee no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward face nor appearance of it to men. It is true, that it is for our ſinnes that the Church is ſo diſtreſſed, and Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo hidden, and true Religion ſo decayed, and therefore we are to grieue for our ſinnes: but yet this is our comfort, that it is not ſo bad as it ſeemes to bee; for the Church of God and his Religion haue then as true a being as euer they had, though not in that euidence and approbation before the World; and therefore though thou ſeeſt it not, yet God ſees it. <hi>Elias,</hi> poore, man ſaw none left with whom he might ioyne, but God ſaw many thouſands. What if all be ſo deſolate (as it was in his time) that thou canſt ſee none of

Gods Church but thy ſelfe, that thou canſt ſee no viſible ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men in the world that thou canſt ſafely ioyne withall? yet know God hath his Church, happily many thouſands, though they make little profeſſion for the time, that neuer bowed their knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> Therefore let vs not iudge by ſight, but by faith, and let this comfort and ſatisfie vs in the moſt deſperate times that are.</p>
            <p>The laſt Vſe is for ſatisfaction to the Papiſts demands, <label type="milestone">

For anſwer to the firſt, wee aske them, Where ſhall the Church be in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts time; that is when they thinke Antichriſt ſhall bee? They anſwer, it ſhall bee much obſcured then. But ſhall there bee a Church then or not? Yes, no doubt but there ſhal: elſe their own Pillar of the Churches perpetuitie falles to the ground. Why then might not our Church be a true Church in the daies of Popery (whom we call Antichriſt) though it were much obſcured? We had a Church amongſt them that did profeſſe our Religion (though much obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them) euen before <hi>Luthers</hi> time. To the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning our Fathers that liued in their Church, what is become of them (ſay the Papiſts) are they damned? Wee anſwer, many of them, though they liued amongſt them, were of the inuiſible Church; for the reſt wee leaue them to ſtand or fall to their owne Maſter; yet wee haue great hope of many that were members of their Church, that liued before the Councell of Trent, and before the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the poyſoning Ieſuites came vp.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He laſt generall Point we ſpake of, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the diuiſion of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhewed, that the Church was diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in it ſelfe in many reſpects, the laſt whereof was this, in regard of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate of it in the eye and appearance to the World. In this ſtate we ſhewed that it was ſometime viſible, to bee ſeene by the eye of man; and ſometime inuiſible, not to be ſeene at all, or at leaſt very hardly to be ſeene. Of the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſtate of the Church wee haue ſpoken already in the laſt Lecture. Now it remaines that by Gods aſſiſtance we ſpeake of the viſible Church, for that is the Point chiefely in queſtion. Therefore leauing the inuiſible Church to God, he onely knowing who are his, wee in the meane while beleeuing it, and eſteeming reuerently thereof, wee proceed now to ſpeake of the viſible Church, which may and is knowne not to God onely, but alſo to the eye of the world. That which hath been already ſpoken of the Church in generall, and eſpecially of the inuiſible, makes the way plaine before vs for the vnderſtanding of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; ſo that now wee may find out the viſible Church without any difficulty at all.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Nine things conſiderable in a viſible Church.</note>In ſpeaking of the viſible Church, we muſt handle theſe Points, firſt, the definition of it; ſecondly, the cauſes of it; thirdly, the members of it; fourthly, the markes and notes of it; fifthly, the gouernment of it; ſixthly, the priuiledges of it; ſeuenthly, the aduerſaries of it; eighthly, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of it; and laſtly, the application of it to all Churches in the world ſo farre as they are knowne to vs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the definition of it, it is this; Namely, A true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16091:75"/>
Church is a Company of people called,<note place="margin">Firſt, the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</note> and ioyning together in the publike profeſſion of the true Religion. Marke the parts of this Definition: firſt, that they may be a Church, they muſt be a <hi>Company of people called;</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they may be a viſible Church, they muſt <hi>ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in publike profeſſion;</hi> And thirdly, that they may bee a true Church, they muſt profeſſe the true Religion. For the firſt, they muſt be a <hi>Company;</hi> for one man cannot make a Church, a Church being as much to ſay, as a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and a Congregation conſiſts of diuers perſons: one man cannot make a Congregation, and therefore one man cannot make a Church. Now whether this Company bee great or ſmall, three thouſand, or but three, it is not much materiall, ſo long as they be a Company, more or fewer; if they be ſo qualified as the reſt of the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires, they are a Church. Secondly, it is a <hi>Company called:</hi> for ſo you may remember that I ſhewed you before, that Church hath her name in the Greeke from calling. Now whereas there is a double calling, one outward, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the inward, thoſe that haue onely an outward calling are viſible members; if they obay the outward calling, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make them to bee reputed in the Church: But if they be true and ſauing-members of the Church, ordinarily they muſt be called, not outwardly only, but inwardly too, and muſt yeeld obedience vnto both. Thirdly, a Company of people; which is not ſpoken definitiuely, as diſcouering what company, that is, a Company of men and women, for that is vniuerſally vnderſtood; but indefinitely, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Capacity and boundes of the Church to all people and Nations in the world: For ſo it was in part euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former Teſtament; ſtrangers ioyning with the Iewes were reputed of that Church, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. much more is it ſo now vnder the Goſpell, the partition wall being beaten downe, Iew or Gentile, or any people vnder the Sunne, if they be rightly qualified as in the definition, may make a true viſible Church. So much for the firſt part of the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, that they muſt be a <hi>Company,</hi> and a Company <hi>called,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:16091:76"/>
and a Company of <hi>people</hi> called.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they may bee a viſible Church, as they muſt be a Company called to the profeſſion of Religion, ſo they muſt ioyne together in the publike profeſſion of it; wherein there are three things: firſt, that they <hi>muſt make profeſſion:</hi> ſecondly, that their profeſſion <hi>muſt be publike:</hi> thirdly, that they muſt <hi>ioyne together in this publike profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Firſt, there muſt be a profeſſion; for a Church is viſible onely ſo farre forth as their faith and Religion is viſible: but this is not to be diſcerned but by their profeſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church is not viſible but onely by profeſſion; ſo then there muſt be a profeſſion. Secondly their profeſſion muſt be publike or open, that is, it muſt be ſo publike and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that there may be notice taken, that ſuch and ſuch men are of ſuch a ſociety and Religion; elſe they are rather of the inuiſible Church, ſpoken of before: And looke as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is more or leſſe publike, ſo the Church is to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more or leſſe viſible. Thirdly, as they muſt publikely profeſſe, ſo they muſt ioyne together in this profeſſion; and that intends, firſt, their ſeparation from all others, whether they be of none, or of a contrary and diuers Religion; and ſecondly, it intends their aſſociating, or ſorting of themſelues together with profeſſors of the ſame Religion, growing into and liuing in a louing Communion and fellowſhip with them. Thirdly, it intendes that they muſt doe it voluntarily, and of their owne accord; ſome ioyne for faſhion, ſome for feare, ſome for hope of gaine, and ſome others for the ſauing of their goods, and the like; yet all theſe doe it voluntarily, for the will cannot be forced; yea if they doe it againſt their will it is a ſinne to them, though they ioyne to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Churches in the world. And ſo much for the ſecond part of the definition; that they muſt ioyne together in a publike profeſſion of Religion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that there may be a true viſible Church, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which this Company make profeſſion of muſt be the true Religion: for as without the Church there is no ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo without the true Religion there is no true Church:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16091:76"/>
there are diuers Religions in the world, and accordingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Churches; yet there is but one onely true Religion, which is that which is contained in the Scripture, the Word of Truth; and ſo there is but one only true Church, that is, that which embraceth that true Religion.<note place="margin">Vera eccleſia eſt quae profitetur Chriſti fidem.

               </note> So that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer Congregation vnder the Sunne doth not profeſſe that one true Religion, let them profeſſe whatſoeuer Religion they will beſides, they cannot iuſtly bee reputed true viſible Churches.</p>
            <p>For the better vnderſtanding of this Point, I will draw it into an Obſeruation, and ſo diſcourſe of it at large; and the Obſeruation is this:  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
               </label>  Whatſoeuer Company or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of men doe openly profeſſe the ſauing Truth of God, the ſame Congregation and Company is to bee held and reputed a true viſible Church. The truth of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine holds generally in all Congregations whatſoeuer of that quality from the greateſt to the leaſt, and from the beſt to the worſt: for firſt, whereas all and euery Profeſſor of Gods Religion through the world doe concurre and ioyne together in the acknowledgment of the common ſauing faith,<note place="margin">Firſt, ſome Churches are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vniuerſall viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> though not in the outward Communion of the ſame Eccleſiaſticall Aſſembly, and therefore all theſe may bee termed a true vniuerſall viſible Church: ſo alſo euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Eccleſiaſticall Aſſembly, profeſſing the ſame ſauing Truth, and ioyning together in the outward Communion of one ſetled Congregation, and obſeruing the ſame lawes and Orders at the ſame time and place, may be called a true particular viſible Church; and that whether it be in the ſame Countrey and Prouince, or in a Pariſh, or in a priuate houſe: and accordingly they are called a Prouinciall, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall, or a domeſticall Church; and each of theſe is a true viſible Church,<note place="margin">Firſt, Particular viſible Churches are, firſt, Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, Parochiall, or domeſticall. Jnſtances, firſt, of a Prouinciall Church</note> though one be vniuerſall and the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. For Inſtances of all theſe in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for a Prouinciall or Nationall Church, which is a Company of people profeſſing the ſame Truth in the whole Land or Nation; you may ſee an inſtance. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. <hi>Then had the Churches Reſt in Iudea, and Samaria, and Galile,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:16091:77"/>
&amp;c.</hi> There were Prouinciall Churches, named by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey they were in, as Iudea, Samaria, &amp;c. And in the <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> the ſecond and third Chapters, the ſeuen Churches there mentioned were Nationall Churches, as Epheſus, &amp;c. And 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>vnto the Church of God which is at Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, &amp;c.</hi> there was a nationall Church.</p>

               <note place="margin">Secondly, of a Parochiall Church.</note>Secondly, for a Parochiall or Pariſh Church, which is a Company of people profeſſing the ſame faith in a Towne or in a Pariſh, we ſhal reade of them in <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. Where it is ſaid, that the Apoſtles ordained them Elders in euery Towne.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Thirdly, of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall Church.</note>Thirdly, for a domeſticall Church, which is a Company profeſſing the ſame faith in a priuat houſe, as we may reade in the <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. and in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.19. of <hi>Aquila and Priſcilla with the Church in their Houſe.</hi> And <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4.15. We reade of a Church that was in the Houſe of <hi>Nimphas,</hi> though theſe are rather to bee reputed inuiſible Churches, except they may be ſo openly taken notice of, and ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly knowne, as the Church that was in <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila's</hi> houſe; then they may be called Domeſticall viſible Churches. So much for the firſt diuiſion, that ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are either vniuerſall viſible Churches, or particular Churches; and that either in a whole Land, or in a Towne, or in a priuat Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Secondly, they are either more or leſſe viſible.</note>Secondly, whereas ſome Churches are more notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, ſome leſſe; yet both are true viſible Churches, though one be more viſible, and the other leſſe viſible. In the time of the Apoſtles it was ſo: the Church of Rome was notoriouſly knowne; for their faith was knowne through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8. <hi>and their obedience was come abroad amongſt all, Rom.</hi> 16.19. ſo that this Church was more viſible. Other Churches were leſſe knowne, as the Church at Cenchrea &amp; Creet, which are only named in the Scripture, and no Epiſtle written to them. Now becauſe they are onely mentioned, therfore they were leſſe knowne, and ſo leſſe viſible, &amp; yet true Churches as wel as the other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas ſome Churches profeſſe the ſauing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16091:77"/>
faith more purely and ſincerely, others more corruptly;<note place="margin">Thirdly, either more or leſſe pure.</note> yet each of theſe is a true viſible Church, though the one bee more pure, (not more true) the other leſſe. Inſtances of theſe we haue in the ſecond and third Chapters of the <hi>Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> ſome Churches there were more pure, ſome more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, yet all true Churches. Churches more pure were Smyrna and Philadelphia, all commended in them, nothing diſprayſed. Churches leſſe pure were Epheſus, Pergamus, and Thiatira, in which Churches ſome things are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſome things diſcommended. Churches yet leſſe pure were, Sardis and Laodicea, where there is nothing commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but all things diſprayſed. So we ſee that ſome of theſe profeſt the true ſauing faith more purely, ſome leſſe purely, and ſome more corruptly, yet euery one of them was a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, they are more or leſſe perfect.</note> whereas ſome Churches are growne to ſome Ripeneſſe and perfection, and to ſome ſetled forme of Gouernment; others are in their infancy, and haue not ſuch a forme eſtabliſhed for Gouernment; yet each of theſe is a true viſible Church, though the one be more, the other leſſe perfect. Inſtances of theſe we haue in Scripture; Firſt, for them that were more perfect, as at Hieruſalem, where <hi>Iames</hi> was Biſhop, there the Church was growne to ſome perfection; there the Apoſtles met and had a Conſultation together, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2. &amp; there was a ſetled forme of Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſo the Church of Philippi, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. was alſo grown to ſome perfection and ſetled forme of Gouernment, they had their Biſhops and Deacons: So likewiſe the Church of Epheſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. they had their Elders and Ouerſeers. Secondly ſome are leſſe perfect, as the Church in Creta, which had ſome things that were vnperfect, and therefore <hi>Titus</hi> was left there to redreſſe things amiſſe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. And ſo the Churches of the Gentiles were not growne to that perfection, and therefore the Apoſtles would lay no heauy burthen on them, but that which they ſhould be well able to beare, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.19. yet theſe were true Churches. So that though ſome viſible Churches be vniuerſall, ſome
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16091:78"/>
particular; ſome more notoriouſly knowne, ſome leſſe knowne; ſome more pure, ſome more corrupt; and ſome growne to ſome perfection and ripeneſſe, ſome in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy leſſe perfect; yet all theſe are true viſible Churches, ſo long as they profeſſe the true ſauing faith. This may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the illuſtration of the Note.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the proofes of the point, and firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law there was a ſet place choſen, where the Lord would put his Name; that is, where Religion ſhould bee profeſt, and he dwels there; that is, as a Father, or as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the family begetting children, and ruling and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that family by his Word. Now what is this vnder the Goſpell, but this, that where Gods ſauing truth is profeſt, there God himſelfe is preſent, as in his true viſible Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> What is a Church? but a company of people ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the Name of Ieſus Chriſt. And what is it to bee gathered together in his Name? but ioyntly to profeſſe his ſauing Truth. And what are they in the midſt of whom he is, but his Church? For ſo in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.1. hee is ſaid to walke in the midſt of the ſeuen golden Candleſticks. And what are the ſeuen golden Candleſticks, but the ſeuen viſible Churches? <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.20. and this is not tied to any one place more then other, but <hi>whereſoeuer,</hi> ſaith our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>two or three are gathered, &amp;c.</hi> be it among the Iewes, or among the Gentiles, be it generally in the World, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in a Pariſh or Houſe, whereſoeuer it is, ſaith our Sauiour, I am in the midſt of them: neither doth hee ſay, that of neceſſity there muſt be any great multitude of them, if but two or three are gathered together in his Name, he is in the midſt of them. So <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 47. there was a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, there was a company of people that receiued the Word, that is, that heard it, and obeyed it; and they were baptized, that is, they did not onely embrace, but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly profeſſe the ſauing Truth, and ſo they were added to the Church, that is, they were of the viſible Church. Doe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16091:78"/>
but conſider how the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. deſcribes the Church of Corinth, <hi>to them that are ſanctified in Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> that is, to thoſe that haue true ſauing Faith in Chriſt that ſanctifies them; <hi>Saints by Calling,</hi> that is, ſuch as make profeſſion at the leaſt to be ſo; <hi>with all that call on the Name of the Lord Ieſus in euery place;</hi> which phraſe, <hi>calling on the Name of the Lord,</hi> generally in Scripture ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the profeſſion of Gods Religion; ſo that thoſe that thus profeſſe the true Religion are true viſible Churches. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.20. the Churches there are ſaid to be golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtickes. Now what is the vſe of a Candleſticke, but to hold forth the light to be ſeene of men? and this not onely experience teacheth, but Chriſt himſelfe teacheth it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Neither doe men light a Candle and put it vnder a Buſhell, but on a Candleſticke, and it giueth light to all that are in the houſe.</hi> And what is the true viſible Church? but a company that hold forth the light of the ſauing Truth to bee ſeene by the World. And thoſe inſtances alleaged of thoſe Churches that are ſome more viſible, ſome leſſe; ſome more pure ſome more corrupt; ſome more perfect, ſome more imperfect; yet all of them true Churches; prooues the whole ſubſtance of the Obſeruation cleerely and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And ſo much for the proofes.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of the point are theſe. Firſt, the ſauing  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label>  truth or faith it ſelfe is the life of the Church; therefore they that profeſſe it, and thereby make it publikely knowne to the World, that the ſame is the ſauing truth, and that embrace it, they are a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, where there is ſuch a company profeſſing Gods  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label>  truth, there they haue the promiſe of Chriſts preſence in a ſpeciall manner, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. but Chriſt is preſent no where in ſuch a ſpeciall manner, but in his Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a company are a true Church. Againe, they haue alſo the promiſe of life and ſaluation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. but none are ſaued but thoſe that are of the Church; therefore they are a true Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the true Church is built on the Prophets and  <label type="milestone">

Apoſtles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. that is, on that ſauing faith which they taught and wrote: therefore they that profeſſe this faith muſt needs be a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  Fourthly, there Chriſt is honoured and obeyed publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as their Head, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22. therefore they that profeſſe to be ſuch are his viſible Body.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  Fifthly, there amongſt ſuch a company are the ordinarie meanes of ſaluation, which are no where elſe to bee found but in the viſible Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  Sixthly, there his voyce is openly heard, and in ſome meaſure obeyed; therefore they are his ſheepe, and that is his fold, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.27.</p>

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>  Eighthly, the true viſible Church is diſtinguiſhed from all other ſocieties whatſoeuer by this profeſſion of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith; for other companies of men either profeſſe no Religion at all, or not the true Religion; therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer company doth profeſſe the true ſauing faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that is a true viſible Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>  Laſtly, the particular profeſſion of the ſauing faith makes a particular man a true member of the true viſible Church, as we may ſee in the example of the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37, 38. he beleeued the ſauing faith of Chriſt, and was baptized, and ſo made open profeſſion of it, and ſo became a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the true viſible Church. If this profeſſion in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar make a particular man a true member of the viſible Church; much more in generall doth it make a company of men profeſſing the ſame faith to bee a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>  The Vſes of the point are many. The firſt is matter of reproofe againſt the Papiſts, who lay this as a generall ground, that the onely way whereby we are to find out the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16091:79"/>
true Religion, is by the true viſible Church (which may be true in ſome ſenſe, but not in this.) And their reach herein is to make all the Chriſtian World to ſuſpend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vpon their Church, as that being alwayes viſible, and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that Religion, and none but that which their Church doth teach. For ſay they, there is no way to find out the true Religion, but by the true viſible Church: but ours is the true viſible Church; therefore if euer you will find out the true Religion, you muſt find it out by our Church. It is not to be denied, but that a true viſible Church is a good meanes to find out the true Religion, being aſſiſted with the continuall preſence of Gods Spirit, and being furniſhed with the Word and Sacraments, and gifts for that purpoſe: but whereas they ſay, it is the onely way, it is not true; for the Scripture hath another way, and a better, <hi>Ioh</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>for they teſtifie of mee.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if this be the onely way to find out the true Religion by the Church, then a man muſt firſt be well aſſured which is the true Church, before hee can ſafely relie vpon her iudgement for the truth of Religion; ſo that whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his care was to find out the true Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſolues to ſearch it out from the true Church; now his firſt and greateſt care is to find out which is the true Church: for other companies that are not, may and doe bragge oft-times, that they are the true Church, when there is no ſuch matter; what are wee to doe in this caſe? This Doctrine tells vs directly what is to be done; where is it that the ſauing truth is profeſſed? There and no where elſe is a true viſible Church; ſo that whereas they ſay, the Church is the onely way for the finding out of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is plaine (as we haue ſhewed) that the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on profeſſed is the onely way, or at leaſt the chiefe way to find out a true viſible Church. The caſe is this: we ſay, the true Religion ſhewes forth the true Church; the Papiſts ſay the contrary, that the true Church ſhewes forth the true Religion. And this that they ſay is true in ſome ſenſe, but that which we ſay is true in a better ſenſe: for the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16091:80"/>
ſhewes the true Church, as the cauſe ſhewes the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; but the Church ſhewes the true Religion, as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ſhew the cauſe. As for example, the Sunne-ſhine is the cauſe of the day, and the day proues that the Sunne ſhines. Now one man may reaſon thus from the cauſe to the effect, and ſay; The Sunne ſhines, therefore it is day: another from the effect to the cauſe; It is day, therefore the Sunne ſhines; and both ſay true: but the firſt is the more forcible kind of reaſoning, when we reaſon from the cauſe to the effects. So when I reaſon thus; Here is the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, therefore the true Church: here I reaſon from the cauſe to the effects; and this is a more forcible and better reaſon, then to ſay, Here is the true Church, therefore here is the true Religion, which is but to reaſon from the effect to the cauſe. This wee ſhall find to be true in the Scripture phraſe, where the Church is compared to a Candleſticke; now what ſerues that for, but onely to hold out the light? then the ſauing truth is the Light or Candle: now the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticke is not ſeene at all without the Light of the Candle in the dark night, though it were of gold: ſo in the darknes of this World, the Church which is the Candleſticke, if it hold not forth the ſauing truth, which is the Light or Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, it cannot be ſeene it ſelfe. So that it is the truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that makes a true Church, and the profeſsion of this truth makes it viſible: then the Church is not the only way to find out the true Religion, nor yet the beſt way; but the beſt and ſafeſt way to find out the true viſible Church, is to find it out by the true Religion which they profeſſe. And ſo much for the reproofe of the Papiſts.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>  The ſecond Vſe is for triall. Is it ſo that euery Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation openly profeſsing the ſauing truth of God, is a true viſible Church; then here is the ſtraiteſt and preciſeſt Rule, to meaſure the being of a true viſible Church by; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition containing all true viſible Churches and no more. Therefore look whereſoeuer the true ſauing faith is profeſt, there is a true viſible Church; And looke where there is a true viſible Church, there true ſauing faith is profeſt; for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16091:80"/>
theſe hold in reciprocall termes; ſo that whether wee would proue any aſſembly to bee a true viſible Church, or reproue and conuince any for a falſe, we muſt lay it to this Rule; ſo whether they profeſſe the ſauing truth of Chriſt, or not, and accordingly eſteeme and iudge of them to bee true or falſe Churches. Here certaine exceptions may bee made to this Doctrine. The firſt exception is this: What,<note place="margin">

Thirdly, that it bee not  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  onely outwardly profeſt, but inwardly imbraced too, at leaſt by ſome of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exception</hi> 2.</note> The ſecond exception is this: But what ſay you if they profeſſe it with their lips, and deny it in their liues and practiſe; is ſuch a Church, a true viſible Church? I anſwer,  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Exception</hi> 3.</note> The third exception; But what ſay you of ſuch a Church, which though they profeſſe the whole ſauing faith; yet they doe in certaine ſome croſſe opinions, which ouerthrow it?  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label>   I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee muſt conſider what manner of opinions theſe be which that Church holdes; Firſt, whether they be ſuch as ouerthrow the foundation; ſecondly, whether they bee publikely profeſt as the Doctrine of that Church; thirdly,

whether they bee perſiſted in after they haue been admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht by neighbour Churches? Then they are no longer to be taken notice of as true viſible Churches. But on the other ſide, if they be matters of ſmaller moment, that doe not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow the foundation, then the hay and ſtubble ſhall burne, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12, 15. but yet they ſhall remaine ſtill a true Church. Secondly, if they bee greater matters, errors that doe ouerthrow the foundation, yet if they be not publikely profeſt as the Doctrine of that Church; yea, though they be publikely profeſt, yet if vpon admonition of other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches they doe recant and reforme their Errors, then they are ſtil to be accounted true viſible Churches, and it is a ſinne for any to forſake them, being in them; yea, it is a ſinne not to ioyne as a member to them, liuing in them, <hi>Deu.</hi> 12.5. at leaſt we are to ioyne with them in conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label>  The third Vſe is this. Euery man that hath any Touch of Conſcience, or any grace in him, is deſirous to be a member of the true viſible Church; for that is a good pledge and witneſſe to their ſoules, that they are members of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Here then thou mayſt learne to know whether thou art a member or no; and ſo likewiſe how to become a member. Firſt, therefore labour to finde out, to know, vnderſtand, and beleeue the ſauing Truth of God; and for this end we muſt heare the Word preached, and conferre of it, and ioyne with the godly, and frequent publike Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Aſſemblies; and alſo we muſt pray to God for his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he would be pleaſed to acquaint thee with his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Truth, and to open thine eyes, that thou mayſt ſee the right way, and that he would alſo leade thee therein. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, thou muſt labour as thou knoweſt it, ſo likewiſe to profeſſe it, and make open ſhew of it to the world, be not aſhamed of it, it is a Royall Calling; if we bee aſhamed of it, Chriſt will be aſhamed of vs before his Father, and before
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16091:81"/>
his Angls in heauen: and as we muſt not be aſhamed of it, ſo we muſt not be afraid to profeſſe it; it is not a matter of ſhame or feare to be of Gods Church, but a matter of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and comfort; therefore bee not afraid of reproch, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, temptation, all outward miſery which wee are ſure to endure, if wee bee knowne to profeſſe the ſauing Truth of Chriſt. Chriſt Ieſus did boldly oppoſe himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the high Prieſt, and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the Iewes, the Scribes and Phariſies, and the Souldiers; yea, he oppoſed himſelfe to Death it ſelfe, and to all the powers of darkneſſe, and to the terrors of God himſelfe for thee; and wilt thou bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to oppoſe thy ſelfe to ſome few outward dangers for him? Nay, it is for our ſelues in the end, for wee ſhall haue the glory of it: yet bee wiſe, and doe not raſhly thruſt thy ſelfe into any danger; but if thou haue iuſt occaſion, and a Calling from God, ſhunne it not for feare of men: Let not thy falſe heart betray the truth of Chriſt his cauſe, but rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon Gods power, promiſe and protection, ſtand to it reſolutely and with a good Chriſtian courage, and ſay, I am a Profeſſor of Chriſt crucified, and ſo I will continew by his Aſſiſtance euen vnto the very death, though I be crucified euen as he was. Thirdly, we muſt ſee that our profeſſion be not in hipocriſie: for this is the Canker-worme that eates out Religion in the hearts of many profeſſors; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore profeſſe the Truth ſincerely and in ſingleneſſe of heart, as in the ſight of God, who ſeeth and ſearcheth the Reynes; doe it as the onely cauſe whereby we may, and muſt bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and whereby thou lookeſt for thy reward in mercy at Gods hand at the laſt day; doe it as in obedience to God, to glorifie his Name, and to aduance his Kingdome, and to the confuſion of Satan and his complices. Fourthly, as wee muſt do it without hypocriſie, ſo we muſt ſee we pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it, and that openly; for our publike practiſe of it is our greateſt and beſt part of our profeſſion: we muſt not be like thoſe, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.16. that in their words profeſſe that they know God, but by their workes deny him, that is, their workes ſtand vp againſt them, and tell them to their faces,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16091:82"/>
that there is no ſuch matter; that which wee profeſſe with our lippes, wee muſt practiſe with our liues. Put the caſe that two men bee at ods, one man ſaith one thing, another man proues the contrary by plaine and euident Arguments; whether of theſe two is the beſt and greateſt auoucher of the thing? So it is in this, he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth in his words onely the Truth of God, and another which doth practiſe it in his workes, which is the beſt and greateſt auoucher of Gods Truth? ſurely he that practiſeth it in his workes. Fiftly, as wee muſt labour to doe theſe things our ſelues, ſo we muſt do the beſt we can to draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to it, according to the Commandement of our Sauiour Chriſt to <hi>Peter, Luk.</hi> 22.32. <hi>When thou art conuerted, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thy Brethren.</hi> Which when I thinke on, it cannot but admoniſh mee of my Duty, and ſo it doth vs all, that wee ſhould labour to draw others to that good, which wee our ſelues are partakers of. Thus it was with the woman of Samaria; when ſhee was conuerted, ſhe laboured to draw all the City of Samaria to Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.28, 29. Eſpecially wee ſhould labour with our owne families that they may ſerue God, as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> did, <hi>I and my houſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will ſerue the Lord.</hi> So ſhall we haue true viſible Churches within the walls of our owne houſes, howſoeuer it be in the Land, or Countrey, or Pariſh where we dwell.</p>

As bloody a Perſecution as euer was, all being bent againſt the profeſſion of this ſauing faith; and yet for all this, that God ſhould preſerue his Church amongſt vs, this is a great bleſſing and worthy of all thanks; for the bloodſhed then was ſo farre from deſtroying the Church, as that it was a meanes to increaſe it; many by ſeeing the conſtancie of the Martyrs then were conuerted, and many by reading their ſtories ſince haue been confirmed in the Truth; ſo that, that which the Diuell intended for the deſtroying of Gods Church, was the meanes of eſtabliſhing it amongſt vs.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow that wee haue ſpoken in the firſt place concerning the definition of a true viſible Church, wee come in the ſecond place to ſpeake of the cauſes of it; For that was the ſecond point laid downe to be ſpoken to in the handling of the viſible Church.<note place="margin">The ſecond thing conſiderable in a true viſible Church, are the cauſes of it.</note> Wee muſt know the Cauſes of it: for vntill we know the cauſes of a thing, wee can haue no perfect knowledge of that thing; for then wee know a thing rightly, and in its kind, when wee are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Cauſes thereof. This point is the more carefully to be lookt into, becauſe wee are challenged and endited by many of our Aduerſaries, eſpecially thoſe of the ſeparation, that our Church hath not her being from ſuch cauſes, as it ſhould; and therefore that ours is a falſe Church. Now vpon the diſcouery and view of theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it wil appeare to any man that can and wil ingenuouſly apply it, that wee haue the right Cauſes of a true viſible Church; and therefore that our Church is a true Church of God.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of the being of a Church are generally of two ſortes; the firſt ſort are ſuch,<note place="margin">And they be of two ſorts.</note> as cauſe the Church directly and of themſelues, purpoſely tending to that end: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  ſort are ſuch as doe not cauſe the Church directly  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  and of themſelues, but onely as by the way, being ouer-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſome other cauſe, that makes them helpfull to the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16091:84"/>
being of a Church; and that ſometimes beſides, ſometimes againſt their owne bent and intendment. We will ſpeake of theſe laſt ſort of cauſes firſt.<note place="margin">The ſecond ſort of cauſes haue firſt ſpoken of, and they of two ſorts.</note> Firſt, God ouer-rules ſome things, to make them helpfull to the being of the Church, beſides their own bent &amp; intendment; as when the thing it ſelfe is neither here nor there to the being of the Church, yet  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  by accident it furthers it. As for inſtance: Sometimes a mans ordinary buſines is a cauſe of the being of the Church,<note place="margin">Of this diuers.</note>  
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  as wee ſee in the woman of Samaria, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4 7. ſhee came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her ordinary buſineſſe to draw water at <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well; now this in it ſelfe could bee no cauſe of the Church, yet this was ſo ouer-ruled by God, that it was a Cauſe of the being of the Church in Samaria. For ſhe heard Chriſt, and beleeued in him, and ranne, and told it in the City, and they came alſo and heard him, and beleeued in him, and ſo  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  became a true viſible Church. The ſecond cauſe is matter of affliction, and this is ſometime ſo ouer ruled by God, that it cauſeth men to be of the Church; and this was the caſe of the prodigall Child, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17. he might haue peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in his affliction, yet God made this a by-cauſe, to make  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  him to be of the Church. Laſtly, the death of ſome great man, that is ſometime ſo ouer-ruled by God, that it is the cauſe of the being of a Church. As the death of <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12.23.24 What was the death of <hi>Herod</hi> to the being of a Church, more then the death of an Hog? Yet God ſo ouer-ruled it, that beſides it owne intendment, it was helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  to the being of the Church. Secondly, ſome things are ouer-ruled by God againſt their owne bent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment,<note place="margin">Of this diuers.</note>  
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  as the thing it ſelfe tending directly to the damage and hurt of the Church, and yet God ſo ouer-rules them, as that they are meanes of the being of the Church: as firſt, hearing or reading the Word, or ſome other good bookes, with intent to deride, or ſcoffe, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill at them, as we reade of one <hi>Virginius</hi> a Biſhop of Rome, who being ſet to write againſt <hi>Caluin,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eading ouer <hi>Caluins</hi> bookes for that end, hee ſaw the light ſo cleare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that hee was conuinced, and would write no
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16091:84"/>
more againſt him: ſo that whereas he read ouer his books with intent to cauill at them, God ſo ouer-ruled it, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne intendment he became a member of the true Church thereby. Secondly, the ſinnes of Gods choſen, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  why a man would thinke that they ſhould tend directly to the hurt and damage of the Church; yet God doth ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-rule the ſinnes of his choſen, as that he makes them cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the being of the Church. Thus God ouer-ruled the ſinne of <hi>Saul</hi> in perſecuting the Church, to the making of him to be of the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4.5. Thirdly, the falling  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  away of others from the faith, is ſometimes ouer-ruled by God, to bee a cauſe of the raiſing of others to bee of the Church. And this is the eſtate of vs all at this day; the Iewes they fell away, and through their fall ſaluation is come to the Gentiles, as the Apoſtle ſhewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11. Fourthly, perſecutions of the faithful, that is ſo ouerrul'd by  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  God, as that it is made helpefull to the being of the Church. Why, what is more hurtfull to the Church, euen to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of it, than this? And yet this is ſometime ſo ouer-ruled by God, as againſt its owne bent and intendment it is a cauſe of the being of the Church: for the cruelty of the Perſecutors makes thoſe that are of any humanity to deteſt them, and their courſes; as alſo the conſtancy and holineſſe of the Martyrs that are perſecuted, won the hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, euen of ſtrangers, yea, of their aduerſaries many times to the truth. Examples of this wee haue had at home in our owne Land; When were there euer more fruitfull times of the Churches increaſe in this Land, than in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> bloody dayes, at leaſt euer ſince, by occaſion of thoſe perſecutions? Laſtly, ſometime the ſcattering of the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  Church in time of perſecution is occaſionally by the ouer-ruling hand of God, a meanes of ſcattering the ſeed of the Word into many places, and ſo of cauſing many Churches, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 8.4. there was great perſecution, and the Word was ſcattered abroad, what could hurt the Church more than this? Yet this was ſo ouer-ruled by God, as that hee made it a meanes of the propagation of his Church in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16091:85"/>
places, whereas before it was in Iudea onely, by this meanes it is come into Samaria too. But all theſe are by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſes, and therefore wee doe onely point at them, and ſo paſſe them by; yet this is worthy herein to bee taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, the wonderfull power, wiſdome, and mercy of God, that brings light out of darkneſſe, and makes whatſoeuer pleaſeth him, euen beſides and againſt its owne bent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment, ſeruiceable meanes for the being of his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The firſt ſort of cauſes handled, ſuch as cauſe the Church di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and theſe are foure taking the Church in a comparatiue ſenſe.</note>The other ſort of cauſes which were the firſt, are ſuch as cauſe the Church directly and of themſelues, and theſe are more proper and materiall than the other. Firſt then, take the Church in a comparatiue ſenſe, as it is compared to a building, and ſo the cauſes are to be apprehended thus. As a building hath foure principall cauſes, ſo hath the Church; firſt, in a building there is the foundation; ſecondly, the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  builders; thirdly, the matter of the building; fourthly, the forme. So in Gods Church there is theſe foure cauſes of it: firſt, the foundation, and that is Ieſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Other foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, which is Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and metaphorically, the Prophets and Apoſtles, as they teaching Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. <hi>As a skilfull maſter-builder I haue laid the foundation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>and are built vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Chriſt Ieſus being the head corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the builders, and they are the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for ſo they are called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The ſtone which the Builders refuſed, &amp;c.</hi> that is, which the Iewiſh Teachers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. And 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. the teachers are called Maſter Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  Thirdly, the matter of the building; and they are Saints by calling, liuing ſtones; for ſo the faithfull are called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>liuely ſtones, a ſpirituall houſe.</hi> And in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>  
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  3.9. they are called <hi>Gods building.</hi> Laſtly, the forme of the building, and that is the laying and the coupling of the faithfull together, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>In whom all the building coupled together, groweth vnto an holy Temple in the Lord, in whom yee are alſo built together to be the habitation of God by the Spirit.</hi> And thus the Church is to be apprehended
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16091:85"/>
in a comparatiue ſenſe, as it is compared to a building.</p>
            <p>Againe, take the Church abſolutely in it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Taking the Church abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, there are ſiue.</note> and then it hath an efficient cauſe, an inſtrumentall cauſe, a materiall cauſe, a formall cauſe, and a finall cauſe. Firſt, it hath an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe, from which it hath her being (for that is the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  efficient cauſe of a thing,<note place="margin">The efficient cauſe.</note> from whence a thing hath that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which it hath.) Now the efficient cauſe from whence the Church hath her being, is God himſelfe, he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. <hi>The Lord added to the Church, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that God himſelfe is the efficient cauſe of the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the inſtrumentall cauſe, or meanes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  of the Church; and they are of two ſorts,<note place="margin">The inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſe: Firſt, outward.</note> either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or inward: outward, as firſt the Miniſters of God, they are the inſtrumentall cauſes whereby we are brought to beleeue, as in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. and theſe are ſometimes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, ſometime extraordinary: ordinary, that is, when they haue an ordinary Calling, as moſt Miniſters (if not all) haue in theſe dayes; extraordinary, that is, then when they are extraordinarily called, as the Prophets, and <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles were. The next outward inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſe of the Church is the Word, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.31. <hi>Theſe things are written that ye might beleeue.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he called you by our Goſpell.</hi> And in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. both theſe outward inſtrumentall cauſes of the Church are laid downe together; <hi>God hath committed vnto vs</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the Word of reconciliation.</hi> Then the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are the next outward inſtrumentall cauſes or meanes of the being of the Church; and firſt, Baptiſme, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Know yee not that all we that haue been baptized into Chriſt, haue been baptized into his death?</hi> And the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which wee bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we breake, is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> By Baptiſme we are made members of Chriſts myſticall Body, and by the Lords Supper we are nouriſhed in this Body, which is his Church. Now all theſe three out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes are laid downe together, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Goe,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16091:86"/>
teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt. Goe,</hi> that is ſpoken to the Apoſtles; <hi>Teach,</hi> there is the Word; and <hi>Baptize,</hi> there are the Sacraments, one expreſt, the other implyed. Theſe are the inſtrumentall cauſes without vs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Secondly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note>Now the inſtrumentall cauſes within vs are, firſt, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18. <hi>God hath granted to the Gentiles Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to life.</hi> Secondly, faith: <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. <hi>And he put no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt vs and them, after that by faith he had puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their hearts.</hi> And laſtly and principally Gods Spirit, that is, the teſtimony of Gods Spirit in our hearts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are perſwaded of Gods loue and fauour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>We haue receiued not the Spirit of the world, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is of God, that we might know the things that are giuen to vs of God.</hi> And all theſe ſixe inſtrumentall meanes inward and outward, are laid downe together in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts</hi> in the caſe of the firſt Church that was planted after our Sauiours Aſcenſion, from the fourteene verſe to the ſix and thirtie, there is their Miniſter, and the Word his Sermon, <hi>Then Peter life vp his voice, &amp;c.</hi> Then there are their Sacraments; firſt, Baptiſme in the 38. and 41. verſes; <hi>Then they that gladly receiued the Word were baptized, &amp;c.</hi> and the Lords Supper in the 42. and 46. verſes; <hi>and they continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine and fellowſhip, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread, &amp;c.</hi> there are the outward cauſes. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the inward, as firſt there is Repentance, verſ. 37. and 38. <hi>They were pricked in their hearts;</hi> then ſecondly, there was Faith too, as in the 41. and 44. verſes; <hi>They that gladly receiued his Word,</hi> and <hi>all that beleeued, &amp;c.</hi> And laſtly, there was the Spirit of God, for in the ſeuenteenth verſe it is ſaid, that it was propheſied before of them, that <hi>God would powre out his Spirit vpon them.</hi> And in the 38. verſe the Apoſtle bids them repent, and be baptized, &amp;c. <hi>and yee ſhall receiue the gift of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſo that they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and beleeuing, did receiue the gift of the holy Ghoſt. So theſe are the inſtrumentall cauſes or meanes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:16091:86"/>The next cauſe is the materiall cauſe, and that is the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  of God; <hi>Saints by calling</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The members of the body of Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Citizens with the Saints, &amp;c. Epheſ.</hi> 2.19. As members are the matter of the body, and Citizens the matter of a City; ſo the members of Chriſt are the matter of the body of Chriſt, which is his Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the formall cauſe of the being of the Church, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  and that is inward and outward; that which is inward is the effectuall calling and gathering of Gods people to Chriſt, when the faithfull are perſwaded in their hearts to beleeue and obey the Goſpell of Chriſt: the outward for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall cauſe, that is their ioynt and publike profeſſion of the ſauing faith, and the outward communion that they hold in the meanes of grace, both for duties of piety to God, and of charity each to other, yee ſhall find both theſe in the caſe of the Church at Ieruſalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. firſt, their effectuall calling, which is their inward formall cauſe, that is laid downe in the 37, 38, 41, and 44. verſes, <hi>they were pricked in their hearts, repented, baptized, added to the Church, &amp;c.</hi> there is their effectual calling. Their outward formall cauſe, that is ſet downe in the 41, 42, 44, 45, 46. verſes, <hi>They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Apoſtles Doctrine and fellowſhip, &amp;c. and had all things common, &amp;c.</hi> there is their ioynt and publike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the ſauing faith, and their outward communion. Theſe are the materiall cauſes of the Church.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the finall cauſe of the Church, which is the end of  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  a Church, and that is to bee conſidered in many reſpects; firſt, in reſpect of Gods glory, that ſome of <hi>Adams</hi> ſeede might glorifie the Lord God here in his Church, by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, obeying, calling vpon him, and hereafter in heauen ſinging euerlaſting prayſes to his glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. <hi>That he might declare the riches of his glory, on the veſſels of mercy which he hath prepared to glory.</hi> Secondly, the finall cauſe of the Church is in reſpect of the faithfull themſelues, and of their ſaluation and glory; for God will not haue all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde caſt away as they well deſerued, but ſome he would haue of his free grace and mercy to obtaine ſaluation and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16091:87"/>
glory by Ieſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>and to receiue the end of their faith which is the ſaluation of their ſoules,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. Thirdly, the finall cauſe of the Church is in reſpect of the truth of God, that the ſame might be embraced and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and kept aliue on earth, that ſome men might not onely know the truth, but beleeue it, and liue in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, and alſo that the Scriptures, the records of truth might be ſafely preſerued; firſt, that the body of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might not bee mangled, or torne by Heretikes; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the ſenſe of the Scripture might not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued by the enemies of it; laſtly, that the Scriptures might not bee as a ſealed booke, but that there might bee ſome on earth to interpret it, and to teach it, and that it might be openly taught and practiſed on earth, this is one end of Gods Church. Fourthly, the finall cauſe of the Church is in regard of the wicked, that they might bee left without excuſe, when as the pretious truth of God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them by his Miniſters, and by his Church, and when as they denie it as falſe, or contemne it, or at leaſt careleſly neglect it as a vile thing, not worth hearkening to, that then they might iuſtly periſh in their owne wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thus you haue heard concerning the cauſes of the being of the Church, both of thoſe that cauſe it directly, and of themſelues, and alſo ſuch as cauſe it, not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues directly, but onely as by the way, being ouer-ruled by God to that end.</p>

            <p>Let vs inlarge our thoughts in this point,<note place="margin">How all the three perſons haue a hand in cauſing the Church.</note> that God is all in all in cauſing of his Church; and let vs conſider firſt, how euery one of the three perſons in the Trinitie haue a ſpeciall and an effectuall hand herein: Firſt, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt perſon, he hath a ſpeciall hand in it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come vnto me, except the Father which ſent mee draw him.</hi> So likewiſe the ſecond perſon Ieſus Chriſt, hee hath a ſpeciall hand in it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>No man commeth vnto the Father but by me.</hi> So likewiſe the third perſon, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, he hath a ſpeciall hand in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. <hi>No man can ſay</hi> (that is, by a true perſwaſion) <hi>that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> God the Father he loues the world, and in that loue of his hee decreed, that ſuch and ſuch ſhould be gathered to his Church, and ſo be ſaued; and alſo in that loue ſends his Sonne to redeeme vs, and to pay our ranſome, and giues vs his Spirit to ſanctifie, and to comfort vs that are his Church. So likewiſe Chriſt Ieſus hee loues
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16091:88"/>
the Church, and in this loue of his comes downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and takes our nature, and our ſinnes, and our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon him, and layes downe his life for vs, that hee might purchaſe the Church with his owne blood, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. and incorporates vs into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and makes vs bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. and brings vs to his Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the holy Ghoſt he loues them, and in that loue which hee carries to them, hee comes and dwels in them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens them, gouernes them, and frames them to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſanctifies them, and applyes the meanes of grace to the particular conſcience of euery one of them; hee makes them apprehenſiue of that courſe whereby they are ſaued, and applyes it vnto them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 12. Secondly, euery part and ſeuerall worke that tends to our ſaluation is of God, as firſt, Election, that is from God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen vs in him, &amp;c.</hi> ſo our Calling is from him; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he predeſtinated them alſo he called:</hi> likewiſe our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is from him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Which are borne not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> So alſo our teaching is of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.45. <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God.</hi> Our iuſtification is alſo of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>It is God that iuſtifieth.</hi> Laſtly, our ſanctification is from him, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Now the very God of peace ſanctifie you throughout, &amp;c.</hi> So that euery ſeuerall worke that tends to our ſaluation is of God. Laſtly, euery ſeuerall meanes both within vs, and without vs is Gods doing: but of this we ſhall ſpeake in the Reaſons; and therefore we will now come to them.</p>

Secondly, the inſtrumentall cauſes they are wholly and onely of him: Firſt, for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſes, as the Word, Sacraments, Miniſters, and Gifts. Firſt, God ordaines them, and giues them their being; and therefore they are called Gods Word, and Gods Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Gods Miniſters, and Gods Gifts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>he hath giuen ſome to be Apoſtles, &amp; ſome to be Prophets, and ſome to be Euangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the gathering of his Saints, for the worke of the miniſtery, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, he vouchſafeth the preſence and tender of them to ſuch perſons and places, where hee would haue his Church to be, as we may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.6. <hi>Paul &amp; Silas were forbidden by the holy Ghoſt to preach the Word in Aſia:</hi> and Verſ. 7. <hi>the Spirit ſuffered them not to goe into Bithynia.</hi> And in the tenth Verſe it is ſaid, <hi>they went into Macedonia, being aſſured that the Lord had called them to preach the Goſpell there.</hi> Sometimes God reſtrayneth the meanes from ſome, and enlargeth them to others, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Goe not into the way of the Gentiles,</hi> compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46, 47. <hi>It was neceſſary</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the Iewes there) <hi>that the Word of God ſhould firſt haue been preached vnto you, but ſeeing ye put it from you, and iudge your ſelues vnworthy of euerlaſting life; Lo, we turne to the Gentiles, for ſo hath the Lord commanded vs, &amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, God giues the ſucceſſe and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16091:89"/>
bleſſing to the meanes, and ſo makes them effectuall. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Paul planteth, and Apollo watereth, but it is God that giueth the increaſe.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 11.21. <hi>the hand of the Lord was with them, ſo that a great number beleeued, and turned to the Lord.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. from the ſixth to the twelfth verſe, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> ſent forth meſſengers throughout all Iſrael and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah with godly letters for the keeping of the Paſſeouer, and the wicked laughed them to ſcorne, but the Text notes in the twelfth Verſe, that <hi>the hand of God was in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, ſo that he gaue them one heart to doe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King.</hi> The King might haue commanded long enough, yet if God had not giuen the people a heart they would neuer haue obeyed him: ſo that all other meanes are vtterly voide, yea nothing without God. 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giueth the increaſe.</hi> Now if God giues vs theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſtrumentall Cauſes of the being of his Church, hee giues vs the inward much more, as Repentance, and Faith, and principally the chiefe of all, Gods Spirit is giuen vs meerely and freely of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed vs, and giuen vs, the earneſt of his Spirit in our hearts.</hi> So that wee ſee the inſtrumentall cauſes of the Church, both inward and outward, are of God. So alſo the materiall cauſe, that is of God too, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Ye are Gods building</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.) The formall cauſe, that is of God alſo, the outward formall cauſe, which is our ioynt and publike profeſſion of the faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. <hi>No man can ſay that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſpecially the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formall cauſe is of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Wee are called of God to the fellowſhip of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Laſtly, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſe that is of God too, Gods Word, labours, husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, ordinances, Church, &amp;c. are not onely of, and from him, as he being the efficient cauſe of them, but alſo for him and his glory, as he being the finall cauſe of them. So likewiſe if we caſt our eyes on the by-cauſes of the Church, God is all in all euen in them too; yea, extraordinarily in theſe; ſo that hee ſeemes rather to haue a greater hand, in theſe,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16091:89"/>
than in the reſt; that God ſhould make perſecution (which tends of it ſelfe to the deſtruction of the Church) to bee a cauſe of the being of the Church; this then ſhewes that God is all in all in cauſing his Church. So much for the Reaſons.</p>
            <p>The vſes are theſe. Firſt Vſe is for inſtruction; to teach vs, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>  that ſeeing the Lord is all in all in cauſing his Church, then let him be reuerently and ingenuouſly acknowledged ſo to be. And in that reſpect, Firſt, let ſuch congregations as haue taſted Gods bounty in this kind, aſcribe all the honour and praiſe and glory of that their bleſſed ſtate to him alone; and that which I ſay of whole congregations, let euery one in particular practiſe, and that both for the congregation, and ſpecially for himſelfe. We muſt not dote on the meanes, though they be ſingular helpes vnder God, the Miniſters gifts, nor any other thing the Church hath, it muſt not bee doated vpon: It is true that wee muſt eſteeme highly of them, and labour for the good of them, and acknowledge what benefit we haue receiued from them, and be thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them; yet ſtill I ſay, it is all the Lords doing, and let him haue all the glory of them; and if euer there ſhould ſuch a preſumptuous thought come into our heads of doa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon them, we muſt euer haue that in a readineſſe in our minds which the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>They are but miniſters by whom we beleeued;</hi> let God haue the honor and praiſe of all that the Church hath, for it is all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Secondly, as this ſhould ſtirre vs vp to thankfulneſſe, for the good we haue already receiued; ſo it ſhould ſtirre vs vp to prayer and continuall calling vpon God, that he would bee pleaſed in his good time to afford the meanes of his Church where they are wanting: And that where they are, there God (who is all in all in his Church) would bee pleaſed to confirme, increaſe, and continue them for euer; that ſo he may haue a Church there to the worlds end. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what is it to haue care for our ſelues onely as <hi>Ioſiah</hi> had? <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>let there be peace in my dayes:</hi> but we muſt haue a care of our poſterity, and pray that God would
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16091:90"/>
continue his Church to them too: and this is a neceſſary duty both for Miniſters and People, and that each for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and one for another; the Miniſter hee is to pray for himſelfe, that the Lord would open his mouth, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his heart and affections; that he may preach powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually; and for the people, that they may bee teachable and tractable, humble, willing, and ready to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and beleeue, obey and practiſe that which they are taught. And ſo likewiſe the people, they are to pray for their Miniſter, and for themſelues too, that God would open their Miniſters mouth, and ſanctifie his heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that he might preach powerfully and effectually to them; and alſo that they might haue teachable hearts, ready and willing to heare and to obey, and that God would water their hearts with his Spirit that they may be fruitfull. Thirdly, this ſhould ſtirre vs vp to vſe the meanes profitably, which are the cauſes of the Church; let them not be vnprofitable towards vs, much leſſe let them bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned of vs, but let vs make a good vſe of them, as of Gods ſpeciall ordinances, which hee will ſurely reuenge if we contemne them. Doth the Lord bend himſelfe wholly and all his forces as it were, to make vs vnderſtanding, wiſe, and obedient, and to bring vs to himſelfe; and ſhall wee neglect ſo great ſaluation, and not make vſe of it to bee brought vnto God? Doe not receiue ſuch a pretious grace of God in vaine, but embrace it, take the opportunitie of it: now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſaluation, now God ſtands at the doore and knockes, now the Table is prepared, the victuals are ready, and the Gueſts are called, therefore let vs now quicken vp our ſelues, let vs take hold on the promiſe of Grace, and let vs receiue the Word, not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the Word of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, powerfull to ſaue vs, if we beleeue and obey it; or elſe, if wee refuſe and contemne it, powerfull to condemne vs, and to caſt vs headlong into hell.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>  The ſecond vſe is matter of comfort to vs; ſeeing God is all in all in conſtituting his Church, then it aſſures vs of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16091:90"/>
welfare of the Church, it ſhall goe well with the Church, although Satan bend all his forces againſt it, though the wicked maligne and perſecute it, God is for it, who can be againſt it? It is of God, and therefore it ſhall ſtand in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of Satan and all his forces. It is God that plants his vine, who can roote it out? He makes a hedge about it, who can breake it downe? Yea, God is a wall of fire about his Church, therefore whoſoeuer comes neere to hurt it, ſhall be conſumed and burnt vp: God waters it, and makes it fruitfull, who ſhall hinder the growth and increaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Surely, God will not ſuffer his owne worke to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by any power in the world. If this were well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it would diſmay the aduerſaries of the Church, and euen daunt Satan himſelfe; for they know before-hand, that they are fighters againſt God, yea againſt his ſpeciall hand, and therefore it is impoſſible that they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. The wicked after the Flood, when they built the Tower of Babel, they fought againſt God, but they could not preuaile, it turned to their confuſion; but theſe fight againſt God in a ſpeciall manner. And therefore this is our comfort, they ſhal neuer preuaile, though they band them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues together againſt the Lord and againſt his Church, yet all they doe is but the imagination of a vaine thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is againſt God and againſt his people. This ſhould comfort the faithfull in all their perſecutions, temptations and diſtreſſes whatſoeuer, becauſe that they are built by Gods owne hand, and therefore like Mount Sion they ſhall ſtand faſt for euer, and neuer be remoued; and likewiſe they are continually aſſiſted by Gods hand, ſo that their enemies cannot hurt them; as the Mountaines are about Ieruſalem, ſo the Lord is about his people, from henceforth and for euer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.1, 2. So much of the firſt obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſing from the cauſes of the Church.</p>
            <p>The next Point ariſing hence is this; That whereſoeuer  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label>  the true cauſes of a true Church are effectuall, and that by the ordinary bleſſing of God they haue their due ſucceſſe, there certainely is a true viſible Church: Firſt, I ſay, where
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:16091:91"/>
they are effectuall, for ſometimes the cauſes may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet not effectuall, or at leaſt very little effectuall; but where they are effectuall, onely there they cauſe a Church. Secondly, I ſay, by the ordinary bleſſing of God: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary bleſſing and ſucceſſe doth not ſufficiently proue a true viſible Church. The point is cleare in the caſe of the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. from the beginning to the end, the cauſes of a Church were there, as wee ſhewed before, and they were effectuall, Verſ. 41. <hi>They were added to the Church;</hi> and it was ordinarily effectuall, Verſe 47. <hi>The Lord added to the Church from day to day, &amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was a true Church, and ſo it is called in that verſe 47. And ſo it was in the caſe of the Church of Antioch, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. from 20. to 26. verſe, there was the meanes, the Word and the Miniſters of it, and it was effectuall, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued; and it was ordinarily effectuall, for a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber beleeued, and turned to the Lord; and therefore they were a Church, and were alſo ſo called, verſ. 26. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Church of God which is at Corinthus, to them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Ieſus, Saints by calling, &amp;c.</hi> They had a Calling then, and this was effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, for they were ſanctified in Chriſt Ieſus, and ſo were a true Church. The caſe was thus in the ſeuen Churches, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.16. to the end of the Chapter, there were the ſeuen golden Candleſticks, that is, ſeuen true viſible Churches, and there was the Sonne of man, that is, Chriſt, walking in the middſt of them, and there were the Starres, that is, his Miniſters vpholden in his right hand, and a two-edged ſword came out of his mouth, that is, his Word, and the power thereof; for ſo the Word is compared to a two-edged ſword, <hi>Heb</hi> 4.12. And theſe were effectuall too, the Starres were vpholden, and it was a ſharpe two-edged ſword: ſo where theſe are thus effectuall, there is a golden Candleſticke, that is, a true viſible Church.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label>  The Reaſons of the point are theſe; Firſt, the cauſe doth alwayes proue the effect neceſſarily, where it hath her worke and is not reſiſted; now here are the cauſes of a

true Church, and their worke is not reſiſted, therefore here is the effect too, that is a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, where theſe cauſes are, there is the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label>  of a true viſible Church, that is, a company of people profeſſing ioyntly the ſauing truth. Now where theſe are, there is a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whoſoeuer liues in ſuch a Church, where theſe  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label>  cauſes are, walking in truth and ſinceritie, and being carefull and conſcionable to obey theſe meanes, he is certainely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and on the contrary, whoſoeuer liues out of ſuch a Church, and doth not obey theſe meanes, ordinarily hee cannot be ſaued: then where theſe are, muſt needs be a true Church; for without the Church ordinarily there is no ſaluation. But our Aduerſaries that we haue principally to deale againſt in this caſe confeſſe it, that the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are the inſtruments and meanes of conſtituting the Church, and conſeruing it; therefore we will ſtand no longer on the proofes and grounds of the point.</p>
            <p>The Vſes are theſe; Firſt, this ſerues to iuſtifie our Church  <label type="milestone">

not receiue them yet we might bee a true Church, though happily not ſo pure and perfect a Church; for Diſcipline is not a matter of ſubſtance to the being of a Church, but to the well-being only:  <label type="milestone">

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing acquainted you already with the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, as alſo with the Cauſes of a true Church; It remaines that we proceed in the third place to ſpeake (as we propounded) of the members of the Church: For whereas the viſible Church is compared to a Body, and every body conſiſts of diuers parts and members framed and ioyned proportionably together; if therefore wee would exactly know the body of a true viſible Church, we muſt be well inſtructed touching the parts and members of the ſame; for the preſence of the members proues the preſence of the body; looke where the members are, there likewiſe is the body alſo. And the ſtate of the members well conſidered, inſtructs vs rightly to eſteeme of the ſtate of the body, for the body is to be accounted ſound or vnſound, accordingly as the members thereof are affected. Now when we ſpeake of the members of the Church; we may as well vnderſtand the head, as the other parts; for in a generall ſenſe the head is as well a member, as the reſt of the parts of the body: or elſe we may ſpeake of all the other parts beſides the head, for ſo in a more ſtrict and particular ſenſe, the head and the members are oppoſed againſt each other, as they being diuerſe from the head, and the head from them. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16091:93"/>
we deſire to carry the matter fully before vs as neere as we can, therefore we will ſpeake of this body in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſenſe, as including both head and members too.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of the head,<note place="margin">In it firſt of the head.</note> for that being the chiefe and principall member, is firſt and principally to bee ſpoken of; ſpecially in this caſe, the head being here infinitely greater, and more excellent than all the body beſides, and therefore firſt of that: That which we will ſpeake of in this point,<note place="margin">And in it three things.</note> we will contriue into theſe three heads; Firſt, that the viſible Church muſt haue a head; ſecondly, that it muſt haue one head; thirdly, that this head is Ieſus Chriſt and hee alone.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Church being a body muſt haue a head, for ſo in the firſt place the courſe of nature requires it, for in  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  the courſe of nature a headleſſe body, is a monſtrous body, imperfect, without forme, faſhion, life or gouernment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the courſe of nature requires it, ſo the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Church requires it; for the Church muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſpirituall life, therefore it muſt haue a head to conuey life into it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the wiſdome of God requires it; for God is the God not of confuſion, but of order in all his works, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his ſpecial workmanſhippe, that is his Church. What a confuſed heape of ſtones would a Church be, if it had not a head corner ſtone, to hold all the other ſtones together, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one in his due place: and what a diſordered Aſſembly would the Church be, if the members were without a head to order it, and to releeue it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the Church hath a head, ſo it hath but one  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  head; for as a Body without a head is a monſter in nature by defect; ſo likewiſe if there bee two or many heads to one body, it is a monſter in nature by exceſſe. Now the Church is but one body, and therefore muſt haue but one head.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this our head is Chriſt Ieſus, and hee alone; for  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  ſeeing the Church is his owne body, therefore hee alone muſt bee the head, if wee ſhall aſſigne any other to bee the head of the Church, being Chriſts Body, it is as if we ſhould
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16091:94"/>
take the body of a man, and ſet vpon it the head of a beaſt, and ſo ſhould be a body againſt nature: for as a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a head is a Monſter in nature by defect, and as a body with two or many heads is a Monſter beyond nature by exceſſe; ſo for a body to haue a head of another kind is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, &amp; is as monſtrous as either of the other; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church being the body of Chriſt, muſt haue Chriſt alone to be the head of it. And thus the way is beaten out plaine to this naturall Obſeruation, which followeth,</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
               </label>  Namely, That our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, as hee is moſt truly and properly the Head of the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that is, of the whole company of the Elect, which are his true myſticall body (as we haue taught before,) ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably hee is alſo the Head of the true viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that is, of all Congregations in the World, profeſſing openly the ſauing Faith. For the clearing of this point, wee muſt heare call to minde two things, of which wee haue heard before: Firſt, that there are ſome things affirmed in Scripture, which are principally ſpoken of the inuiſible Church, but proportionably are to bee vnderſtood of the viſible, the whole taking the name of the better part, and ſo this is to be vnderſtood here. For when it is ſaid ſimply, that Chriſt is the Head of the Church, it is meant principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the inuiſible Church, and yet is proportionably to bee vnderſtood of the viſible Church, becauſe ſome of thoſe members that are in the viſible Church, are alſo of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible vniuerſall Church, the whole taking denomination of the better part. And therefore I doe not ſay in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, that Chriſt is ſimply the Head of a viſible Church, but proportionably, becauſe there are ſome in the viſible Church that he is the head of. The ſecond point, that we are here to call to mind, for the clearing of the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this, that the viſible Church is either vniuerſall, or particular. The vniuerſall is the whole Company of thoſe that profeſſe the ſauing truth through the world, from the beginning to the end thereof: a particular viſible Church is a Company of thoſe that ioyne together in the profeſſion
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16091:94"/>
of the ſame ſauing truth in ſome particular place and time, &amp;c. Now therefore when I ſay, Chriſt is the Head of a true viſible Church, I meane chiefly and moſt properly the vniuerſall viſible Church, not but that it may be affirmed alſo of euery particular viſible Church, yea and of euery member too, that is ſo farre forth as it is a member of Chriſt, and Chriſt the Head thereof; as the head is the head of the right ſide as well as of the left, and of the hand too, as well as of the whole body; yet not ſimply and by way of appropriation, but together with the reſt of the members by way of participation and communication; that is, as being a member with the reſt of ſuch a body: ſo all particular viſible Churches, from the beginning to the end of the world, are indeed but one body, though diuers in time, place, and other circumſtances, yet in the profeſſion of the ſauing truth, they are but one and the ſame in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. And Chriſt is the head of the whole vniuerſall viſible Church, and alſo hee is the head of euery particular viſible Church, but that is onely by way of communication, as that particular Church concurres and participates with other particular Churches, in the vniuerſall viſible Church: ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it ſelfe, Chriſt cannot bee ſaid to bee the head of one particular viſible Church, for then we ſhould make many heads and many bodies; as the head cannot be ſaid to bee the head of the hand ſimply by it ſelfe, but by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with the reſt of the members; therefore, when we ſay, Chriſt is the head of a particular viſible Church, wee muſt vnderſtand it in common, as all particular viſible Churches are members of that body, whereof Chriſt is the head. The Apoſtle makes this plaine in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Yee are the body of Chriſt and members for your part;</hi> they are the body of Chriſt in ſome ſenſe, and yet in ſome ſenſe they are but members, and in both theſe ſenſes they haue Chriſt to be their head. Conſider the Church of Corinth in it ſelf, and it is a body; conſider it in the generall with other particular Churches, and it is but a part of the body. I note this the rather, to preuent an obiection ready to bee made
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16091:95"/>
againſt this truth, which is, That if Chriſt bee the head of euery particular viſible Church in England and France, &amp;c. then either there are many Chriſts, becauſe there are many bodies; or elſe there is but one head to many bodies, both which are abſurd: but Chriſt is the head of euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar viſible Church proportionably, that is, as that particular Church is a member of the vniuerſall viſible Church; and ſo much ſhall ſerue for explication.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Corpus adaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note>Now we come to the proofes, That Chriſt Ieſus is the Head, and the onely Head proportionably of a true parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular viſible Church. In <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God hath appointed him ouer all things to be the Head to his Church.</hi> I grant that this is ſpoken principally and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Church vniuerſall, for that is the onely body that is in all reſpects fitted and equalled to the head, and the head to it. Yet it holds conſequently and by proportion of the viſible Church; for that is therefore called a Church, becauſe it is preſumed that there were at leaſt ſome faithfull and elect of God amongſt them, yea the Apoſtle ſeemes to ſpeake it with reference to that particular Church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, whom he calleth Saints in the firſt verſe, and it could be no comfort to them to know, that Chriſt is the Head to his Church, vnleſſe it were intended that they were a part of his body. And ſo likewiſe <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.15, 16. Chriſt is ſaid to be the head of his body. Now what body is that? but onely that body ſpoken of in the 11. and 12. verſes, where his Miniſtery is publikely exerciſed, and that is a true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church. So in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. Chriſt is the head of the Church, and the Church is his body; that is ſpoken prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of the inuiſible Church, but is proportionably to be vnderſtood of the viſible: for the Apoſtle ſpeakes of that Church, wherein was the vſe of the Word, and of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme, as we may ſee in the 26. verſe, which are onely in vſe in the viſible Church. And in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.18. there is Chriſt the head of his Church, and there is the Church the body of Chriſt. Now the Apoſtle ſpeakes of that Church, whereof hee was a Miniſter, as we may ſee,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16091:95"/>
verſ. 25. which is a viſible Church. And that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that theſe Collections are not ſtrained againſt the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, you ſhall find that the Apoſtle in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. ſpeaking to the viſible particular Church of Corinth, ſaith plainely, <hi>Yee are the body of Chriſt;</hi> and ſo intends neceſſarily, that Chriſt is the head of that particular viſible Church. And as it was with the Church of Corinth, ſo it is too with all true viſible Churches elſe, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.13. there the head and the body is deſcribed together; there was the ſeuen golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, the ſeuen particular viſible Churches, and there was alſo the Son of Man walking in the midſt of them, that is, Chriſt the head of them. And no queſtion but the Iewiſh Church in the former Teſtament was Chriſts Spouſe, and ſo Chriſt was her Husband, and conſequently her Head: for how often did God threaten to caſt them off, and to giue them a Bill of Diuorce; ſhewing thereby that hee was the Head euen of their viſible Church, then much more of our particular viſible Churches: ſo that Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably is the Head of a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of the Obſeruation are theſe; firſt, Chriſt  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label>  liuing vpon the earth was of the viſible Church, but not as an inferiour or a member, for then ſome other viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber muſt be his head, which is impoſſible; therefore while he liued vpon earth, he was the head of the viſible Church. Now what he was, he is; he was ſo then, and therefore he is ſo now.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all power is giuen to Chriſt both in heauen  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label>  and earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. and he is the head of all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.10. And in what reſpect is he the head of all? but that he might be the head of the Church, as the very reaſon is implyed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22. <hi>And hath made all things ſubiect vnder his feet, and hath appointed him ouer all things:</hi> Why? <hi>to be the head of his Church.</hi> And this is that we meane in that Article of our Faith, when wee ſay, <hi>I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God;</hi> that is, that hee hath power giuen him to rule ouer all things,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:16091:96"/>
ſpecially ouer his Church, to rule and gouerne it, and to conuey all good things to it, as the head to the body.</p>

                  </p>
               </note> and ſo to the Pope? I anſwer, No, Chriſt gaue it not to <hi>Peter,</hi> nor yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meant to giue it him, much leſſe to the Pope: Firſt, hee gaue it not to <hi>Peter,</hi> for the places which they alleage to proue this point ſerue nothing to this purpoſe, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Whatſoeuer thou ſhalt binde on earth, is bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhalbe looſed in heauen.</hi> This is ſpoken equally to all the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as well as vnto <hi>Peter; Ioh.</hi> 20.23. <hi>Whoſoeuer ſinnes ye remit, they are remitted, &amp;c.</hi> Where now is the headſhip of <hi>Peter</hi> ouer the whole Church? So that in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. where our Sauiour ſaith three times to <hi>Peter, Feede my ſheepe, &amp;c.</hi> What a ſlight ground is this to build the headſhip of the Church vpon? And if they aske then, why Chriſt ſhould
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16091:97"/>
thus preſſe it vpon <hi>Peter</hi> ſo often? The Fathers anſwer them, that it is onely a ſpeciall charge binding to Duty (not any vniuerſall authority or iuriſdiction) preſſed thrice vpon him, for his former threefold deniall of Chriſt, that ſo hee might be the more carefull for the time to come; elſe the charge is alike to all the reſt of the Apoſtles: for ſhall wee think that any of them were not bound to feede the ſheepe of Chriſt as well as he? The Apoſtle giues this charge to all Miniſters 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Feed the flocke of God, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, but <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is the Rocke, and vpon this Rocke Chriſt will build his Church,<note place="margin">And Mat. <hi>16.18</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. I anſwer, if the Church were built vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> then it was either built vpon his perſon, or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Confeſſion; but it was not built vpon his perſon, for then when he died, the Church muſt haue failed too: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the place muſt be vnderſtood of <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion, or of his faith, or of that Chriſt which he confeſſed. Chriſt built his Church on the confeſſion of <hi>Peters</hi> faith, becauſe himſelf was the ſubſtance of his confeſſion, &amp;c. <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion of his faith is the Rocke, in making knowne the Church: But Chriſt himſelfe is the Rocke, as being the ſubſtance of that his confeſſion, ſo that the Church is not built vpon <hi>Peters</hi> perſon. And if it had, what is that to the Pope? Vnleſſe they can proue theſe two things: Firſt, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſate at Rome as head of the vniuerſall Church; ſecondly, that hee intended to leaue his headſhip to the Pope of Rome, and to none other, which is a meere fancie and deuice of their owne braine, for which they haue no colour. So then Chriſt neuer gaue <hi>Peter,</hi> much leſſe the Pope, this headſhip. Secondly,<note place="margin">Chriſt ſaith, He neuer will giue it.</note> as Chriſt neuer did giue it, ſo he ſaith expreſſely he neuer will giue it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.25, 26. Our Sauiour ſaith to his Diſciples, that it was enough for the Gentiles to be Lords, and to raigne one ouer another, but it ſhall not bee ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you (ſaith he) ſo that Chriſt checks them for hauing but a conceit of ſuperiority, ſo far is he from giuing it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them. Further, this being a great part of Chriſts glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as he is Mediator, to be head of his Church, hee will not giue it to any other, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.11. <hi>My glory will I not giue to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16091:97"/>
another.</hi> And as Chriſt neuer gaue this, nor meant to giue it to any other; ſo no man is able to weeld or ſway it,<note place="margin">None is able to weeld and ſway it.</note> no more than any one temporall Gouernor can rule all the Kingdomes in the world; no, this power is reſerued onely to him that made the whole world, and all things therein. So that we ſee, they ouer-reach in ſaying the Pope is the head of the vniuerſall viſible Church. Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Head, Chriſt.</note> they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach as far in ſaying he is the head; if you aske them what head they meane? They will ſay onely, a miniſteriall head vnder Chriſt, heere is ſome ſhew of modeſty: But aske them further, what power they aſcribe to him?<note place="margin">The power and authority that is giuen to the Pope proueth, that he cannot be a miniſteriall head as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſupreame head.</note> And then they bewray themſelues; for they ſay that the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Church through the world, depends on him, that he hath power and authority to iudge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of all cauſes of Faith and Religion, to rule Councells, to order Biſhops and Paſtors, to excommunicate and to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and to inflict other penalties vpon offenders; yea, whatſoeuer concerneth either preaching of Doctrine, or the practice of Diſcipline in the Church of Chriſt, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of gouerning in all ſuch cauſes (they ſay) lies in the Pope. Is this to be a miniſteriall head? This is rather to be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſupreame head. If by head they meant onely ſome chiefe Gouernour, the name head in that ſenſe might agree to ſome one man, in reſpect of ſome one particular place, for ſo the Scripture vſeth the word in other caſes, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>The man is the womans head, &amp;c.</hi> But neuer in this caſe, for a man to be the head of the whole Church.<note place="margin">
                  <p>The Pope is made the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, yea, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Doctor of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Pope doth what he doth of himſelfe, and not as vnder Chriſt; for he taketh not the courſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Chriſt in that he doth.</p>
               </note> This tranſcendent power by them aſcribed to the Pope, is a great part of Chriſts owne power, and can neuer agree to any man in the world; for Chriſt is the onely Doctor of his Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8, 10. How then can the Pope determine all matters of faith and religion? Is not this to make him a great Doctor, yea the onely Doctor? No, ſay they, for hee doth it but vnder Chriſt: But he doth it of himſelfe, if the Pope in controuerſies would take Chriſts booke, and vſe prayer to God for direction therein, and in humility and ſincere loue of the Truth, would examine euery cauſe and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:16091:98"/>
ſo iudge, there were ſome hope that he would doe many things well and that he would iudge rightly, as in Chriſts ſtead, and ſo honour his Maſter, and doe good ſeruice to the Church: But firſt, he takes no ſuch courſe; but mingles with the word, and vſeth his owne Canons in ſtead of the word; and he is ſo farre from vſing prayer to God for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as that he preſumes the truth is tyed to his Chayre; and therefore that he cannot erre in any of his Sentences, likewiſe hee is ſiniſterly affected to the Truth, framing it to the ſtate and practice of his owne Church, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee iudges and pronounces. Secondly, if he ſhould take the former courſe, yet his reach is not infinite, hee cannot iudge rightly in all cauſes of faith and religion, for no one man that euer was (Chriſt Ieſus onely excepted, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles) that was able to iudge of all Truth; Therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Pope in particular muſt be at leaſt as one of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, nay he muſt be as Chriſt is. For if the Apoſtles could doe it, yet they had fellowes, <hi>Paul</hi> as well as <hi>Peter</hi> could do this;<note place="margin">The Pope taketh vpon him to iudge the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles doctrine, and ſo to be <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Maſter, and ſo proues himſelfe to be Antichriſt. The Pope takes Chriſts name vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <hi>viz.</hi> Chiefe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. Obiect. You make the King head of the Church.</note> But the Pope is without any fellow, yea he will take vpon him to iudge of the Apoſtles owne Doctrine and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: ſo that though he pretends to be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet vpon the point he takes on him to be <hi>Peters</hi> Maſter, euen to be Chriſt, &amp; ſo proues himſelf to be very Antichriſt; yea and he not onely takes vpon him Chriſts Office, but he takes his name vpon him alſo; hee calls himſelfe the chiefe Shepheard, which name is proper to Chriſt onely, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. What is this but to ſtep into the throne of Chriſt? But they except againſt vs and ſay, doe you finde fault with vs for ſaying the Pope is the head of the Church? Why you your ſelues make the King ſupreame head of the Church. I anſwer, how do we ſay the King is the head of the Church, as they ſay the Pope is? No, but wee ſay the King is the head of the Church within his iuriſdiction, to ſee Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion maintained,  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label>   and to ſee the Church gouerned by the word, not elſe. And in this ſenſe the good Kings both of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and Iudah, were alwaies the head of the Church, not in deciding matters of Faith and Religion, for that Gods
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16091:98"/>
Word decides. But this word, Head of the Church,<note place="margin">The word, Head of the Church, to be warily vſed, becauſe not found in the Scripture.</note> muſt be warily vſed, becauſe it is not found in the Scripture; but chiefe Gouernor is: and therfore in that ſenſe the King may be ſaid to be head of the Church within his dominions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vnder Chriſt he is chief Gouernor. Secondly, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept &amp; ſay, the vniuerſal viſible Church hath a viſible head. Now where is this viſible Head, Chriſt is not viſible? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; Yes, Chriſt is viſible: for firſt, though he be not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene in this diſpenſation of time, yet he may be ſeene. If the King after he is crownd, ſhould keep himſelf in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet all his life time, yet hee is a King, and a viſible King too, though he be not actually ſeene of his ſubiects. So Chriſt, he is the King of his Church, and is now in heauen,<note place="margin">Chriſt the Head of the Church is viſible.</note> where the Saints ſee him, and where wee ſhall ſee him too, and that with theſe eyes of ours; and therefore he is viſible, though he be not actually ſeene of vs now. Secondly, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that in ſome ſort he is viſible daily in his Church, in the Word and in the Sacraments, eſpecially in the Lords Supper, in theſe Chriſt is amongſt vs, and in our ſight cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. Thirdly, hee was once viſible and ſeene on earth for many yeeres, and ſhall bee ſeene by euery eye at the laſt day, and that as the head of the Church. Fourthly, his Miniſters together with lawfull Magiſtrates, doe in ſome ſort viſibly repreſent him amongſt vs. So that Chriſt (and not the Pope) is the head of the viſible Church, though he be not actually ſeene euery day amongſt vs. And ſo much for the firſt Vſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Vſe is matter of comfort to Gods Church, in  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>  that Chriſt is their head, and that many wayes. Firſt,<note place="margin">Matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the Church many wayes.</note> it ſhewes the excellency of the Church; ſecondly, the neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it hath with Chriſt; laſtly, it ſhewes the ſafety of the Church. Firſt, it ſhewes the excellency of the Church: for  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  ſeeing it hath ſuch a glorious Head as our Lord Chriſt is, therefore the body muſt needs be glorious too, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Kingdomes and Monarchs in the World come infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort of the excellency of the Church, euen as farre as their Gouernors come ſhort of the excellency of Chriſt,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16091:99"/>
that is, as farre as mortall and ſinfull man comes ſhort of the eternall and bleſſed Sonne of God. As Chriſt hath a Name aboue all names, to bee the Head of heads, that is, the moſt excellent and glorious head: ſo hath the Church in her meaſure a name aboue all names, the body of bodies, the moſt excellent and glorious body in the World.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Secondly, it ſhewes the neere coniunction the Church hath with Chriſt, and is matter of comfort to the Church in that reſpect. There is no coniunction ſo neere as this; let any, or all the Societies in the World, ſhew me ſuch a neere coniunction betwixt them and their Gouernours, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his Church. Seruants haue their Lords, Companies their Maſters, Cities their Maiors, Subiects their Kings, Sheepe their Shepheards, &amp;c. yea, but the Church hath Chriſt to be her head, and this is the neereſt coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can be. Other Gouernours of other Societies, thoſe that are vnder them, or conioyned with them in the ſame Company, may haue hurt, and yet they not know of it; or if they know it, they doe not affect it; at leaſt if they doe affect it, it is but for conſcience of their place onely. But Chriſt knowes the harmes and wrongs that are done to his Church, and affects them as done to himſelfe; <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour:) he tooke the iniury that <hi>Saul</hi> offered to his Church, as done to himſelfe. And of neceſſity Chriſt muſt needs be ſenſible of the harmes done to his Church, as the head is of the hurt done to the body. It is impoſible but that the head ſhould be ſenſible of the hurt done to the body, and that in regard of it ſelfe, as well as of the members. This the Church conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and receiues ineſtimable comfort by the conſideration thereof; for by this they are aſſured of Chriſts neereſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to them in their afflictions, by meanes of this neere coniunction, and alſo they are aſſured that he will releeue them of the wrongs and iniuries done vnto them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge them on their enemies, as done to himſelfe. And alſo he will mercifully recompence all our releeuers, as if they had releeued him on earth in his greateſt extremity. This
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16091:99"/>
point is maruellous comfortable to all ſuch as know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be liuing members of his body the Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this is matter of comfort to vs, in regard of our  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  ſafety, which wee haue by meanes of this neere coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Chriſt is our head, therefore we ſhall be ſafe: the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt vs, we are builded vpon the Rocke; and that Rocke is Chriſt, and they ſhall neuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt vs: if they can preuaile againſt Chriſt, then they may preuaile againſt vs too; but the one is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo is the other too. Secondly, it aſſures vs that we ſhall preuaile againſt them; nay, it is paſt doing, for it is done already, for Chriſt our head hath ouercome the World, the Diuell, and all the powers of darkneſſe: the head being aboue water, the body cannot poſſibly be drowned; <hi>I haue ouercome the World,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour. Thirdly, it aſſures vs, that certainly we ſhall liue and reigne in heauen: for where the head is, there the members ſhall be alſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.24. yea, wee are already by communication with him in heauenly places, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.6. becauſe he being our Head, is there already.</p>
            <p>The third vſe is for inſtruction, that ſeeing Chriſt is the  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label>  head of a true viſible Church, then we muſt labour ſo to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme him, and to beleeue in him, to reuerence him, and to obey him, as our head. Firſt therefore, ſeeing it is the nature of the head, to conuey life, ſenſe, and motion to the Body: let vs therefore waite vpon our head Ieſus Chriſt, and call vpon him for his life and Spirit, and for his direction in all our actions, both for matter of Doctrine and manners, and diſcipline too; and alſo let vs defie all other directions, and all other counſels, that doe not agree either particularly, or at leaſt in the generall with his reuealed will: all directions therefore that are againſt Chriſt, and againſt his Word, though it were brought to vs by an Angell from heauen, we muſt not receiue it, but ſtand at defiance with it: and we muſt ſubmit our ſelues intirely to the Scepter of the Word and Spirit of our Head Chriſt. It was Iſraels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſneſſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7. and the Iewes wilfulneſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.14.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16091:100"/>
that they did refuſe to haue Chriſt to be their head and to raigne ouer them, and therefore he refuſed them to bee his Body: therefore what direction ſoeuer Chriſt tenders vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, we muſt obey it; and whatſoeuer is againſt the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Chriſt, wee muſt defie them. And ſecondly, ſeeing Chriſt is our head, therefore whatſoeuer life or direction wee haue in ſpirituall things, wee muſt acknowledge the Fountaine of them, that we haue them not of our ſelues, but from him onely; for <hi>of his fulneſſe wee all receiue grace for grace, Ioh.</hi> 1.16. and <hi>without him we are able to doe nothing, Ioh.</hi> 15.5. and <hi>by him we are able to doe all things, Phil.</hi> 4.13. Marke how ſweetely theſe places agree together, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all from him, without him wee can doe nothing, by him we are able to doe all things; therefore whatſoeuer good things wee haue, ſpirituall life or graces, wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them thankfully, embrace them ſweetely, vſe them gratiouſly, to the honor of thy head, and the good &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of thy ſelfe, and thy fellow-members: ſo likewiſe for vnprofitable members that diſhonor our head, wee ſhould pray that our head, Chriſt Ieſus, would either make them profitable, or elſe cut them off; and alſo that he would be pleaſed to purge from his body, the noyſome humours, as ſinne and ſuperſtition, that ſo hee may haue a ſound and a healthfull body. Thirdly and laſtly, ſeeing Chriſt is our head, therefore as he hath a gracious care for our ſafety, ſo we ſhould be as carefull to preſerue and maintaine his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, we ſhould reioyce when we ſee his honor and glory aduanced, and we ſhould mourne and bee gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued when we ſee it oppoſed. And ſo likewiſe we ſhould bee affected with the good or harme of our fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. we ſhould be carefull to bring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to heauen, and not bee careleſſe whether they come thither or no.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label>  The laſt Vſe is this, hence wee haue a ſufficient warrant, that the Church of England is a true viſible Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt our head, ſpirituall life, and the Doctrine of Saluation, is found truly in our Church. But our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16091:100"/>
except againſt vs; Firſt, ſay they, you haue not Gods ordinances amongſt you, and therefore you haue not Chriſt to be your head? We anſwer, that they muſt ſhew vs out of Gods word that thoſe are the ordinances of Chriſt which we want. But ſay they, you haue Antichriſt to bee your head, for you haue many things from him? I anſwer, we defy him as much as they do together with his doctrine wee defie his practiſes and courſes, if wee haue, or vſe any thing, that he doth or hath vſed before vs: firſt, it is either no matter of ſubſtance, but onely ſome paſſage or carriage or circumſtance, either in worſhip or gouernment: or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they are ſuch things as were vſed in purer time, and Churches before Antichriſt: or thirdly, it is of the beſt, which that Church being in Apoſtacy, that is, hauing beene a Church, and ſtill pretending to continue the ſame, hath reſerued, for ſtill they haue ſome good things, and profeſſe ſome good truths: Laſtly, at leaſt it is throughly cleanſed from their ſuperſtition and idolatry. So that ſtill we hauing Chriſt to be the head of our Church, and his ſpirituall life, and the Doctrine of ſaluation being found amongſt vs, and begetting ſpirituall life in many of vs, we muſt needes bee a true viſible Church. And ſo much for this point.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He third point propounded to bee ſpoken of concerning the finding out of a true viſible Church, was touching the members of it; for as I ſhewed you, the Church being a body, and that euery body conſiſts of certaine members, therefore if wee would exactly know the body, we muſt know the members: Now the members were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either in a more generall ſenſe, including the head; or elſe in a more ſtrict and particular ſenſe being conſidered, as a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16091:101"/>
diuerſe thing from the head: now becauſe we would carry the matter fully before vs, we tooke it in both thoſe ſenſes, and hauing ſpoken of the members of the Church in the firſt ſenſe (where wee ſhewed that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was the head, and the onely head of the true viſible Church,) now we come to ſpeake of the members of the Church in a more ſtrict and particular ſenſe,<note place="margin">The ſecond thing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the third thing touching a viſible Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof in a more ſtrickt ſenſe; and they are of three ſorts.</note> being conſidered as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head. And thus conſidered, the members are of three ſorts: Firſt, ſome are members by right onely, and not by poſſeſſion; ſecondly, ſome are members by poſſeſſion, not by right; and thirdly, ſome are members both by right and by poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſome are members of the viſible Church by right onely, not by poſſeſſion; for ſome members haue a good  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  right in the body of the viſible Church, and the priuiledges thereunto belonging;<note place="margin">The firſt ſort, and of the diuers kinds.</note> but yet are not actually poſſeſſed of them. And of theſe there are diuers kindes; irſt, generally all the elect of God liuing vpon the face of the earth, that  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  as yet are not called; for the Church is theirs, and the Word is theirs, and the Sacraments are theirs, and the Miniſtry is theirs, the Lord ſpecially intending his owne ordinances to the benefit of his choſen, though indeed they themſelues be notable ſo much as to know their own right in them, much leſſe are they able to reach forth their hands to claime it and enioy it: yet becauſe the Lord hath appointed them to be heires of ſaluation, and therefore conſequently hee hath appointed them a time in which hee will call them to the outward profeſſion of the ſauing faith, therefore in reſpect of the purpoſe of God they are by right, true members of the true viſible Church, though they be not as yet actually poſſeſſed of it. And thus one and the ſame man may be at one and the ſame time, a member of the Church malignant, and Synagogue of Satan in his owne practice and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and by right (in reſpect of Gods purpoſe) a true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſts true viſible body.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16091:101"/>
member of the true Church of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thoſe that are members of the true viſible  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Church by right and not by poſſeſſion, are ſuch as onely haue heard of Chriſt and of the Goſpell, and are endued with ſome little ſmatch of religion, yet they are but entring into the Church, onely their feet are in the Porch, they are not yet come within the holy place, they haue not yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Sacrament of Baptiſme, which is our admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the viſible Church; ſo that after that time, the Church doth acknowledge vs from thence forward to bee her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and wee acknowledge her to be our mother, and ſo we are incorporated, and become members of that body. So then thoſe that haue onely heard of Chriſt and of the Goſpell, and haue ſome little ſmatch of Religion, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not iuſtly bee ſaid, to bee members by poſſeſſion; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding becauſe that by the ſweetneſſe of that little Religion they haue, they are whetted on to an hunger and thirſt after more, and doe vnfainedly ſeeke and deſire to be further partakers of the Churches Communion; therefore they are in reſpect, partly of thoſe beginnings and taſtes which they haue of Religion; and partly of thoſe deſires to be further partakers of the Churches communion; they are, I ſay, in this reſpect true members of the viſible Church by right, though not by poſſeſſion; of this ſort were thoſe in the primitiue Church, which were called <hi>Catechumeni</hi> or <hi>Nouices,</hi> that began to be inſtructed in the grounds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that vpon their further growth and fitneſſe they might ſoone after bee made partakers of Baptiſme, and ſo become members by poſſeſſion: It is in this ſpirituall buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as it is in the building of a materiall Church, which is built of ſtones, whereof ſome are layd already, and ſo are parts of the Church by poſſeſſion; others are onely taken out of the Quarry, and are vnder the workemans hand in fitting and preparing for the building, and are not yet pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced within the building as the others are, and ſo are no parts by poſſeſſion, yet theſe ſtones becauſe they are not onely appointed, but alſo being in the Workemans hand a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16091:102"/>
fitting for the building, therefore they haue a place by right in the building; So likewiſe it is in the ſpirituall building of the Church, there are ſome members that are placed in the Church already, and ſo are members by poſſeſſion, of which we ſhal ſpeake in their due place; others there are that are a fitting and preparing vnder the workmans hand, that Faith may be wrought in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſo they may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be baptiſed &amp; become members of the church by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, as it was with thoſe <hi>Nouices</hi> in the primitiue church: Now that theſe are members by right, before they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, the reaſon is very good, for put the caſe that theſe ſhould dye before they bee baptized, ſhall we ſay, they are damned, or that they died out of the Church? God forbid; But rather we muſt ſay that they died within the Church, though not by poſſeſſion, yet by right, and ſo were ſaued.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  A third ſort that are members by right, though not by poſſeſſion, are the ſeed of the faithfull that die before they can be conueniently baptized: I ſay, before it can conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently be had; for if it be neglected or contemned, where it may conueniently be had, it is ſinne: but if it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently be had, and ſo they die before they bee baptized, theſe are members by right, though not by poſſeſſion; they haue no poſſeſſion among the members of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not baptized; yet being borne within the Couenant, wee are charitably perſwaded that they are a holy ſeed, and we muſt acknowledge them to haue a right among the members of the viſible Church.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  A fourth ſort are thoſe that haue true repentance and faith in Chriſt, begotten in them in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as amongſt the Turkes and Infidels; but yet doe not know any other to ioyne with them, nor for them to bee ioyned with, if they did know any ſuch, and might conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ioyne with them, they would: of theſe we are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably to be perſwaded, that they are members by right, though not by poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  Laſtly, there are ſome that haue been poſſeſſed, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, and yet either of their owne accord
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16091:102"/>
haue made a voluntary ſeparation, and ſo haue diſmiſſed themſelues, as Schiſmatikes doe; or elſe they are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate by the Diſcipline of the Church, and ſo are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed by others for ſome ſinne; theſe afterward, if they repent of their ſchiſme, or of their ſinne, and deſire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored into the Church againe, though they die before their ſecond admiſſion, yet ſtill we are charitably to bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that by right they are members of the Church, though not by poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Branch is,<note place="margin">The ſecond ſort.</note> that ſome are members by poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and not by right, and they are ſuch as are baptized and planted in the Church already, but haue no true right nor title to it; for after they haue gotten to be members by poſſeſſion, they grow lewde and profane in their liues, and ſo by right they are no members of the Church. They are ſo but by intruſion and vſurpation, and haue gotten poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by colourable and fraudulent meanes, pretending to bee that they neuer were, that is, that they are true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, when indeed they are not, nor euer were ſuch; for if they were, they would bring forth better fruits.<note place="margin">And of this two ſorts.</note> Of theſe there are two ſorts; notorious offenders, and ſecret hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. Firſt, notorious offenders, ſuch were the ſonnes of  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  
               <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.12, 17. they were members of the Church by poſſeſſion, but they were ſuch notorious wicked men, ſo that they made the offering of the Lord to be abhorred; therefore they were not members by right. And ſuch are many amongſt vs, that were baptized in their infancy, but when they are of yeares, they ſhew themſelues openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and of diſſolute liues; their Baptiſme giues them poſſeſſion, but their prophaneneſſe and diſſoluteneſſe of life vtterly diſables them from hauing any right at all in this body; for if they had their right, they ſhould bee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out. But you will ſay; So they are caſt out when they are once knowne to bee ſuch, and then they are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by poſſeſſion neither. I anſwer; It is true, they are ſo where matters are carried as they ought to bee, but yet ſometimes the Church is in a weake caſe, and hath not this
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16091:103"/>
power, their hands are tyed, and they cannot doe it; or elſe if they haue power, ſometime they are negligent, and do not exerciſe that power they haue; or if they be forward in it, yet at leaſt there muſt be a time for admonition betwixt their diſcouery and caſting out, and ſo ſtill for a time they are members by poſſeſſion, but yet not by right.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  In the ſecond place, there are ſome ſecret hypocrites that are members by poſſeſſion, but not by right; and theſe are all ſuch as are baptized, and accordingly goe on in an outward conformitie to the lawes and gouernment of the Church in outward ſhew, as well as true beleeuers, but yet are not ſuch, for within they are full of wickedneſſe, and haue not that true faith in their hearts which outwardly they profeſſe: like to <hi>Iudas</hi> that profeſt himſelfe to be one of Chriſts Diſciples, and a member of the true Church, and outwardly carried himſelfe as a true beleeuer; but yet within he was a diuel, and a child of perdition; no member of the Church by right, though he were by poſſeſſion. It is with them in this caſe, as it is with a man that wrongfully poſſeſſeth an houſe, all the while that it is not diſcouered, he is accounted the true poſſeſſor of that houſe: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when it is proued he is not ſo, then he is thruſt out; ſo that though he had poſſeſſion, yet he had no right to it: ſo theſe hypocrites profeſſe themſelues outwardly to bee true members by poſſeſſion, and are ſo accounted of others, yet they are not that within, which outwardly they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe; and therefore are no true members by right.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third ſort.</note>Thirdly, there are ſome that are members both by right and by poſſeſſion too, and ſo are onely the faithfull that make profeſſion of the ſauing faith, and none but they, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>If they beleeue with the heart, and confeſſe with the mouth,</hi> they are true members: for faith giues vs right to be true members of the Church, and the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this faith giues vs poſſeſſion of it: ſo that onely the faithfull making profeſſion of their faith, are true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church by right and by poſſeſſion: I will giue you an inſtance of all theſe kinds of thoſe that are
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16091:103"/>
members by right, and not by poſſeſſion, and alſo of thoſe that are members by poſſeſſion, and not by right; laſtly, of thoſe that are members both by right and by poſſeſſion. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.29. there is a Parable of the two ſonnes; the eldeſt ſonne hee was bid to goe and worke in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and he ſaid he would not, but afterward hee repented himſelfe and went: here was a member by right, though not by poſſeſsion then, becauſe hee refuſed to goe: in the 30. verſe, there is the younger ſonne that was bidden goe, and ſaid he would, but went not; there was a member by poſſeſsion, becauſe he ſaid he would goe, but not by right becauſe he went not. So likewiſe the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.3. made ſhew to be members of the Church, but by right they were not; for they ſaid and did not. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, members by right and by poſſeſsion too, ſo were all the Prophets and Apoſtles, ſo was the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Pſalm.</hi> 116.10. <hi>I beleeued</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>therefore I ſpake:</hi> and ſo was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>We beleeue, and therefore we ſpeake.</hi> We beleeue; here is our right: therefore we ſpeake; here is our poſſeſsion. So that in theſe inſtances we haue examples of theſe three ſorts of members. Now the matter of greateſt doubt and moſt conſequence, is concerning the wicked, how they can be members of Gods Church; therefore that is moſt to bee inſiſted on. And for the better vnderſtanding thereof, I will draw it into an Obſeruation.</p>
            <p>And the Obſeruation is this;  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
               </label>  That Hypocrites and Caſtawayes may be, and are oftentimes members euen of a true viſible Church: for proofe of this you ſhall heare it witneſſed out of their owne mouthes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.26. <hi>We haue eaten and drunke in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreetes, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore they were members of the true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Churches, and yet they were Reprobates; for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith vnto them, verſ. 27. <hi>I know yee not, depart from me yee workers of iniquity.</hi> And ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. they ſhall ſay to our Sauiour; <hi>Haue not we by thy Name propheſied, and by thy Name caſt out Diuels, and by thy Name done
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:16091:104"/>
many great workes?</hi> And yet our Sauiour ſhall ſay vnto them; <hi>I neuer knew yee, depart from me yee workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi> Theſe were members of true viſible Churches, and yet they were hyprocrites and caſtawayes: ſo yee haue heard it from their owne mouthes. Now take it from a ſurer witneſſe, out of the mouth of our Sauiour himſelfe, in that Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.47, 48. where the kingdome of heauen is compared to a draw-Net caſt into the Sea, that gathereth all kind of fiſh good and bad. Here it is ſo clearely laid downe, as if the Parable had been fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of purpoſe to proue this point. I will not ſtand here to proue, that by the kingdome of heauen is meant the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, though the place would beare it wel enough, but it ſignifies plainely the preaching of the Goſpell, or the Goſpell preached, whereby a Church is gathered and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Kingdome of heauen: for in that ſenſe it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in verſ. 31. Now vnderſtand the compariſon thus; Like as a draw-Net that is caſt into the Sea, gathers of all kinds good and bad, ſo the preaching of the Goſpell is caſt forth into the World, and gathers all kind of men, good and bad, choſen and reprobates, hypocrites and true beleeuers, all are gathered by this Net, into the outward communion of the faithful, and as the bad fiſhes are part of this draught; as well as the good; ſo the wicked outwardly gathered by the Goſpell, are alſo parts and members of the viſible Church, as well as the godly. So likewiſe another Parable we haue to proue this point, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.1, 2. In the firſt verſe our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>I am the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine;</hi> and in the ſecond verſe hee ſets downe two ſorts of branches; ſome that abide in him, and bring forth fruit, and theſe are the faithfull: others that beare no fruit, that are taken away, what are theſe but hypocrites and caſtawayes? Therefore they are parts of the viſible Church as well as the faithfull.</p>

The faithfull that are ingrafted into the body of Chriſt, they receiue iuyce and life from him and can neuer fall away: but hypocrites and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes, they are but grafted into the barke, that is, into the outward communion, and ſo receiue iuyce onely, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for a time, but afterward they fall away: ſo wee haue ſeene it proued by Parables. See it likewiſe proued by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and that will make it more plaine; and in alleaging theſe examples, I may propound theſe two things: Firſt, what Church euer was there, but had ſome wicked men in it: and ſecondly, what wickednes was there euer ſo great, but it hath been found in the members of ſome viſible Church or other, as by theſe examples may appeare. Looke into <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Caine</hi> was a member of the viſible Church, his outward conformity to religious duties proues it; for he brought his offering to God, and yet hee was a wicked reprobate. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Ham</hi> he was a member of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, for he was preſerued in the Arke, and yet hee was an accurſed wretch as we may ſee in the 25. verſe. If we looke into our Sauiours choſen Diſciples, they were certainely a true viſible Church, elſe there was neuer any in the world, and yet there was a <hi>Iudas</hi> a member of it and a Diuell, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.70. So if wee looke into thoſe Churches in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> 2. and 3. Chapters, many of them were full of wicked and vngodly men in one kinde or other. The Church of Corinth may be a witneſſe of all this; there were carnall people, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. there were fornicators, and one in the higheſt degree, an inceſtuous perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 1. ſo there were deprauers of the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. And for the Lords Supper, how horribly did they abuſe it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21. yet for all this though there were ſuch
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16091:105"/>
notorious offenders in it, it was a true Church: So likewiſe if you would find out falſe brethren, you ſhal haue them in the Church, <hi>Gal.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.4. So for heretiks you ſhal haue them in the Church too, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. there muſt be hereſies amongſt you (ſaith the Apoſtle) And <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.6, 14, 15 in the Church of Epheſus there were the Nicholaitans. And ſo in the Church of Pergamus, there were they that maintaind the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the Doctrine of the Nicholaitans: So for Schiſmaticks, they are in the Church too, before they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18. There were diſſentions amongſt them. Nay, I will ſay further that Antichriſt may bee a member of a true viſible Church; The Text intends he muſt be ſo, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. He muſt ſit in the Temple of God: diuers Diuines tyre themſelues with opinions vpon this place. Some ſay he muſt ſit in that which was the temple of God; but that anſwers not the meaning of the words, for he muſt ſit in that which is the Temple of God. Yea, but ſay others, he may ſit in that which is the Temple of God, becauſe ſome faithfull lye hid within it; but this cannot be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, for it is meant of a viſible Church, as if he ſhould ſay, Antichriſt ſhall ſit in that which is the Temple of God, that is, in a true viſible Church; till he bee vtterly corrupt, and fully diſcouered. And no queſtion but that many yeeres after Antichriſt fate in the Church, it was a true Church. So that it is plaine that hypocrites and caſtawaies in the higheſt degree, are &amp; may be of a true viſible Church.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, it is the corruption of mens hearts to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and to reſt in ſhadowes, but leauing the ſubſtance; ſo  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label>  that if they bee baptized and ſo receiued into the Church, they reſt in that and go no further, fooliſhly flattring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that all is well, when as yet they want the ſubſtance of Baptiſme, and ſo whereas they think, that they are in the way to Heauen, they are in the high way to hell.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is from the ſubtilty and malice of the Diuell;  <label type="milestone">

            <p>Fifthly, elſe there ſhould be no hypocrites at all, vnleſſe  <label type="milestone">

It paſſeth the skill and power of man to doe this, it is to bee done by the Angels at Chriſts direction when hee comes to Iudgement. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.39, 40. It is true that a ſeparation from the bad muſt bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured by vs here in this life, ſo farre as they are knowne to vs, and ſo farre as wee are able to ſeparate. But firſt it is impoſſible for vs to know all that are wicked; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for thoſe we doe know, it is impoſſible alſo to bee quite
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16091:106"/>
ſeparated from them, for then wee muſt goe out of the World, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. howſoeuer ſome heretikes (as the Donatiſts) haue maintained, that the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church conſiſts onely of the elect and choſen; and ſome of our Diuines haue vſed the ſame words; but the heretikes meant it in one ſenſe, and our Diuines in another. The heretikes intend it as they ſpeak it, and ſo it is not true; but our Diuines meane it principally of the Church inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo it is true, that none but Gods choſen are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof: and when they doe apply it to the viſible Church, they vnderſtand it of the liuing, abiding, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full members of the Church, and ſo it is true too, that none are liuing members of the viſible Church, but the choſen, but yet there may be rotten and dead members too.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this teacheth vs what to eſteeme of ſuch as  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>  make profeſſion to be of the Church, and yet their liues are not anſwerable to their profeſsion, ſhall wee ſay preſently, they are none of the Church? Certainely wee muſt iudge of them as members at leaſt by poſſeſsion, and for ought wee know, they may bee members by right too. It is very hard and impoſsible for man to iudge who is an hypocrite, and who not; becauſe that though hypocrites may diſcerne themſelues by notorious falls, yet the faithfull ſometimes fall as dangerouſly as they; and therefore wee muſt leaue that to God, who onely knowes the heart; in the meane time we may ſafely ſay, that they are members by poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for ought we know by right too. This is harſh in many mens eares, but yet the Doctrine is true and ſound, and the exceptions againſt it are eaſily anſwered. The firſt exception is this; How can theſe bee members of the true viſible Church, and yet are not members at all of the Catholike Church? I anſwer: Yes, they are of the Church to vs, both becauſe they ſeeme ſo, and in charity wee are to hold them ſo, till we ſee the contrary. Yea, but doth not the Apoſtle ſay, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>They went out from vs, becauſe they were not of vs.</hi> I anſwer, this is ſpoken of them after their falling away, but yet while they abode with them,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:16091:107"/>
they were members by poſſeſsion,<note place="margin">Hyper. method. <hi>574.</hi>
               </note> though not by right: and it is confeſt of the Apoſtles, that <hi>Iudas</hi> had obtained fellowſhip with them, and was numbred amongſt them; beſides,<note place="margin">Additum dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuens.</note> viſible is <hi>additum diminuens,</hi> that is, it addeth not to the thing, but diminiſheth from the ſtrict acceptation; ſo that the wicked reprobates and caſtawayes may be of the true viſible Church, though not of the true Church ſimply. The ſecond exception is this: How can they bee the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, the body of Chriſt, ſeeing they haue not Chriſt to be their Head? for Chriſt is the Head of no Reprobate. I anſwer; Yes, they are members of that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whereof Chriſt is the Head, though ſimply he is neither Head to them, nor they members to him, but he is the Head properly of the faithfull in that body; and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably he is reckoned the Head of the whole. Beſides, the wicked pretend and counterfeite themſelues to bee the members of Chriſt, but Chriſt neuer pretends and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeites himſelfe to bee their head; and therefore though head and members bee relatiues, yet it is ſo that they may be members of him in their ſenſe, and yet he no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to bee their head. Laſtly, hee is their head in that ſenſe that they are his members, that is in the ſhew of the world, and in their owne pretence, though not in his. The third exception: But how then is the viſible Church the Kingdome of heauen? for ſo it is called many times in the Scripture. I anſwer; Firſt, it is ſaid ſo in reſpect of the faithfull that are in it; ſecondly, it is ſaid ſo, becauſe there is the meanes, to bring all, euen the wicked to heauen; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they doe all outwardly profeſſe to be Citizens of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and are ſo to be reputed, till there be euident proofe to the contrary, and then they are to be caſt out. Fourth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: But what if all bee hypocrites, is that a true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church? I anſwer: It is impoſsible; for where the Word is truly preached, it cannot bee but that there are ſome that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe ſincerely profeſſe. Secondly, I ſay, that if it were poſsible, yet till it be diſcerned to be ſo, it is to be held a true viſible Church. The fifth exception: Yea, but you
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:16091:107"/>
confeſſe your ſelfe, that though they be members, yet they are not liuing but dead members; and will any man ſay, that a dead member is a member of a liuing body? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; Yes, euen as a rotten branch of a tree, till it be cut off, is a member of the tree as well as the ſoundeſt. In <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.1. the caſe is auouched in this very kinde; the Church of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis is ſaid to be a dead Church, becauſe it had dead mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and yet it was a true viſible Church. And ſo they may be members by poſſeſsion and by ſhew, though they bee dead members, and ſo by right are not members, for that belongeth onely to the faithfull.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this teacheth vs, that we ſhould not be raſh, to  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label>  condemne a Church for to be a falſe Church, or no Church, becauſe it hath in it many hypocrites and wicked members, for you ſee that true viſible Churches haue alwaies hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in them. It is true that a Church full of hypocrites may bee called, and doth well deſerue to bee accounted a corrupt and an vnſound Church: yea,<note place="margin">
                  <p>A Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied to be a true viſible Church, though there be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hypocrites in it to one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer.</p>
                  <p>The Browniſts obiection of our Church being a prophane multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, anſwered diuers wayes.</p>
               </note> but ſo long as there are ſome it, and of it, that do openly profeſſe the ſauing faith in ſincerity, though otherwiſe it be full of wicked men and hypocrites, it cannot bee denied to be a Church, yea a true viſible Church, though there be a thouſand hypocrites to one true Beleeuer. This matter concernes vs neerely, for it is one of the maine Reaſons alleaged by <hi>Browne</hi> and <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Greeneway</hi> and the reſt of the ſeparation, to proue vs to bee a falſe Church. Oh, ſay they, your Church is a profane multitude, promiſcuouſly mingled together of good and bad, all were admitted together into the Church, and ſo you continue in it without ſeparation. I anſwer, If it were ſo, this might proue vs to be an impure and corrupt  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  Church, but not a falſe Church, ſo long as wee haue the Word, and Sacraments openly embraced and obeyed by ſome amongſt vs, wee are ſtill a true Church, though wee ſhould bee in a miſerable and fearefull eſtate, becauſe the wicked, if they were not rooted out would bee likely at length to ouerthrow the Church. But ſecondly, wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  It is not ſo: For firſt for admiſsion, we receiue none
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16091:108"/>
into our Church, that are profeſſedly wicked, for our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is adminiſtred to none, but vpon ſolemne proteſtation and promiſe of the profeſsion of the ſauing faith, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſame: Now becauſe they are receiued into our Church being young, therefore this promiſe is not made by themſelues, but by ſureties; and when they come to yeeres, ſuch ſureties as are conſcionable, and likewiſe the Miniſters call vpon them to conſider and performe their promiſe made in baptiſme: ſo then firſt our Church admits none, but ſuch as make ſolemne proteſtation of faith and obedience.<note place="margin">Obiect. You let wicked ones continue in your Church without ſeparation.</note> And ſecondly, whereas they alleage that wee let the wicked continue in our Church without ſeparation, whereas we ſhould cut them off when we finde them to be hypocrites. I anſwer, wee doe ſeparate, as much as in vs lies, for we labour to haue them ſeparated from vs, and alſo  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label>  wee labour to ſeparate our ſelues from them. Firſt, wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour their ſeparation from vs, deſiring their remouall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing their wickedneſſe, and our condition that liue in <hi>Meſech</hi> and <hi>Kedar,</hi> and reprouing them for their ſinnes; and if that will not ſerue, complayning againſt them to thoſe that are in Authority, that they may bee excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and withall wee are inſtant with God by prayer to ſtirre up the hearts of ſuch as are in Authority to execute his Ordinances vpon them: wee doe what wee can to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from vs, and it comes ſometime to paſſe, that many are ſo ſeparated from vs; but if they ſhould not, that indeed were the Churches ſinne, and a foule ſinne too; yet it deſtroyes not the true being of our Church. Secondly,  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label>  if we cannot get them ſeparated from vs, yet wee ſeparate our ſelues from them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hyp.</hi> 577. 580. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> and that is the ſeparation that the Scripture ſo much beates vpon in priuate perſons, as we are more conſcionable, ſo wee doe more ſeparate from them, from their wills, affections and courſes; yea, wee muſt ſeparate as much as conueniently we may from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, at leaſt from their ſinnes, which for our parts wee are perſwaded to bee the chiefe ſeparation that the Scripture intends. Yea, but this is a ſecret ſeparation, ſay they, vnder
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16091:108"/>
hand, not openly knowne. Nay, this is a notorious and knowne ſeparation: For firſt, it is ingenuouſly profeſt on our part, to the mouing of their after-hatred and deſpight againſt vs; wee diſclayming them that are lewd, ſwearing and prophane wretches, and that openly, not caring who know it; and likewiſe it is knowne on their part, they vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding vs therefore very reproachfully, with the names of Puritanes, Preciſions, holy Brethren, and ſuch like, becauſe wee will not accompany with them, if this bee not an holy and a plaine ſeparation, What is? I maruell then, the matter being ſo notorious, that they are not aſhamed to ſay, that wee doe not ſeparate from the wicked: this therefore is an horrible ſlander. Yea, but ſay they, yee ſhould ſeparate from them in the Aſſemblies, from the Word and the Sacraments? I anſwer, rather the wicked ſhould ſeparate from vs in theſe things: where the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and buſineſſe are naught in themſelues,<note place="margin">Bernard againſt Browniſts. <hi>1034.</hi> where the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are bad, there the good muſt ſeparate; but where the aſſemblies be good, there the bad muſt ſeparate.</note> as at Playhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſuch like, there the good muſt ſeparate: but where the Aſſembly and buſineſſe is good in themſelues, there the bad muſt ſeparate; and the reaſon is good, for it is none of theirs, and the good muſt tarry and be preſent, for it is their owne right; and it is ſin to refuſe Gods ordinances for the pollution of others, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17.24. Yea, but ſay they, Can your holines ſanctifie them? If not, then your Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are prophane. I anſwer; No, our holineſſe ſanctifies not them, yet our holineſſe being true in vs, and openly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and practiſed, it ſhalbe enough to make vs a true viſible Church, yea, and an holy Congregation in Gods acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the charitable eſtimation of our Brethren. Yea, but ſay they, their filthineſſe defiles you, and your holy things; either really, or at leaſt by imputation? I anſwer; they defile theſe holy things to themſelues indeed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.22. compared with <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.14, 15. and <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. but not to vs, ſo long as by faith we receiue them; neither can they defile vs, ſo long as we communicate not with them in their ſinnes, no not ſo much as by imputation, <hi>Galath.</hi> 6.3.15.</p>

Our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.15. <hi>beware of falſe Prophets that come to you in ſheepes cloathing, but inwardly they are rauening Woolues,</hi> &amp;c.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>5</label>  Laſtly, this teacheth vs, that ſeeing Hypocrites and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awaies may bee members of a true viſible Church, wee muſt therefore take heed that wee bee not carried away with this common error, that becauſe wee are members of a true viſible Church, and haue beene baptized; therefore wee ſhall certainely bee ſaued. But take heed, fift and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, and bee alwaies digging into thine owne heart, for feare of hypocriſie; for though thou makeſt a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as thou thinkeſt, yet there is that corruption in thy heart, which if it bee not ript vp before God dayly, it will betray thee, and preuaile againſt thee to fall away, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe in theſe dayes. Let vs take heed therefore, as the Apoſtle doth admoniſh vs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>That there bee not in any of vs, at any time, an euill heart and an vnfaithfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part away from the liuing God.</hi> As great and as bright ſtars as thou art haue fallen from heauen; therefore, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let euery one that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt hee fall;</hi> not that he which doth ſtand can fall, but hee that <hi>thinks</hi> he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall. Try therefore, and examine thy ſelfe daily, fift hypocriſie out of thy heart; that ſo as thou art a member of the Church by poſſeſſion, ſo by thy ſtanding and continuing in the faith, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere profeſſion thereof, thou maiſt ſhew thy ſelfe to bee a member by right too. And ſo much for this point, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates and Caſtawaies may be, and often are members of true viſible Churches.

Wee know that all Souldiers haue their Banners and colours vnder which they fight, and ſo hath the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church, the Souldiers of Ieſus Chriſt, her Colours and Banner to fight vnder. So likewiſe euery Corporation and Company haue their Armes and Liueries, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed from all other Companies: yea, we know that euery Lord and great man hath his Badge and Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance, whereby his ſeruants and attendants are to bee knowne from other mens. So the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the Lord of Lords, the great and glorious God of heauen and earth, hath his Badge and Cogniſance whereby his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants are diſtinguiſhed and diſcerned from all other, from the ſeruants of ſinne, and from the ſeruants of the world, and from the ſeruants of men. True it is, that the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible is knowne to God alone, becauſe none but hee is the Searcher of the heart: But the Church viſible is therefore called viſible, becauſe it hath certaine ſenſible notes and markes ſet vpon it, that at the ſight thereof it may bee knowne to be the Church of God. I doe not ſpeake here of the inward, markes which God doth ſet ſecretly on his Children; as that they are borne of God, ioyned by faith vnto Chriſt their head, endued with the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16091:110"/>
aſſuring them of Gods fauour, and perſwading them to holineſſe, and an inward loue and affection to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; for by theſe they are onely knowne to God and to themſelues: but I ſpeak of outward markes wherby they are knowne to others, ſuch, as that therby the world may take notice of ſuch a congregation ſo marked, that they are a true viſible Church of God. This was a mattter practized in the former Teſtament, and propheſied for the latter, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.19. that the viſible Church ſhould bee thus marked out. And ſurely it is very neceſſary,<note place="margin">Reaſons why there ſhould be Markes of the Church.</note> that there ſhould bee ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tokens and markes to diſcerne it by: Firſt, in reſpect of thoſe that are within the Church, for the ſurer confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their hearts, that they are in the right way; as alſo  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  for the publike teſtification of faith and Religion to bee in  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  the world. And ſecondly, in reſpect of thoſe that are without, for many arrogate falſely the name of the Church vnto themſelues, as falſe Prophets, and Heretikes, and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes; all which may bee diſcouered plainely by theſe markes, that they are not ſuch as they pretend themſelues to bee, as alſo becauſe ſome of them that are without, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Gods election, by theſe markes diſcerning the true Church, may thereby be allured to ioyne to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and ſo bee brought to God; that all the reſt may be left vtterly without excuſe, that being ſhewed by ſuch pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and plaine evidences which is the true Church, out of which there is no ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet they wilfully refuſe to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereunto: what is to be thought of ſuch, but that they are rebells againſt God, and enemies to Chriſts Kingdome, that when hee diſplaies his Banners openly, they will not come into the fight on his ſide, but take part againſt him?</p>

the neerer: but if wee would ſeeke out a thing wiſely, wee muſt ſeeke that which is unknowne, by that which is knowne; and that which is but a little knowne, by that which is more knowne: for that which I know another by, muſt bee beter knowne to mee than the other: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; If I know a man by his face, or by ſome wart or mole vpon it, then I muſt know that better, or at leaſt haue a more particular impreſſion of it in my minde, than of the man himſelfe: So the notes and markes of the Church muſt be better knowne to me than the Church it ſelfe. And both theſe markes and notes muſt concurre together, for being a certaine marke it muſt bee firſt able to direct vs to the thing wee ſeeke; and ſecondly, ſuch as may not deceiue vs therein: if it bee a thing well knowne, and yet not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall, it may direct, but it is apt to deceiue; againe, if it be eſſentiall, and not beſt known, as it is not apt to deceiue, ſo it is not able to direct, therefore they muſt both concurre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So then the iſſue of all is this; That whatſoeuer things doe ſo belong to a viſible Church, that being exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by theſe notes, they will ſtand anſwerable thereunto; theſe and none other are to bee acknowledged, right marks thereof.<note place="margin">Vrſin. <hi>582.</hi> Vogel. <hi>727.</hi>

               </label>  The obſeruation is this, That the preaching of the Word, and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and profeſſion of Obedience to the requiring of them both (that is, to that which they both require) are the chiefeſt and moſt infallible markes of a true viſible Church.<note place="margin">Caluin. inſt. lib. <hi>4</hi> cap. <hi>1</hi> ſect. <hi>10.</hi> in Acts <hi>2.42.</hi>

and moſt infallible markes. For proofe of the obſeruation, looke into <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Goe teach all Nations, baptiſing them</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> What is the buſineſſe our Sauiour ſends his Apoſtles about? It was to plant and erect viſible Churches in the world; how is that to be done? <hi>Go</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>teach all nations, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, they muſt teach the Word; there is the Word preached: ſecondly, <hi>Goe and baptize, &amp;c.</hi> there is the Sacraments adminiſtred, and though but one bee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as that being of moſt ſpeciall uſe, for the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of planting Churches, yet figuratiuely the other is intended: for ſo you ſhall find was their practice, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 42. where it is ſaid, not onely that they did baptize, but that they brake bread alſo; there is the Lords ſupper too: and it is not to bee thought, that they went beyond their commiſſion in this: for it was the Miniſters part to deliuer it, and the peoples to receiue it. So then here is the Word preached, and the Sacraments adminiſtred; and what elſe are they to doe? verſ. 20. <hi>Teaching them to obſerue and do, &amp;c.</hi> there is (at leaſt) profeſſion of Obedience. As if Chriſt ſhould ſay; Let them profeſſe at leaſt, that they will obay you; elſe turne away from them, and ſhake off the duſt of your feete as a witneſſe againſt them. The words are ſo preciſe for euery particular in the obſeruation, and that from our Sauiours owne mouth, and containing ſuch an abſolute deſcription of the office both of Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the intendment being the erecting and ſettling of true viſible Churches, that me thinks it is as much as if our Sauiour had ſaid; Whereſoeuer theſe three are performed, there let the World take notice of a true viſible Church: and ſo from time to time whereſoeuer there is any true Church to the worlds end. And what is this but that which I have affirm'd in the obſeruation, that the preaching of the Word, and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the people to that which they doe both require, are the moſt infallible and chiefeſt markes of a true viſible Church. Another Euangeliſt reporting the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16091:112"/>
ſpeakes as much in effect, though not in ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe tearmes, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Go ye into all the World and preach the Goſpell to euery Creature, he that ſhall beleeue and bee baptized, ſhall bee ſaued, &amp;c.</hi> there is the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and there are the Sacraments (as before) and there is profeſſion of obedience to them both: for if they beleeue, they muſt obey. This point is ſo cleare, that it needs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe; yet becauſe it is a queſtion betwixt vs and the Papiſts, and alſo betwixt vs and the ſeparation, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe among Divines; therefore wee will ſee further proofe of it: There are other places of Scripture which auouch the ſame in effect, yet not ſo pregnantly as theſe doe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.4. our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>He goes before his ſheepe;</hi> that is, before his people, and they heare his voyce and follow him. How doth Chriſt go before his people? He goeth before them in the Word and in the Sacraments, leading them in the wayes of ſaluation: for the Word is there expreſly named, <hi>My voyce;</hi> and vnder that, the Sacraments are figuratiuely to be vnderſtood, <hi>And they heare it, and follow him;</hi> there is obedience. Our Sauiour alludes to the cuſtome of the Shepheards in that Countrey, that were wont to tune a voyce to their ſheepe, which they hearing and knowing, did all follow. Now this voyce of Chriſt is his Word; and his Sacraments are parts thereof; therefore if yee aske who are the ſheepe of Chriſt? The anſwer is ready, They that heare the voyce of Chriſt, and follow him. As who ſhould ſay, Where is a true viſible Church? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, where the Word is truly preached, and at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be obeyed. The like ſpeech is in the 27. verſe of the ſame Chapter. So likewiſe in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt gaue himſelfe for his Church, that he might ſanctifie it, and cleanſe it, by the waſhing of water through the Word.</hi> Apply theſe words to the viſible Church, then there is the Word, and Water, that is, Baptiſme; and vnder that Sacrament the Lords Supper is implied; and there is profeſſion of obedience, for they are ſanctified and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſo that whereſoeuer theſe are, there is a true viſible

Anſwerable vnto theſe aſſertions, you ſhall find it by experience to haue been from the beginning, looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17. there is the Word, Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement giuen to our firſt Parents; <hi>Yee ſhall not eate,</hi> &amp;c. and there were the Sacraments, the Tree of life, verſe 9. purpoſely to ſignifie and to ſeale vnto them eternall life, if they did obey; and there was alſo their obedience acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, in that they accepted of their eſtate, and that vpon that condition.

Where the woman acknowledged that they were bound not to eate of that Tree, ſo there is their profeſſion of Obedience: So you ſee how it was with the Church in Paradiſe before the fall. Now let vs ſee how it was with the Church out of Paradiſe after the fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. There was the promiſe of the Goſpell, there is the Word preached: and <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4. There were the Sacrifices, there was <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> offering Sacrifices, which were repreſentations of Chriſts owne Sacrifice of himſelfe, and conſequently of the Sacrifices of the new Teſtament; and there was alſo their profeſſion of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in that they brought their Sacrifices vnto God: no doubt but <hi>Adam</hi> their Father taught them the Doctrine of the Goſpell, and how they ought to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, and they profeſt obedience to that he taught, both <hi>Caine</hi> as well as <hi>Abel,</hi> for then they were both mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church: ſo heere is the Word, and the Sacraments, and Obedience profeſt to them both, and ſo a true viſible Church. Likewiſe that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. from the eighth to the ſeuenteenth verſe; In <hi>Noahs</hi> time after the floud, there was Gods Couenant made with <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo there is the Word, and there was the Bow ſet in the Cloudes, there was the Sacrament; and thirdly, their profeſſion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience too; for it is a Couenant, which intends obedience on <hi>Noahs</hi> part, for elſe, how is it a Couenant if it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to on both parts? And ſo alſo in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 4 7.10.23. in the 4. and 7. verſes God makes a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> there is the Word; and in the 10.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16091:113"/>
verſ. there is the Sacrament, Circumciſion: and in the 23. verſe there is <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, <hi>He circumciſed Iſmael, and all the males in his houſe.</hi> So likewiſe when God ſent to gather his people out of Egypt, firſt hee deliuers them his Word by <hi>Moſes, Exo.</hi> 3.15. and 6.6. and he giues them the Sacrament of the Paſſeouer, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12.3. and in the eight and twenty verſe of that Chapter, there is the peoples obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>The Children of Iſrael went and did as the Lord had commanded Moſes and Aaron, euen ſo did they.</hi> And what was the Law and Sacrifices in the former Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, but euen as the Word and Sacraments are in the new Teſtament. And did not the Lord require and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of the people a preciſe promiſe of obedience, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee preſcribed them either Law or Sacrifices? This wee may ſee hee did <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5.8. God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people there, before hee deliuered them his Law, and before hee preſcribed their ſacrifices, to know whether they would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey or not: and they ſaid they would. So that vnder the Law there was the Word and the Sacraments, and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of obedience in the people, and ſo a true viſible Church. And ſo <hi>Ioſhua</hi> renewing the true worſhip of God, <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 1.16.18. redreſſeth the things amiſſe, and brings in the Law and the Paſſe-ouer, and the people they promiſe obedience in all things, euen as they obeyed <hi>Moſes.</hi> And ſo in the 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.2, 3, 21, 22, 23. When <hi>Ioſiah</hi> reſtored the Church of God; Firſt, hee cauſed the words of the booke of the Couenant to be reade to the people in the ſecond verſe, ſo there was the Word: and in the 21. verſe, there the King reſtored the Paſſeouer, ſo there is the Sacrament: and in the third verſe, there is their obedience, for the King made a Couenant with the Lord, and all the people ſtood to it: And thus likewiſe it was in the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> as you may read Chap. 7.8. And alſo in the time of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Chap. 8. &amp; 9. they reſtored the Word and Sacraments, and made a Couenant with God, wherein they profeſſed their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and ſo were reſtored to bee a true viſible Church. So then theſe muſt needs be the principall markes and notes
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16091:113"/>
whereby a true viſible Church is diſcerned, becauſe they are not onely in the inſtituting of a true viſible Church, but alſo in the renewing and reſtoring of it, when it is corrupted. It is in this caſe as with a Campe in the field, who as they are gathered at the firſt to their Colours and Banners,<note place="margin">Non ſecùs ac belli duces, vt diſſipatum clade aliqua exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum recolligant, ſigna militaria, vel accenſos ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ex edito loce conſpiciendos proponunt, quo pedem referant quotquot ex cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de diſperſis, &amp; palantes vagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Morn. de eccleſ. p. <hi>27.</hi>
               </note> ſo likewiſe if the Campe bee put to flight by the enemy, the Generall hangs out and diſplaies his Colours and Enſignes, that ſo they that are ſcattered may gather to them againe, and that ſo they may bee a Campe as before: So it is with Gods Church, when it is put to the worſt, when it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and polluted, hee diſplayes the Enſignes and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his Word and Sacraments, that ſo whoſoeuer is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away, may enter into Couenant againe, and become a member of the true viſible Church, and fight vnder Gods Banner as well as hee did before. Thus wee ſee how it was in the former Teſtament, that theſe were the true marks of a true viſible Church; and ſo it is alſo in the new Teſtament: I will giue you a patterne or example onely in two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and by them you may eſteeme of al the reſt. The firſt is the Church of Ieruſalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.14, 41, 42. In the fourteenth verſe, it is ſaid <hi>Peter lifted vp his voice,</hi> &amp;c. there is the word preached: and in verſe 41. there is the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, they that gladly receiued his Word were baptized; and in verſe 42. there is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper vnder the name of breaking of bread: and there is alſo their profeſſion of obedience, for they continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread and prayer; and ſo there was a true viſible Church. The ſecond patterne is the Church of Corinth, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.13. there was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; and in the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.23. There was the Lords Supper, and Chap. 15.1. there was the Word preached, and alſo their obedience; for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preacht vnto them the Goſpell which they receiued and continued in. So that theſe are the chiefe and moſt principall markes of a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church. And where theſe are, the Word truely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the Sacraments rightly adminiſtred, and profeſſion of obedience to that which they doe both require, there is a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16091:114"/>
true viſible Church of God: The ancient Fathers doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this in effect; for they ſay, that the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the Sacraments adminiſtred, are the chiefeſt markes of a true viſible Church: <note place="margin">Morney <hi>

But you will ſay, how can the ſame things be the cauſes and definition, and alſo the ſignes and markes too? Yes very well: As for inſtance, the Sunne-ſhine is the cauſe and definition, as alſo the infallible marke and ſigne of the Day: and ſo the Word and Sacraments, being the cauſes and definition of a true viſible Church, muſt needes alſo bee the cleareſt and moſt infallible ſignes and markes of it.</p>

In the firſt planting, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. and in the continuing, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 42. and in the reſtoring, as <hi>Ioſhua's</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah's</hi> times, &amp;c. as we have ſhewed before.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, where there is good wheat ſowen and thriues,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16091:114"/>
and comes up in the blade, is not that a field of wheat? So likewiſe where the Word is preached, and the Sacraments adminiſtred, and profeſſion of obedience to them both, is not this a true Church? Not that profeſſion onely makes a true Church, but becauſe as I have ſhewed, it cannot be but whereas theſe are, there is ſome that doe ſincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, is not ſhee a right and naturall Mother, that  <label type="milestone">

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label>   It is true, that other Congregations pretend to haue theſe markes, as what Heretikes or Schiſmatikes are there, that will not ſay, they have the Truth and right faith with them: this is the generall claime of them all, the Scriptures are ours, and for us.</p>
            <p>But this is a falſe pretence, for when it comes to the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, it will appeare that it is but their ſaying, not that it is ſo in truth; for either they will refuſe ſome part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: or elſe they will mangle and deprave it, or elſe they will take the Letter for the ſenſe, as the Papiſts doe in the matter of Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>this is my Body;</hi> and other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes that becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire;</hi> therefore they baptize with fire, taking the Letter of the Scripture inſtead of the ſenſe of it. Or elſe they adde ſomthing to the word, as traditions and ſuch like; and ſo though they doe approue, and take it in at the fore-doore, yet they caſt it out at the backdoore; ſo that indeede they haue it not at all, whatſoeuer they pretend: we may ſay truly therefore that they challenge theſe markes; but wee cannot ſay they are theirs, but they ſtill remaine the proper right of Gods true Church. Wee know that the Divels policie and the depth of his ſubtiltie, is to imitate apiſhly, the courſes of God; that thereby hee may deceiue the more cunningly, and therefore hee will counterfeit Gods owne markes and cogniſance; but wee muſt trie the Spirits, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.1. and the proofe will make all cleare, for Sathan can transforme himſelfe into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light, and his Apoſtles can transforme themſelues into the Apoſtles of Chriſt and his Miniſters, as though they were the Miniſters of righteouſneſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. So then though theſe lay claime to theſe markes, and ſay they are theirs, yet they have no right to them, it is but their vaine bragges, their maſter Sathan himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth Scripture, and pretends it is for him, but hee was ſhamefully diſcouered by our Sauiour, for hee left out part

And ſo the harlot, <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.14. ſaid, <hi>I have peace-offerings, this day I have paid my vowes, therefore came I out to meete thee:</hi> ſhe pretends to pray, but her intent was to play the harlot. And ſo <hi>Zidkiah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.24. braggs that hee had the Spirit of Prophecie, when indeede it was a lying Spirit, that was in his mouth. So the Congregations of Heretikes and of Schiſmatikes lay claime to the Word and Sacraments, and ſay they are theirs, when as indeede they are not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they doe either refuſe ſome part of them, or depraue them, or adde vnto them their owne Inuentions.

But ſometimes a Church of God is not in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent eſtate, ſome are but in their beginings newly planted, and ſo cannot haue all at once, but hath euery thing in its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; place: firſt, the Word is tendred to them, then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if they beleeue and ſubmit themſelues and profeſſe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, they are to be made partakers of the Sacraments. Firſt, Baptiſme, and then the Lords Supper; ſo far forth as it is a viſible Church, it hath all theſe marks; theſe Church's are but in their beginnings, and therefore they haue but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of theſe notes and markes. Againe, ſometimes a Church is in a dying and decaying eſtate; either by reaſon of Apoſtacie, or perſecution; if the Church bee in a decaying ſtate by Apoſtacie, what ſhall I ſay to ſuch Churches? I ſay that ſo farre forth as theſe be true viſible Churches, ſo farre forth they retaine theſe markes, if they be but the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a Church, then they haue the remainders of theſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16091:116"/>
markes; if it bee a dying and a decaying Church, then it hath dying and decaying markes: So then, theſe markes muſt be found in all true viſible Churches according to the ſtate of thoſe Churches; if it be a dying Church, then the Word and Sacraments and Obedience are dying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying too; but when it is quite fallen, it ceaſeth to be a true viſible Church, nor hath it theſe markes. And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the time of perſecution, when the Church is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, that there are none left to make open profeſſion of the Faith and Religion of Chriſt, yet ſo long as there are any that publikely ſuffer for the Goſpell, ſo long there is a true Church, though troubled and brought low; for by their ſuffering they profeſſe obedience to the Goſpell: and though they are debarred of the publike vſe of the Word and Sacraments, yet the fruit and effect of them is ſtill viſible, and ſo they haue theſe notes and markes in ſome degree.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Secondly, conſider in what ſtate or ſenſe theſe markes are neceſſarily required in the Church; they ſhould be and ſometimes are in the pureſt and ſoundeſt Churches, in an high and excellent degree. There is the true Word without tradition, the true Sacraments, none but thoſe that Chriſt inſtituted; true obedience without reſiſtance to any part of the knowne Will of God: and anſwerably this true Word, muſt bee truely and ſoundly preecht; theſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments onely ſo adminiſtred, as Chriſt hath commanded without any addition; and this true obedience truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed without any ſiniſter reſpect. And this all Churches are to pray and labour for, and thus it ought to bee in all true viſible Churches; but yet they are generally other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in all viſible Churches, in as much as all are ſubiect to errors and corruptions; but yet ſo long as the true markes are found in any viſible Church, though they bee not ſo rightly and ſincerely carried as they ſhould, the ſame is a true Church, though not ſo pure as ſome others; if they haue the true Word though mixt with ſome errors (ſo they be not ſuch as ouerthrow the foundation) they are a true
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16091:116"/>
Church, though more corrupt. As for example, the Church of Galatia, embraced the true Word, but not truly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; for they taught iuſtification by workes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. and ſome thinke that they were then in the ſtate of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and yet they were a true viſible Church, and are ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2. So ſecondly, for the Sacraments, looke into the Church of Corinth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22. to the end of the Chapter, they had the Lords Supper, but it was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued, and not ſo ſincerely adminiſtred as it ought to haue beene, and yet they were a true Church; and ſo for the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, a materiall point in Religion; there were ſome that denyed it in the Church of Corinth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. and yet they were a true Church.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, for profeſſion of obedience the Church of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.3.1. had a name that ſhe liued but was dead;<note place="margin">Bernard againſt Separat. <hi>122. 123.</hi>
               </note> they were generally in the eſtate of Apoſtacie in that Church, yet becauſe they made profeſſion of obedience, though not ſincerely; and becauſe ſome amongſt them did truly profeſſe, as in the 4. ver. therefore it is called a Church: I ſpeake not this to cheriſh any Church in the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they are in; but onely to keepe vs from an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable conceit of ſuch a Church: as not to eſteeme it for a true Church, becauſe the Word is not ſo truely preacht, nor the Sacraments ſo rightly adminiſtred, nor profeſſion of obedience ſo ſincerely yeelded as it ought to be.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they obiect and ſay, that theſe are not more  <label type="milestone">

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they muſt be and are better known than the Church; for ſeeing that onely is a true Church, which profeſſeth the true Faith, as wee haue ſhewed before; therefore wee muſt firſt know which is the true Faith, before wee know which is the true Church; and ſo as they muſt bee more knowne, ſo they muſt bee firſt knowne: I know a viſible Church, as a company of men, not by their faith, but as a Church, by their faith only and their profeſſion of it: As I

               </label>   but not eſſentiall; the Church hath a being, and a wel-being. Diſcipline is a note of the wel-being of the Church, not of the true being of it: for it is no part of the eſſence of the Church; and ſo it is excluded from being a neceſſary marke of a true Church, becauſe it is not eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. I confeſſe, where that Diſcipline wants, that God calls for in his Word, that ſo farre that Church is an imperfect Church, but yet not a falſe Church. As a man ſicke of the Palſey, his ſinewes are weak, his hands tremble, his ioynts are not ſoundly knit together; this is a crazed and diſeaſed man, not a falſe man: So that Church that wants Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, is not well and ſoundly tied together in the ioynts, and ſo is an imperfect Church, not a falſe Church. I ſpeake not this, as I ſaid before, to cheriſh any Church in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, for they are to labour againſt them: but yet let vs iudge charitably; and not ſay, Such a Church is a falſe Church, when indeed it is but a bad Church.</p>

               <note place="margin">Third ſort of aduerſaries to this doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> the Papiſts, and the Markes they alleage, and anſwers to them.</note>Thirdly and laſtly, there are other aduerſaries here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, that obiect againſt this Doctrine, and they are the Papiſts. They obiect and ſay, that theſe markes are not the principall, but others are more required than theſe, and that as better markes. They alleage foure; firſt, Antiquity; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Succeſſion; thirdly, Multitude; laſtly, Vnity or Conſent. Theſe are ſtrange markes of a true Church.</p>
            <p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16091:117"/>
then it would follow, that euery ancient Church were a true Church; and ſo the Church amongſt the Turks ſhould be a true Church, becauſe it is ancient; therefore it is Antiquity of truth, not of place or people. Look what Church main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the ancient Doctrine of truth, that is the true Church: ſo that antiquitie ſeparated from the truth, is no note of a true viſible Church. <hi>Caine</hi> and Satan were anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet no true Church: but ioyne this note with the Truth, <hi>The true Word preach'd</hi> (which is one of our notes) and then it is a true marke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for Succeſſion. What ſucceſſion of Biſhops, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  or of men that ſit in one Chaire?

               </gap>f with the word, then ſtill they run vpon our notes and markes of the Church: for wee ſay, that Succeſſion of true and ſound Doctrine is a ſpecial Note of the Church. Succeſſion of it ſelfe is no Note; it is as if a man ſhould ſay, This is my Horſe, becauſe this is my Bridle: as if his Bridle would not ſerue any other Horſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for multitude, they make that a Note of the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  Church; but it is quite contrary: for generally the true Church is the feweſt in number, and for the moſt part, the greater number are the worſt; and by this Rule in Chriſts time, the Scribes and Phariſes, and Iewes were the true Church, and Chriſt and his Apoſtles muſt be Heretikes.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, for vnitie and conſent, that is no Note, vnleſſe it  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  be vnity and conſent in the faith and ſauing truth of God; ſo that ſtill all their Notes runne vpon this maine point, of Faith and ſauing Truth, which is our Note. For how doth the Church of Rome know her ſelfe to be a true Church? Surely by the Word, whereby they proue, that ſhee was once a true Church, that is the ground of all. So that their Notes of Antiquitie, Succeſſion, Multitude, and Vnitie or Conſent, came in but to ſecond that, prouing by theſe, that therefore ſhe is ſo ſtill, becauſe by the Word it is proved; firſt, that ſhe hath been a true Church, and ſo that ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre: doe they not labour by all might and maine to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16091:118"/>
proue it by the Word? that ſo their Church may be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be Catholike: ſo that ſtill they iuſtifie their Church by the Word as well as they can, as that being indeed the onely witneſſe to iuſtifie any Church by. Alſo, if an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ariſe, how doe they diſproue it, but by the Word prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally? So that ſtill the Word by their owne practice (whatſoeuer for a ſhift, and for contention-ſake they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) is the beſt and trueſt witneſſe, of a true or a falſe, of a Catholike or Hereticall Church; yea, they themſelues put theſe very things into the definition of a true viſible Church (that is,<note place="margin">Bellar. de eccleſ. mili. p. <hi>184. 188.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Firſt, the harmes and euils that haue been raiſed in the Church of God occaſionally by Church-gouernment.</note>Wee will beginne therefore with the firſt point; The harmes and euils that haue been raiſed vp in Gods Church hereby. Infinite are the euils which this matter of Church-Gouernment hath occaſionally bred, and brought forth in the Church of God; I ſay, occaſionally, not of it ſelfe; for the thing in its owne nature is holy and good, and therefore naturally can yeeld no ſuch bad fruits, but occaſionally as being abuſed by the malice of Satan, and the corruption of mans heart, hence it is that it brings forth ſuch bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>The fault is partly in the Gouernours, and partly in the gouerned. Firſt, the Gouernors; ſometimes when they bee proud and hauty, contemning their inferiours, ſtriuing with equals, aſpiring to the higheſt places, as is euident in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall gouernment. And ſome tokens of bad Gouernours the Scriptures giue vs, as Couetous, giuen to filthy Lucre; abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their places and Authority to their owne priuate gaine; negligent and careleſſe, like <hi>Gallio</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no conſcience of the faithfull execution of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there are faults in thoſe that are Gouerned; ſome ambitiouſly ſeeking for higher places, than they are fit for; ſome are enuious, maligning and ſpiting their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; ſome are ſenſuall, deſpiſing Gouernment; ſome are

ill-tongued, ſpeaking euill of thoſe in Authority; ſome are obſtinate and rebellious, reſiſting their orders and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and will not endure their necke vnder any yoke.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſome are humourous and peeuiſh, denying that power ſet ouer them to bee lawfull, labouring for innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and changes, and new platformes of gouernment of their owne deuiſing: contrary to that already eſtabliſhed. Theſe and the like Aduantages hath the enemy from time to time wrought vpon, therby to diſgrace Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to make it the greateſt trouble-ſtate in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world.

In a word; what diſhonour hath hereby beene done to God? What diſgrace to Religion? What hinderance to the proſperous ſucceſſe of the Goſpell, and of the Kingdom of Chriſt? What furtherance and aduantage to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Satan? What heart-burning hath it bred amongſt ſome?

And the onely Lawes it is to be gouerned by, is the preſence, power and direction of the Spirit: but here we vnderſtand it of a particular viſible Church, whether it be Parochiall, Nationall, or Prouinciall: for theſe being confined, and bounded within their ſeuerall places, may, and muſt haue their ſeuerall Lawes and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, euery one for and within it ſelfe: of this Church it is that we here ſpeake of, whether it be greater or leſſe. Now we come to the next word <hi>Gouernment,</hi> which word in a generall ſenſe ſignifies to <hi>maintaine;</hi> ſecondly, in particular to <hi>gouerne.</hi> Firſt, in generall, in reſpect of the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as wee are men, ſo the Lord gouernes, that is, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and preſerues his Church, ſeating euery particular Church in the place where it is, making a Fence about it, feeding and clothing them, ſupplying their wants, affording them helpes and meanes for their reliefe, defending them from their enemies, deliuering them from dangers, cauſing them to thriue and proſper in outward things, and couering them with his fauour as with a ſhield. And this kind of Gouernment the Lord extends ouer the whole world, yea, euen to the wicked, as well as to the faithfull; yet with this difference: to the wicked in the common fauour of his prouidence; to the faithfull in the ſpeciall fauour of his Grace in Chriſt: for euen in the very temporall bleſſings that the faithfull haue in this life, they are theirs by Grace and promiſe in Chriſt. And therefore, to the wicked they periſh in the inioying of them, they haue no further benefit of them but outward and temporall; to the faithfull they are helpefull and ſeruiceable in ſome degree, to the worke of their eternall ſaluation: for ſo God intends them, and ſo the faithfull accept and vſe them. This is for the generall Gouernment of God, in reſpect of the ſtate of nature, as we
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:16091:121"/>
are men. Secondly, there is a particular Gouernment in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the eſtate of Grace, as we are men profeſſing the ſauing Faith of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo the Gouernment is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, inward and outward. Firſt, inward; and this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Spirit of Chriſt, God onely ruling in the hearts of his choſen, as a King by the power of his Word and Spirit, conuerting them from the ſeruice of ſinne to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, cauſing them to beleeue Gods promiſes in Chriſt, and ſo iuſtifying vs from our ſinnes, crucifying the old man, and quickning the new, acquainting vs with his will, and framing vs to obedience, putting good motions from time to time into our minds, and ſtirring vs vp, and enabling vs to entertaine them graciouſly, and to giue place vnto them, and ſo ſanctifying vs: and further he aſſures vs of Gods loue and fauour, and our election in Chriſt, and ſo comforts vs: further, he increaſeth theſe and other Graces in vs euery day more and more, ſo long as wee are in this world, till at length they bee fully perfected in vs, and wee receiued into his Kingdome of glory in heauen, and ſo hee glorifies vs. This, this is the right Kingdome of God, and of Chriſt, whereby God raignes in vs, as King here, and makes vs to raigne as Kings with him for euer hereafter. This is the inward Gouernment. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the outward Gouernment, that is, the power and direction that God hath put ouer to the ſonnes of men, for the well gouerning of the Church, whereby there muſt bee firſt ſufficient and painefull Miniſters to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the people in the wayes of ſaluation, teaching them Repentance towards God, and Faith in Ieſus Chriſt; and ſecondly, there muſt bee others that are holy and religious men, choſen for their Aſſiſtants, for the diſpatch of ſuch Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall buſineſſe, as they may bee helpefull in. And thirdly, there muſt be certaine godly and Chriſtian Lawes and cuſtomes eſtabliſhed amongſt them by the common conſent of the Church, for the maintaining of peace and order in the Church, for the puniſhment of ſin and ſinners, and for the encouragement of well-doers, and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16091:121"/>
execution of all ſuch ordinances, as the Lord in this caſe hath prouided to bee done in his Church. And this is the Gouernment which we here meane, and which wee ſeeke after, that is, the power and direction, and adminiſtration that God hath committed to his Church, ſpecially to the Miniſters and ouerſeers thereof, to ſee that the whole body be well ordered, and that euery member carry themſelues godly and religiouſly, both in priuate, eſpecially in publike both towards God and the World.</p>
            <p>In the third place wee are to ſpeake of the neceſſity of Church-gouernment,<note place="margin">The third thing conſiderable in Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz</hi> how needfull it is.</note> how needfull and neceſſary it is in the Church for the good thereof. For the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Point wee muſt know, that there is a twofold neceſſitie; one abſolute, the other conditionall. Abſolute, that is, when one thing is ſo neceſſarily required to another, as that it cannot be without it. Secondly, there is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is not abſolute, but conditionall; that is, when one thing is ſo neceſſary to another, as that it cannot well bee without it: of this latter ſort, the neceſſity of this Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church of God is: for the Church may bee without it in ſome kind of being, but it cannot haue her well-being except this concurre. The Point lyes fit to bee handled by way of Obſeruation, and therefore ſo I will deliuer it.</p>
            <p>The Obſeruation is this, namely;  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
               </label>  That there is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily required an outward forme of Gouernment in the Church of God, to bee exerciſed and adminiſtred by men. All the former part of the Obſeruation, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, Church, and gouernment haue beene before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; onely the laſt words, adminiſtration by men, needes ſome opening. I ſay, it muſt bee adminiſtred by men: I doe not ſay, It muſt bee deuiſed of men: for it muſt be of Gods owne ordaining; either in particular, or at leaſt in generall; and it muſt bee adminiſtred, that is, men, as Miniſters, and Inſtruments muſt put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that which God hath ordained. And what men muſt theſe bee? Surely they muſt bee members of the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16091:122"/>
For firſt, theſe men muſt not bee ſuch as are of no Church; for what haue wee to doe with them that are without, or they with vs? Nor ſecondly, it muſt not bee done by them that are members of another Church; for what hath one Church to doe to meddle with anothers Gouernment, except it bee by aduice; or in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or in ſuch cauſes as concerne diuers Churches; but they muſt bee members of the ſame Church. Theſe are the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that may, and muſt Adminiſter this Gouernment: ſo that wee ſee, the Note ſtands vpright, namely, that of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there is to bee required an outward forme of Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Gods Church, to be exerciſed and adminiſtred by men. For the proofe of this point, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4, 5, &amp;c. The Apoſtle compares the Church to a body, and Profeſſors to parts and members of that body; <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>euery member hath not the ſame office;</hi> no, for that were ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and would breed confuſion: but ſeuerall members are tyed to ſeuerall offices, for the good of the whole body. Now there the Apoſtle ſpeakes of outward gouernment in the Church, as verſe 5, &amp;c. and there muſt bee ſundry Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Officers to exerciſe that Gouernment, and who ſhould theſe bee, but the members of the ſame body? In the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. from the 12. to the 21. verſe, there the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle preſſeth the ſame compariſon further, and growes to more particulars, calling one the eye, another the foote, the hand, the head, &amp;c. of purpoſe to ſhew, that as in the body and the parts thereof it is ſo ordered, that ſome are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, others to be gouerned: ſo it is in the Church, ſome muſt gouerne, others muſt be gouerned; and ſtill vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of outward Gouernment in the Church: and that they that gouerne, muſt bee mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Church, for ſo the compariſon holds, they muſt bee members of the ſame body. And this the Apoſtle doth ſet downe generally for a rule, in the firſt Epiſtle of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 14. verſ. 40. <hi>Let all things be done decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by order:</hi> where wee ſee, that the Apoſtle expreſly commandeth order in the Church, that is Gouernment: for
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16091:122"/>
it is all one for things to be well ordered, or well gouerned; and it is intended of outward buſineſſes in the Church, as verſe 26. Where the Apoſtle ſpeakes of their comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and it is a Charge, <hi>Let all things, &amp;c.</hi> there is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, and all is impoſed vpon men, as we ſee in the 26 verſe; <hi>Brethren, when yee come together, &amp;c.</hi> yee that are members of the ſame Church. And according to this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Rule, ſo the Apoſtles carry themſelues; the Apoſtle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14, 15. ſaith, <hi>Theſe things write I vnto thee, that thou mayſt know how to behaue thy ſelfe in the houſe of God.</hi> Now that which hee wrote to him of was, partly of outward Gouernement, as verſe 1. and forward, where he ſpeakes of the Office of a Biſhop; and the words in the fifteenth verſe ſhew it plainely; hee writes to him that hee may know how to behaue himſelfe in the houſe of God; that is, in the Church of God. But you will ſay, hee was but a particular man, and therefore what doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the whole Church? I anſwer, Though it were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten particularly to him, yet hee being the chiefe ouer-ſeer in that Church, it conſequently concernes the whole Church. And this was ſo neceſſary, that hee would not reſpite it till his comming, though hee were to come ſhortly, but for the more ſuretie hee wrote before-hand, that ſo the Church might not bee deſtitute of ſo materiall an ornament, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Gouernment is: And he charges <hi>Timothy</hi> moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely in Chap. 5. verſ. 21. and in Chap. 6. verſ. 13. and 14. <hi>that the ſame be duly obſerued.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. there the Apoſtle writing to <hi>Titus,</hi> that was Biſhop of the Church of Creta; ſaith; <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Creta, that thou ſhouldeſt continue to redreſſe the things that are amiſſe, and that thou ſhouldeſt ordaine Elders in euery Citie, &amp;c.</hi> There by name are two principall parts of outward Gouernment ſet downe, redreſſing things that are amiſſe, and ordaining elders. And theſe are impoſed vpon <hi>Titus</hi> being Biſhop of that Church, and that of neceſſity; for he was left there for this very cauſe. And in the ſecond and third Chapters of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> there are directions ſent from heauen to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16091:123"/>
of the ſeuen Churches, and that for many things that did concerne euen the outward, as well as the inward Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Churches. If wee looke into the eſtate of the Church from time to time, we ſhall ſee that the practice was anſwerable, that ſtill of neceſſitie there was outward Gouernment in the Church. Our Sauiour while hee was vpon earth among his Diſciples, how orderly did hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them? When any thing was amiſſe amongſt them, how quietly did hee order it? How orderly did hee ſend them out to preach? How carefully did he giue them Rules for the outward Gouernment of the Church for the time to come? So the Church after Chriſts aſcenſion, how well was it ordered and gouerned? As wee may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.13, 14. Where it is ſaid, that the Apoſtles <hi>continued with one accord, in prayers and ſupplications with the women, and Mary the mother of Ieſus, and his Brethren.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Apoſtles Doctrine and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayer.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2, 3, &amp;c. When that matter of difference aroſe concerning the poore, how wiſely did they order it? and choſe out men from amongſt them fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, for the performance of this buſineſſe. So here we ſee how well the Church was ordered and gouerned after our Sauiours Aſcenſion. See it further <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2. and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; when there aroſe diſſention in the Church about Circumciſion, what did they doe? <hi>They called the Apoſtles and Elders together,</hi> and ſo they ordered what ſhould bee done in that buſineſſe: ſo here wee ſee is outward Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtill. And ſo <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. the Apoſtle writes to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Deacons of that Church, that is, to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of it. So that we ſee, that of neceſſity there is required an outward Gouernment in the Church of God to bee adminiſtred by men. And ſo much for the proofe of the point.</p>

               <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33. The Apoſtle giues all the Churches of the Saints for inſtance in this point, that God is the Author of peace in all them; as hee commanding it, and they obeying. Now what peace can there bee, or how can it be maintained, but by Gouernment? therefore whereſoeuer there is a Church of Saints, there muſt of neceſſity bee Gouernment. Againe ſecondly, <hi>Holineſſe becomes Gods Houſe for euer,</hi> ſaith the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2:"/>  Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.5 but without Gouernment there can be no Holineſſe, at leaſt in the outward man; and therefore of neceſſity outward Gouernement muſt bee in the Church.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of Reaſons are drawne by compariſon from other Aſſemblies;<note place="margin">Second ſort of Reaſons.</note> what Company is there without Gouernment?

I do not ſay, as the Papiſts doe, that one Angell is aboue another in degree, but in order at leaſt; Chriſt is the Head and gouernour of them all, and that perſonally: ſo there is a Gouernment in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And as it is in heauen, ſo it is in earth; What Company or Corporation either in the City or Kingdome, is, or can conſiſt without Gouernment? And is not the Church the Company of Gods Saints (ſo they are called, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89.7.) and can that be without Gouernment? So in an houſe there can be no peace, nor liuing together in it without Gouernment. The Church is the Houſe of God, the City of God, the Kingdome of his owne Sonne; and therefore there muſt be of neceſſity an outward gouernment in it exerciſed by men: yea, Hell it ſelfe, though it bee the place of all diſorder and confuſion, yet they haue ſome Gouernment amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, elſe their kingdome cannot ſtand.</p>

Wee are called to liberty, ſay they, Ieſus Chriſt hath ſet vs free, and therefore we need no Gouernours. It is true, wee are called to liberty, but wee muſt not vſe our liberty as a cloake to our ſinnes. What liberty and freedome is it that wee haue? Is it not from ſin and Satan, and the curſe of the Law? It is not a ſtate of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in reſpect of the outward man, but in reſpect of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16091:124"/>
inward man: for the beſt liberty the outward man can haue, is, when it is made conformable to the ordinances of God, and ſuch wholeſome Lawes as by his direction are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; we are free indeed from ſinne that it ſhould not raigne ouer vs, and we are free from Satan that he cannot condemne vs, and we haue a freedome from the Law, that wee are not ſubiect to the curſe of it: but yet we are ſtill bound to doe that which the Law commands, and ſo to obey our Gouernours, and to ſubmit our ſelues to outward Gouernment, onely we are free from them in our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that they ſhould not be Lords ouer that. Yea, but ſay they, wee are a Law vnto our ſelues, wee need not any Rulers. A proud allegation from a preſumptuous ſpirit, who is there amongſt vs that hath made any triall of his heart for obedience to God, but is guilty to himſelfe that he is dull and backward, and needs reproofes, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and cenſures, and all too little to keepe him within the compaſſe of obedience; the humble ſoule feeles ſuch a rebelliouſneſſe within it ſelfe, that it cryes out not to God onely, but to man too; <hi>O, I am a miſerable ſinner!</hi> I pray yee looke to mee, watch ouer me, reprooue me, exhort me, cenſure me, terrifie me with ſhame and puniſhment for my ſinnes: for my rebellious heart muſt be ſo bridled, or elſe it will breake forth outragiouſly into ſinne. Wee know what the Apoſtle ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>That he was ſold vnder ſinne.</hi> Therefore this comes from a proud ſpirit in them to ſay, they haue no need of Gouernment, becauſe they are a law vnto themſelues. We ſee the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that it breeds in particular men; what would the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience be to the whole body, if it were ſuffered in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall? ſurely much more: as it was with the Iſraelites when there was no King in Iſrael; ſo would it be in the Church, if there were no outward Gouernment, euery man would doe what he lift.</p>

And had this been the mind of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, they would neuer haue taken ſuch preciſe order for it in euery Church.

I find that the Church can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be long nor well without Gouernment, but yet it may be ſometimes without it, and yet bee a true Church. It is true of the inward Gouernment, for where that is not, it is not poſſible that the Church ſhould haue any being at all, but it is not ſo of the outward. Therefore we muſt rightly diſtinguiſh betwixt the inward and the outward Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Fiue differences betwixt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</note> otherwiſe we ſhall run into many abſurdities.

Thirdly, the inward is peculiar to the faithfull and elect alone, God rules in their hearts and conſciences, iuſtifying and ſanctifying them, and none others; the outward is common to all that profeſſe themſelues to be members, though they be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  Fourthly, the inward is the higheſt and principall, the outward is but a ſeruiceable diſpenſation fitted to the

Fifthly, the inward ſeconds the outward, and  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  makes it effectuall and fruitfull; the outward doth but leade vs by the hand (as it were) to the inward.

Happily it is not knowne to them that doe not obſerue it, and then it is no Rebellion; if it be knowne by them, the ſinne is much the greater, if it bee not obſerued. But yet Chriſt may ſtill exerciſe his Kingdome in the hearts of many members of the Church by his Spirit, though this were wanting. The caſe may ſeeme to bee well paraleld by our outward and inward worſhip in prayer: the outward worſhip is but an appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the inward, for the inward may be true with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the outward. And ſo Diſcipline is rather an appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to Gods Kingdome, than the Kingdome it ſelfe; ſo that we ſee that Gods Church may be without Diſcipline, though it cannot be well nor long without it; where out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Gouernment is wanting, the Church may bee defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue and maimed, yea halfe dead in outward ſhew at leaſt, and yet a true Church ſtill.

Laſtly, I anſwer, they are ſimply neceſſary, as they are the cauſes and gathering of the Church, but not as they are parts of outward gouernment. As <hi>Moſes</hi> his meſſage and gathering of the Iſraelites to the Lord, was one thing, his gouerning of them another. So that the Word and Sacraments muſt be conſidered in both theſe reſpects, and ſo in reſpect of gathering the Church, they are ſimply neceſſary, not in reſpect of gouerning of it. So that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Gouernment is not ſimply neceſſary to the being of the Church, but to the well-being onely.</p>

I doubt not but this is your pure minde in this caſe; you haue heard that there is a Church-gouernment; you haue ſeene alſo how neceſſary it is to the well-being of the whole Church, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof: Now you would caſt about to ſee where it is to bee had, that ſo you may bee made partakers of it. For the ſatisfaction of this your deſire; I will propound it here
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16091:127"/>
by way of queſtion; Whether there be any preſcript forme of Church-gouernment in euerie particular to bee found in the Word? For if it bee found any where, ſurely it muſt be found in the Word. For firſt, it being Gods owne Ordinance as you haue heard, it muſt haue Gods owne warrant; and ordinarily there is no warrant from God but in his Word. Secondly, that which is to bee gouerned, being the Church, the Houſe of the liuing God, it muſt bee faſhioned to his owne mind: for who is to preſcribe Orders for the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Houſe but the Maſter of the houſe? And who ſhall preſcribe Orders for this Houſe, the Church, to bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by, but Ieſus Chriſt the Lord and Maſter of this Houſe. And wee cannot know the mind of the Lord, but by the Spirit of the Lord; and Gods Spirit reueales Gods minde, onely by Gods Word. Therefore wee muſt doe in this caſe, as in all other doubtfull and difficult caſes in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; Flie to the golden Rule, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeake not according to this Word, it is becauſe they haue no light in them.</hi> Gods Word muſt bee conſulted withall, and what that faith, muſt bee embraced: If wee haue not the light of Gods Word in it, we are blind and dumbe, and no light is in vs at all. This Rule of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is ſeconded by our Sauiour himſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, &amp;c. they teſtifie of me;</hi> not onely of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, who or what hee is; but of his minde what hee would haue vs to doe in all our courſes.<note place="margin">What the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, deliuered in two poſitions.</note> Now what the Scripture ſaith, and what order it takes in this kinde, may be truly and plainely deliuered in theſe two Poſitions: Firſt, that the whole ſubſtance of Church-gouernment is ſo ſet downe in Gods Word, as that euery particular Church may receiue inſtruction how to bee gouerned by it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is not any one ſet particular forme of Church-Gouernment ſo ſet downe in the Scripture, that euery Church may receiue inſtruction thereby, how to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in euery particular ceremonie and diſcipline. Theſe two poſitions being well vnderſtood doe teach vs all things needfull to bee knowne in this point. There may ſeeme to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16091:127"/>
bee ſome contradiction betwixt them; the one affirming, that there is a forme of Church Gouernment ſet downe in the Word; the other denying it. But this is onely in ſhew a Contradiction, and is eaſily reconciled by this diſtinction: It is one thing to ſpeake of the generall, another thing to ſpeake of the particular. The affirmatiue Poſition ſaith; That it is wholly ſet downe there in the generall, and partly in the particular. The negatiue ſaith; It is not there wholy in euery particular. Theſe Poſitions I purpoſe to deliuer by way of Obſeruation, that ſo I may ſpeake the more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vpon them,<note place="margin">The firſt drawn into an Obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and that they may bee the fitter for your vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>I will beginne with the firſt; which is this; namely, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>1</label>  That the whole ſubſtance of Church-Gouerment is ſo ſet downe in Scripture; that euerie particular Church may receiue inſtruction and direction thereby, how they ought to bee gouerned. This Doctrine I doubt not, but it is the certaine Truth of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, and doe whatſoeuer I haue commanded you.</hi> Firſt, wee muſt here preſuppoſe the neceſſity of Church-gouernment, as I haue taught before: and ſecondly, that it is Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, as I haue alſo before ſhewed; and then it muſt needes follow, that Chriſt gaue it in charge to his Apoſtles, and ſo they taught it, and that not by preaching onely, but by writing too: For what they preached, they writ the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it; ſo that euen in their writings at leaſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this buſineſſe is contained: and this is the more likely, becauſe about that very time, that is, ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Aſcenſion, hee ſpake vnto them of the things which appertaine to the Kingdome of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.3. which if we vnderſtand not of the ſubſtance of Gods Kingdome, which is inward in the hearts of his Children; but of the appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of it, as it ſeemes to bee, then it cannot bee fitter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, than to this matter of Church-Gouernment: For what doth more neerely and properly appertaine, or is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to that Kingdome than this? Now the Apoſtles muſt teach all that Chriſt taught them; but Chriſt taught
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16091:128"/>
them this; therefore they muſt teach it too; and that not by preaching onely, but by writing too: for what they preacht, they writ the ſubſtance of it; therefore there is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient matter to bee found in Scripture, to direct euery Church in the ſubſtance of Church-gouernment. Let vs come ſomewhat neerer to the point: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. It is there ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt did therefore giue ſome to be Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Euangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors, and Teachers for the repairing of the Saints, and for the worke of the Miniſtry, and for the edification of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Whereby it is plaine, that by thoſe which Chriſt ſo gaue to be Apoſtles, &amp;c. there is ſufficient direction left, for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the whole body. Now Gouernment is one ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes for edification, yea, and for the gathering of the Saints, and for the worke of the Miniſtry; and therefore that is not vntaught by them, and ſo conſequently not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written at leaſt for the ſubſtance of it. Ad to this that which the Apoſtle hath in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5, 9. eſpecially in verſ. 28. and then it will appeare to be cleere enough; where the Apoſtle tels vs of adminiſtrations and gifts, &amp; ſo comes to thoſe that are endued with thoſe gifts, and that are to exerciſe them, whereof though ſome be temporall, yet others are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: Which if wee adde to that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. then here is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient prouiſion ordained of God, and ſet downe in his Word for euery Church to bee directed by, for ſubſtance of Gouernors, and Gouernment. And conſider that this is not ſpoken of the Corinths onely, but of the Church in generall; <hi>God hath ordained ſome in his Church, &amp;c.</hi> that thereby it might bee plaine, that it is appliable to euery particular Church. The like place is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. where the Apoſtle ſpeakes of Offices in the Church, and of them that vſe them. Theſe places then laid together, proue the point. Let vs come to examples of Churches in Scripture, to proue the point further. Wee haue examples of this in two Churches in Scripture, that were beſt prouided for in this kinde, and that is in the Churches of Corinth and of Epheſus. Take the Church of Corinth for an example, and ſee how ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16091:128"/>
it was prouided for in this kinde; and that in moſt particulars: for they had the Word, and the Lords Supper, Sects and Offenders were puniſhed, yea, and generally they haue Rules giuen them for the whole Carriage of Gods worſhip, as in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Conſider what Rules of edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Order hee there preſcribes, and extends them to all Churches in their kinde; and ſay then whether all Churches bee not ſufficiently prouided for in the generall, for this matter of Church-gouernment. See this alſo in the Church of Epheſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 20, 28 Conſider the Charge there giuen to all the Ouerſeers of that Church, that <hi>they ſhould feede the flocke, &amp;c.</hi> that is, gouerne them, as well as teach them. Conſider the manifold inſtructions hee giues them there, how they ſhould carry themſelues; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſider the particulars he chargeth <hi>Timothy</hi> withall in both his Epiſtles, for the Gouernment of the Church and ſay, if this Church were not ſufficiently prouided for in this kinde. If you yet doubt of it, beleeue the Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.20. where the Apoſtle ſaith, that hee had kept nothing back from them, that was profitable: ſo that if Church-Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bee profitable for them (as ſurely it is very neceſſary) then for the ſubſtance of it they were ſufficiently inſtructed. And ſo it will follow, that all other Churches muſt bee ſo too, either more or leſſe, though happily not in that degree of perfection as theſe were. And ſo much for the proofe of the point.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of it are theſe Firſt, it is ſo in matters of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label>  both for duties of life, and for matters of faith; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the whole ſubſtance of it, is ſo ſet downe in Gods Word, that euery particular man may receiue Inſtruction thereby how to carrie, and how to gouerne himſelfe. If this bee ſo for a particular Chriſtian in matters of faith and practice: then this being a matter partly of faith, but more of practice, and being for the good of the whole body of a Church, therefore the ſubſtance of it muſt needs bee ſet downe in Gods Word.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it was ſo in the Iewiſh Church in the former  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> 
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:16091:129"/>
Teſtament; God ſet down the matter of Church-Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very preciſely for the ſubſtance of it, and that in moſt particulars; and therefore he doth ſo with the Church in the latter Teſtament: for muſt not the Church now bee as well prouided as then; ſurely it muſt in matters of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label>  Thirdly, Chriſts care of his Church proues it. It is not credible that hee ſo tenderly louing her welfare, and ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly prouiding euery thing elſe for her, that hee would faile her in this, leaue her without Gouernment, at leaſt for the ſubſtance of it. It is not credible but that Chriſt being the Sonne, would bee more faithfull in Gods Houſe, than <hi>Moſes</hi> being but a Seruant, as the Apoſtle makes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. Or ſhall wee beleeue, that Chriſt was not ſo carefull of the whole Church, as <hi>Paul</hi> was of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? But <hi>Paul</hi> wrote ſufficiently to <hi>Timothy,</hi> how hee was to gouerne and to behaue himſelfe in that Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. therefore Chriſt being more faithfull than <hi>Moſes;</hi> and more carefull of the whole Church, than <hi>Paul</hi> was of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, muſt needes leaue ſufficient direction in Scripture how euery Church ought to be gouerned, at leaſt for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>5</label>  The fifth Reaſon is taken from the ſufficiency of the Word, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>For the whole Scripture is giuen by inſpiration from God, and is profitable to teach, to conuince, to correct, and to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe.</hi> But how farre forth is it thus profitable? The Apoſtle ſaith in the 17. verſe, <hi>That the man of God may bee abſolute, being made perfect to all
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16091:129"/>
good workes.</hi> That the man of God may be abſolute; Who is this man of God? Surely <hi>Timothy,</hi> and ſuch as he is, that are in the chiefeſt place for Gouernment in Gods Church; and theſe muſt be perfect to euery good worke; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this worke to gouerne aright. Therefore, if gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bee a good worke, and that the Scriptures make the man of God perfect to euery good worke, then alſo it inſtructeth him, and maketh him perfect in this good worke.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the maine buſineſſe in this matter of Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>6</label>  is ſet downe, and prouided for by name in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; there is the Word, and the preaching of it; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and the adminiſtration of them; Officers and their Duties; and viſiting the ſicke, releeuing the poore, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out the infectious, and ſuch like, as might bee ſhewed by many places of Scripture: yea, if any man can name any other ſubſtantiall part or buſineſſe of Church-Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I dare vndertake to ſhew in the Word, that there is ſome good order at leaſt in generall taken for it. So much for the Reaſons.</p>
            <p>The Vſes are theſe: Firſt, here is a Rule for all Churches  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>  to goe by in their Gouernment; wee muſt follow the Rule and direction of God in his Word; as <hi>Moſes</hi> in building the Tabernacle, was to doe all things according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne which he ſaw in the Mount: ſo muſt they doe euery thing in the Gouernment of the Church, according to the patterne ſet downe in the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Two extremes to be auoided.</note> And here two extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are to be auoided, that ſome haue fallen into; Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  let vs take heed wee goe not too farre as ſome haue done, that haue been exceeding bold and preſumptuous this way, taking vpon them to coine new Lawes, and to deuiſe new Officers, and to erect a whole new forme of Gouernment, and to intrude it vpon the Church. Others there are that pretend to goe no further than Chriſt hath preſcribed in his Word, yet they obtrude more on the Church than euer he meant, though not of their owne heads, as they ſay, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of his owne Ordinance. Others make that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16091:130"/>
perpetuall, which is but temporall, as the workes of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, &amp;c. theſe things haue been the occaſion of much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe in the Church of God; and therefore howſoeuer the intent of theſe may be good, yet the euent is naught; as if the euent of them be at any time good, yet the practice of them is foule and naught: for hereby they accuſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of inſufficiency, and Chriſt himſelfe of neglect, that hee did not, or of want of wiſdome, as if he could not prouide ſufficiently for his Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as we muſt not goe too farre, ſo we muſt take heed that wee come not too ſhort; for that is as great a ſin to leaue out any thing that God hath preſcribed, as to adde any thing thereto; to decline from Gods Word either to the right hand or to the left, is alike ſinfull; to charge Chriſt with ſuperfluitie as well as with defect, are alike euill. Thus they erre that make thoſe Offices, or Officers temporall, which Chriſt hath made perpetuall to endure to the worlds end: For this is to charge Chriſt with ſuperfluitie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt and ſafeſt courſe in this buſineſſe is to do thus: The whole body of a Church, both Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and people are to conſult with Gods Word, and to intreate God by prayer to open the Scriptures to them, and to open their vnderſtandings, that they may ſee what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them therein in this caſe, and that they are to embrace, and not wilfully either to take or refuſe any thing, but with ſubmiſſion to receiue better aduice, if God ſend it them; and accordingly they are to proceed, as in Chriſts ſtead, and as if himſelfe were perſonally preſent to direct them what is to be done in this caſe.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>  The ſecond Vſe, is to teach vs Obedience to Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: for ſeeing it is Gods ordinance, it muſt be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and obeyed, and yeelded to; elſe if wee reſiſt it, we reſiſt God, becauſe we reſiſt Gods Ordinance; this is ſpecially to be preſt in our Church for the Chriſtian Magiſtrates ſake, who hath ratified ſuch a Gouernment amongſt vs; for his ſake we muſt yeeld, yet alwayes in the Lord: the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is free from being ſubiect to men.

I anſwer: Firſt, that though euery particular in that Gouernment cannot bee maintained by Gods Word, yet in the generall it may bee ſoundly maintained. Secondly, I ſay, that except thou canſt diſproue it, on very good ground out of the word, thou muſt take it on their words that impoſe it, and thou muſt obey it till thou bee better reſolued. For this is the Rule concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning outward Gouernment in the Church, when it is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Magiſtrate, it is not left free to vs, either to obey or not to obey; but wee muſt obey, vnleſſe we haue a good warrant out of Gods Word againſt it. But what if I doubt, muſt I yet obey, before I am reſolued? Yes, though thou doubt of it, yet thou muſt obey, except thou canſt bring ſome ſound proofe out of Gods Word againſt it, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or by neceſſary conſequence.</p>

A louing Father will not teach his Childe onely how to liue, but alſo how to liue orderly and healthfully, and how hee may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne himſelfe with grace and credit to the world. So Chriſt prouides not onely for the being of his Church, and for the life of it, but alſo for the health and grace, and well-being of it. A good Shepheard prouides not onely paſture to feed his ſheepe, but hee hath his Crooke too to gouerne them, and keepe them in order. So our chiefe and heauenly Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard furniſhes vs not onely with Doctrine, but alſo with Diſcipline too in a ſufficient manner; he prouides his Word and Sacraments to feede and nouriſh vs, and he hath Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline his Rod, to keepe vs in the right way. Alas, what would haue become of vs, if wee had been left wholly to our ſelues, and to our owne direction; the ſilly ſheepe is not more ready to goe aſtray, and become a prey to the Wolfe and Beare, and Lyon, than wee are ready to runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſnares of ſinne, and by our miſdemeanors to betray
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:16091:131"/>
our ſelues into the hands of Satan, if wee had not the Rod and Staffe of our bleſſed Shepheard, his holy Diſcipline, to guide vs in the right way. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, I know it is not in man to direct his owne ſteps.</hi> We may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply this ſpeech to the Church: It is not in her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe her owne Gouernment: If Chriſt therefore had not prouided for her in this caſe, but had left her to her ſelfe, a thouſand to one ſhe had neuer hit on the right way; or if ſhe had, ſhe could haue had no comfort of conſcience in that caſe, nor hope of bleſſing in the courſe, becauſe ſtill ſhee would haue been vncertaine and doubtfull, whether it were of God or not. Therefore as it is and muſt bee from the Lord, ſo let vs bleſſe and praiſe the Lord our good God, that hath ſo mercifully and plentifully furniſhed vs in this kinde. And ſo much of the affirmatiue point, namely, that the whole ſubſtance of Church-gouernment is ſo ſet downe in Scripture, that euery particular Church may receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and direction thereby, how they ought to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Second thing conſiderable in this fourth point of Church-gouernment, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is not any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar forme of Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for euery particular, ſet downe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note>Now I come to the ſecond point; the negatiue Poſition, namely, That there is not any one particular forme of Church-Gouernment ſet downe in Scripture, that euery particular Church is preciſely bound vnto, to obſerue for ordering euerie particular. This being a negatiue Poſition as you ſee, muſt bee content with negatiue proofes; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the queſtion is, whether there bee ſuch a Gouernment in Scripture for euery particular, or not, and ſeeing the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that there is not; no maruell then though there bee no direct place to confirme it. But you will ſay, that many together will. I ſay, No, many laid all together will not: they that pretend there is ſuch a thing, muſt inſtance in ſome ſuch places in the Word where it is proued; elſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is preſumed to be true. And ſo it followes, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of ſuch allegations, is the direct proofe of the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore for proofe of this negatiue Poſition; Firſt, I ſay, no place of Scripture ſaith, that there is, or preſcribes that there ſhould bee ſuch a particular forme of Church-Gouernment,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16091:131"/>
&amp;c. for euerie part of diſcipline: nay, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places conferred, and laid all together doe not. For mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſubſtance, and in generall, there is proofe enough, as wee heard before in the former point, but not for any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular forme in euery particular, &amp;c. As there is no place that affirmes or preſcribes this particular forme of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: ſo I ſay further, there is no example for it in all the Scripture. There is no queſtion, but that if our Sauiour, or his Apoſtles had intended any ſuch forme of Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bee obſerued in euery particular, either they would haue giuen it in expreſſe charge particularly, or at leaſt there would haue beene ſome notorious patterne of it in ſome Church, but there is no ſuch in Scripture. To inſtance in the beſt Churches, Corinth and Epheſus were the beſt proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for in that caſe; yet theſe had no particular forme of Church-Gouernment, whereunto they were preciſely bound. Firſt, for Corinth, there was more written to that Church for matter of outward Gouernment, than to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church; yea, almoſt as much as to all others; yet it was not prouided for in euery particular, no, not in regard of it ſelfe: in many particulars it was well prouided for, in all it was not by writing, for ſome the Apoſtle reſpited till his preſence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34. <hi>Other things will I ſet in order when I come.</hi> So then the Church of Corinth was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for in euery particular by writing, for her ſelfe, much leſſe was it ſo prouided for, as that euery Church ſhould be directed thereby. But you will ſay, are not the Church-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church of Corinth, the Lords owne Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37. Yes; they are to them of that Church, ſo farre as was directly inioyned them, but not to all Churches elſe: So likewiſe for the Church of Epheſus, though it were then the moſt famous Church in Aſia, and plentifully prouided for that way, yet it was not ſo proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, that euery Church ſhould be directed by it; nay, it was not prouided for in euery particular for it ſelfe. But you will ſay, <hi>are</hi> not particulars profitable? If ſo bee they are, then the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the ouerſeers of that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:16091:132"/>
Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.20. <hi>I haue kept nothing back that was profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you;</hi> and therefore not thoſe particulars? I Anſwer: Surely, particulars are profitable, and therefore this Church had enough in generall, whereby they might frame vnto themſelues ſuch particulars as were needfull for them: but they had not all particulars, this place proues the former Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition well, that the ſubſtance of Church-gouernment is ſet downe in the Word, wholly in the generall, but not in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular, though they had ſome to meaſure the reſt by. Yea (but there is a further matter for Gouernment in the Church of Epheſus, than in any other Church) for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle impoſeth on <hi>Timothy</hi> a charge of perpetuity, as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. <hi>I charge thee in the ſight of God, &amp;c. that thou keepe the Commandement without ſpot, vntill the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> So then that Gouernment which hee chargeth him withall, was to bee perpetuall? I anſwer, firſt, that that Commandement is chiefly, if not onely of faith and holineſſe. Secondly, if it be vnderſtood of Gouernment, yet that was but perſonall to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he ſhould keepe it as much as in him lay; and alſo it was onely for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, and for thoſe particular things there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded (which came farre ſhort of euery particular) that they ſhould perpetually bee there obſerued; this is the charge hee giues <hi>Timothy.</hi> Laſtly, I anſwer; If it bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to euery particular Church, it muſt be vnderſtood of matters of ſubſtance, which as wee haue heard, muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall in all Churches. So that wee ſee there is no proofe for this, nor no example in Scripture, nay, there are exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples againſt it, becauſe wee finde not the ſame Gouernment in all Churches: for ſome wanted that which others had, and ſo (by this rule) one of them ſhould haue ſinned; as in the Church of Philippi, there are onely <hi>Biſhops and Deacons</hi> named. So that wee ſee there is no particular forme of Church-Gouernment for euerie particular ſet downe in the Word, for euery Church preciſely to bee ruled by.</p>

infinite, and ſtill new occaſions ariſing in the Church dayly, which if they were foreſeene, yet they could not bee written, the world could not containe the bookes, as the Euangeliſt ſpeakes, of the Word and workes of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. What ciuill Law was there euer, that the beſt heads haue been layd together to deuiſe, that were ſufficient at the firſt for euery particular, but by new occaſions ſtill increaſed for particular cauſes? Yea, but though men could not, yet God could haue prouided for that? But yet he did not; yea, I ſay further, that the Word of God, though it bee a moſt perfect and abſolute Law of faith and life; yet it preſcribes not for euery particular, what is to bee done; but there are generalls from which, and ſome particulars by which the reſt are to bee drawne and meaſured.

As for Inſtance; it is a decent thing in ſome Churches to weare long haire, in ſome it is not: In ſome Churches it is decent to haue the head couered, when they propheſie, in ſome it is not; therfore where its decent, it may bee done; where it is not decent, it may not be done: ſo that Decency is held ſtill in the generall, though that the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars faile and differ, as farre as the Eaſt is from the Weſt.</p>

How many excellent wits haue euen tyred themſelues out in this buſineſſe?

And ſo likewiſe I profeſſe for matter of Church-gouernment now vnder the new Teſtament, by all my labours and endeauours, and prayers vnto God, I could neuer ſee it in euery particular ſet downe in the Word.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>  The ſecond Vſe is for refutation and reproofe of all ſuch  as pretend their particular Gouernment to bee Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and condemne all others. As firſt, the Papiſts, they alleage this, that their Gouernment is Gods Ordinance: for Chriſt, ſay they, when hee was on earth, minding to erect one vniuerſall head ouer all, as his ſubſtitute, and that all the Churches in the world ſhould be at his becke and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. Firſt, he erected it in <hi>Peter,</hi> and from him it came to the Pope, and ſo it is to contiene for euer; and therefore (ſay they) whoſoeuer is not vnder this head, is no part of Gods Church. But of all oppoſitions to this Obſeruation, this hath the leaſt colour of truth; and theſe oppoſites haue leaſt colour of Scripture for them of all other: for beſides that there is no precept nor example for it in Scripture, they are both moſt directly againſt it. Firſt, for precept, looke in <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.25.26. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles raigne ouer them, &amp;c. but it ſhall not be ſo among you, &amp;c.</hi> there is our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours precept directly againſt it. And ſo for example, looke in <hi>Act.</hi> 15.13. <hi>We ſhall ſee that Iames Biſhop of Ieruſalem,</hi> moderates the matter in queſtion, and giues ſentence in it, which is the Office of a Biſhop, and which <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould haue done, if hee had been head of the whole Church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:16091:134"/>
what meant <hi>Paul</hi> to write to Rome, and to Corinth, and Epheſus, and other Churches, and to preſcribe Orders for them; if <hi>Peter</hi> had been Head, it had been his Office, and he muſt haue performed it; and if he were dead, why did not his Succeſſour doe it? Likewiſe when commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came from heauen for reformation of the ſeuen Churches in Aſia, why were they not reuealed to <hi>Peter;</hi> or he being dead, to the Pope his Succeſſour, but that they muſt be reuealed to <hi>Iohn</hi> in Pathmos; if the Pope had been Head of the Churches, the Epiſtles ſhould haue been ſent by him, or at leaſt by <hi>Iohn</hi> from him. So that they haue no colour for their Gouernment.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this reproues thoſe of the Presbytery that ſay, that their Gouernment and their Rulers which they require are plainely ſet downe in the Word, and is an ordinance of God to endure for euer. Yet this is not ſufficiently furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in euery particular: for firſt, they are not certaine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Office of a Paſtor and Teacher be diuerſe; or if they be ſo, then ſecondly, they know not whether they may not be in one and the ſame perſon: thirdly, whether of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie all theſe muſt bee in euery particular Congregation, ſo that it doth not ſuffice that they bee in ſome parts of the Church where moſt need is. And laſtly, the Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate who hath a chiefe ſtroke in Gouernment, they ſpeake nothing of him; neither doe they interpret any of thoſe places, where the Apoſtle ſpeakes of Rulers, of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrate, though I am verily perſwaded, that it is to bee vnderſtood of them: And therefore they erre in theſe particulars. And ſo wee ſee that there is not any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular forme of Church-gouernment ſet downe in Scripture which euery particular Church is preciſely bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, as preſcribing to it euery particular in Gouernment.</p>

The Reſolution whereof it is to bee fetcht from that which hath been formerly ſpoken. For whereas euery particular Church muſt haue her particular gouernment, and the Word hath not preſcribed any one ſet forme for all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to obſerue in euerie particular, as I haue ſhewed in the ſecond Obſeruation of the former Lecture: Therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular Church, out of their owne power and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and being guided by the generall forme ſet downe in the Scriptures, as oft as neceſſity requires, muſt make the beſt ſupply and prouiſion for themſelues herein that they can: howbeit, becauſe the whole ſubſtance of Church-gouernment is ſet downe in the Word, &amp;c. as I ſhewed in the firſt Obſeruation of the former Lecture; Therefore the Church muſt not be preſumptuous and licentious, as if it were arbitrary, and as if they might ordaine and do what they liſt: But they muſt carefully ſee that whatſoeuer prouiſion they make in this kinde, bee ſuch as may well
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:16091:135"/>
ſtand with thoſe generall rules and directions which the word affords: I take not vpon mee here to define what is preſcribed in Gods word; what not; this is a hard taske, too curious for mee, and too tedious for you; That is left to the enquirie of the particular Churches, euery one for it ſelfe; and the promiſe of the Spirit to leade the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Truth of ſpeciall vſe for this purpoſe, both to inſtruct the Church what is preſcribed, and what is not; as alſo to helpe and direct them what to take, and what to leaue, and how to behaue themſelues in ſuch caſes of Gouernment, wherein they are deſtitute of particular warrant for each particular caſe from the word: yet becauſe I would faine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you throughly of the whole buſineſſe, ſo farre as is needfull to know, I will (God willing) inlarge my diſcourſe farther than I thought to haue done, and labour to rip it vp from the very bottome.</p>

But what then, euery one cannot vnderſtand theſe languages, they may bee in a Nation whoſe language is not the Mother-Tongue; What muſt bee done then? Surely wee muſt get the moſt faithfull and beſt Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are; and when they are got, what muſt the Church ſee to bee done with them? Firſt, ſome of theſe Copies muſt bee laid vp in a ſafe and ſecret place, that if Deſolation ſhould come, yet the written Word may bee preſerued: ſo the booke of the Law, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.14. which was thought to bee written by <hi>Moſes</hi> owne hand, was found in a ſecret
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:16091:136"/>
place, where no doubt it had been laid vp by Gods ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prouidence to bee preſerued from that common hauock which was in the Land; ſo that ſome Copies muſt bee laid vp in ſafe and ſecret places. Yea, but that is not enough, but there muſt bee ſome extant in places of publike and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Aſſemblies, as it may ſeeme to bee in our Sauiours time, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.16, 17. where our Sauiour comming into the Temple, there was a book of the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to him: So that they muſt bee extant in the publike Aſſemblies. And how muſt they bee extant there? Not as dumbe ſhewes, but as the liuely voyce of God to bee read openly; ſo was the caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.27. <hi>The word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were read euery Sabbath Day.</hi> And not onely ſo, but it muſt bee preacht too; that is, conſcionably expounded and applied: So you may read, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15. that there were Lectures of the Law and of the Prophets. And that the Ruler of the Synagogue ſent to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That if they had any word of exhortation, they ſhould ſay on.</hi> And this is our Sauiours charge, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Goe preach the Goſpell to euery Creature.</hi> And ſo it is the Apoſtles charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Preach the Word, bee inſtant, &amp;c.</hi> And this is ſo neceſſary, as that it is the power of God to ſaluation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. we cannot bee ſaued without it. And it is impoſſible wee ſhould beleeue without the preaching of the Word: <hi>How ſhall they beleeue in him of whom they haue not heard? and how ſhall they heare without a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? Rom.</hi> 10.14. And this was the practice both of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles; they preacht the Word. And as the Word muſt bee taught, ſo it muſt bee heard, vnderſtood, and obeyed; therefore our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Bleſſed are they that heare the Word of God and keepe it.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.16. ſaith, <hi>Let the Word of God dwell in you plenteouſly:</hi> hee vſeth a very elegant Speech, as if hee ſhould ſay; Let it not come as a Stranger, to tarry with you for a little while, but let it dwell with you, &amp;c. And as it muſt bee heard and obeyed, ſo it muſt bee dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conferred vpon; that is it which is commended in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:16091:136"/>
the men of Berea, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. that <hi>they ſearched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to try whether the things were ſo that Paul taught them.</hi> So there muſt bee care had for the Word wee ſee. Secondly, there muſt be care had for the Sacraments: firſt, that they be vſed, and none other, which Chriſt inſtituted; and ſecondly, that they bee adminiſtred in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that our Sauiour did adminiſter them; ſo it is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> there is the Sacrament of Baptiſme inioyned; and in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. there is the Lords Supper; and the practice of them appeares in both the Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and by name for the Lords Supper in that firſt Epiſtle <hi>cha.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 25. where the Apoſtle deliuers not onely the ſubſtance of it, but in ſome meaſure the circumſtances of it alſo. Laſtly, the Duty of Prayer, that muſt bee had in the Church, that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt bee publikely made in the Church: we haue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the Apoſtle to it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. <hi>I exhort, that firſt of all Prayers bee made for all men &amp;c.</hi> where hee intends it of publike Prayer, and exhorts to it as to a chiefe duty, <hi>I exhort, that firſt of all prayers bee made, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. And the practice of the Apoſtles is anſwerable to this <hi>Act.</hi> 1.14. after Chriſts aſſenſion, they continued with one accord in prayer, &amp;c. So you ſee how that in well-gouerned Churches, the Word, and Sacraments, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are to bee had and vſed. Wee haue an example for all theſe together, <hi>Act.</hi> 2 41, 42. where it is ſaid, <hi>That they which gladly receiued the Word were baptized, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of Bread and Prayer.</hi> So there was the Word, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Prayer. Here many good and profitable obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations might bee had, but they are here onely handled as by the way, and wee haue handled ſome of them before in the markes and notes of a true viſible Church; and the maine thing in them reſts to bee handled in the inſtances when wee come to them. So much for the firſt point, that the Word and the Sacraments, and Prayer muſt bee had in the Church.</p>

               <note place="margin">The ſecond du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be done. <hi>Vid.</hi> Zegred. <hi>120.</hi>
               </note>The ſecond point is election of Officers from time to time as occaſion requires, this muſt bee had too: for a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bee performed neceſſarily requires an Officer to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. And the Duties being of ſundrie kindes, ſo muſt the Officers bee too that manage them, elſe there would bee diſorder and confuſion; and none muſt intrude or thruſt themſelues into ſuch places of their owne heads, for that were intolerable preſumption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. <hi>No man taketh this honour to himſelfe vnleſſe he be choſen of God as Aaron was:</hi> there is no warrant of Conſcience, either in them that thus intrude to execute ſuch offices, nor in others to obey, nor no hope of bleſſing by either: Therefore there muſt be electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Officers in the Church, that is, there muſt bee a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Aſſignment of ſuch men to ſuch Offices. When a Church is firſt planted, it is one of their firſt Duties, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the election of Officers, as <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>They ordained them Elders in euery Church by election.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5. <hi>Titus</hi> was left in Crete, when the Church was firſt planted, to ordaine Elders in euery City. Againe, as there muſt bee election of Officers when the Church is firſt planted; ſo there muſt be election for the ſupply of Officers, when any are diſplaced, either by death, or for their miſdemeanor, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers muſt bee placed in their roomes by election. And thus did the Apoſtles when <hi>Iudas</hi> was fallen away, they fell to election by lot, for another to ſupply his roome, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.21. Againe, when the Church of God is increaſt, and when by multitude of buſineſſe, thoſe that are Officers haue as much already to doe, as they can turne their hands to, other Officers are to bee added by election. And this was the caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2, 3. <hi>When the multitude of Diſciples grew, there was a murmuring becauſe the widowes of the Grecians were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the dayly miniſtration.</hi> Now the Apoſtles had greater matters in hand, and therefore it was vnmeet for them to tend to it; therefore ſaid they, <hi>Chuſe you out ſeuen men from among you, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo when the people of Iſrael were increaſed, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> knew not what to do, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21, 22. <hi>Iethro</hi> his Father in Law gaue him counſell to
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:16091:137"/>
chuſe other Officers to aſſiſt him, and ſo he did. So that election of Officers is a needfull duty in the Church. Now as this muſt bee done in regard of all Officers, ſo eſpecially there muſt bee election of Miniſters, ſuch as labour in the Word and Doctrine, as they hauing the chiefe buſineſſe to deale in: and their election conſiſts chiefly in two things; Ordination and Aſſignation to ſome particular place.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Ordination, that is an Action whereby men are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated to the worke of the Miniſtery, and whereby they are enabled to doe ſome things, which they could not doe before, as in the power and vſe of the Keyes to binde and looſe; and ſome other things they may doe lawfully now, which they were able to doe before, but not lawfully, as to preach and to adminiſter the Sacraments, &amp;c. theſe depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon lawfull Ordination; ſuch an Ordination we find, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2, 3. where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſeparated to the work of the Miniſtery, but not aſſigned to any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place. And in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. where the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Timothy, Deſpiſe not the gift that is in thee, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee by Prophecy, and the laying on of the hands of the Company of the Presbytery:</hi> where the Apoſtle ſpeakes of his Ordination, before he came to be aſſigned to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place: for as yet he had no certaine Charge till he came to Epheſus, and the Apoſtle ſpeakes as of a thing done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: that is for Ordination.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place we come to the appointment of them to ſome particular place, where they may exerciſe their gifts, and to performe the worke of their Miniſtery, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there is a mutuall reference betwixt the Miniſter, and thoſe whom hee is ſet ouer, hee being their Paſtor, and they being his Flocke. And ſo the Apoſtle left <hi>Titus</hi> in Crete, that he might ordaine Elders in euery City, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. that is, that he might ordaine them, and appoint them in euery Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for both theſe vſually doe, and ſhould goe together, that is Ordination and appointment to ſome particular place, ſpecially amongſt vs, though in the Apoſtles times, there were Miniſters at large: but this is not good amongſt
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16091:138"/>
vs, we haue no ſuch large Commiſſion as the Apoſtles had, but wee muſt haue reference to a certaine people, and to a certaine place. And ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>They ordained Elders by election in euery Church:</hi> there they did ordaine Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and appoint them to a certaine place. And ſurely, whatſoeuer is rightly done in this kind, the Lord himſelfe acknowledgeth for his owne handy worke, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heed to the Flock ouer which the holy Ghoſt hath made you ouerſeers, &amp;c.</hi> I ſpeake all this while of the outward calling onely, for that is in the power of the Church; the inward is meerely, and immediatly from God. The Church is to try and examine the inward too by the proofe of their gifts, and by charging them in the ſight of God to ſpeake the truth herein, whether they find that Gods Spirit hath made them willing and able for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, but to conferre it on them they cannot. So much for the ſecond point, election of Officers.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third ſort of duties to be done.</note>The third point is the duties of charitie and mercy, they are to be done in the Church, next to the duties of pietie to God; the duties of mercy and charitie are moſt carefully to be performed, and to bee prouided for in the Churches of Chriſt. I ſpeake not ſo much of ſpirituall duties of charity, concerning ſpirituall diſtreſſes, as to comfort the wounded conſcience, to beare with the weake, to haue compaſſion on our Brethrens infirmities; but chiefly of outward bodily charity, which concernes the outward ſtate of our Brethren; as firſt, the ſicke muſt be viſited; ſecondly, the dead muſt be bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ied; thirdly, the needy muſt be releeued; fourthly, the Miniſters muſt be maintained. In theſe foure conſiſt all the duties of mercy and charity to be done in the Church. Firſt, the ſicke are to be viſited, the Text is cleare for this in <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.14. <hi>If any man bee ſicke, let them call for the Elders of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> And this muſt not be done for faſhion ſake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ciuill manner, but for conſcience ſake, after a religious and Chriſtian manner wee muſt pray with them and for them for their recouery, and for a ſpeedy and comfortable end; we muſt offer our ſeruice to them for any good office
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16091:138"/>
in that neceſſity; we muſt comfort and incourage them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the terrours and pangs of death; we muſt ſtirre them vp to put their houſe, eſpecially their ſoules in order. Thus we muſt labour euery way to fit them for the time of their diſſolution: thus wee muſt viſit the ſicke. Secondly, the dead are to be buried; this is commended for a good work of mercy by Chriſts owne words, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.6, 8. when the Woman powred the boxe of Oyntment on his head, ſome murmured at it, but our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>She hath wrought a good worke on me, for ſhee is come afore-hand to annoint my Body to the Buriall:</hi> ſo hee approues Buriall for a good worke.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing that Sepulchers and Burials are monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Reſurrection (for that was the firſt and true vſe of them amongſt the faithfull) where ſhould this bee practiſed more than in the Churches of God, where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is moſt and beſt taught and beleeued. Thirdly, the needy are to bee releeued, the naked muſt be clothed, the hungry muſt be fed, &amp;c. and this dutie conſiſts of two branches, collection and diſtribution. Firſt, there muſt bee collection; ſo the Apoſtle inioynes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2. <hi>That euery firſt day of the weeke euerie man muſt put aſide ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the reliefe of the Saints:</hi> then it muſt bee collected and gathered, and ſo much put into the Treaſury, and that was the vſe of the Treaſury in <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.45 to put in that which was collected. Secondly, there muſt be diſtribution, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Hee that diſtributeth, let him doe it with ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie;</hi> and verſ. 13. <hi>diſtributing to the neceſſitie of the Saints. Heb.</hi> 13.16. <hi>to doe good, and to diſtribute forget not, &amp;c.</hi> and this may be done either by their owne hands, or others; and that not to their owne Churches alone, but to others too; if they want and theſe abound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.26. ſo that that which is collected, muſt not be kept, but after col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, there muſt bee diſtribution, and in theſe two offices conſiſts the relieuing of the needy. The fourth duty of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is this, the Miniſters muſt be manifeſted; this is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle meanes in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. where he ſaith, <hi>that hee that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16091:139"/>
rules well is worthy of double honour, ſpecially he that labours in the Word and Doctrine:</hi> where at leaſt double honour is taken for the honour of maintenance; and the Text is cleare for it by that which followes, where he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muſſell the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth forth the Corne:</hi> and this muſt not bee done with a ſparing hand, but as the Apoſtle commands it in <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word, make him that hath taught him partaker of all his goods.</hi> Let him thinke nothing too deare for him. And this is not grounded on the law of loue onely but euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the law of reaſon too: for ſo the Apoſtle in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. ſheweth, that in reaſon if they miniſter to vs ſpirituall things, it is no great matter if they reape our carnall things. It is true, that rather than the Miniſter ſhould be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the Church, he is to labour with his owne hands to ſatisfie his neceſſitie: but yet when there is a competent ſtate in the people, they are to eaſe him of that labor, and of their eſtates to releeue his wants, as the Philippians did by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4.10, 11. where the Apoſtle reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth for the care which they had in miniſtring to him. And ſurely the people loſe nothing by this; for when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are thus prouided for, they giue themſelues wholly to their callings without let, to ſtudy for the good of the people, whereas elſe they bee driuen to prouide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, it will be with them as it was with the Iſraelites vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of the cruell Taskmaſters in Egypt, they muſt be ſeeking ſtraw while they ſhould bee making brick to build withall; they muſt be ſeeking after the pelfe of this world, while they ſhould be building Gods houſe. And they that neglect this duty, are empty of all Religion, both for piety to God whoſe Miniſters they are, and for charitie to themſelues and their brethren, becauſe they do not ſtraine themſelues to relieue the wants of ſuch as by Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance they are moſt bound vnto, and which doe ſpend themſelues and their time for others good and ſaluation. So much of the third point, for duties and workes of mercy and charity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:16091:139"/>The fourth point is the cenſures of the Church,<note place="margin">The fourth ſort of workes to be done.

For ſeeing in all Churches there are ſtill ſome that walke inordinately, ſome courſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity muſt bee taken againſt them, that the Church may bee disburdened, either of their perſons, or of their ſinnes. And hence it is, that our Sauiour himſelfe takes preciſe order for this matter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Apoſtle chargeth this Duty on the Theſſalonians with great authority, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>We warne you brethren in the Name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that you withdraw your ſelues from euery Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that walketh inordinately.</hi> And hee is grieuouſly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Corinthians, that they did not proceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly with all ſeuerity againſt the inceſtuous Perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 55. And the Reaſons for ſuch proceedings are very weighty.<note place="margin">Reaſons of this.</note> Firſt, no Gouerment, I ſay, not onely can bee good, but can  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  ſtand, where malefactors are not puniſhed, much leſſe can the Gouernment of the Church, where ſinne is ſpecially to bee hated, preuented, and ſuppreſſed. Secondly, where  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  knowne ſinne is not puniſhed, there the ſtate and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is reputed acceſſary to that ſinne, now what a ſcandall is it to Gods Religion and Church to bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fauourers, or ſparers of any ſinne, which they muſt bee, if offendors bee not puniſhed. Thirdly, offendors muſt bee  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  puniſhed, elſe there is danger of infecting the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>A little leauen leaueneth the whole l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, in regard of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  himſelfe; Cenſures muſt bee had in the Church, that ſo the fleſh may bee thereby deſtroyed, and his ſoule ſaued, and ſo Gods mercies glorified in the conuerting a penitent Sinner, by his ſauing Ordinances, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. But if hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue obſtinate, his puniſhment here is but the beginning of his tormented State in hell, and the decreee of Gods Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is begun to bee executed vpon him, and ſo the Lord is glorified in iudgement in the middeſt of his Church, in the confuſion of his enemies.</p>
            <p>Now theſe proceedings conſiſt in many particulars; for
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16091:140"/>
the Church is mercifull, euen as their heauenly Father is mercifull, they delight not in the death of ſinners, but rather that they ſhould bee conuerted, and liue; and therefore they attempt all meanes of cure firſt, before they proceed in cutting off.<note place="margin">How to proceed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16. Secondly, if hee will not heare, complaint muſt be made to the Church, as in verſ. 17. which (as I take it) is that noting out by Letter, which the Apoſtle ſpeakes  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  of in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. Thirdly, conſequently if hee will not heare the Church, ſeparate from him, haue no Company with him, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes in that 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14. And this is it alſo which the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. <hi>I wrote vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that you ſhould not company with fornicators,</hi> this is a ſuſpending of them for a time from the Sacraments, and from Communion in holy things, till the Church had triall whether thereby they would bee brought to Repentance. Fourthly, if this will not preuaile, what muſt be done then?  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  Why, if they cannot cure, they muſt cut off, hee muſt bee deliuered vp to Satan indeed: ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. and that which the Church doth in this caſe; the Lord ratifies in heauen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Whoſoeuer they bind on earth, is bound in heauen;</hi> yet ſo too, that vpon his Repentance, they can, and muſt, and doe moſt willingly looſe them from thoſe bandes of Satan, wherein they wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him before. This is a moſt ſerious and weighty duty to bee performed in the Church of God: but how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly it is both neglected and abuſed, it is a ſhame to ſpeake of, that any that profeſſe themſelues to bee of the Church of God, and haue power in their hands to execute theſe cenſures, ſhould yet neglect them; (theſe being the onely meanes to reclaime or caſt off the obſtinate, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment and all other waies will not ſerue). So alſo it is abuſed by thoſe vpon whom it is inflicted, they deriding it,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16091:140"/>
and making but a ieſt of it, as if they were neuer the further from heauen for all that: and ſurely it may be they are not, becauſe they were neuer neere it. Well, whoſoeuer they be that abuſe it, let them know that it is Gods owne pretious and holy Ordinance, and therefore not to bee dallied in, nor baſely eſteemed; yea, it is Gods owne worke and doing, where it is lawfully proceeded in, and it is ratified by him in heauen; and where it is abuſed, God will bee auenged on the abuſers to the full. It is true, that the Curſe cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes, is like the flying of a Bird in the Aire, it leaues no impreſſion behind it; and in this caſe God derides it from heauen, and it is their fearefull ſinne that inflict it. But when it is iuſtly ſuffered, it is the heauieſt ſtroke that can light vpon man in this life, either from God or man. The ſword of the Magiſtrate is nothing to this, that onely depriuing vs of temporall life, this of eternall life: a wounded Conſcience (which is an intolerable Burthen to them that haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

conſent of the whole; and conſent is not to bee fetcht from houſe to houſe, of euery man by himſelfe, for that courſe is ſubiect to fraud, but Aſſiſtants are to bee called, parties are to bee warned to bee there, and ſo publikely to teſtifie their owne conſent, and our Sauiour hath promiſed his preſence and aſſiſtance in ſuch caſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.19, 20. Now theſe Aſſemblies are ſometimes greater, as of a Dioceſſe or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, ſometimes ſmaller, as of a Pariſh. Againe, ſome are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, vpon ordinary occaſions; and, as extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions doe oft fall out, ſome are extraordinary. An aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together for ordinary occaſions and duties, they are for the moſt part theſe; Firſt, the preaching of the Word, the adminiſtration of the Sacraments and Prayer. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. <hi>When ye come together into one place; this is not to eate the Lords Supper.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. <hi>What is to bee done, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when yee come together, according as euerie one of you hath a Pſalme or a Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> So that there muſt be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Aſſemblies for theſe duties. Secondly, there muſt bee a calling of publike Aſſemblies for the election of officers; for this cauſe the multitude were called together, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2. Thirdly, there muſt bee a publike meeting for Almes, for the collecting and diſtributing to the Saints, ſo the Apoſtle commands 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.3, 4. Laſtly, there muſt bee ordinary publike Aſſemblies, for the execution of Church cenſures, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>When ye are gathered together, and my Spirit with you, &amp;c.</hi> So there muſt bee publike meetings vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſions; ſometimes God teſtifies extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary mercies, and giues extraordinary bleſſings to his Church, and then there muſt bee an extraordinary aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Church to giue publike thanks to God, as it was in <hi>Heſter.</hi> 9.22. Secondly, ſome heauie iudgements are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther felt or feared to come vpon the Church, and then the Church muſt aſſemble together for faſting and prayer, as it is commanded, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.15, 16. And wee ſee the practice of it in the Niniuites, <hi>Ionah</hi> 3.5. where they proclaimed a Faſt vpon <hi>Ionas</hi> preaching of deſtruction to come vpon them. Thirdly, Lawes and Decrees are to bee made or reuiued for
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16091:141"/>
the carriage of Gods worſhip, or ſuch like, and ſo in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. the Church came together for the decreeing of matters concerning ceremonies. And <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4. they deliuered thoſe decrees for the Churches to keepe, then there muſt be an aſſembling for the receiuing of them. Laſtly, doubts and controuerſies are to be decided; therefore there muſt bee publike Aſſemblies for the deciding of them. So <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent vp to Ieruſalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1, 2, &amp;c. about doubts that did ariſe; and what did they there, the Apoſtles and Elders came together to looke to this matter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. So much of the fifth Duty.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Dutie is ouer-ſight,<note place="margin">The ſixth duty.</note> that all theſe things may be duely and rightly done; this Duty is as needfull as the reſt: For wee know that euery thing growes out of frame in time, except they bee vpheld and renewed by continuall ouer-ſight and looking into; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.6. that the Apoſtles and Elders came together to looke into the matter. This is one moſt neceſſary Duty; for it is the keeper and maintainer of all the reſt; if this bee negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, all the reſt will faile; we know concerning our owne bodies, that if we looke not to our ſelues in our diet, all will bee ſoone out of frame, and much more in our ſoules, for who finds not by experience, that though hee labour to ſet himſelfe neuer ſo well in frame in the morning, yet before night for want of ouer-ſight, the Soule wil be much out of Order; and were it not for this carefull ouerſight our Soules would bee growne ouer with ſinnes, as the Fields are with weedes: ſo would it bee likewiſe with the Church. Now for this matter of ouerſight, firſt, it muſt bee ordered, that things once ordained bee eſtabliſhed by authority, and if it be poſſible by the authority of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, at leaſt of the Church. Thus <hi>Ioſiah</hi> made a Couenant with God, and eſtabliſhed it by his authority, and made all the people ſtand to it, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.32. And ſo the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37. eſtabliſheth thoſe things which hee had ordained in the Church by the authority of his Apoſtleſhip; <hi>If any man</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>bee ſpirituall, let him acknowledge, that the things
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:16091:142"/>
which I write vnto you are of the Lord.</hi> And if things be not thus eſtabliſhed, ciuill men will not regard them. Secondly, euery man muſt bee quickned vp, and incouraged to the performance of this duty, and therefore there muſt bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſight in the Church. Thus <hi>Ioſiah</hi> incouraged the Prieſts to the ſeruice of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.2. and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp <hi>Timothy</hi> to the obſeruation of his duty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21. <hi>I charge thee in the ſight of God, and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the elect Angels that thou obſerue theſe things.</hi> And ſo the Lord incourageth the Church of Smyrna, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.10. againſt her ſufferings; <hi>Feare none of thoſe things</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>which thou ſhalt ſuffer, &amp;c. but bee faithfull vnto the death, and I will giue thee the Crowne of life.</hi> Thirdly, there muſt bee ouer-ſight, that well-doers may bee commended and approoued: ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> commends them to whom hee wrote 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.19. for doing well, in that they did take heede vnto the words of the Prophets, &amp;c. And in the ſecond and third Chapters of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a Church that had any good thing in it, but our Sauiour commends them for it, and the want of this duty is a great diſmaying to religious proceedings amongſt vs. Fourthly, things muſt bee redreſſed, therefore there muſt bee ouer-ſight in the Church, and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Titus</hi> in Creta to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe thoſe things that were amiſſe, <hi>Titus</hi> 1 5. And ſo our Sauiour in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.5. labours to reforme the Church of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus; <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, &amp;c.</hi> And likewiſe the Church of Sardi, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p>The laſt duty in the matter of ouer-ſight is this; that if we cannot reforme and redreſſe thoſe things that are amiſſe, then we muſt make open proteſtation againſt their failings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the Apoſtle did, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. with ſharpe denuntiations and threatnings of Gods Iudgments againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they reforme not: ſo our Sauiour threatens the Church of Epheſus, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2 5. <hi>That if ſhe will not repent, he will come againſt her ſhortly and remoue her Candleſticke, &amp;c.</hi> and the Church of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus in the ſixteenth verſe, <hi>Repent thy ſelfe, or elſe I will come againſt thee ſhortly, and will fight againſt thee with the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16091:142"/>
ſword of my mouth.</hi> So if I liue in a Church that will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the things amiſſe, if my place afford it me, I will make open proteſtation againſt them; and if that will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, I will ſharpely denounce the iudgements of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and ſo I ſhall haue peace in diſcharging my Conſcience. And ſo much for the laſt Duty to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Church, namely, ouer-ſight.</p>

Now euery member of the Church is not preſently an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the Church, but firſt a man muſt be a member, and afterwards as his fitneſſe is, hee is to bee made an Officer; neither yet is euery Officer to manage euery duty, but ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duties are to bee matcht with ſeuerall Officers; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Officer is to bee confined to that particular Dutie, which hee is appointed vnto.</p>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16091:143"/>
that theſe officers muſt haue two things: firſt, they muſt be qualified with a competent meaſure of gifts, fit for ſuch offices;<note place="margin">Church-officers muſt haue two things: Firſt, they muſt be qualified with a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent meaſure of gifts.</note> ſecondly, they muſt be appointed to ſuch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by the order and authority of the Church wherein they liue. Firſt, they muſt be qualified with a competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of gifts fit for ſuch offices: for ſuch is the admirable wiſedome of God, that as he hath ordained diuerſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations (that is to ſay, duties) to be done in the Church; ſo proportionably he hath giuen diuers gifts, that is, enable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the adminiſtration of ſuch duties. And theſe gifts hee hath not heaped vp all together vpon one man, for one man is not able to receiue them all, at leaſt not to vſe and weeld them all, but hath diſtributed ſome to one man, and ſome vnto another, to euery one ſeuerally as himſelfe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. So the Apoſtle deliuers the matter very plainely and pithily in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. to the eleuenth verſe, where hee ſpeakes of adminiſtrations, gifts, and offices; and ſaith, that one and the ſame Spirit diſtributeth to euery man ſeuerally, as he will. And theſe three haue both a mutuall correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency too, and a dependency in Nature with each other, and are inſeparably ioyned together: adminiſtrations require gifts, gifts require officers, and officers require adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yea, adminiſtrations require not gifts onely where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but officers alſo by whom they are to be executed: and gifts require not officers alone by whom, but admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations alſo whereupon they are to be imployed: and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers require not onely adminiſtrations which they are to execute, but gifts alſo whereby they are enabled to execute them. Adminiſtrations without anſwerable gifts and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are but dead matters, there is no life in them. Gifts without officers and adminiſtrations anſwerable, are idle things, there is no profit in them. And ſo officers without adminiſtrations and gifts are meere ſhadowes and ſhewes, no truth nor ſubſtance is in them: So that theſe three are inſeparably ioyned together. And hence it is, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer duty the Lord would haue to ſucceed happily, ſtill thorow the whole booke of God, wee ſhall finde that hee
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16091:143"/>
matcheth that duty with gifts and officers accordingly. This we may ſee in the twenty fiue, and twenty ſixe, and ſo to the thirtieth Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> there was a Tabernacle to bee built, and an Altar, and an Arke to be made; here is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration: then looke in the 31. Chapter, ſecond and third verſes, and wee ſhall ſee, that there were preſently gifts and officers fitted thereto. In the ſecond verſe there was <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> whom God had called by name for that worke: and in the third verſe there were gifts too, <hi>Whom I haue filled with the Spirit of God in wiſedome, &amp;c.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.37. and <hi>chap.</hi> 10.1, 2. In the ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verſ. 37. our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>The harueſt is great, &amp;c.</hi> here is the adminiſtration, the preaching of the Goſpell: and in the tenth Chapter, the firſt and ſecond verſes, there are gifts and offices ſuted thereto; for Chriſt calls his Diſciples, and giues them gifts for this purpoſe. That may ſuffice for the firſt point.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, they muſt be lawfully appointed to ſuch offices.</note> they muſt lawfully be appointed to ſuch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the authoritie and orders of the Church wherein they liue; <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Titus,</hi> that hee left him in Crete to ordaine Elders, &amp;c. <hi>I haue appointed thee</hi> (ſaith he;) hee was not to doe theſe things of himſelfe, but according to the Orders eſtabliſhed by <hi>Paul</hi> in that place. And there is great reaſon for it: for whereſoeuer an officer is thruſt on a people againſt, or beſides their Orders or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, it breedes in the people diſcontent againſt him, and makes, that neither hee nor his ſeruice is well accepted of them. But what if we liue in a Church where the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Orders are corrupt? I anſwer: It were for to bee wiſhed, that in all places officers might bee made after the beſt and pureſt manner: but when we liue in places where we cannot be ſerued with the beſt and fineſt, wee muſt bee ſerued with courſer, wee can haue no better than the place will yeeld. Therefore if an officer bee appointed, after the vſuall Orders and Cuſtomes of the Church, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what corrupt, if withall he be qualified with ſome compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent meaſure of gifts, this ſufficeth to make him a lawfull
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:16091:144"/>
officer to them, and ſo hee is to bee accepted and eſteemed. And that theſe two are moſt neceſſary, as none being a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full officer ordinarily that hath not both; and moſt ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as that whoſoeuer hath theſe is a lawfull officer, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by theſe Reaſons: Firſt, that which a man is lawfully ſeazed on, he muſt haue both right to, and poſſeſſion in. When God giues a man gifts, he hath a poſſible right; and when he is appointed by the Authoritie and Orders of the Church, that giues him actuall poſſeſſion. Secondly, euery ſuch officer is an officer both for God and for men, and therefore hee muſt bee inueſted by each; Man inueſts him by appointment, God inueſts him when hee is qualified by himſelfe, and appointed by man according to Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. So much for the firſt generall anſwer, that officers in the Church muſt bee men qualified with a competent meaſure of gifts. Secondly, that they muſt bee appointed thereto by the Authority and Orders of the Church wherein they liue.</p>

               <note place="margin">Particularly, What theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are.</note> Now I come to anſwer particularly, and by name to the Queſtion, namely, what theſe officers are. It were too great a labour, and yet to no great purpoſe, to reckon vp all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular officers, that haue had to doe in Church buſineſſes; for beſides the ordinary, there haue been many extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. Some in our Sauiours time, and the Age next ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: as Apoſtles that were to teach at large through the whole world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, &amp;c. and Prophets to foreſee and foreſhew things to come, as <hi>Agabus, Act.</hi> 11. and Euangeliſts to bee Aſſiſtants to the Apoſtles. Others there were alſo in many Ages after, as Exorciſts, Doore-keepers, Acolutiues, and Readers, &amp;c. but whether theſe were in, rightfully or wrongfully, is to bee ſeene hereafter. In the meane time we will ſpeake of ſuch officers as were of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and neceſſary vſe in the Church, either ſuch as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, or elſe are pretended ſo to be on probable and plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds.

We will take them in their orders: firſt, we will begin with Biſhops: ſecondly, we will come to Presbyters, then to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, then to gouerning Elders, then to Deacons, then to Widowes, then to other Aſſiſtants: laſtly, we will come to ſpeake of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Firſt, wee will begin with Biſhops; and firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, Biſhops. Firſt, their name.</note> wee will ſpeake of their name; ſecondly, of their office. Firſt, of their name. <hi>Biſhop</hi> is as much to ſay, as an Ouerſeer in the Originall; and it is attributed vnto them by a kind of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: for there are many Ouer-ſeers, but theſe are the chiefe (in the Scripture ſenſe) that are, and theſe are Ouer-ſeers by a kind of excellency, whether we reſpect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they ouer-ſee, or whether we reſpect their deſignement to that office, or whether wee reſpect the worke they doe. Firſt, if we reſpect the perſons they ouer-ſee, they are ouer-ſeers by a kind of excellency, for they ouer-ſee the faithfull, or the flocke of Chriſt: for whereas they haue other ouer-ſeers, as they are Subiects, they haue the King, and other Magiſtrates to be their Ouer-ſeers; yet none are ſo as theſe, for theſe are their Ouer-ſeers, as they are the flock of Chriſt. Secondly, if we reſpect their ſpeciall deſignment ouer that flock, they haue a more ſpeciall deſignment ouer the Lords flock, than any other Ouer-ſeer hath ouer any other people; the holy Ghoſt makes them ouer-ſeers after a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Thirdly, if we reſpect their worke, which is to feede, and that not with bodily foode, but with ſpirituall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly food to eternall life.

               <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>To all the Saints in Chriſt Ieſus which are at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi with the Biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> And moſt plainely in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. <hi>If any man deſireth the office of a Biſhop, &amp;c.</hi> this is the generall ſignification of the word in Scripture. But you ſhall vnderſtand, that by common practice of ſpeech, I find this name alwayes, almoſt euer ſince the Apoſtles times particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly applied to thoſe that haue a primacy and precedency in the Church aboue their fellow-Miniſters; and ſo Biſhops are not Ouer-ſeers of the flocke onely, but alſo of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors too within ſuch a compaſſe, ſome greater, ſome ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, which we call Dioceſſes; and as this is generally ſo in all antient Writers, ſo likewiſe if the Poſtſcript be authenticall, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> (as for any thing I ſee it muſt) then the Scripture fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours it too: for there <hi>Timothy</hi> is ſaid to be a Biſhop in this ſenſe, and ſo had other Paſtors vnder him.

And this <hi>Timothy</hi> muſt doe; and thereto Antiquitie ſo plainely agrees, that <hi>Ierome,</hi> though otherwiſe bitter enough againſt Biſhops, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it to be done by them, and miſliked not the doing of it. And ſurely, ſeeing ordination muſt be continued in the Church,<note place="margin">The obiection that the Apoſtles did ordaine as Apoſtles, not as Biſhops; and <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> as Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts not as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, anſwered.</note> ſome Perſons muſt needs haue a ſpecial ouer-ruling hand in it; and who are they but Biſhops, that is, they that are higheſt and chiefeſt in the Miniſtery? So the Apoſtles, and ſo the Euangeliſts being the chiefeſt in the Miniſtry, did ordaine Miniſters. If it be ſaid, that the Apoſtles ordained not as Biſhops, but as Apoſtles; and <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> not as Biſhops, but Euangeliſts, yet the ſame office being of neceſſitie ſtill to be performed, ſome muſt alwaies be in the

Church, anſwerable to them in that reſpect, call them how you will, if not Biſhops, yet they muſt haue as much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in this buſineſſe, as I for my part do aſcribe to Biſhops. It is true, that extraordinary Officers are not to be imitated in extraordinary workes: but in their ordinary workes of continuall and neceſſary vſe, when extraordinary Officers ceaſe, ordinary muſt ſucceed them. I doe not ſay, they did this wholly and alone, but ſtil other Presbyters or Miniſters were aſſiſtants, and layd on hands with them: and ſo it was in the Primitiue Church, and ſo our Law requires, that the Biſhop ſhould make no Miniſter, vnleſſe other Miniſters be with him: but yet ſtill they haue the chiefe ſtroke; the power of ordaining is in the one, the approbation in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing wherein their Office conſiſts,<note place="margin">Secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing things amiſſe.</note> is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeeing, and redreſſing things that are amiſſe: for this purpoſe was <hi>Titus</hi> left in Crete to redreſſe things amiſſe, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5. and that not in the people onely, but in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters alſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>Againſt an Elder receiue none ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, but vnder two or three witneſſes; them that ſinne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly rebuke openly, &amp;c. Timothy</hi> was at Epheſus, as <hi>Titus</hi> was at Crete, to redreſſe things amiſſe, and there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miniſters there, and theſe muſt bee reformed too; and therefore the Apoſtle would haue him in redreſſing things amiſſe amongſt them, to receiue no accuſation againſt them but vnder two or three witneſſes. So that there muſt bee one aboue the reſt, for the performance of this Duty: the ſame Reaſon may bee proportionably applied for this, as for the former, for ſeeing ſome miniſters muſt bee redreſſed, then there muſt be ſome that muſt haue this power to doe it; and who are they but Biſhops that are in the chiefeſt places? I doe not aſcribe to Biſhops hereby any abſolute power ouer their Brethren, as to doe what they liſt, but a limited power to proceed with the approbation of their Brethren: neither ſay I, that theſe were ſimply Dioceſan Biſhops, as ours are, but ſurely they were ſuch as had ſome compaſſe of iuriſdiction allotted them, wherein were many
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:16091:146"/>
Congregations, at leaſt many Miniſters whom theſe did ouer-ſee. Thoſe of the Presbytery haue one that is chiefe amongſt them, and ſo is the confeſſion of the Reformed Churches. And Maſter <hi>Caluin</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth as much, that in the ancient Church there were ſuch Superiours; and ſaith further, that their proceedings were not contrary to the Word; yea, and hee ſhewes and approues the reaſon why ſuch were choſen, and that was of purpoſe to preuent diſſention, which by equality would ariſe. Miſtake me not, as if I did meane to ſettle in Biſhops any Princely authority or Lordlike command; neither he, nor they, nor I intend it, but that at leaſt there muſt be one ſuperiour, and aboue the reſt for order-ſake. For ſo it muſt needs be in all Companies and Societies whatſoeuer, elſe it cannot ſtand. There were many Miniſters in Epheſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. And ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 15.35. we reade of many that were in the Church of Antioch, and ſome of them are named, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1. Now what diſorder would there haue been in theſe Churches, if one had not been aboue the reſt? What danger of Schiſme would there haue been? How could matters haue been decided amongſt them? Who ſhould there haue been to haue moderated their actions? The freeſt State that euer was, hath one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour aboue the reſt, as Venice hath her Duke, Rome hath her Conſuls, &amp;c. yea, the Apoſtles themſelues exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this order amongſt themſelues; ſome in one Cauſe was Moderator, ſome in another. Nay, I adde further, that they exerciſed power, though not ouer themſelues, for they were all equall, yet ouer other Miniſters. Therefore the thing is not vnlawfull in it ſelfe, if it bee moderately and lawfully vſed. And the order which I pleade for, I would not haue thought a bare Title, but ſuch as is armed with ſome kind of power too, which is conferred on them, by them which choſe them to ſuch places. But you will ſay all this is tolerable, if it were but for one Action, or for one yeare? I anſwere, that ſurely the lawfulneſſe is all one, bee it for a yeare or for a mans life, only there is leſſe danger of abuſing ſuch a place, if they be limitted to a ſhorter time:
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:16091:146"/>
And ſo much of the firſt Office, namely, Biſhops, where yee haue heard firſt of their Name, and ſecondly of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>Now wee come in the ſecond place to Presbyters or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;<note place="margin">Secondly, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</note> for ſo the word Presbyter in the Originall ſignifies an Elder; and they were ſo called, either as they were Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or as they were ancient in yeares, or at leaſt in carriage, or becauſe they were more ancient in grace, and in beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others to the Faith. We ſpeake here of ſuch as labour in the Word and Doctrine, for of ſuch as are pretended to be gouerning Elders, we ſhall ſpeake in the next place. This name wee find alſo to bee generall to all in the Miniſtery, from the higheſt to the loweſt; yea, euen the Apoſtles themſelues are ſo called; ſo <hi>Peter</hi> calls himſelfe an Elder, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1. yet by vſe for the moſt part both in Scripture, as <hi>Act.</hi> 15.4. and the 14.23. and in other Writers, it is reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to thoſe that are aſſigned to teach in ſome particular Congregation, ſometimes many of them together, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one by himſelfe, as times and occaſions ſerued.</p>
            <p>Their Office in regard of the maine eſſentiall duty,<note place="margin">Their office, firſt, generally.</note> is to feed, and therefore they are called Paſtors, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Hee gaue ſome to be Apoſtles, &amp;c. and ſome Paſtors, &amp;c.</hi> And to this duty they are often exhorted in Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>The Elders which are amongst you I beſeech—feed the Flocke of God, &amp;c. Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heed therefore vnto your ſelues, and to all the Flocke whereof the holy Ghoſt hath made you Ouer-ſeers, to feed the Church of God, &amp;c.</hi> And this feeding conſiſts chiefly in two things; that is, firſt, to teach; ſecondly, to rule and gouerne: they muſt bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to haue as abſolute power and authoritie from God for both theſe duties within their Charge, as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in theirs: for euery Presbiter is a Feeder; that is, both a Teacher &amp; a Ruler within his Charge. It is true, that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue bin moſt vniuſtly ſcantled &amp; abridged by Canons and Councels of this part of their office, that conſiſts in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and gouerning; too much hath been taken from them, that Biſhops might be aduanced the more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:16091:147"/>
               <note place="margin">Secondly, more particularly.</note>To ſpeake more particularly of their Office, it conſiſts in many particulars; Firſt, they are to teach the Word; that  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  is, both to expound it, and to apply it, and whatſoeuer par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of exhorting, reprouing, comforting, &amp;c. are ſet downe in Scripture, they are to bee referred to this head, they were all exerciſed by the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, and are ſo to bee by euery Miniſter or Elder within his Charge: that which is ſpoken of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. is ſpoken to all Miniſters; <hi>Preach the Word, bee inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, improue, rebuke, exhort, &amp;c.</hi> And there is reaſon for it; for the Word being committed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Paſtor to bee miniſtred by them, and that being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to teach, to conuince, to correct, as it is in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. therefore there is power and charge in them, to handle  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  it euery way, for the edification of the Church. Secondly, they are to adminiſter the Sacraments: for that alſo being charged vpon the Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. was intended to all the Miniſtery, as well as the Word: and in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18. <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, &amp;c.</hi> there is the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the Apoſtle makes it peculiar to him and other  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  miniſters to adminiſter, <hi>it which wee bleſſe, &amp;c.</hi> The third Duty is prayer, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4. and in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. there the manner of publike prayer is plainely ſet downe, that is, that which is conceiued by the Miniſter, and the people accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying him in their affections, and ſaying, <hi>Amen.</hi> The  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  fourth Duty belonging to their Office, is that they be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to their flocke of holineſſe in life; ſo the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the Elders to whom hee writ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. to bee an example to their flocke: and ſo the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> to bee an example to them that beleeue, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.12.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  The fifth Duty is to viſit the ſicke; So it is intended, <hi>Iames</hi> 5.14. <hi>If any man bee ſicke let him call for the Elders of the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  Church, &amp;c.</hi> Their ſixth Duty; they are to vſe and exerciſe the power of the Keyes both in binding and looſing, for that alſo is common to them with the Apoſtles; and that which is ſaid to the Apoſtle in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.23. is ſaid alſo to all true Miniſters; <hi>Whoſe ſinnes ſoeuer ye remit on earth, they
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:16091:147"/>
are remitted, &amp;c.</hi> This is peculiar to all in the Miniſtery, and none elſe. The ſeuenth Duty belonging to their Office is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>  that they are to haue care ouer the poore. I vrge it not ſo much that they ſhould diſtribute with their owne hands, yet that is needfull too: where greater occaſions are not hindred by it; for ſo the Apoſtles, all was brought and laid at their feet, and they did diſtribute it, till they had greater buſineſſe in hand. But this they ought to doe, to ſee it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by thoſe that are in places, both collections and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. Eighthly and laſtly, their Duty is to  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>  bee continually reſident, and attendant, ouer their Charge <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heede to the flocke ouer which the holy Ghoſt hath made you ouerſeers, &amp;c.</hi> The very name, <hi>Ouerſeer,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſo much, that they muſt be continually reſident ouer the flocke, wherein the Apoſtles themſelues, though they went from place to place, yet they were very carefull in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting, and in writing to the Churches which they had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.36. and they did long to bee with them, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11. and when they were hindred from it, they bewailed it, as Satans worke therein. So doth the ſame Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. and when they could not come themſelues, they ſupplied their bodily abſence by the preſence of their Miniſters and Deputies, as alſo by Letters. But no ordinary Miniſter can thus excuſe himſelfe, but they are continually bound to bee reſident. And the danger is exceeding great when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor is abſent, as wee may ſee in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. When the Apoſtle was abſent, ſome crept into the Church that taught errors and falſe Doctrine, as that there is no reſurrection, &amp;c. and the danger of it amongſt vs is too apparant and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. And therefore wee are to pray vnto God, that thoſe in Authoritie may force them that are tied to a Charge to be reſident vpon it: ſo much for Presbyters.</p>
            <p>In the third place we come to Doctors:<note place="margin">Thirdly, Doctors.</note> I finde the word vſed in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. and we expound it Teachers, which hath two ſignifications: Firſt, I find it to bee vnderſtood of thoſe that teach the Word, and that is the true and onely ſenſe of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:16091:148"/>
it in the Scriptures: ſecondly ſometimes it is vnderſtood of thoſe that inſtruct Schollers ſpecially in the grounds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and ſo after in other matters; and ſo it is taken in ſome antient Writers. The queſtion concerning Doctors is in the former ſenſe this; Whether there muſt bee ſuch an one in euery particular Congregation, as a ſeuerall Officer from the Paſtor? For anſwer whereunto, I ſay, that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Doctor is neceſſary in both ſenſes generally in the Church: and alſo in the former ſenſe, as hee is a Teacher, hee is neceſſary in euery particular Congregation; yea and further, I ſay; that if there bee in one and the ſame Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, a Doctor in whom is the Word o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> knowledge, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a Paſtor in whom is the word of wiſdome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. it is not to be miſliked. But that this muſt be ſo of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie that wee deny: for howſoeuer the gifts bee diuers, the Doctors to teach and expound the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Paſtors to apply it; yet they may bee and are vſually found in the ſame Perſon: and therefore wee ſhall find it. Scripture, that teaching and preaching concurre together in the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer: ſo it is ſaid of our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.35. <hi>That hee went about teaching and preaching the Goſpell.</hi> And ſo it is ſaid of the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Act.</hi> 15.35. <hi>That they continued preaching and teaching at Antioch.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.2. requires this in <hi>Timothy, that he teach and exhort.</hi> And this is generally required of all preaching Elders, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. that they labour in the Word and Doctrine; and what is that but to teach and apply? And euery Miniſter muſt bee apt to teach. What neceſſitie is there of a Doctor in euery particular Congregation? Howſoeuer then they are diuerſe gifts, yet commonly they are found in the ſame perſon: and that which they alleage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. makes directly againſt them; for if the Apoſtle there had meant to haue made them diuerſe offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:16091:148"/>Now we come in the fourth place to gouerning Elders.<note place="margin">Fourthly, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Elders.</note> I finde Gouernors mentioned in Scripture, as in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. and alſo Rulers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. And I deny not but this is of neceſſary vſe in the Church; for the Miniſters muſt bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with it, they muſt rule and gouerne, as we haue ſeene before, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. And it may bee of good vſe too, for the Church; euen in thoſe that are out of the Miniſtry, as in the Chriſtian Magiſtrate: but that this muſt bee meant directly of ſome that muſt of neceſſity rule in euery particular Church, beſides the Miniſters, I cannot ſee; ſpecially ſeeing they aſcribe to theſe Rulers a hand in the Cenſures of the Church, which being a chief part of the power of the keyes, and therefore appropriated to the Miniſters, and limited by Chriſt onely to the Apoſtles and them; how ſhal they be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to others, without their open wrong? I will deliuer my iudgment briefely and freely in this caſe: Firſt, either there were none ſuch at all; or if there were ſuch, they were onely by practice, not by inſtitution; or if they were by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, yet they were for that preſent diſpenſation, and not perpetuall; or laſtly, if they were perpetuall, yet our Church is not deſtitute in that caſe. Firſt, either there were none ſuch at all; for firſt, whereas it is ſaid, that the Iewes had their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in their Synagogues, &amp; that theſe were tranſlated from them; though this bee probable and likely enough, yet it is but a coniecture, there is no ſure proofe for it: But there muſt bee ſure ground to erect a Church-officer vpon. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is no example in all the Scripture of any Church ſo gouerned. Thirdly, the places of Scripture allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for them are ſcarce and few, and indeed there is but one, and that is in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. I will not ſtand to ſcanne it, or to make ſhifts againſt it; but if it bee ſo expounded of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning Elders beſides Miniſters, it is ſubiect to many iuſt exceptions, and alſo it may admit many interpretations to the contrary, agreeable to the Analogy of Faith, and fitting to the words themſelues, and there are a great many more harſh interpretations that paſſe for currant in farre weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters: ſo that firſt either there were none ſuch at all;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:16091:149"/>
or ſecondly, if there were ſuch (as for my part I will not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny it) yet they were onely in practice then, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proued to bee an Inſtitution: for many things were done then, which in doing were not inſtituted. Thirdly, or if it were by Inſtitution, yet it was onely for that preſent diſpenſation; when there was no Chriſtian Magiſtrate; ſo that now wee liuing vnder a Chriſtian Magiſtrate are not bound to it, nor haue no ſuch vſe of it, and therefore it is not perpetuall. Fourthly, or if it bee perpetuall, yet our Church is not vtterly deſtitute; we haue in euery Pariſh Veſtry-men to ioyne with the Miniſter in ſuch parts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, as needs ſuch perſons, to heare and reforme ſome matters with the Miniſter, that he might not carry all alone. And therefore there is no cauſe of ſuch quarrell and excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as is made againſt our Church vpon this occaſion. And ſo much for the fourth point concerning gouerning Elders.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fifth, deacons.</note>In the fifth place we come to the office of Deacons; that is an expreſſe Office mentioned in Scripture, as <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2. though they are not there expreſſely called Deacons; yet I doubt not but they were ſuch. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. they are called Diſtributors and in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. there they are by name. Theſe are ſuch as at the firſt were appointed, and imployed altogether about the poore, and about Church-Treaſury; but afterwards they did alſo exerciſe ſome miniſteriall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: for <hi>Philip</hi> was a Deacon,<note place="margin">Philip preached and baptized rather as hee was an Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, than a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</note> 
               <hi>Act.</hi> 6. yet afterward hee preached and baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.5, 38. though he did that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he was an Euangeliſt, than a Deacon; for ſo we may reade, <hi>Act.</hi> 21 8. that <hi>Philip</hi> was an Euangeliſt. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Deacons baptized, which (ſauing the iudgement of the better learned) I thinke they rather vſurped, than had any right to it by office, or other warrant for it; yet in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages, they had generally a degree of the Miniſtery, anſwerable to that of the Leuites vnder the Law, who taught and looked to the Treaſury too; and the Scripture ſeemes to fauour it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. where it is ſaid, <hi>they haue miniſtred well, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that it is neither ſtrange, nor much
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:16091:149"/>
to be found fault with, that there are ſome ſuch amongſt vs. But admit they were only imployed in Church-treaſury, for that is the true originall of them; yet either they were onely for certaine times and places, and ſo was the occaſion of their firſt erection, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>Caluin</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 21.8. And therefore they are not of neceſſitie to be in euery Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or if they bee neceſſary, we haue Churchwardens and Collectors anſwerable to them, though not ſo gifted as they were in <hi>Act.</hi> 6. that may bee the defect of the times that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford not men ſo well qualified, or of the chuſers of them, that make not better choice, and alſo though they be not ſo cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by prayer and impoſition of hands, which either is not ſimply neceſſary in this caſe; or elſe being omitted, that is alſo the chooſers fault. But, ſay they, if you retaine the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and not the Title, this is to ſubiect Gods Ordinance to your owne inuention; as if one ſhould ſay, he would yeeld to haue his matter moderated and determined in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and yet not by my Lord Chancellour, whom the King appoints, but by one of his owne chuſing: and ſo in the Church you will haue this matter of Church-treaſury or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and yet not by Deacons whom the Lord Ieſus hath appointed? I anſwer: This is but a cauill about words, ſo long as wee retaine the thing it ſelfe, there is no ſuch great matter for the name. And ſo much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken concerning Deacons.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place we come to Widowes;<note place="margin">Sixthly, wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.</note> of theſe we may reade in Scripture, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 6.1. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.3. and it is probable that theſe are meant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. where they are called helpers; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. ſhewers of mercy. Yee ſhall haue my iudgement briefly in this point, and that is this; That all theſe places of Scripture well vnderſtood and compared together, doe proue onely thus much; firſt, that in many Churches there were then ſuch Widowes: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that whereſoeuer they were, there they were to bee relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: thirdly, that where they were ſo relieued, there they were to performe workes of mercy and charitie, as to attend the ſicke, to waſh the Saints feete, and ſuch like, as occaſion
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:16091:150"/>
required: But that they are a neceſſary Officer in euery Church, and that where they are not, there the Church-gouernment is defectiue, that can neuer be proued. In <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua</hi> they haue rather poore men than women; and in the Churches of France they haue no ſuch vſe of Widowes at all.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, wee come to ſpeake of other Aſſiſtants, as Readers, Fellowes, Acolutiues, Exorciſts, &amp;c. concerning whom becauſe they bee not at all found in the Word, wee therefore doe paſſe them by.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Eighthly the chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; wherein firſt that hee is a Church Officer.</note>Eighthly and laſtly, wee come to the Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who though he be laſt named, yet hath not the leaſt hand in Church-gouernment. And the queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him is, Firſt, whether hee may bee rightly called a Church-officer; I anſwer: Hee may: though not in that proper ſenſe as the Miniſter, becauſe he hath not ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand in the Word and Sacraments; but in a large ſenſe he may, and that very rightly. For being a member of the Church, and that a chiefe one too, how can he be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from being a Church Officer, and that a chiefe one too, in his nature. It is no diſparagement to him, Chriſt being the Head of the Church, and he being Chriſts Lieutenant within his lawfull Dominions, why may not he be a chiefe Ruler in Church-buſineſſe.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter wee had ſpoken in the firſt place touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duties to bee performed in the Church-gouernment, we came in the ſecond place to ſpeake of the perſons or Officers that are to performe theſe duties: where we ſhewed; firſt, what manner of perſons they ought to bee; and ſecondly, what they were by name. Now we come to the third point, namely, the Rules and Lawes that theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and officers (ſpoken of in the ſecond point) are to bee directed by, in the execution of theſe actions and duties ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the firſt point, that is the point wee are now to ſpeake to.</p>
            <p>All buſineſſes to be done do neceſſarily require certaine Lawes and Rules to bee performed by: and ſurely,<note place="margin">The third pillar whereupon the Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſteth, <hi>viz.</hi> the Rules and Lawes by which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours are to be directed;</note> Gods buſineſſe requires it much more. It is not enough that the workes of God bee done, but as they are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; ſo the carriage muſt be good too, they muſt be well done. The Lord is very preciſe and iealous ouer his owne Ordinances; and therefore as hee hath giuen expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that they be obſerued for the matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them, ſo alſo he hath preſcribed certaine rules and directions how they are to be proceeded in for the manner and circumſtances of them: and therefore to performe the duty commanded, neglecting the directions preſcribed for the managing of them, is like <hi>Sauls</hi> obedience, which is ſaid to be diſobedience; at the beſt it is but halfe obedience, the Lord accepts it not. For our ſound and intire obedience to God conſiſts in this, when wee doe that which the Lord commands, and when we doe it as hee commands it to bee done, according to that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 39.42, 43. where the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:16091:152"/>
children of Iſrael are commended becauſe they did that which the Lord commanded them, and in euery point as he commanded them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to three heads.</note>Now the Rules here to bee obſerued (that theſe duties may be well done) are many; for order and plaineneſſe ſake wee will reduce them to theſe three heads: Firſt, the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant muſt be good by which they are guided in the doing of them: Secondly, the manner muſt bee good whereby they are carried: Thirdly, the end muſt be good which we aymed at in the doing of them.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Wee will begin with the firſt: The Rules and Lawes whereby theſe Perſons and Officers muſt bee guided in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe duties muſt haue a good warrant: The beſt, and indeed the onely true and ſound warrant for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to bee fetcht from the Lord Ieſus out of his Word: for ſeeing hee is the head and chiefe Officer of his Church; therefore the reſt being inſtruments and ſeruants vnder him, are to waite at his mouth for directions how to carry themſelues in their places. Firſt, therefore the Word of God muſt bee ſought into carefully and diligently. Secondly, wee muſt ſeeke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by humble and feruent prayer, for the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, both for the right vnderſtanding, and alſo for wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling conformableneſſe and ſubmiſſion to the Word; for this is right conſulting and walking with God, when we haue taken aduice from his Word for euery buſineſſe in hand, and when we receiue a comfortable anſwere from him in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for incouragement therein, and do ſo proceed in it, becauſe God will haue it ſo: For as euery Creature, ſo euery Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we goe about is truly ſanctified vnto vs by the Word and Prayer; that is, when wee looke into the Word for a warrant for it, and when wee goe to God by prayer to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs in it.<note place="margin">What things are to be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> Heere therefore in Gods Word, Firſt, wee muſt haue a warrant for the Duty, that it be neceſſary, or at leaſt lawfull to be done. Secondly, for the Doer, that hee or they are authoriſed, at leaſt allowed by God to deale in it: Thirdly, a warrant muſt bee had hence for the Carriage of the Buſineſſe, that it bee commanded, or at leaſt permitted
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:16091:152"/>
by the warrant of Gods Word. The matter wee are now to inſiſt on, is the warrant for the cautions, conditions, and carriage of the buſineſſe. And this is of two ſorts: Firſt,<note place="margin">Warrants for the cautions, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are, Firſt, more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall.</note> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a principall and direct warrant; or ſecondly, an inferior warrant of a lower degree, deriued from it. The principall and direct warrant is expreſly mentioned in the Word, and that either by way of precept or example: By way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and that is either particular or generall, each preciſely to be obſerued, as being in the nature of a binding Law. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples (I meane only ſuch as the word commends) they are either ordinary, or extraordinary: extraordinary were ſuch as were peculiar to certaine times, places, and Churches; ſuch as was the election of <hi>Matthias</hi> by lot, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and theſe ended where they began, and are not to bee propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as patternes for imitation. Ordinary, are ſuch as were commonly practiſed, as gathering for the Saintes, whereof the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. <hi>That as hee had ordained in the Churches of Galatia, ſo he ordained amongſt them alſo, &amp;c.</hi> and theſe are to be obſerued by all, where there are like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the warrant from an inferior or lower degree,<note place="margin">Secondly, infer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our warrant.</note> as being deriued from the principall; theſe are yonger in yeares, as not being in the Apoſtles times, but in ſome neere Ages after, and meaner in authoritie, as being ratified by men not ſo infallibly guided by the Spirit, as the Apoſtles were. And theſe alſo are either Precepts, or examples. Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  precepts, and they are commonly called Traditions, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; I meane not Traditions in matters of faith, for they are very dangerous, but in matters of outward church gouernment, and theſe may more ſafely bee dealt withall. Secondly, examples, or practice of the Church, and each of  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  theſe are either generally ratified by all, or the moſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; or elſe but by ſome one or few Churches, and each of theſe the moſt antient and pureſt; or latter and more corrupt. Now whatſoeuer is done in Church-Gouernment, muſt haue ground from one or both theſe warrants. If it be poſſible it muſt haue warrant from the firſt, that is, the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:16091:153"/>
principall warrant. Therefore when any thing is to be done in this caſe, look ſpecially into the principall warrant, which is the Word; if ſo there be any particular precept for it, then that muſt bee done as the Lords Commandement, without any further communicating with fleſh and blood, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, when hee ſpeaketh of matters of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37. But if the Precepts be generall, as that <hi>all thing muſt be done in order, &amp;c.</hi> make vſe of them for ſuch particulars onely, as naturally proceed from thence, being informed by ſound conſequence in reaſon and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. If we haue no precept in Scripture, then wee muſt looke to examples, and thoſe that are ordinary; which though they are not of that authority that precepts are of, becauſe thoſe are abſolutely to be imbraced, yet they are much to bee regarded; and theſe wee are to faſhion our ſelues vnto, alwaies obſeruing a due proportion of times, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, perſons, occaſions, and ſuch other neceſſary circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for to apply that to one Church in one ſtate, and at one time, which was in another Church, in another State, and at another time; were abſurd. Well then, if we be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of this principall warrant, that we haue neither precept nor example in Gods Word; then wee muſt goe to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior warrants, we muſt ſee what Precepts and examples are to be found in Writers that haue ſpoken of Church-Gouernment ſince the Apoſtles times; and of theſe wee muſt ſee, whether they were of the moſt antient and pureſt Churches; or of the latter and more corrupt: if we haue no preſident by conſtitution or practice, but in the later and corrupt times; I ſee not, but that the Churches now being, may as well deuiſe particulars of their owne, as follow theirs; yea, and better, ſo long as they meaſure their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, fitly and wiſely by thoſe in the Word. But if wee haue any preſident in all, or the moſt antient and pureſt Churches, for the moſt part it is ſafe enough to build on them, ſo as they bee not miſ-applyed nor miſtaken (I ſpeake ſtill of matters of Church-gouernment, not of faith) But if there be many conſtitutions and examples in thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:16091:153"/>
and ſome diffring from other, take the beſt, that is, that which is neereſt to the word, and hath beſt preſidents of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Churches, or of ſuch as that their condition &amp; ſtate may beſt agree with ours. This point of inferior warrant ſome haue gone too farre in, eſteeming too highly of it; ſome haue come too ſhort, eſteeming too baſely of it. Firſt, ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme too highly of theſe, impiouſly equalling them with the Word, whereas there are two maine differences; Firſt, becauſe thoſe in the Word are certainely true; wee know it was done by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles. Secondly, as wee know they were done by them; ſo wee know that they were done by them, as they were infallibly guided by God himſelfe, ſo that they could not erre. But for the matter of inferior warrant, firſt, haply there was no ſuch thing done, at leaſt in thoſe times, and by thoſe Perſons; for Hiſtories make mention of things not true: or ſecondly, yet they might erre, for they were not infallibly guided by Gods Spirit. Others come too ſhort, eſteeming too baſely of them, as if they were nothing worth; they eſteeme no more of an antient Church, than of one that hath beene within theſe two hundred yeares. Let vs take the meane betwixt both theſe, embrace them reuerently, where they are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the Word; and ſo they are a ſufficient warrant in thoſe caſes, if wee bee deſtitute of better. And ſo much bee ſpoken for the warrant of thoſe things which are to bee done in Church-gouernment.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the ſecond generall head,<note place="margin">Second head, and in it fiue Rules.</note> the manner whereby they muſt be carried; that muſt be good too, as well as the warrant whereon they are grounded: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times good things are marred by ill handling; therefore that theſe good things may not bee marred with ill han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling. Obſerue touching the manner of the carriage of them theſe Rules: Firſt, that the moſt neceſſary and materiall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties bee firſt and chiefly prouided for: ſecondly, that all things bee done decently, and in order: thirdly, that the peace of the Church be not troubled: fourthly, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hath any right in the performance of this buſineſſe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:16091:154"/>
be not contemned, or reſtrained of their right. Laſtly, theſe duties muſt be ſo carried (ſo farre as may be) as beſt fits the ciuill Gouernment wherein wee liue. We will begin with  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  the firſt, that is, That the moſt neceſſary and materiall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt bee firſt and chiefly prouided for; and they are the Word, and Sacraments, and Prayer, and the Miniſtery; theſe muſt bee firſt looked to: ſo our Sauiour himſelfe takes this courſe, he firſt prouides for theſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, 38, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Firſt, he preacheth and baptizeth. And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. Firſt of all (ſaith he) <hi>I deliuered vnto you that which I receiued, how that Chriſt died for our ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, hee preacheth Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: and the Reaſons are plaine for this; for theſe are the foundation of Religion, therefore theſe muſt bee firſt laid, elſe there can bee no building: ſecondly, theſe are the gatherers of Gods choſen; if they haue not theſe, none can be conuerted at all: thirdly, theſe are ſo effectuall to the being of a Church, that where theſe are found, there is a Church; and where they are not, there is none; therefore theſe muſt bee firſt and chiefly prouided for. The due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of this Rule, if it were carefully looked into, would preuent much ignorance and diſſention, and other inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences: many there are that nuzzle the people vp in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies onely, and goe no further, as the Popiſh Church. This is a cauſe of horrible blindneſſe and ignorance, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the moſt part reſting there, and thinking they haue Religion enough, if they obſerue ſuch and ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and ſo are careleſſe of true growth in Chriſtianity by the true vſe of the Word and Sacraments. Theſe are Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall courſes to tythe Mint and Anniſe, and to leaue the weighty matters of the Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23. Others beate firſt and chiefly on Diſcipline, and would haue that and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe taught, a prepoſterous zeale, which wrought much diſſention, as by lamentable experience we may ſee in our Church; for this hath been an occaſion that many haue ſeparated from our Church, and that many liue diſcontent
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16091:154"/>
in it, not being firſt well grounded in the principall: firſt, faith and repentance muſt bee taught, and afterward Church-gouernment.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Rule is,<note place="margin">The ſecond Rule</note> All muſt bee done decently and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for ſo is the expreſſe Rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. Firſt then, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency is required in Church-gouernment; this is required in ciuill and naturall duties; and therefore in Chriſtian and religious duties it is required much more. Now this is not in all places alike: for we muſt vnderſtand, that that which is decent in one place, may bee vncomely in another: that is to be reputed decent in any place,<note place="margin">That is vncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one place which is decent in another. What is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted decent.</note> which the cuſtomes and faſhions of the place, not repugnant to the Rules of Nature, Ciuilitie and Gods Word haue made decent; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, propheſying with the hat on, in the Church of Corinth vndecent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. but in the reformed Churches in France, made decent by Cuſtome, they being in Gods ſtead to ſpeake vnto the people, they thinke they may bee coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Therefore ſtill ſuch cuſtomes are to bee conſidered, and accordingly decency to be eſteemed. Secondly, Order is required in Churchgouernment, ſo it is in all other things, ſpecially it muſt be ſo in Gods Church, he being the Author and God of order, and not of confuſion. This was it that commended and graced <hi>Salomons</hi> houſe exceedingly, ſo that the Queene of Sheba was rauiſht to ſee it in the 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.5. and ſhall hee that is greater than <hi>Salomon,</hi> the Lord Ieſus want it in his houſe, the Church. It is a ſpeciall grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the viſible Church, and therfore <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaking of the order of Gods Church, ſhewes how comely it is, <hi>Thy teeth are like a flocke of ſheepe in good order, which go vp from the waſhing, &amp;c. Dauid</hi> was enamoured with it <hi>Pſa.</hi> 68.25. ſpeaking as vnder a vaile of the godly order which is in Gods Church, faith, the <hi>Singers went before,</hi> the <hi>Players of inſtruments came after, and in the midſt were the maides playing with Timbrells.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Order extends it ſelfe to two things. Firſt, to things to be done.</note> Now this order extends it ſelfe to two things; firſt, in things to bee done in the Church: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the perſons that doe them. Firſt, in things to bee done, there muſt be order as in propheſying, that one ſpeak
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:16091:155"/>
after another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.31. and ſo in order the Word muſt bee preacht before the Sacraments be adminiſtred; prayer muſt bee before preaching; Baptiſme before the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; as alſo ſmaller matters muſt bee layd by, while greater are in handling, <hi>Act.</hi> 6 2. ſometimes extraordinary caſes of neceſſity may ouerbeare this Rule, but generally it muſt bee thus. So there muſt bee order in Perſons, the Superiours muſt bee firſt reſpected,<note place="margin">Secondly, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> whether hee bee ſuperior in yeares, or in gifts and graces, the Paſtor muſt rule the flocke, and not the flocke the Paſtor. Finally, it is with vs in the Church, as it is with Souldiers in the field, euery man is placed by the Captaine, and muſt keepe his ranke; And ſo it muſt bee with vs, wee muſt keepe our ranke that God hath placed vs in in the Church, and not breake out, for that is a grieuous ſinne: I would this were well looked into in our Church, that men would not go beyond their rankes for this breedes diſorder and confuſion in the Church.</p>

               <note place="margin">The third Rule.</note>The third Rule is, that the peace of the Church bee not broken nor troubled, the Apoſtle in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.3. would haue vs, whatſoeuer wee doe, to keepe peace; and hee vſeth a ſpeciall phraſe there; <hi>Keepe the vnitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace:</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, if yee keepe not peace, which is the bond, your ſpirituall Communion is in danger to bee ſoone diſſolued. And in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. the Apoſtle teacheth that contentiouſnes is not tolerated in the churches of God. The enuious Serpent, and his inſtruments, haue a ſpeciall delight in diſturbing this peace, and ſpares no means but ſeekes all aduantages, for the ſowing of diſſention in the Church: and the members of the Church are too apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue of it, elſe he could not doe vs that harme he doth, vnleſſe we were ſo apprehenſiue of diſſention amongſt our ſelues. Now as the peace of the Church is indangered in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;<note place="margin">Three wayes how peace is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered.</note> ſo eſpecially in theſe: Firſt, when men are addicted to one Miniſter before another, one to <hi>Paul,</hi> another to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, &amp;c.</hi> this comes of a carnall mind, as the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and thus they wrong themſelues and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters too: themſelues, in that they are hindred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:16091:155"/>
from the good they might haue: and their Miniſters, becauſe that they make Contention betwixt them, where otherwiſe none would bee. Secondly, this peace is indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the election of Officers; ſome breeding and making factions for one againſt another, as their affections leade them. Thirdly, it is indangered in deciding controuerſies either of Religion or State; one will be croſſing and thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting another in the heate of Contention and ſtrife; yea, happily rent themſelues from the Church, if it may not goe as they would haue it. Let Gods children bee admoniſhed to haue no part in ſuch Contentions, but let them labour for the peace of the Church, if they will haue peace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; for wee are called to peace, to mind and to ſpeake one thing; if the good things wee ſeeke for may quietly and peaceably bee obtained, it is well; let God haue the glory, and our ſelues may comfortably enioy the benefit of them. But if they cannot bee had without breaking the peace of the Church, what is to bee done? They may haue comfort, for they haue diſcharged their Conſciences in ſeeking the beſt things, and let them bewaille the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the times, and keepe themſelues vnſpotted of thoſe corruptions, and pray to God for redreſſe. Thus are wee to ſeeke the peace of the Church, and not bee any cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention whereby it may be broken.</p>
            <p>The fourth Rule to bee obſerued in the manner of the carriage of Church buſineſſe is,<note place="margin">The fourth Rule.</note> that whoſoeuer hath any right in the performance of any ſuch Duties, bee not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, nor rſterained of their right; but that they be called to the buſineſſe, and permitted to ſpeake, and doe freely ſo farre as the Lord hath put into their hands: For then the Lord is beſt pleaſed with a Buſineſſe, when it is ioyntly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by eueryone that is authoriſed by himſelf therto: the Magiſtrate muſt not neglect the Miniſter, nor the Miniſter muſt neglect the Magiſtrate. The Paſtor muſt not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the flocke, nor muſt the flocke neglect the Paſtor, but euery man muſt haue his due, and doe his duty. Looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Act.</hi> 15.23. and ſee how the buſineſſe was carried there,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:16091:156"/>
the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Three wayes how this rule is broken.</note> and the Elders, and the Brethren had a hand in that buſineſſe, euery man ſo farre as concerned him. Oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it comes to paſſe, that there is a <hi>Diotrephes</hi> found in the Church, as in the third Epiſtle of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that loues to haue the preheminence, and to ſway all with their owne hand; there this rule is broken, ſometimes in a Church, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church are wrung out of the hands of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and paſſed by another authority, onely he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and publiſh what others haue done, himſelfe can haue no further hold in them; here likewiſe this Rule is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: Laſtly, many abuſe their Chriſtian liberty to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the weake, and ſo this Rule is broken; for the weak brother hath his intereſt in my liberty, as well as my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The fifth Rule.</note>The fifth and laſt Rule is, that all things in the outward Gouernment of the Church muſt bee ſo carried, as beſt (ſo farre forth as may be) fits the Gouernment of the ciuill State wherein wee liue. I would not haue any thinke, that wee would draw Religion to the bent of the outward State, but wee ſpeake of outward Gouernment in the Church, that wee ſay, muſt not croſſe the well eſtabliſhed Gouernment of the ciuill State, to cauſe Innouations, and changes, and troubles, and confuſions, ſpecially in a Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. It was neuer our Sauiours meaning, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage of Religion, ſhould ouerthrow the carriage of the temporall State; But that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould haue as well that which is <hi>Caeſars,</hi> as God that which is Gods. I ſpeake of a politike State already eſtabliſhed by lawfull Authority, and confirmed by wholeſome Lawes, and maintained by the ancient vſe and cuſtome of the place, there Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in afterwards, it muſt bee framed for the outward carriage of it to the ciuill State; except wherein Religion is plainely contradicted. Our Sauiour no doubt was as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of ciuill Chriſtian States, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was of the Iewiſh Policy; but there Church-gouernment was fitted to their ciuill State, and ſo muſt ours. But you will ſay, that both ciuill State, and their Church-gouernment were each of them directly and equally from God. True, and are not all
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16091:156"/>
the powers that are ordained of God? So the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. and therefore though the Gouernment of ciuill States bee not now ſo immediatly from God as the Iewes was, yet it is from God too; and therefore by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion where the gouernment of the ciuill State is ratified by vſe, Religion comming in afterwards, in all equitie and reaſon it is to bee carried accordingly, for the outward paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of it. When the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> perſwades the ſcattered Iewes to ſubmit themſelues to all manner ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. it is a plain warning to them, that nothing bee done by them in their particular carriage, much leſſe in the outward Gouernment of the Church, which might bee preiudiciall to the gouernment of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill State; they muſt not croſſe that, vnleſſe that croſſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as I ſaid before. The want of the due obſeruation of this Rule, hath made many become Anabaptiſts, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Gouernment, and in many places it hath made Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion fare the worſe, and the profeſſors thereof to bee tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for rebellious, troubleſome, and dangerous people, Enemies to the State. So much for the manner of the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Church Buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the third and laſt generall head,<note place="margin">
                  <p>The third head, and that is the end.</p>
                  <p>And there be two kinds of them:</p>
               </note> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the end that muſt bee aimed at in doing theſe Duties, that muſt bee good too. It muſt bee done with a ſingle end, and a ſincere affection and intention, free from all ſiniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, either to themſelues or others. There are two good ends which wee muſt ayme at in all actions concerning Church-gouernment; the firſt is, the glory of God, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  is, the edification of our Brethren. Firſt, wee muſt aime wholy and onely at Gods glory: ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whatſoeuer yee doe, let all bee done to the glory of God.</hi> For it is Gods buſineſſe, his gifts, and officers, and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of purpoſe appointed for his glory after a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and therefore this requires a true zeale for the Lord of Hoaſts, for the aduancing of his Kingdome, and the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his Name; as alſo it requires vprightneſſe of heart, that laying aſide all guile, couetouſneſſe, ambition, pleaſing
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:16091:157"/>
of men, they may meerely intend the honour and glory of their Lord and Maſter. The ſecond end is, that all tend to the edification of their Brethren; ſo the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. would haue <hi>all things in the Church done for edification:</hi> and ſo hee carries himſelf; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.19. <hi>for the Lord hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained officers in his Church, &amp; giuen them gifts for that end,</hi> as it is in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. therfore that is the matter that all muſt direct themſelues vnto. Now this matter of edification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires two graces;<note place="margin">Two graces ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for this: Firſt, wiſedome.</note> firſt, wiſdome; ſecondly, loue: If we haue not theſe graces, we ſhall neuer take this courſe. Firſt, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires wiſdome to obſerue &amp; diſcerne what courſes are moſt profitable for edification, and that to follow: as the Miniſter is wiſely to obſerue the times and ſeaſons he liues in, and the Perſons that he hath to deale withall, and ſo to inſiſt chiefly on ſuch points, as are fit for ſuch ſeaſons and perſons: to giue milke to the weake, and meate to the ſtrong: hee muſt be a wiſe Steward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giuing to euery one in Gods houſe his portion in due ſeaſon: where this Rule is obſerued, it wil be a ſingular furtherance to the labors of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Church. As wiſdom is required in this duty, ſo alſo in the ſecond place loue is required, in commiſerating the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the weake,<note place="margin">Secondly, love.</note> and in hauing compaſſion of the damnable eſtate of poore ignorant and vnbeleeuing Soules, vnfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring and labouring their conuerſion; and for that cauſe framing themſelues and their courſes, ſo as may bee fitteſt to bring them to God; they muſt with the Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all to all, that they may winne ſome. Loue is a farre more excellent vertue and more beneficiall to the Church than knowledge; knowledge puffes vp, ſaith the Apoſtle, but loue edifieth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. knowledge without loue makes men proud, it tends to oſtentation; but loue alwayes ſeekes and labours for thoſe things onely that may edifie. Then doe men ſwerue from this golden Rule of edification, when they enact Lawes, ordaine Ceremonies, vſe preaching gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for the maintenance of the ſtate, more than for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; yea,<note place="margin">When this Rule is ſwerved from.</note> then they commit high impiety in this kinde, when they vſe courſes and paſſages in Church-gouernment
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:16091:157"/>
to deſtruction, not to edification; yea, as ſnares to entrappe tender Conſciences, at leaſt to prouoke and offend them. This is againſt the Apoſtles Rule, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 3. our power (ſaith hee) is giuen for edification, not for deſtruction. Put the caſe that thoſe things which bee impoſed be lawfull; muſt wee doe them preſently? No, not vnleſſe they edifie our brother ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>Wee muſt beare with the weake, and euery man muſt pleaſe his neighbour in that which is good to edification.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Let vs follow thoſe things which concerne peace, and wherewith one may edifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All things are lawfull for me, but all things edifie not:</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, Wee muſt not doe all lawfull things vnleſſe they edifie. So then this is the end of all our Actions to bee done in the Church, they muſt bee done to Gods glory, and the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our brother. And ſo much ſhall ſerue touching the rules and lawes whereby the Officers muſt bee guided in performing their Actions and Duties in the Church.</p>
            <p>Now it remaines onely that I inſtance (as I promiſed) in two or three duties, fitting them to the Perſons and Rules.<note place="margin">Inſtances in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers duties.</note> And firſt, I will inſtance in the firſt duty, which was the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  Word, Sacraments, and Prayer. Now as theſe are to be had in the Church, ſo they muſt be adminiſtred; firſt, by ſuch perſons; and ſecondly, by ſuch Rules, as God in his wiſdome hath ordained and fitted for them. And firſt, we will ſpeak of the Perſons, then of the Duties. Firſt, the Perſons to deale in euery of theſe duties (in the publike vſe) are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, be they Biſhops, Paſtors, or Presbyters, they and all of them, and none but they are to deale in them; their very name imports ſo much, they are called Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments, and ſo Prayer, it holds by propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Prieſts of the Law, for they and none elſe were to offer Sacrifices. I ſpeake of ordinary caſes: But neceſſitie ſometime inforceth otherwiſe, yet ſome are expreſly excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt in this caſe, as women they are not to ſpeake in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. and therefore whereas ſometimes they take vpon them to baptize, this is an horrible preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:16091:158"/>
in them, and a profanation of Gods Myſteries. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Rules whereby they muſt be directed in doing theſe duties are theſe: firſt, the preaching of the Word, for the matter of it, it muſt bee Gods Word alone, and that which is built vpon it; for the manner, it muſt be ſincerely preacht, not making merchandize thero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and truly and rightly agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Analogie of faith, and inſtantly and continually, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, reuerently and conſcionably, and powerfully, not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the Word of the liuing God. ſecondly, the Sacraments, thoſe and none other muſt bee adminiſtred, which Chriſt hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and that rightly and in ſuch manner as Chriſt and his Apoſtles inſtituted them: but yet wee are not bound to euery Circumſtance; For Chriſt and the Apoſtles were baptized when they were of yeeres; ſo muſt not wee bee. Thirdly, Prayer, that muſt bee fitted for euery oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ſinnes muſt bee confeſt, iudgements muſt be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt, bleſſings muſt bee thankfully remembred; And this muſt bee done both for themſelues and others, and all feruently and in the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So much for the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  The ſecond inſtance ſhall be in the ſecond Dutie Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Officers: and here alſo conſider; Firſt, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that muſt performe this duty; ſecondly, the Rules they muſt bee directed by. Firſt, the Perſons that are to deale in it; for Miniſters, it muſt bee thoſe that are in ſuperiour place and degree, the Gouernours of the Church, but yet with approbation of fellow Miniſters. So for Deacons or Church-wardens and other inferiour Officers; they muſt bee choſen by the Miniſter and people together. Wee ſee a preſident for this in <hi>Act.</hi> 6. where the Apoſtles referred this partly to the people, that they ſhould chuſe out certaine from amongſt themſelues for this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and yet ſtill they had an eye to it, and a hand in it too, as wee may ſee in that place. Secondly, the Rules they muſt proceede by in this Duty, and ſpecially in election of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, are theſe: Firſt, is examination and tryall of their gifts,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:16091:158"/>
ſo it is implied of the Miniſtery in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21, 22. <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo it is expreſt in Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Let them firſt bee proued, then let them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</hi> If it be ſo of Deacons, much more of Miniſters. The ſecond Rule they are to proceed by, is approbation: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. <hi>He (that is, a Biſhop) muſt be alſo well reported of, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Timothy, Act.</hi> 16.2. <hi>That the brethren reported well of him.</hi> Thirdly, there muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3. After they had faſted and prayed they layd their hands vpon <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> &amp;c. And in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Timothy, deſpiſe not the gift that is in thee — which was giuen thee by Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and laying on of the hands of the company of the Elderſhip.</hi> Fourthly, there muſt bee faſting and Prayer, that is plaine, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3. Laſtly, both the chooſers and the choſen muſt haue God before their eies, that without any ſiniſter reſpect the one ſeeke, and the other admit: alſo the choſen muſt ſolemnly promiſe a conſcionable care to performe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty impoſed vpon him faithfully; this they muſt make open proteſtation of.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  Now we will come to the third duty, to inſtance in that, and that is the Duties of charity: heere conſider, firſt, that theſe duties muſt be done: ſecondly, the Perſons to deale in theſe duties; and thirdly, the Rules that they are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by. Firſt, theſe Duties muſt be done, for it was ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.7. <hi>If one of thy Brethren with thee be poorer, thou ſhalt not harden thine heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ſhut thine hand from thy poore brother:</hi> then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore they muſt bee prouided for. Againe, theſe Duties are firſt the fruits of our faith, <hi>Titus.</hi> 3.8. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they are vnſeparable conſequents of our loue to God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.7. and 4.21. Thirdly, they are badges of our profeſſion. Fourthly, this may bee our caſe heereafter. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is the meaſure of our iudgement, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. Sixthly, ciuill and carnall men doe the like. Secondly, the Perſons to deale in this Duty are Miniſters and people. Thirdly, the Rules they are to bee done by, are many and excellent. Firſt, they muſt be done with cheerefullneſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Let him that ſheweth mercy doe it with cheerefulneſſe:</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Let euery man giue not grudgingly: for God loueth a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full giuer.</hi> Secondly, they muſt bee done with ſpeed, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Say not to thy brother, goe and come againe to morrow, and I will giue thee, if thou now haue it.</hi> Thirdly, they muſt bee done without hypocriſie in ſingleneſſe and ſimplicity of heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.1, <hi>&amp;c. Giue not your almes before men</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>to be ſeene of them: Rom.</hi> 8.12. <hi>let him that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributeth doe it with ſimplicity.</hi> Fourthly, it muſt bee done arcording to the ability of the giuer, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>For if there be firſt a willing minde, it is accepted, according to that a man hath, and not according to that a man hath not.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Euery man muſt lay vp, and giue to the poore, as God hath proſpered him.</hi> Fifthly, it muſt bee done according to the need of the Receiuer, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.35. <hi>The Apoſtle diſtributed to euery man as they had need.</hi> Laſtly, it muſt bee done with an eye to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.42, 43. <hi>Whoſoeuer receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, ſhall receiue a Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and hee that giueth a cup of cold water to drinke, to one of theſe little ones in the name of a Diſciple, he ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi> And ſo much ſhall ſerue for the inſtances.</p>
            <p>Yea, but will ſome ſay, what if I liue in a Church where theſe things are not done? I anſwer, that yet wee muſt not forſake the Communion of the Church, if the principall and eſſentiall matters bee in ſome competent meaſure prouided for; wee muſt not ſeparate from the communion of the Church; much is to bee borne and ſuffred (rather than that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:16091:159"/>
bee committed) both in the Parties that doe thoſe things; ſpecially in the tolerating and yeelding to theſe things, of thoſe that are not to bee Actors and Doers of them; there is ſome difference betwixt the doer and the ſufferer: when a man is an actor and doer in theſe things, if that bee impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon him, which is againſt his Conſcience, hee ſinnes in doing of it; as if the Miniſter bee to weare a Garment, &amp;c. hee were better leaue his Miniſtery, then ſinne againſt his Conſcience; but the Sufferer, they haue no reaſon to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare comming to the Lords Table for that, becauſe they are no Actors in it.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it muſt bee appropriate to thoſe Parties to whom it is granted; that is, it muſt bee free to them, and euery of them to enioy, and peculiar to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, others muſt bee abridged and debarred from it: this is the vſe of the word amongſt vs, in the nature of it: It is otherwiſe vſed in prophane authours, but we ſpeake in our owne language, and therefore we ſpeake of it, as it is in vſe amongſt vs.</p>

take it thus, the Church of God hath her priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that is, there are certaine excellent priuiledges belonging to the true viſible Church, which all that are of the Church, and they alone, haue right and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in, and are denied to all others:  <label type="milestone">

               </label>  For proofe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, It is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. laſt verſe, <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with euerie nation,</hi> that is, he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation; the Prophet ſpeakes there of Gods dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Iſrael</hi> then, and, by Conſequence, of his dealing towards his Church for euer. Now God had many Nations in the world beſides <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and he deales mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully and graciouſly and bountifully with them all, and giues them food and rayment, and health and life and all; But ſo, as with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, ſo mercifully and ſo bountifully, he deales not with any Nation: No, he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation vnder the Sunne, as with them; and as God dealt with them, ſo he deales with his Church, from time to time, hee vouchſafeth them more excellent Priuiledges then all the world beſides. And in the 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.9. <hi>Yee are a peculiar people,</hi> that is, ſuch a people as the Lord hath endued with many excellent Priuiledges, proper and peculiar to them alone: And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.3. they are called, <hi>Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ones,</hi> what is that, but priuate ones? And what are priuiledges, but certaine Conditions granted to ſome priuate States or Perſons? So then, the Church are Gods ſecret ones, as who ſhould ſay, hee granteth them many excellent priuiledges, which none other are partakers of: And in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. the Church is called Gods <hi>Chiefe Treaſure;</hi> It is true, that all <hi>the Earth is the Lords,</hi> and is all full of his Treaſures; but his Church is his chiefe Treaſure; Siluer hath her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue aboue all baſer mettall, and gold his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue aboue ſiluer, but Pearles and precious Iewels are a chiefe Treaſury, and haue prerogatiue aboue all the reſt. <hi>Sodom</hi> was <hi>a goodly City like Eden;</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> was <hi>a fat and fruitfull Soile;</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To goe forward, <hi>Baſhan is a high mountaine;</hi> But <hi>Zion</hi> is farre beyond that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.15.16.

               <note place="margin">Reaſons.</note>The Reaſons, why the viſible Church hath ſuch Priuiledges are theſe; Firſt, euery Company and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Cittie haue certaine Priuiledges of their owne; therefore the Church, the Company of the faithfull, the Cittie of the great King, muſt haue hers much  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſpeciall fauour and loue, which God doth beare to his Church, is ſuch, that he can doe no leſſe for them; Thoſe whom the Kings of the earth moſt fauour, on them they beſtow the greateſt Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: Therefore whom the King of Kings fauours moſt of all, that is, the Church, hee is to beſtow on them greater and better priuiledges, then any King can giue, but God onely; or any ſubiect can receiue, but Gods owne Dearlings.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  Thirdly, the Church hath many offices to performe towards God, in ſpiritual and heauenly duties, as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſuch like, which they cannot poſſibly performe, vnleſſe they bee, by Gods owne ſpeciall priuiledges, exempted from other Imployments, and enabled to theſe.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  Fourthly, their neareneſſe to Chriſt, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him requires it, they are his Sheepe, and hee is their Sheepherd, and ſhall not hee know them, and ſo ſet his mark vpon them, and call them by name, and lead them foorth into greene Paſtures, &amp;c. ſhall not he guide and comfort, and preſerue and priuiledge them, from ſuch things as other flockes are ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? yea, their oneneſſe with him requires it: hee is the Husband, the Church is his Spouſe, they are one; and ſhall not hee giue her a wedding Ring, his hand, and his heart? ſhall not he apparell and decke her and cheriſh her in his boſome, and affoord her his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable preſence at bed and at boord, as we ſay? And many other ſuch priuiledges, which non elſe can enioy yea, he is the head, &amp; the Church is his body and ſhall not he enliue, and quicken, nouriſh, direct, defend and

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  Fiftly, the Merit of Chriſt requires it, which being infinite in it ſelfe, and wholly imparted to the Church, muſt needes purchaſe and procure from God many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Priuiledges, ſuch as are fit for them.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  Sixtly, the Church is ſeparate from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtate and condition of others in the world, by their very Calling and Being of the Church; therefore it is neceſſary, that they ſhould haue ſome notable Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to bee enioyed in that State, in regard, that they are depriued of ſuch as are common to others.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>  Seauenthly and laſtly, many Afflictions are to bee  ſuffered and endured of the Church, not onely in that State, but euen for it; and therefore, ſome excellent Priuiledges are beſtowed vpon them, to comfort their hearts, and to make them a full amends, for all the wrongs, croſſes, and loſſes, that therby they vndergoe.</p>
            <p>The vſes of the point are theſe;  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>  Is it ſo that God hath beſtowed ſo many excellent Priuiledges vpon the Church; then firſt, this ſhould teach vs to glorifie God, that doth ſo mercifully grace and glorifie vs; and firſt in generall we are to acknowledge with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe Gods ſpeciall Loue and Fauour to his Church, that beſtowes ſuch excellent Priuiledges and Royall Prerogatiues vpon it. Secondly in ſpeciall wee muſt acknowledge with all thankefulneſſe, that amongſt the reſt, this Land, wherein wee liue, is gathered into his Church, and therby hath long and doth ſtill enioy ſuch priuiledges; &amp; that as we are a part of his Church, ſo we haue part in all her Priuiledges: And thirdly we muſt thankfully acknowledge more in particular, that wee, that are here preſent, haue our parts in the Church, and that we are members, liuing &amp; ſound members therof,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16091:163"/>
and ſo that we haue right and ſpeciall claime in them all: And this benefit will appeare to bee the greater, if wee conſider, firſt, that it is denied to others, and yet affoorded to vs; that Child or Subiect, that is ſpecially ſingled out, by the Father or King, from the reſt of the Children or Subiects, to haue a richer portion then they, to haue a ſecond Meſſe, as <hi>Beniamin</hi> had, is not he ſingularly bound to that father or King? This is our caſe in reſpect of many thouſands in the world, they are left, wee are taken; they euer in harmes-way, wee are priuiledged; alas, they are his Creatures as well as wee, and wee are duſt and aſhes as well as they, why ſhould wee haue better at Gods hands then they? Yea, wee are ſinners as well as they; why then are we priuiledged from thoſe Euills, which they are ſubiect vnto? Why doth not this land wallow in the darkneſſe of Heatheniſme, Idolatry, Turciſme, Iudaiſme, Papiſtry, &amp;c: as the the greateſt part of the world doth beſides?

A worldly man is not troubled, but hath peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe round about him; yea, but thou haſt peace with God and in thine owne conſcience, and this is the right peace. A worldly man liues at his owne will, and doth what himſelfe liſt; yea, but thou liueſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods Will, and doeſt, in ſome meaſure, what hee commandes, this is the Life of God; heauenly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Life. Worldly men, they and their children are gayly and richly apparrelled, and fare deliciouſly euery day: yea, but what art thou the worſe for that; that which they haue, is but for the outward man, that which thou haſt, is for the inward man; thou art cloathed with the rich Robe of Chriſts Righteouſnes, this is rich and gay Apparell indeed; and thou art fed with ſpirituall food, the Word and Sacraments, and Gods Comforts, and the continuall Feaſt of a good Conſcience: this is the daintieſt fare and the ſweeteſt diſhes that can bee ſet on our tables, if wee were Angels wee could haue no better: yea, marke further thou ſhalt ſee the time, when they and theirs for all their preſent glory, ſhall die like Beaſts, and afterward be tormented in hell with the Rich man for euer; whereas thou and thine being brought vp in Gods Feare, ſhall die Gods deare Saints and Children, and afterwards bee alſo glorified in Heauen, and that for euer. If wicked rich men would conſider and vnderſtand this, it would quell them in their greateſt mirth, and abate their haughty thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and their pride, and their Contempt of Gods Children, and their Cruelty againſt them: And ſo if Gods Children would ſeriouſly conſider of it, they

            <p>Secondly, ſuch as are proper to Beleeuers onely,<note place="margin">2. proper to the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, and theſe of two ſorts. 1. matters of preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes.</note> as the Spirit of Adoption, and ſuch like; and theſe are alſo of two ſorts. Firſt, matters of preſent poſſeſſion; ſecondly, matters of future certainty. Firſt, matters of preſent poſſeſſion, and they conſiſt of diuers kinds. Firſt, wee are priuiledged in reſpect of God; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of the Creatures; Thirdly, in reſpect of Gods ordinary dealings in the world; Fourthly, in reſpect of the workes, hee doth for vs; Fiftly, in regard of the graces hee workes in vs; Sixtly, in reſpect of the comfort hee impartes to vs; And laſtly, in regard of the liberty he giues vs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they are priuiledged in reſpect of God, hee is theirs, and they are his; God the Father is their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Maſter, and Preſeruer; they are his Children, Creatures and Charge. Ieſus Chriſt is their Head, they are his members; hee is their husband, they are his Spouſe; hee is their Sauiour, they are his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; hee is their Aduocate, they are his Clyents; hee hee is their Sheepherd, they are his Sheepe; yea,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16091:166"/>
they in ſome ſort are one with him, and hee with them; ſo likewiſe the holy Ghoſt, he is their maſter, they are his Schollers; he is their Leader, they are his followers; he is their Counſellour, they are his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; he is their Sanctifier, they are his Temple; hee is their Quickner, they are his frame and workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to a new Creature. Yea, the whole bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doe moſt graciouſly concurre by their perſonall Actions in euery part of our Saluation: here is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar priuiledge; if we had no more but only this, it were enough to ſtirre vs vp to glorifie God, and to comfort vs againſt all our preſent afflictions; how truely then may we ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. laſt, <hi>Bleſſed are the people that are in ſuch a caſe, yea, bleſſed are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> Secondly, we are priuiledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reſpect of the Creatures, the holy Angels are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and attendants vpon the Church; they are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Spirits ſent forth for their ſakes: The Saints in Heauen acknowledge vs to bee Members of their Body, the Catholique Church, and doe inſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the full accompliſhment of our ſaluation, that they and we may be perfected together. The Saints on earth loue vs, pray for vs, reioyce at our good; ſorrow at our harmes: The wicked of the world oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and admire vs for our holineſſe, and the good things wee haue, though otherwiſe we be moſt odious to them; yea, all the vnreaſonable and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Creatures, in heauen and earth, are at League with vs; yea, the Diuels are ſubdued to vs, and troden vnder our feete; yea, further, the damned in hell, that ſcorned and hated vs whileſt they did liue, doe now acknowledge that our eſtate is exceeding happy; and curſe themſelues that they had ſo little grace in their life, as not to ioyne themſelues to our Societies and practiſe our courſes; yea, the whole world is ours, it was made for our vſe and ſeruice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>euen all things are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:16091:166"/>Thirdly, in reſpect of Gods ordinary dealings and proceedings in the world, wee haue our priuiledges, whether he ſtrikes or ſpares, giues or takes away, rains or ſhines, kills or giues life, bleſſeth or curſeth, helpes or forſakes, whether it bee man or a beaſt, good or bad, whole kingdomes or priuate perſons, Church or Commonwealth; we haue our priuiledge and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit in and by them, they are all done with a ſpeciall Eye and intendment towards vs, and ſo they <hi>all worke together for the beſt vnto vs,</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. All Gods Iudgements are our Schoolmaſters; his bleſſings, our comforts; his warnings, our counſellours; his lawes our rules; his dealings, our directions: Specially thoſe dealings which God exerciſeth towards our ſelues, are matters of ſpeciall priuiledge to vs; when hee bleſſeth vs, that is a matter of ſpeciall priuiledge to vs; for we haue them by promiſe, we eſteeme and embrace them as pledges of his loue, and we vſe them aright to the glory of the giuer: for want of which priuiledge, the very bleſſings of the wicked are heauy Curſes: Againe, God chaſtens vs, and it is our priuiledge, hee chaſtens vs in the world, <hi>that wee might not bee condemnedwith the world,</hi> as it is in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. and <hi>to you is it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>not onely to beleeue in Chriſt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for to ſuffer for his ſake:</hi> For want of which Priuiledge to the wicked, all their preſent puniſhments are the beginnings of their Torments in hell; Againe, God ſometimes takes away his Spirit from vs for a while; and then wee mourne and grieue, and being left to our ſelues, oftentimes wee ſinne grieuouſly, and then our caſe is moſt fearfull, yet by vertue of our priuiledge in Chriſt, theſe very deſertions of his, &amp; ſins of ours, work by contraries, for when we come to our ſelues againe, they work more grace in vs, and make vs wiſer for the time to come, and worke more conſcience in vs of our waies, &amp; bring vs greater comfort afterwards, for war of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the wicked are left in their ſins, and are hardned

therein and periſh for euer. Laſtly, he kills vs and we die, but by vertue of our priuiledge in Chriſt, and his death; this very death of ours, is aduantage to vs, for a better life; whereas to the wicked it is the end of their happines; and the beginning of all their miſery. Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 The workes God doth for the faithfull.</note> wee are alſo priuiledged in reſpect of the workes God doth for vs; what are theſe? Firſt, hee chuſeth vs to ſaluation, whereas hee leaues others in the maſſe of the old <hi>Adam</hi> to periſh iuſtly by their  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  owne ſinnes; this is a ſecret priuiledge, but yet the moſt excelent, and the foundation of all the reſt; for becauſe the Lord hath choſen vs, therefore wee haue all theſe Priuiledges; when hee hath choſen vs, then we muſt haue a being; why, God giues vs our being too: But you will ſay, God giues the wicked a being; yea, but we haue it for good, and not for euill, elſe it  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  were a thouſand times better that we had neuer beene borne: Then he redeemes vs, and payes all our Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and makes full ſatisfaction for vs; whereas hee lets all the reſt of the world lye by it, bound in the chaines of their ſinnes, till they haue paid the laſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Then hee calles vs, and that effectually; not  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  onely preaching to vs, but opening our eyes, eares and hearts, that wee may vnderſtand and beleeue, and ſo be ſaued; whereas hee caſts a vaile ouer the hearts of others, that though they heare, yet they might not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, leſt they ſhould be conuerted, and ſo be ſaued; Then he iuſtifies vs, imputing to vs his obedience, and  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <hi>couering vs with his owne righteouſneſſe;</hi> the reſt of the world, the Lord Ieſus lets alone, ſtanding defiled in their blood, vgly and odious with all their ſinnes on them, before the face of God, an Angry Iudge, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, and to caſt them into vtter darknes: Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  hee ſanctifies vs, he changeth our hearts, and our wils, &amp; our affection, and <hi>ſubdues our nature and brings it vnder the Obedience of his bleſſed Will, renuing vs into his owne glorious Image;</hi> whereas all the reſt of the world

are left in the ſlauery and bondage of the Deuill being his Children, and hauing his Image on them (but this is more naturall to the next head) theſe things are ſo nearely depending on each other, that we can make no perfect and exact diſtinction; but, for Doctrine ſake, they are to be ſundred howſoeuer, that we may know varietie of our Priuiledges.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the Graces God workes in vs, are a Priuiledge to vs, as Faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and in all Gods promiſes; Repentance for our ſinnes, Mortification of the old man, and quickning of the new man; hatred of ſinne, and loue of righteouſneſſe; Loue to God, and his Religion, and to his Children; zeale for his Glory; patience in afflictions; ſtrength againſt temptations; he workes in vs knowledge, wiſedome, hope, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, loathing of ſinne, and of the world, and a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and haſting for the comming of the Lord Ieſus to Iudgement, and hee workes in vs a ſanctified heart, to make a ſauing vſe of the Word and the Sacraments, and of all occurrences that befall vs, and euery fruit of the ſpirit: and this God work in vs, either indeed, or at leaſt, in deſire, either more or leſſe, ſooner or later.

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>  Seuenthly, the liberties that are attained by vs are a priuiledge to vs; Conſider what is or might be againſt vs, wee are freed from it, and looke what is or may be for vs; that we haue liberty in, for the firſt what is or might be againſt vs, that we haue freedome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the <hi>Son hath made vs free, Iohn</hi> 8.36. Firſt, Gods Iuſtice was agianſt vs, to hurt vs, and to condemne vs for our ſins; wee are ſinners, and God is Iuſt, and hates ſin, and how can we ſtand before him? But that we haue this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by Chriſt, that hee hath fully ſatisfied for all our ſinnes, and ſo wee are freed from this danger; ſo that now to vs in Chriſt, God is a mercifull Father, not a Iuſt Iudge; yea, Chriſt hauing ſatisfied the Iuſtice of God, to the full, for vs, we may reuerently challenge the Lord, in the Name of Chriſt, that he cannot puniſh vs, hauing puniſhed one for vs; and ſo Chriſts merits, being all-ſufficient, haue purchaſed all good things for vs; ſo that now Iuſtice is for vs, to giue vs that which is due to Chriſt; not againſt vs, to giue vs our owne deſeruings: Secondly, the Law is againſt vs, and, like <hi>Saul,</hi> breathes out threatnings againſt the Church of God; ſaying, If thou doeſt not this, thou ſhalt dye; but this is ſatisfied too; <hi>Chriſt tooke on him the curſe of the Law,</hi> and ſo redeemed vs from it, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.13.

               <hi>Death deſtroyes him that had power of death, which is the diuell,</hi> and ſets vs at liberty; ſo that we may now ſay with the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 15.56.57. <hi>The ſting of Death is ſinne, the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law, but thanks be to God, who hath giuen vs victory, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards comes in hell for her ſhare, and opens her mouth to ſwallow vs downe quicke: Hell, that houſe of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that ſhould haue beene, by right, the houſe of our perpetuall habitation and aboade; but <hi>Chriſt Ieſus hee hath triumphed for vs ouer Hell and Condemnation, ſo that now there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. Laſtly, the diuell, who is the ground of all theſe forces, hee had fingered vs, and got vs within his clutches, and wrapt vs vp in chaines and fetters, as his captiues and bond-ſlaues; Chriſt Ieſus hee comes, and <hi>looſeth the workes of the diuell,</hi> 1 Ioh. 3.8. hee breakes theſe chaines, and ſubdues Satan; ſo that we may ſay with the Prophet, Pſalme 124.7. <hi>the ſnare is broken, and wee are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered;</hi> Theſe are great and rare priuileges, I would haue you wiſely to conſider of them: For, <hi>who ſo is wiſe, will ponder on theſe things, that they may vnderſtand the louing kindneſſe of the Lord;</hi> wee ſhould labour to know theſe things, and to make vſe of them, and to <hi>ſtand faſt in this liberty, and not to be intangled againe in the yoake of bondage:</hi> In the ſecond place conſider what was or could be for vs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  and all that wee haue freedome into, <hi>we haue bold acceſſe vnto the Throne of Grace, and an entrance vnto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5.2. Epheſ. 2.18. wee may goe boldly, and ſafely to God, and tell him our wants, and begge ſupply; we may <hi>talke familiarly with him, as a man doth with his neighbour,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes, wee may come vnto God, and ſay, <hi>Thou art my Father and my maker, deſpiſe not the worke of thy hands;</hi> ſo we may goe to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and ſay with <hi>Thomas, My Lord, and my God,</hi> hee by ſight, wee by faith; ſo likewiſe we may goe to the holy Spirit, and ſay, thou art my Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier and Comforter, and I am thy Temple, ſuffer not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan

to defile mee with ſinne: So likewiſe, we may haue free acceſſe to the Word, and to the Sacraments, and to all Gods promiſes, and we may lay our hands on them, and challenge them for our owne; So likewiſe, wee may alſo reach out our hands to all the creatures, as being our peculiar right; and laſtly, when we are on our death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds; wee may with our Sauiour Chriſt, and with <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſweetly and comfortably, commend our ſpirits into the hands of God, and ſay, <hi>Into thy hands O Lord I commend my ſpirit, for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth:</hi> this is an excellent priuiledge, that at the houre of death, when wee are aſſaulted with many ſore tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wee may throw them all from vs, and ſafely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our ſoules into Gods hand; and if there were no other priuiledge but this, it were enough to make vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>  to be of the Church. The eighth Priuiledge, is the power that is conferred vpon vs, to admit or reiect, to binde or looſe, &amp;c. (but this is to be ſpoken by it ſelfe in the eighth generall head following.) The laſt ſort of Priuiledges are in matters of future Certainties;<note place="margin">2. matters of future cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties.</note> I ſay, matters of future Certainties, not of poſſibilities, that is too weake a word in this ſenſe; poſſibilities are for men, as that the ſonne ſhall haue this and this after his fathers deceaſe, and yet the ſonne may be diſappointed many wayes: but with God, future poſſibilities are vndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Certainties, they are as ſurely ours, as if we had them already. Now theſe are, firſt, perfection of all grace, now we haue them but <hi>in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.9.12. but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after wee ſhall haue them in perfection: The ſecond thing is the reſurrection of the body, but that (you will ſay) is common to the wicked too? It is true they, ſhall riſe too, but they <hi>ſhall not be able to stand in iudgement,</hi> Pſalme 1.5. they ſhall <hi>riſe to condemnation,</hi> as our Sauiour ſaith, Ioh. 5.29. It were better for them to lye ſtill, the graue is better then hell; ſo that it is no Priuiledge to them to riſe: Thirdly, wee ſhall ſtand dreadleſſe, and feareleſſe before the Iugdement Seat of God; alas, now
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16091:169"/>
wee are afraid of euery qualme, how ſhall wee ſtand dreadleſſe then? I anſwer, Then wee ſhall know God to be our Father in Chriſt, wee ſhall know that our peace is made beforehand, wee ſhall haue the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Ieſus Chriſt to couer vs, and then there ſhall be no ſinne in vs: this is it that will make vs ſtand dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: whereas the wicked, for want of this, ſhall trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quake, and call to the mountaines to fall vpon them, and to the hills to couer them. Laſtly, we ſhall haue euerlaſting glory, life and happineſſe in heauen, inioying the fellowſhip of God and Chriſt, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and the bleſſed Angells, and there wee ſhall liue continually, praiſing and glorifying God, there we <hi>ſhall haue fulneſſe of ioy and pleaſures for euermore,</hi> Pſal. 16. To conclude therefore, let vs not debaſe our ſelues to ſinfull and vile, and ſlauiſh courſes, but let vs labour to walke in ſome good meaſure, anſwerable to ſuch great and high priuiledges as theſe are.</p>

The ſecond Priuiledge queſtionable, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the neceſſity of being a member of the Church, if euer wee will attaine ſaluation; and thereupon ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this queſtion;<note place="margin">1. concerning the infallibe guidance of the Church by Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſo whether the Church can erre or no, either in manners, or in Doctrine, or in both, or in neyther.</note> whether any can be ſaued out of the Church or no? Theſe are the two points which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to handle at this time. The firſt is concerning the infallible guidance of the Church, by Gods Spirit, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ariſeth this queſtion, whether the Church may erre or no? And becauſe error is a generall name, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as wel of matters of obedience, as of knowledge, of bad ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners as well as of falſe doctrine, therfore in plaine and large termes it ſhall be propounded and handled thus: whether the Church may erre either in manners or doctrine, or in both, or in neither? to open the way to the diſcloſing of the point, wee are to vnderſtand, rightly,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16091:170"/>
theſe words, Church and Error: Firſt, concerning the word Church; for whereas, ſometimes it ſignifies the whole Company of Beleeuers liuing on earth; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſome one viſible Congregation profeſſing the Faith of Chriſt: the ſtate of the queſtion is not of both alike, but we muſt vnderſtand it far otherwiſe of the one then of the other: For whereas in the firſt ſenſe it containes Beleeuers onely, and all of them together, it muſt needs haue ſome ſpeciall Priuiledge aboue particular Congregations, at leaſt for ſome kinde of Error: Euery Beleeuer hath a Priuiledge, in that reſpect aboue an vnbeleeuer; therefore all together much more: ſo that if it bee poſſible that one or two might be ſeduced to Error, yet that all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould bee ſo, it is impoſſible: And whereas, in the ſecond ſenſe, the Church conſiſts of Hypocrites, as well as true Beleeuers; yea ſometime all, or moſt of Hypocrites, therefore the Church, taken in this ſenſe, muſt needes bee more ſubiect vnto Error, then in the former ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning the word Error: The Word of God preſcribes euery true and right way, and euery ſwaruing from that is therefore called Error, whether it be in Doctrine or manners; becauſe it is a going from that true and right way, which the Word of God doth teach vs: And though Error, properly ſignifie a ſwaruing from the Truth, whether on the right or on the left hand, yet it comprehends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is true; but yet there is great difference betwixt them; for firſt, they that erre in the foundation, are ſeldome and hardly reclaimed, not one amongſt a hundreth: but they that erre in ſmaller matters, are vſually and eaſily reclaimed; for if the foundation bee ouerthrowen, all muſt bee reared vp a new; but if any thing, that is built vpon it, be amiſſe, it may be eaſily amended; yea thoſe that erre  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  in ſmaller matters, cannot chuſe but bee reclaimed, as hauing the foundation; and therefore cannot poſſibly periſh. Secondly, thoſe that erre in the foundation, muſt repent particularly of that error, and muſt alſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the contrary Truth, elſe hee cannot be ſaued; But
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16091:171"/>
thoſe that erre in matters of leſſe moment, though they doe not repent of their error in particular: Nay, though they do not know them (for who knowes his errors) yet if they repent in general of them, they ſhall find mercy &amp; pardon from God: ſo that we ſee, there is a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt theſe. Secondly, ſome errors are either  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  of Infirmity or of Obſtinacy; Of infirmitie, as when wee are either by negligence, Ignorance, Ouerſight, weakeneſſe, as being taken tripping in a ſnare, againſt our knowledge, and againſt our purpoſe and holy deſire, or by other occaſions: ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeakes of <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Brethren, if a man be ſuddenly fallen into any offence, yee which are ſpirituall reſtore ſuch a one,</hi> &amp;c: when as they ſee it not to bee an error, or if they doe ſee it to be ſo; yet they haue ſome weake deſire and labour againſt it, but yet the aſſault is ſo ſtrong, and their corruption ſo great, that they cannot ouercome it; this is an Error of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: Some errors are of obſtinacy, that is, when as the Partie knowes the right, and yet willingly declines from it; and theſe that thus erre, are ſo far from ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing againſt their Error, that they rather ſtriue againſt a manifeſt Truth, to maintaine their Error; ſuch an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror the Iewes are taxed for, by <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7.51. and by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.26. where he applies a place out of <hi>Eſay</hi> to them, ſhewing their obſtinacie, that in <hi>ſeeing they did ſee and not perceiue,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that this is an error of obſtinacy, for a man to know the Truth, and yet willingly to decline from it. Thirdly, ſome are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and for a time onely, ſome finall and for euer: for a time onely, and vpon better Aduice they change their minde; ſuch was <hi>Peters</hi> deniall of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.75. for which hee preſently repented and <hi>went out and wept bitterly:</hi> Againe, ſome are finall and for euer, as when men liue and dye in ſinne without any Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at all, at leaſt without any true and ſound Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; ſuch was the ſinne of <hi>Iudas</hi> in betraying Chriſt, he died deſperately in it, without any true Repentance,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16091:172"/>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.3, 5. Laſtly, ſome Errors are particular, ſome are generall, and each of theſe in two reſpects; firſt, in reſpect of the perſons that erre; ſecondly in reſpect of the things they erre in, for when as one or two or ſome few men in a Congregation are tainted with Error, here is a particular Error in reſpect of the perſons, as it was in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when as but <hi>ſome</hi> of them <hi>denied the Reſurrection,</hi> and not all 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. But when as all or the greateſt part in a Church erre, this is a generall Error in reſpect of the perſons; An Inſtance of this wee haue in the Iewes, when as they did all cry out againſt our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him:</hi> So, ſecondly, in reſpect of the things erred in, as when a man or a Church erres onely in one or in few things, this is a particular Error in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſo did the Church of <hi>Pergamus, Reuel.</hi> 2.14. <hi>I haue a few things againſt thee;</hi> But when a man or a Church erres in all or the moſt things, this is generall alſo in reſpect of the things they erre in, as the Church of Rome at this day erres in all, or the moſt things and ſo their Error is generall in that reſpect, as alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their perſons. Now to apply all this to the ſubiect of the queſtion, whether the Church may erre in all, or in any of theſe reſpects, or no? If wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Church in the firſt ſenſe, for the whole Company of Beleeuers liuing on earth, in this ſenſe the Church may be ſaid to erre: firſt, in matters of ſmaller moment, not in the foundation; Secondly, of Infirmity, not of obſtinacy; Thirdly, at leaſt, onely for a time, not for euer; Fourthly, particularly, not vniuerſally; either in reſpect of the perſons or of the things: But if wee vnderſtand the Church in the latter ſenſe, of one particular Congregation, in this ſenſe, the Church may erre in all theſe; which, that I may the more largely and diſtinctly, without Confuſion, deliuer, and you apprehend, receiue it plainely in theſe Obſeruations.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is this; That the Church militant (the whole Company of Beleeuers on earth) howſoeuer it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16091:172"/>
hath many excellent Priuildges by the Spirit of truth, yet it is not ſo exempted from Error, but that it may and doth oftentimes erre both in Doctrine and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: I ſhall not neede to handle Errors in manners by themſelues, and Errors in Doctrine by themſelues, for each of theſe are tranſgreſſions againſt the Word &amp; Wil of God, and they are both damnable; and each, alike, may take hold of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe, being then a ſound, yea, a principall Member of the Church of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth ingenuouſly much Ignorance, that hee knowes little to that hee ſhould know, he knowes but in part; Now Ignorance being an Error in a generall ſenſe, as wee heard before, then we ſee that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle willingly vndergoes the Imputation of Error; and if he bee in Error, who can looke to eſcape? And therevpon it followes by neceſſary conſequence, that he erred in manners too; for wee cannot bee obedient in that wee doe not know; ſo that, as his knowledge was imperfect; ſo was his loue and obedience too: But for errors in manners, it is far plainer in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22, 23. where the Apoſtle acknowledgeth that there was <hi>a Law in</hi> his <hi>members rebelling againſt the Law of</hi> his <hi>minde, and leading</hi> him <hi>captiue vnto the law of ſinne,</hi> &amp;c: and this was not his infirmity alone, but it is the infirmity of all the Faithfull, the Spirit ſtirres them vp to doe good: yea, but, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.17. <hi>the fleſh luſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit, and the Spirit against the fleſh,</hi> and theſe are contrary one to another, ſo that you cannot doe the ſame things you would: And our Sauiour giues an Inc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling of this to his Diſciples in a kinde of Parable, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.10. where he faith, <hi>He that waſhed is needeth no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the point is vndoubtedly true of all other particular churches, that they may erre fundamentally, obſtinately, finally, and generally, and ſo ceaſe to be true viſible churches; examples will cleare it; there is no Church, but hath erred in ſome kinde, both

The like wee finde in many other Primitiue Churches, how many famous churches are falne away, that were true viſible churches in thoſe times? ſome to the Arians hereſie, ſome to the Donatiſts, ſome to the Nouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp;c. The lamentable eſtate of the Iewes, Gods owne people, proues this point without exception, they are vtterly cut off from the foundation, Chriſt: Error, like a gangrene ſometimes ouer-growes all; but ſome may ſay, when may a church be ſaid to erre thus; ſeeing, though ſome may erre, yet happily not the reſt? I anſwer, then a church may be ſaid to erre, either when an error is embraced of all in generall, or ſpecially of thoſe that are the Paſtors and guides, and carry the chiefe face and port of the Church with them; which error if it be generall, in all, or the chiefeſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith, and that after admonition they perſiſt in it, and condemne all other churches that hold otherwiſe; Then is that church degenerate into a faction, againſt the Church, and except ſome amongſt them impugne
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16091:177"/>
their vntruthes, and theſe in ſome anſwerable number, or of ſome good place and quality in the Church, or in ſome knowne manner, that notice may be publikely taken of it, ſuch a Church ceaſeth (to vs) to be a true viſible Church; but if there be ſuch oppoſers in theſe vntruthes onely, and yet they hold with the factions in opinion, in ſome other truthes fundamentall; the Church (for their ſakes) may be falſely reputed (by all that know that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>The reaſons of the point are theſe: The ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that proue that the Militant Church may erre, hold directly for proofe of the firſt part of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, that a particular church may erre, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doth erre; for if it be ſo in them, being all certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen, much more in theſe, being all called, but few choſen: which alſo, well conſidered, will proue the latter part of this obſeruation, that is, they may erre fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally and finally too; for in euery particular viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church, there are ſome few of Gods choſen, elſe it can bee no true church; Now theſe few dying, ſtill, the Truth and the Church (where God in his Iudgement forſakes) decayes more, and more, looſing one truth after another, and one faithfull perſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, till at laſt, few, or none are left, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in number, at leaſt in port and place, to beare the name of ſuch a viſible church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God tyes himſelfe, and his grace, and ſaluation to no one particular place; and therefore hee may take it from one particular church, and giue it to another, that may bring forth better ffruits.</p>
            <p>The firſt vſe is for inſtruction to all particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to teach them to walke warily, and carefully, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining themſelues by the Word, whether their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be agreeable thereunto, and praying for the Spirit to enlighten them, and let them take heede of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and inuentions of men; if any error ariſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently let them oppoſe and ſuppreſſe it; If any doubt, let
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16091:178"/>
them goe vnto the Law, and to the Teſtimony; If there be any difficulty, let vs pray for the Spirit, hee is the beſt expounder, and God hath promiſed to giue the Spirit to them that aske him; ſo though wee may erre, yet wee ſhall not erre finally, and generally: Let not any Church preſume of it ſelfe, though it be neuer ſo pure, for as good Churches, as they, haue falne, and they may; yea, and without great heed, they are in as great danger of corruption, and ſo proceeding, of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fall and deſolation: Neither let any man do at on the Church, be it neuer ſo glorious, as if it were an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Oracle, and the ground of our faith and ſaluation: rather ſearch the Scriptures; if the Doctrine of a Church be agreeable vnto them, imbrace it, and build on it, not ſo much becauſe of the Church, which may erre, and, haply will deny that afterward, which it once affirmed; but becauſe of the Scripture, which is alwaies conſtant to it ſelfe, and vnchangeable.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16091:178"/>
how can the Papiſts maintaine their doubting of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the not errring of the Church? yes, ſay they, though wee know what wee are now, members of the true Church, and therefore in the ſtate of ſaluation; yet wee are not ſure what wee ſhall be, whether wee ſhall continue ſo or not: but yet then they confeſſe, that there is aſſurance of ſaluation for the time preſent, though not for the time to come; and how alſo can they maintaine the falling away of the faithfull, with the not erring of the Church? For the faithfull are choſen of God; but ſome of theſe that are of a viſible Church are only called; If then the choſen faithfull may fall away, then thoſe that are onely called, much more: yes ſaith <hi>Hoſius,</hi> Euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member may fall away, but the whole Church cannot: but I anſwer, that the only bar to ſtay men from finall falling away, is the decree of Gods election, which is tyed no more to all the Church in generall, then it is to euery man in particular; but they retort this on vs; you (ſay they) deny the finall falling away of the faithfull, and yet affirme the finall falling away of the Church; and yet alſo you call the Church the company of the faithfull: I anſwer, when wee ſay the faithfull cannot fall away for euer, wee vnderſtand the choſen faithfull; But when we ſay the Church may fall away, we meane only the faithfull by profeſſion, and by calling only, not by election; &amp; when we ſay that the Church is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the faithfull, wee vnderſtand it properly of the whole members, not of any viſible congregation: and for that which they obiect, that the Church cannot erre, becauſe the Church is the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>the Piller and ground of truth;</hi> and becauſe it hath the promiſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: to this I anſwer; that theſe do belong properly to the whole militant Church, not to any particular viſible Church; but onely by proportion, that is, ſo far forth as the faithfull and choſen are found in it: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this promiſe of the Spirit, they may ſinne, and therefore they may erre too, for Gods Kingdome is the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16091:179"/>
Kingdome of righteouſneſſe, as well as of truth; and that holy Ghoſt is the Spirit of grace againſt ſinne, as well as the ſpirit of truth againſt error; he is a ſanctifier, as well as an inlightener.

For this is one ſingular prerogatiue of the Church, that whoſoeuer is of it, is in the ſtate of Saluation, and whoſoeuer is out of it, is in the ſtate of Damnation.

in a plaine and direct obſeruation, and therefore ſo we will take it, and ſo proceed in the handling of it: And the obſeruation is this; That the Church of God ſo long as it is in this world, is alwayes incountred and aſſaulted with many aduerſaries, that ſeek to diſquiet their peace, and hinder their good proceedings; Marke the parts of the obſeruation, Firſt, I ſay, they are <hi>Aduerſaries,</hi> there is their quality, they are Aduerſaries, full of hatred; Secondly, I ſay they are <hi>many</hi> Aduerſaries, there is their number: Thirdly, I ſay, that they <hi>encounter</hi> and <hi>aſſault</hi> the Church, there is their worke: Fourthly, I ſay, they doe <hi>alwayes</hi> aſſault it, there is their diligence: Laſtly, I ſay, they <hi>ſeeke to diſquiet their peace, and hinder their good proceedings,</hi> there is their end: I ſhall not neede to make a curious Application of any proofes to euery one of theſe particulars (though I doubt not, but that many of the places brought for proofe would affoord it): It will be ſufficient, that I proue the maine matter plainely and directly: Therefore for the proofe of this obſeruation, ſee it firſt in a ſhaddow, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.24. where Chriſt and his Diſciples are in a Ship vpon the Sea, and this Ship is troubled with Tempeſts, and ouerflowed with waues: Now although this be but a ſtory, and that there be no intendment in the place to be applyed to this; yet vnder this is fitly ſhadowed out the eſtate of the Church in this life: Imagine the Sea to be the world, and the ſhip to be the Church, and the tempeſts and waues to bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults and incounters, that the Church is ſubiect vnto, and the Winds to bee the Aduerſaries of the Church; And then we ſhall ſee in this ſhaddow, the obſeruation bee plaine, that no ſhip is more toſſed in the Sea with Winds and tempeſts, hindering their courſe, and indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering their eſtate; then the Church is, beaten againſt by the aſſaults and oppoſitions of aduerſaries, troubling their peace, and hindering their good proceedings: See it more plainely in a Compariſon of Gods owne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and applying, <hi>Cant</hi> 2.2. where the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

So that this place teacheth euery particular the point obſerued. See it yet more plainely affirmed by the Lords owne mouth in the former teſtament, and ſet downe as an ordinance and worke of God himſelfe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will put Emnity betwixt thee and the woman, and betweene thy ſeede and her ſeede, he ſhall break thine head, thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele:</hi> here is a plaine oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Satan and his ſeede, and the Church and her ſeede; and this is continuall; for when his head was broke by our Sauiour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. in ouercomming him in his temptations, but ſpecially at his death; yet ſtill he ſeekes to aſſault the Church, and to bruiſe her heele. And the ſame in effect is iuſtified by Chriſt himſelfe, in the new Teſtament, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.33. <hi>In the world ye ſhall haue affliction, but be of good Comfort: I haue ouercome the world,</hi> &amp;c: As if hee ſhould ſay, ſo long as you are in the world, looke for affliction, it is your portion here, to be afflicted and aſſaulted with many aduerſaries. Yet laſt of all, ſee it moſt plainely in the experience of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, In the fourth chapter of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> verſ. 7.8. <hi>when Sanballat and Tobiah, and the Arabians and the Ammonites, and the Aſhdodims heard that the walls of Ieruſalem were repaired, they conſpired altogether to come and to fight againſt Ieruſalem, and to hinder them:</hi> So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, 36, 37. where the eſtate of the Church in this world is ſet downe to bee this, that <hi>many were ſtoned, many racked, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hewen aſunder, and others ſlaine with the Sword,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the aſſaults and oppoſitions, that the Church is to expect in this life; So the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 49. to the 13. ſpeakes of the like oppoſitions, that the Church meetes withall in this world, that <hi>they were as men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Death, a gazing ſtocke vnto the world, to Angels, and to men,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>made as the filth of the world, and the off ſcowring of all things:</hi> And in the 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.18. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

ſaith, that hee <hi>would haue come vnto them, but Satan hindred him:</hi> ſo that wee ſee that Satan, and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments aſſault the Church continually, and hinder their good proceedings. So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1.2. &amp;c. <hi>the heathen rage and the people murmure, the Kings of the earth bande them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and the Princes are aſſembled together againſt the Lord and his Chriſt.</hi> And in <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27. in both theſe places Chriſt himſelfe is propounded for an example in this caſe, that ſo all that beleeue in him and profeſſe him, may know what to truſt to; <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the Gentiles, and the people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> all were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together againſt Chriſt; if it were ſo with our Sauiour, it muſt needs bee ſo with all his members: If they hated and oppoſed him, they will hate and oppoſe them, for <hi>the Seruant is not aboue his Maſter:</hi> what Church euer was there in the world, yea, or what one true member of the Church, that can no by their owne experience giue Teſtimony to this Truth? Either in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity, or out of it; either vnder the Law, or before the Law; or after the Law: Either Apoſtles, Prophets or Patriarkes, all from the firſt to the laſt; yea <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe in Paradiſe, ſee how hee was encountred and ouercome, and ſo caſt out of Paradiſe, which all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind rues to this day: There is no place not ſtate, but heauen free, there, and no where but there, ſhall the Church be triumphant, there ſhee is alwayes militant, aſſaulted and fought againſt by many Aduerſaries, that ſeeke to diſquiet her peace, and hinder her good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.

Sixthly, Let vs <hi>throw away all hindrances,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.2. <hi>no man that warreth, intangleth himſelfe with the affaires of this life, &amp;c.</hi> Souldiers carry little with them to the warre, but caſt away all that is troubleſome to them; ſo muſt wee throw away all hindrances that may trouble vs in this fight, as the loue of the world, and of our ſelues, and of pleaſures, yea, and if neede be, <hi>we muſt loaue father and mother, wife and children</hi> too, and throw them all away, rather then they ſhould comber vs in this battell; wee muſt rid our hands of all things, but what neceſſity ties vs to, that ſo we may be free from incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances in the mannaging of this ſpirituall warfare: The Apoſtle in the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 9 26, 27. propounds himſelfe for an example in this caſe, <hi>ſo fight I</hi> (ſaith he) not as one that beateth the ayre, but <hi>I beat downe my body, and bring it in ſubiection, &amp;c.</hi> hee knew, that if hee did not beat downe his body, and ſo caſt this hindrance away, he ſhould but beat the ayre, teaching vs, that wee muſt throw away all that hinders vs in the mannaging of this  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>  Spirituall fight. The ſeuenth duty is, <hi>confidence in Gods loue,</hi> wee muſt caſt our ſelues by faith vpon the power of God, as the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10. <hi>My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> and if we doe thus, it ſhall goe well with vs in this our bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell; and this faith and confidence is nor onely a part of this fight, but the very victory it ſelfe, as the Apoſtle
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16091:186"/>
ſaith 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.4. <hi>this is the victory whereby we ouercome the world, euen our faith,</hi> and in this reſpect it is called <hi>a ſhield to quench all the fiery darts of Satan, Epheſ.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>The eighth duty which we are taught from hence to  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>  practiſe, is the duty of prayer, this is a ſpeciall meanes to preuaile in our fight, therefore the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 56.9. <hi>when I cry, then mine enemies ſhall turne backe;</hi> and this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> practiſed in his ſpirituall fight, <hi>when the meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him, he beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from him;</hi> and the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. exhorts vs hereunto in many termes; pray <hi>alwaies,</hi> with all <hi>manner</hi> of prayer, and <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>watch</hi> thereunto, with all <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance,</hi> wee muſt haue helpe and ſtrength, elſe wee cannot withſtand our enemies, they being ſo ſtrong, and we ſo weak; and whence ſhould we haue helpe, but from God? And how ſhall we obtaine it of him but by prayer? and therefore wee muſt pray alwaies vnto God, that he would helpe and ſtrengthen vs in our fight, and that hee would daunt and draw all good ſucceſſe from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that ſo they may not preuaile againſt vs, but that wee may preuaile againſt them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11. <hi>When</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>held vp his hand, Iſrael preuailed, and when hee let his hand downe,</hi> Amaleck <hi>preuailed;</hi> ſo it is with vs when we hold vp our hands to God by prayer, wee ſhall preuaile againſt our ſpirituall enemies; but if wee let downe our hands, neglect this duty, this dutie of prayer, they will preuaile againſt vs.</p>
            <p>The laſt duty which wee are hence taught to practiſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>  is patience, wee muſt <hi>poſſeſſe our ſoules with patience, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to the end of the fight,</hi> and being well content with our preſent portion, ſighing for deliuerance, and yet waiting the Lords good leaſure, with an expectation of helpe and comfort to all our croſſes, and a ſeaſonable and ioyfull deliuerance from all our croſſes, and a recompence in heauen, with a Crowne of glory, for all the croſſes and miſeries which wee doe heere endure.

Then the obſeruation is this:</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
               </label>  That in all the Battailes that are mannaged betwixt the Church and her Aduerſaries for Gods Truth,the Lord ſo carries himſelfe on both ſides, and to both, that he is altogether for and with the Church to helpe and deliuer them, and altogether againſt their enemies to confound and deſtroy them: ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15, 16. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are vpon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16091:200"/>
and his Eares are open to their cries, but the face of the Lord is againſt them that doe euill, to cut off their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance from the earth:</hi> So in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.5. the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Heare ye the Word of the Lord, all ye that tremble at his Word: your brethren that caſt you out for my names ſake, ſaid; Let the Lord be glorified: but yee ſhall appeare to your Ioy, atnd they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> And <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.28. <hi>In nothing feare your Enemies, which to them is a token of Perdition, and to you of ſaluation, and that of God:</hi> Thus God was with the Iſraelites to ſaue them; and with the Egyptians to drowne them in the red Sea, Let vs ſee this point proued a little more plainely in particulars: God is with and for the faithfull in many reſpects.</p>

Thus hee rayſed vp <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and others to deliuer his Church; And ſo by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring to the faithfull many gracious opportunities, either to preſerue themſelues, or to ouerthrow their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>

So we ſee, that God is with, and for his Church to defend them: firſt, as a party in the cauſe: ſecondly, as a deliuerer to ſaue them from their enemies: Thirdly, as a Rewarder, to crowne them after the fight.<note place="margin">How God is againſt the enemies his Church many waies.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, to blinde them, as he did the <hi>Sodomites, Gen.</hi> 19.11. and as he did the <hi>Aramites,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.18. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

               </label> The reaſons of the point are theſe: Firſt, that which the aduerſaries doe againſt the Church, they doe againſt God himſelfe; It is <hi>the Lords battell,</hi> and not ours, as <hi>Iahaziel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20.15. and therefore he will mannage it for the defence of his Church, and the deſtruction of their aduerſaries, hee that toucheth the Church, toucheth the Apple of Gods eye, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.8. and <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.34. the Lord ſaith to <hi>Tyrus,</hi> when they caſt lots for his people, <hi>What haſt thou to doe with me?</hi> And to <hi>Saul, Acts</hi> 9.4. when hee went to perſecute the Church, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou mee?</hi> and 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.22. when <hi>Zenacherib</hi> railed againſt Ieruſalem, and lifted vp himſelfe againſt them, the Lord ſaith, <hi>Whom haſt thou rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on? &amp;c.

The Lord threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth, againſt Mount <hi>Sier,</hi> that <hi>becauſe they had put the children of Iſrael to flight by the Sword, therefore as I liue (ſaith the Lord) I will prepare thee to blood;</hi> that which the aduerſaries doe againſt the Church, they doe it againſt God, and therefore hee will defend his Church, and puniſh and deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is his promiſe to the one, that hee will  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label>  defend them, and his threatnings againſt the other, that hee will ouer-throw them, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſest thorow the water I will be with thee, Exod.</hi> 23.22. <hi>I will be an enemy to thine enemies, and afflict them that afflict thee, Zeph.</hi> 3.19. <hi>I will bruiſe all that afflict thee.</hi>

            <p>The vſes of the point are theſe: the firſt is for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, and firſt it reproues the faithfull themſelues, ſuch of them as are ſuſpicious and fearefull to encounter with their aduerſaries, that thinke there is no way when their enemies aſſault them, but deſolation, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring things by ſenſe, and not by faith; Why, <hi>The Lord is with vs to defend vs, why then ſhould we be afraid though ten thouſand roſe vp againſt vs?</hi> ſecondly, it reproues the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous aduerſaries, that thinke when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, that God hath forſooke his Church, as <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 71.11. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.43. or that hee doth not regard their trouble <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 94.6, 7. or that hee could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.14. Laſtly, it reproues the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and carnall beholders that aſcribe all to the meanes, and doe not beleeue Gods hand to be all in all in defending his Church, and deſtroying their enemies.</p>

of the Church, which could not ſo fitly be reduced to the gouernment of the Church; and theſe are the points which, God willing, here wee will ſpeake vnto: The power and authority of the Church; I call it power and authority, for in effect they are both one; It is true, that they are ſometimes diſtinguiſhed, and then this is the difference; power, ſignifies an ability to doe a thing; and authority, a warrant from God to exerciſe that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: but here they ſignifie one and the ſame thing, and the reaſon is plaine; becauſe the Church of all other ſorts doth abſolutely deny her ſelfe, to haue any power to do ought but that which ſhe hath authority and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from God to doe.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 that it is not humane, but diuine.</note>Firſt, it is not humane, that is, it is not of men, though they be men that exerciſe it, and howſoeuer, where it is publikely practiſed, it is vſually, and needfully ratified, at leaſt permitted by the authority of the temporall State, yet it hath not his power from men; but it is diuine, and hath his power directly from God himſelfe; the firſt beginnings of this power is from him, as wee may ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.1. to 5. where our Sauiour calls his Diſciples and giue them <hi>power to preach &amp; to caſt out diuels, and to heale the ſicke, &amp;c.</hi> and the promiſe of more power is alſo from God, as his owne free gift, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen, and whatſoeuer thou ſhall binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heauen;</hi> And ſo the performance of more power is from him, as deriued from his owne Pattent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18.19. <hi>Goe teach all Nations, &amp;c. teaching them to obſerue all things,</hi> and <hi>lo I am with you to the end of the world;</hi> The Church is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with power from Chriſt, euen as hee is from his father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20 21.22. <hi>As my Father ſent mee, euen ſend I you, &amp;c.</hi> and yet a more full increaſe of this power is from God too, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. <hi>Behold, I ſend the promiſe

            <p>And the Reaſon is plaine, becauſe <hi>all Power is from  <label type="milestone">

And <hi>there is no power but from aboue,</hi> as our Sauiour tells Pilate, he could haue no power, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were giuen him from aboue; If all power, euen the power which the wicked haue, be from God, much more is the power and authority which the Church hath, from God too; And that after a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo much the more immediately, as the Church is more nearer ioyned to Chriſt, then any other State whatſoeuer; And to much the more rightly, as Chriſt is more rightly a ſpiritual King then a temporall, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. <hi>my Kingdome is not of this world,</hi> &amp;c: And ſo much the more properly, as Chriſt is the head and ruler of the Church more properly, then of the Commonwealth: And ſo much the more effectually, as the Lord doth more <hi>magnifie</hi> himſelfe in Church cauſes, then in cauſes of the State.</p>
            <p>This teacheth, firſt, that if the power and authority  <label type="milestone">

            <p>Secondly, it teacheth the Church, that they bee the  <label type="milestone">

            <p>Thirdly, ſeeing this power is ſo directly from God,

then this teacheth vs, that it muſt bee the more dutifully obeyed and ſubmitted to, of them that liue vnder it, elſe <hi>if wee deſpiſe it, we deſpiſe not men but God,</hi> as it is <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>hee that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me,</hi> &amp;c.

               <note place="margin">Two things aſſerted, that power of the Church is not temporal, but ſpirituall.</note>The ſecond branch of this ſecond point is, that this power is not temporall, but ſpirituall; and therefore it is not ſo often called a Sword to ſmite, or a ſcepter
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16091:205"/>
to ſway, as Keyes to open and ſhut; and what doth it open and ſhut? Euen <hi>the Kingdome of heauen, Matth.</hi> 16.19. and therefore it is a ſpirituall Power. The Ciuill Magiſtrate hath to do about our bodies, goods and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward State, the Church hath to doe with the Soule and Conſcience and the inward man; Temporall power and authority ſerues to maintaine a temporall Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and ended here; ſpirituall Power and Authority maintaines a ſpirituall Life begun here, but perfected and finiſhed hereafter in the life to come; Temporall power rules by the lawes of men, ſpirituall Power rules onely by the Lawes of God; temporall power fights and defends it ſelfe by the materiall Sword and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Policy; Spirituall Power renounceth theſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 26.52. <hi>put vp thy Sword into his place, for all that take the Sword, ſhall periſh by the Sword;</hi> Chriſt would not bee defended by the Sword; Spirituall Power betakes it ſelfe to better Weapons, to ſpirituall and heauenly Weapons, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. <hi>the Weapons of our warfare</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are not carnall, but ſpirituall, mighty through God,</hi> &amp;c: they are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but ſpirituall; not weake, but mighty; and that not of themſelues, nor through the power of him that vſeth them, but through God: And what are theſe weapons? They are the Word and the Spirit, Faith, Repentance, Prayer, &amp;c. It is true, that ſometimes both theſe Powers do concur together in the Church, that is, when the Magiſtrate is Chriſtian; and ſurely, then Gods worke goeth happily forward, and then this is a bleſſed thing both for our Soules and bodies too, if wee haue grace ſo to vſe it: but though they doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times concurre, yet they are neuer confounded, though they be not diuided, yet they bee diſtinguiſhed; they muſt each of them keepe in it's owne ranke, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their ſeuerall Charges by ſeuerall adminiſtrations; The Church is not to vſurpe on the temporal power, for that is flatly forbidden, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15, 16. <hi>the Gentiles

And it was well hee eſcaped ſo, for by the law he deſerued Death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.7.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The 3. thing aſſerted: that the Power of the Church is limited and ſcantled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of the Word.</note>The third Branch of the ſecond point is, that though it bee a ſpirituall Power, yet, it is not vnbounded, but it is limited and ſcantled within the bounds of the Word; For the ſame God that hath ſet markes and <hi>boundes in the earth for the Sea that it ſhall not ouerflow them, Iob</hi> 38.11. he hath alſo preſcribed in his Word, certaine marks, limits, and bounds for the power of the Church, and ſo farre the Church muſt goe and no further: The Body and Spouſe haue power to doe many things, yet ſtill they are to bee ruled by the direction of their Head and Husband; And ſo long as the Church containes herſelfe within theſe bounds and limits it goes well with her, God proſpers her, and he hath promiſed (and will performe) a bleſſing to her, but if ſhe goe beyond theſe bounds and tranſgreſſe againſt God: It is a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dangerous caſe, the bond is broken, all flyes a ſunder, the walls and hedges of the Church are tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den downe, and the Boare and wild Beaſts enter in, and ſpoile and make a prey of all; Gods yoke is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off and then men runne into ſtrange outragious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable and exorbitant Courſes, fitter for lawleſſe Infidels, then for Chriſts Diſciples, and by this meanes Gods Church will bee degenerate into Synagogues of Satan, and Religion turned into Ignorance, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, profaneneſſe and meere licentiouſneſſe; And by this meanes Anti-Chriſt himſelfe hath clymed vp into the Seate of Chriſt. The reaſon is plaine in the very like caſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. Becauſe that they haue reiected God and his yoke, and gone beyond their bounds, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will reiect them and caſt them off from being
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16091:206"/>
his Church; The Church therefore muſt conſider, like a modeſt Spouſe, that ſhee hath power indeed, but to what, to that that ſhee will and liſt her ſelfe? No, but to that, which Chriſt her husband will haue her to doe; ſo farre as in the exerciſing of her power ſhee walkes with God, ſhee may goe on ſafely and boldly: But if when God ſtayes, ſhe will not ſtay, but ſtill goe on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at her owne perill be it.</p>
            <p>The fourth Branch of the ſecond point is,<note place="margin">The 4. thing aſſerted, that the power of the Church is the greateſt power on earth: Kings are vnder the power of the Church, though they be aboue the perſons that exerciſe it.</note> that though it be a bounded and limitted power and authority, yet it is the greateſt power on earth, it reacheth not onely to the people, but Kings and Princes muſt obey it; I ſay, they are vnder the power of the Church, though they be aboue the perſons, that exerciſe this power, as may appeare in the Example of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> the Perſon of <hi>Nathan</hi> being ſubiect to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and yet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſubiect to the Power of his reproofe: Secondly, as it reacheth not onely to the meaneſt, but to the higheſt; ſo it reacheth not onely to the outward man, but euen to the Inward alſo; the very Spirit and Conſcience though it be free from all other power, yet it is ſubiect to this; I ſay not to the Church it ſelfe, but to that ſpirituall and diuine power, which it in Chriſts Name doth exerciſe: Laſtly, whereas no other authority or power reacheth ſo high as heauen, or ſo low as hell; this power of the Church extends to both, it cuts off from God, and deliuers ouer to Satan; And againe it releaſes out of Satans lawes, and reconciles vs to God, and brings vs to heauen: So much for the ſecond point, what manner of power this is.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt point is this, Namely; what is it,<note place="margin">The 3 point is, what it is that the Church haue power in, &amp; it is double 1. ouer perſons, and that 1 ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers either not come in to admitte. Who are to be admitted.</note> that the Church hath power in? The Church hath a double power, one ouer perſons and another ouer things; ouer perſons, and that in two reſpects, either as they are members, or as they are officers; As they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and that in two reſpects alſo, either as they are not come into the Church, or as they are come in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16091:207"/>
as they are not come in, and that in two reſpects too; either to admit them as members, or to repell and refuſe them: If yee aske, who are to be admitted? The Anſwer is, all thoſe that are called, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>the promiſe is made to you and your children, and to many that are a farre off, euen to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call;</hi> For ſeeing the promiſe belongs to them, and ſo they are, for ought wee know, within the Couenant, then they ought to be admitted into the Boſome of the Church, and to bee admitted as members thereof: If yee aske, how we ſhall know that they are called? The Anſwer is plaine, yee ſhall know it by their profeſſion of faith in the Church, and by their profeſſion of Repentance; by their profeſſion of faith, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12, 37. <hi>As ſoone as they beleeued</hi> Philip, <hi>which preached the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Kingdome of God, and the Name of Ieſus Chriſt, they were baptized both men and women,</hi> And verſe 37. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip ſaid to the Eunuch, If thou beleeueſt with all thine heart, thou maiſt be baptized; then he anſwered and ſaid, I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God,</hi> &amp;c: 38. <hi>and he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized him:</hi> And ſo, by the profeſſion of Repentance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.6. <hi>they were baptized of</hi> Iohn, <hi>confeſſing their ſinnes:</hi> And both theſe you ſhall finde together, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.38. when <hi>they were pricked in their hearts</hi> at Peters Sermon, <hi>they ſaid, Men and Brethren what ſhall we doe to be ſaued;</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid vnto them, Amend your liues and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized euery one of you in the Name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, for the remiſsion of ſinnes;</hi> as if he had ſaid, repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: for amendment of life doth neceſſarily imply purpoſe of obedience; and ſo the profeſſion of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a promiſe of obedience, and this is preciſely required, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. to the 8. where the Lord ſent to the people of Iſrael, to know whether they would obey him, before hee would enter into Couenant with them: To which agrees the practice of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and the people in the caſe of Reformation or renewing their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: when they had broken their Couenant with

God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.31, 32. he renued the Couenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and his people, and cauſed all that were found in Ieruſalem and in Beniamin to ſtand to it; If you aske what is the meanes and act of Admiſſion? The anſwer is, that it is baptiſme,<note place="margin">The Act and meanes of admiſſion.</note> 
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37, 38 <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>they that gladly receiued the Word were baptized, and the ſame day there was added to the Church aboue three thouſand Soules;</hi> Now this Act being once receiued, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to bee recall'd, though the Couenant be afterwards neglected and broken; for one entrance ſtands good for our whole eſtate: In ſo much, that if I fall after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and that ſo greiuouſly, as that I be cut off by the cenſure of the Church, yet if I returne againe,<note place="margin">This not to be renued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any falling away.</note> the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is to bee renued, but not baptiſme, no more then circumciſion in the former Teſtament was to be renued in the like caſe; but if men were neuer before baptized, then though they bee of yeares of diſcretion, yet they are to receiue Baptiſme. But whether hath the Church power to compell men to be members? No ſurely,<note place="margin">How far the Magiſtrate may compell.</note> faith cannot be forced vpon any, yet if the Magiſtrate be Chriſtian, he by his authority, may, and muſt compell men to come to the outward meanes, elſe wee deny him the priuiledge of his authority, and of our ſubiection: So did <hi>Ioſiah</hi> cauſe all that were found in Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">Or, to repell them.</note> and <hi>Beniamin</hi> to ſtand to the couenant, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.32. As they haue power to admit into the Church, ſo they haue power to repell and keepe out; and this wee finde to be plaine, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.36.37. <hi>See, heere is water</hi> (ſaith the Eunuch) <hi>what doth let mee to be baptiſed?</hi> Philip <hi>ſaid vnto him, if thou beleeueſt with all thine heart, thou may'ſt, &amp;c.</hi> as who ſhould ſay, where faith is wanting, it is a ſufficient let to keepe from baptiſme, and ſo from being admitted into the Church; But what ſhall children doe then? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they, if they be the ſeed of the faithfull, are pre-ſuppoſed to be within the couenant, and ſo they are to be reputed, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. God ſaith to <hi>Abraham, I will eſtabliſh my Couenant betweene mee and ther, and thy ſeede

after thee;</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 3.29. <hi>The promiſe is made to you and to your children,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, and ſo in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>The vnbeleeuing wife is ſanctified by the beleeuing huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, &amp;c. elſe were your children vncleane, but now are they holy,</hi> and therefore where children are tendred by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full parents to the Church, they muſt admit them, ſo far as they haue power, and that is to baptiſme, <hi>Marke</hi> 10.13.14. as it was with circumciſion in the time of the Law, the children of the faithfull, all that were males, were circumciſed; ſo it is in Baptiſme, which ſucceedes in the roome of that; all the children of beleeuing parents, are to be made partakers of it: So you ſee the Church hath power ouer perſons that are not come in, and that either to admit, or repell them. Secondly,<note place="margin">Or, ſecondly, as come in, to keepe them in, or caſt them out.</note> they haue power ouer perſons, as they are come in already, and that either to keepe them in, or to caſt them out; to keepe them in, as in <hi>Reu.</hi> 3.11. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith to the Angell of the Church of Philadelphia, <hi>Hold faſt that thou haſt, that no man take thy Crowne from thee;</hi> and what was the Angels Crowne, but the faithfull in that Church? So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Theſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians his Crowne; and how muſt hee hold them faſt, and keepe them in? By confirming, exhorting, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, comforting, and inſtructing them, bearing with their weakneſſe, admitting them to the Lords Table, and vpon their repentance, looſing them from their ſinnes: So the Church hath power to caſt out, for their obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in ſinne, and ſo to binde them in the chaines of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting damnation: that the Church hath this power, it is plaine, for the Word of God is powerfull each way, <hi>It is the ſauour of life vnto life,</hi> vnto ſome, to other, <hi>It is the ſauour of death vnto death;</hi> ſo the Cenſures of the Church are wonderfull powerfull, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.23. <hi>whoſe ſinnes yee remit, they are remitted, and whoſe ſinnes ſoeuer yee retaine, they are retained,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: And ſo we ſee how the Church did caſt out the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous man, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5. and how they receiued

the authority of the Church is not greater then the authority of the Scripture, no, it is not equall with it, but the authority of the Scripture is greater and higher then the authority of the Church: here are two parts of this obſeruation: Firſt, that the authority of the Church is not greater then of the Scripture: ſecondly, that the authority of Scripture is greater then of the Church; the ſame places that proue one, proue both, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.39. The woman of Samariah hauing had conference with our Sauiour, and beleeuing him to be the Meſſiah, <hi>ſhe went and told it in the Citty,</hi> and it is ſaid in the 39. verſe, that <hi>many of the Samaritans beleeued in Chriſt for the ſaying of the woman;</hi> but it is ſaid in the 41. verſe, that <hi>many moe beleeued, becauſe of Chriſts owne words:</hi> The voyce of the woman, what is it but the voyce of the Church? ſhee beleeuing in Chriſt her ſelfe, propounds him vnto others: which is the Office of the Church in this caſe; well, the people beleeued for her ſaying; but doe they reſt vpon that as the chiefeſt authority of their faith?

Therefore eyther they much wronged the womans voice in preferring Chriſts before it, or elſe the Church is not of greater authority then the Scripture, but the Scriptures of greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then the Church, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.33. to the 39. <hi>Iohn</hi> bare witneſſe to the truth, that Chriſt was the Meſſiah, and his voyce therein is the voyce of the Church: But doth our Sauiour reſt there, as if the truth were thereby ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently confirmed? no, he diſclaimes it in that reſpect, verſe 34. <hi>I receiue not the record of man,</hi> and appeales to a higher and greater witneſſe, euen to his Fathers, who

did ſpeake more ſufficiently for him, and doth not the Father ſpeake in the Scriptures? So that as the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Iohn</hi> is not greater then that of the Father, but the Teſtimony of the Father greater then of <hi>Iohn;</hi> ſo the authority of the Church is not greater then the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scripture, but the authority of the Scripture, is greater then that of the Church: And in the 39. verſe of that Chapter, hee appeales from the Teſtimony of <hi>Iohn</hi> by name to Scriptures; <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they teſtifie of me, as they being a greater witneſſe, then the witneſſe of Iohn:</hi> So in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. from verſe 27. to 31. the rich man being in hell in torments, intreats father <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might goe and forewarne his brethren, that they might not come into thoſe torments; No, ſaith <hi>Abraham,</hi> they haue <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and if they will not heare them, they will not heare him; The caſe is plaine, if <hi>Lazarus</hi> had come to his brethren and told them that they ſhould take heed of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers courſes, for hee was now in hell in torments for their ſinnes; if he had done thus, had not his voyce been the voyce of the Church?

of more authority then the childe, her word ſhall ſtand when the childes ſhall not ſtand, yea, but the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands word is of more Authority, then the wiues, for his ſhall ſtand, when hers ſhall not; then it followes, that the husbands word muſt needs be of greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then the childes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that which ſpeakes true alwaies, muſt needs  <label type="milestone">

God is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued before man, but the voyce of the Scripture is the voyce of God himſelfe; and the voyce of the Church is but the voyce of man; therefore the voyce of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of greater authority, and is to be beleeued before the voyce of the Church.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, our aſſurance of any truth, ſtands more on  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>5</label>  that into which it is laſt reſolued, then of that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a meanes thereto, is it ſelfe proued by it: As for example, If I be ſure the King will giue me an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, becauſe hee hath promiſed, and paſt his word for it; this promiſe is but the meane of this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that which my aſſurance is laſt reſolued into, is the honeſty of the King; for if I be not principally reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on that, his promiſe can giue mee no certaine aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; Now our aſſurance of the truth of Scripture, is laſt reſolued into the authority of the Scripture it ſelfe; the Church is but a meanes, bringing vs thereto, and it ſelfe leaning thereon: For, if I beleeue the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church ſaith it, then I muſt be ſure that the Church ſaith true, but how ſhould I doe it, but by the Scriptures; therefore my aſſurance of the truth, ſtands on the authority of the Scripture, not of the Church;

Touching this point, what authority the Church hath in the ſenſe of Scripture, it is as materiall, and as difficult a point as the former: Firſt as materiall, for after we are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted which the letter of Scripture: ſo that we know which are Canonicall bookes, written by the Infallible direction of the Holy Ghoſt, and that euery thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them is the vndoubted truth of God, wee are ſtill as far to ſeeke in matters of faith as before till we proceed further and be acquainted with the ſenſe and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16091:215"/>
meaning of Scripture; for the Word of God is not ſo much the letter, as the ſenſe; and the Scripture is not ſo much the bare written word, as the right meaning, and vnderſtanding of that which is written: That what a man ſaith, is his ſpeech indeed, in common acceptation:<note place="margin">Hieron. in Epiſt. ad Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. cap. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> But yet if it bee not taken in the ſenſe hee meanes it, he will and may iuſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime, as none of his ſpeech: A mans meaning is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his words, as the things ſignified in the ſigne, becauſe words are the ſignification of our meaning; but the ſubiect of them wherein it properly reſts and is ſeated, is the breaſt of the ſpeaker; So the Word of God is in the Scripture, as the ſigne, whereby God ſignifies his meaning, but the ſubiect of them, wherein properly the meaning of them reſtes, is in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; ſo that this is a materiall point to be knowne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is as difficult a point as the former, for after we heare which is the right letter of Scripture, it is as difficult to know which is the right ſenſe, as before it was to know which was the right letter; for the ſame words ſometimes haue diuers ſignifications, and one and the ſame ſentence may be vnderſtood many wayes; and diuers men, are of diuers minds, expounding one and the ſame Scripture diuers wayes; euery man abounding in his owne ſenſe; the true beleeuer expounding it to the maintenance of the true Catholique faith; the Heretique to the maintainance of his Hereſie; Yea among and true beleeuers themſelues, one interprets the ſame words to that opinion that he fauours, and another to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that he fauours; What is to be done in this caſe? The Church is here thruſt vpon vs, as the onely or chiefeſt vmpyre in theſe differences, and that alone to be the true ſenſe, which ſhee pronounceth; And ſurely I ſee not, but that the Church may as probably and plauſibly challenge authority to deliuer which is the meaning of Scripture, as which is the letter of Scripture. We haue giuen the Church her due, touching the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16091:215"/>
former, acknowledging her authority in and about the letter of, Scripture, but not ouer or aboue it; and ſo God willing, we will deale as ingenurouſly in this concerning the ſenſe of Scripture; But yet we will limit and bound it within certaine neceſſary cautions and limitations; And that we may doe ſo, we will handle it by way of Obſeruation.</p>
            <p>The Obſeruation is this;  <label type="milestone">

               </gap>r viſible Churches may and oft times haue expounded Scripture to their owne minde, and not according to Gods minde; And therefore it is reaſon that they ſhould bee thus bounded and limited; we will proceed then to the proofes of the obſeruation: And firſt, I will prooue it by rules; And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by examples; The rules in the Scripture are plaine for this note, and that firſt in generall, <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the law &amp; to the Teſtimony,</hi> &amp;c. whoſoeuer is the ſpeaker, and whatſoeuer he ſpeakes in matters of God, and of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and therefore ſpecially in expounding Scripture, it muſt be according to the law and the teſtimony; that is, according to the meaning that God intendeth therein, and ſo in the 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4.11. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let him that ſpeakes, ſpeake as the words of God,</hi> that is, in Gods ſenſe. As in generall all muſt thus ſpeake Gods Word, ſo ſpecially the Preacher, or whoſoeuer that takes vpon him to expound Gods Word, he muſt ſpeake it as the Word of God, that is, not onely for the manner of it, reuerently and zealouſly, as becomes the Word of God; but for the matter much more, that is, in the ſame ſenſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16091:216"/>
that God himſelfe hath ſpoken it, as hee being then in Gods ſtead, and deliuering his meſſage, elſe he ſpeakes his owne words not Gods; Secondly, more particularly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5, 39. <hi>Search the Scripture</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, he doth not bide them, take the Scriptures, and reade them, and giue what ſenſe of them they thinke good; But he bids them <hi>ſearch</hi> them, that is, examine them and conſider ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly of them, lay them rightly together &amp; weigh one place wel with another, and make diligent inquiry after the ſenſe, &amp; reach that God intends in them; And ſo we ſhall find that they are firſt witneſſes of Chriſt, and then that they are helpes to eternall life: See it yet more neerely <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Let vs propheſie according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, whereby prophecy is expreſly meant interpretation of Scripture, for ſo it is taken in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3.31. and that is to be framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion or Analogy of faith, which whether it be meant of faith, contained in the Creede, or of the meaſure of faith that God hath endued vs with all, yet ſtill it is to bee vnderſtood, that that faith which God hath reuealed in the body of the Scripture, muſt needs be the rule and ſquare of all interpretations; And ſo in the 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.20. <hi>No propheſie of Scripture is of any priuate interpretation,</hi> &amp;c. where intepretation of Scripture is named, and all priuate interpretations of Scripture excluded; now what is meant by priuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations; it is explained by the oppoſition <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>but holy man of God ſpake as they were mooued by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſo that euery interpretation is forbidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as ptiuate, that is not according to the minde of the holy Ghoſt that ſpeakes in Scripture, and ſee it falls in right, with the obſeruation, as if it were the ſame words. Secondly, the examples of the practice of the faithfull is plaine for this; <hi>Nehem</hi> 8.7.8. The Text ſaith, <hi>they read in the book of the Law, and gaue the ſenſe,</hi> &amp;c. not that they did giue a ſence of their owne, but they gaue that ſenſe that the Lord himſelfe therein intended,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16091:216"/>
and ſo cauſed them to vnderſtand it: So in <hi>Act.</hi> 8.34, 35. the Eunuch reading that place, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53. <hi>hee was led as a Sheepe to the ſlaughter, &amp;c.</hi> hee asketh <hi>Philip</hi> whether <hi>the Prophet ſpeaketh this of himſelfe, or of ſome other,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging thereby, that the meaning of the Prophet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe muſt be the Rule that he muſt goe by in expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Prophet, And <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. The Bereans took not the Apoſtles word, no farther then it was conſonant to the ſenſe of Scripture, but <hi>they ſearched the Scriptures dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether thoſe things were ſo;</hi> And our Sauiour him ſelfe ſubmitted himſelfe to the ſame Rule, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.27. <hi>he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets to them,</hi> that is, hee did plainely deliuer their meaning, for that is the right office of an Interpreter; as when two ſpeake together, being of a ſtrange language, the Interpreter is to tell what each of them meaneth: And this being the chiefe office that the Church hath concerning Scripture, to interpret them, ſhee is then to giue no other ſenſe of them, but that which is the minde of God, and the meaning of the Scriptures themſelues; this is true preaching; and this did our Sauiour, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.17.21. <hi>hee opened the booke, and read in it,</hi> and then expounded it: So much for the proofe of the point.</p>
            <p>The reaſons are theſe,  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label>  firſt, what the Church doth according to her owne will, not following the ſenſe of the Scripture, they doe it as naturall men; for ſo farre as they are ſpirituall, ſo farre they follow the mind of God, and deny themſelues; now <hi>the naturall man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth not the things of the Spirit of God;</hi> and <hi>the ſenſe of the fleſh is enmity againſt God, Rom.</hi> 8.7. and when <hi>Peter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt aright, that our Sauiour was the Sonne of God, <hi>fleſh and blood did not reueale this</hi> vnto him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.17. and therfore if ſo be they will find out the truth in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they muſt not conſult with themſelues, but with the Spirit of the Lord.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16091:217"/>
ſpecially, hee that makes lawes is to expound them; And is not the Scripture Gods owne Word? and is not he the author of all the Lawes and Statutes therein contained? And ſhall wee ſcantle God of that in this kinde, which is due to euery man in the like kinde? Shall euery man expound his owne words, and interpret the lawes hee makes, according to his owne meaning? And ſhall not God doe ſo much more? It is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles reaſon for the words of the Prophets, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. where he ſaith, that <hi>no propheſie of Scripture is of any priuate interpretation, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moued by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, it is Gods Word, and therefore not to be interpreted after the will of man; and it may as iuſtly be applyed to all the Scriptures, as to the Prophets, becauſe they be <hi>all of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>all giuen by inſpiration from God,</hi> therefore God is to expound them.</p>

alſo amongſt the reſt, is needfull to be ſpoken vnto: Matters of ſubſtance in Religion are of two ſorts, ſome concerning faith, teaching vs what to know and beleeue; others concerning obedience, preſcribing vs what to do and practiſe, in each of theſe, the Church hath a great hand, where the light of Scripture goes before, and where ſhee followes the Doctrine thereof accordingly; but where the Scripture is ſilent in any thing of either or both theſe kindes, there the Church muſt be ſilent too, and not deſire to ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Wee will deliuer the matter plainly by way of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and that is this, namely,  <label type="milestone">

for one is your Doctor and Maſter,</hi> and who is that, but Chriſt himſelfe; Now what is it to be our Doctor and to be our Maſter?

The Office of reuealing God to man, is appropriated to Chriſt, hee onely declares him; and the reaſon is there implyed, becauſe he onely came out of the boſome of the Father, and therefore he onely knowes the minde of his Father, and therefore conſequently he onely being of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and authority to declare it; ſo that whoſoeuer takes vpon him to reueale any part of the minde of God, hee muſt ſhew that he comes out of Gods boſome, elſe hee neither muſt, nor can ſpeake in this buſineſſe, that Chriſt himſelfe hath already reuealed, that is, that which is contained in the Scripture; Now, that we may know that this Rule is inuiolably to be obſerued, wee muſt know, that all which euer had to deale in matters of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, were preciſely tyed and and confined to this ſcantling, both teachers and hearers; Teachers, they muſt teach nothing in this kinde, but what Chriſt in his Word hath firſt taught: The Apoſtles, and in them all Miniſters are forbidden to teach any thing but what Chriſt commands them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. that, and nothing beſides that: yea, the holy Ghoſt, Chriſts ſpeciall and chiefe Deputy on earth, hee is to receiue of Chriſt, and to ſhew that to the people, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.14, 15. <hi>he ſhall receiue of mine, and ſhew it vnto you;</hi> And the Text ſaith in the 14. verſe, that <hi>he ſhall glorifie Chriſt in this,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, if hee teach ought beſides, it were a diſhonour and diſparagement to the Lord Ieſus, much more, if any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould doe ſo: and ſo the hearers they are tyed to this ſcantling too; for ſo it was propheſied before, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe vp a Prophet vnto thee, like vnto me, from among you, euen of your brethren, vnto him yee ſhall hearken;</hi> And this Prophet is Chriſt, as the

            <p>Secondly, The ſecond reaſon is drawne from the ſtate  <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label>  of conſcience, which is this, God hath endued our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience through his mercy and ordinance, with that freedome and liberty that is in ſubiection to none, but to God onely: and therefore whatſoeuer God commands or forbids, the conſcience well rectified yeelds to it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the authority of the ſpeaker to be a bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Law, which neceſſarily muſt be obeyed; but when a matter is impoſed by man onely, without or beſide the preſcript of God, the conſcience feeles not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power of God to ouerſway it, and therefore may, and muſt, and doth take the benefit of her liberty; and this is it the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Be not the ſeruants of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third reaſon is drawne from the property of the  <label type="milestone">

were before, and that not beſide the word, but with and by the word. This may be cleared by an Inſtance, The article of Iuſtification by Faith, had lyen hidden for many yeeres before Chriſt came, but when Chriſt and his Apoſtles came, they reuiued it, and yet made no new article of it, but the ſame that was taught from the beginning of the world: to come neerer home; After that this doctrine was againe obſcured &amp; lay hid for many yeeres, till it pleaſed God to raiſe vp <hi>Luther,</hi> and others, which brought it forth, to that cleare light, that it was in in the Apoſtles times; And is this to make new articles? No, but to reuiue and to bring to light that which had lyen hid a long time; And thus far the Church may goe, and no further. The ſecond Poſition is this, that the Church cannot make any booke to be Canonicall Scripture,<note place="margin">Secondly that the Church make any booke to bee Canonicall Scripture.

Secondly, if the Church hath power to make bookes that are Apocrypha, Canonicall, then alſo ſhee hath power  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1.2."/>  aſwell to reiect ſome that are Canonicall, for hee that hath power to build, hath alſo power to deſtroy; And what were this, but for the Church to mayme and mangle the Booke of God as ſhee liſt her ſelfe? what an horrible wrong were this to God?

               <note place="margin">Thirdly that the Church hath power to deuiſe, adde, diminiſh, or alter any part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note>The third Poſition is this. That as the Church cannot make any booke Canonicall which is not ſo of it ſelfe, for ſhe hath no power to deuiſe, adde, diminiſh, or alter any part of Gods worſhip; outward paſſages of Gods worſhip are much in her power, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, but that ſhe may ordaine any part of his worſhip beſides Scripture, or affixe remiſſion of ſins or other ſupernaturall effects to the obſeruations and ceremonies which ſhe deuiſeth, all this is but will-worſhip hatefull to God, and expreſly forbidden, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23.<note place="margin">which the Church of Rome hath done prooued by diuerſe things.</note> Intolerable hath beene the preſumption of the Church of Rome in both theſe; For firſt, they haue ordained beſides Scripture Images, ſatisfactons, new Sacraments, new interceſſours new propitiatory ſacrifices, and ſundry other parts of Gods worſhip and  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1.2."/>  ſeruice; Secondly euen to ceremonies of their owne deuiſing, as to croſſings, proceſſions, ringing of Bels, pennance, and ſuch like, they haue aſcribed forgiuenes of ſinnes, driuing away of Deuils, and ſuch like, gracious effects wherein conſiſts no ſmall part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

while they were but certaine the traditions of men, and certainely not the Word of God; And therefore here is the damnable preſumption of the Papiſts, that they by name call them the Word of God vnwritten, &amp; equall them both in authority to binde the conſcience, &amp; in neceſſity to be beleeued and obeyed with the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word; common ſence and reaſon which is endued but with the leaſt touch of Religion, will eaſily decide this controuerſie: If we adde heere to determination of councels, conſent of fathers, decrees of Popes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther patches and faynings of Popiſh Religion, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion muſt be this, that either there were none ſuch; or if there were, they were not beſide Scripture; but according to it; or elſe if they were beſides Scripture, then they were no matter of ſubſtances nor Saluation, nor to be receiued as ſuch.</p>

In the Church of Antioch, there was a matter in queſtion, as touching <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> an outward Ceremony; the Apoſtles being then at Ieruſalem, were by the conſent of the Church of Antioch, conſulted withall about it; and accordingly they deliuer their iudgement in the 23. verſe, &amp;c. And therein ſhew their

power, and conſequently the power of the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them (for the cauſes being perpetuall, the courſe muſt be perpetuall too) and they ſhew their power both in diſanulling ſome Ceremonies, as <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> verſ. 10. as <hi>abſtaming from meat offered to Idolls, and blood,</hi> verſe 20. which were certainely things in their owne nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as the Apoſtle ſhewes of meats, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8.8. And yet all this they did with the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, verſe 28. and that onely in things needfull, as in the ſame verſe; and this they did not ſo much for the thing it ſelfe, but for the auoyding of offence: And ſo in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. &amp;c. where the Apoſtle mentions the ordinances, which hee had deliuered them already, which are generally vnderſtood of matters of order and decency, and the circumſtances make it plaine enough, for after verſe 3, &amp;c. he deliuers them other ordinances keepe, which hee had not deliuered them before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>vncouering of the mans head, and the couering of the womans head,</hi> which were things indifferent in themſelues, yet for comlineſſe ſake, hee doth there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne them: and verſe 20, &amp;c. hee deliuers certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinances, concerning the outward carriage of Gods worſhip in the Lords Supper, as their <hi>tarrying one for another, eating before, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 33.34. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many other things were out of frame with them, he promiſeth in the end of 34. verſe, to order the reſt at his comming to them, where it is cleare that the ordering of things concerning the outward carriage of Gods worſhip, is in the power of the Church it ſelfe; for ſtill the Rule holds, that the diſeaſe continuing, alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a continuall reamedy from time to time: So in the 1. <hi>Cor,</hi> 14.26, 40. The Apoſtle would haue all things done decently, and in order: hee giues them this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule for matters of Ceremony, and they muſt draw particulars accordingly, and this Rule holds as well for the Church now, as then; there being the ſame neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there muſt alſo be the ſame power: So the point
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16091:233"/>
is plaine, that euery particular viſible Church, hath power from God to ordaine certaine outward Rites, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The reaſons to proue this point are theſe: Firſt ſome  <label type="milestone">

            <p>Secondly, no Rights are vniuerſall, to hold euery  <label type="milestone">

            <p>Thirdly, no Ceremonies are perpetuall in one and the  <label type="milestone">

            <p>Laſtly, if a particular Church hath not power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine  <label type="milestone">

            <p>The vſes are theſe: Firſt this teacheth the Church to  <label type="milestone">

Ceremonies,<note place="margin">The bounds the Church is to keepe in ordaining matters of ceremony. 1. 2.</note> are theſe: Firſt they muſt doe nothing that is oppoſite to Gods Word, Secondly, they muſt haue no opinion of Gods worſhip placed in them, as the Surplice and the Croſſe, if the Church ſo inioyne them, it makes them vnlawfull; If they haue beene abuſed ſo heretofore by the Papiſts, that is not their ſinne now, take away the abuſe, and the things may ſtill be impoſed  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  and put in practice: Thirdly, wee muſt haue an eye to  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  doe <hi>all to Gods glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. Fourthly, they muſt be done without ſcandall or offence, as much as poſſibly may be, the Church muſt be wary heerein, for though <hi>all things be lawfull, yet all thing are not expedient,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  23, 32.

I will endeauour (God willing) to make application of that which hath beene ſpoken, as to all Churches in generall: ſo more particularly to this Church of ours: The generall diuiſion, of all Churches that eyther are or haue beene ſince our Sauiours time, is two-fold: Firſt, according to their ſituation, and ſo ſome are Eaſterne, and the reſt Weſterne Churches: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, according to their language, and ſo ſome are Greeke, and ſome Latin Churches.

In the ſecond place, wee come to Hereticall Churches, and they are ſuch as hold, and ſtiffely maintaine any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall point in Religion, contrary to the common faith of the Catholike Church: a particular man is not to be reputed an Heretike, except hee ioyne with his error, obſtinacy, and that he wilfully perſiſt therein, againſt the admonitions and allegations of the Church; and ſo a Church is not to be reputed Hereticall, till they be obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their error; and this obſtinacy muſt be in all, or, at leaſt, in the chiefeſt &amp; greateſt part of them, ſo that none of note amongſt them do teſtify their diſſent from them, nor oppoſe themſelues againſt their hereſie; but if any of note be found amongſt them, though but few that doe openly contradict the reſt, that Church, till ſeparation be made of the ſound from the vnſound, is rather in charity to be wel thought of, becauſe of the right beleeuers, then in zeale to be vtterly condemned as hereticall, becauſe of the miſ-beleeuers, though they be the greater part.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16091:237"/>
Offices, Birth, life, Death, and Reſurrection, &amp;c: And therefore the Layers of this foundation make the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the rule or line that they worke by, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that which they taught by the Scriptures: So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Act</hi> 26.22, 23. <hi>witneſſing both to ſmall and great, ſaying none other thing, then that which the Prophets and Moſes did ſay, ſhould come, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, &amp;c:</hi> And <hi>Act</hi> 28.23. <hi>he expounded and teſtified the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, perſwading them concerning Ieſus, both out of the Law of Moſes, and out of the Prophets;</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3.4. <hi>I deliuered vnto you, firſt of all, that which I receiued, that is, how that Chriſt dyed for our ſinnes according to the Scriptures, &amp;c:</hi> And ſo <hi>Apollos, Act</hi> 18.28. <hi>mightily conuinced the Iewes, and that publiquely, ſhewing by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that Ieſus was Chriſt;</hi> ſtill the Builders made the Scriptures their rule and line whereby they taught; And this foundation in Scripture, is ſometimes ſet down in fewer words, as in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified:</hi> ſometimes in more words, as in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>great is the myſtery of godlineſſe, God was manifeſted in the fleſh, iuſtified in the Spirit, ſeene of Angels. preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gentiles, beleeued on in the world, and receiued vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Glory;</hi> But this is the ſubſtance of all, Ieſus Chriſt, God and man, the onely Sauiour of the world, as hee is reuealed in the Scripture, the ſhorteſt is intended by the holy Ghoſt, and ſo it is to bee vnderſtood of vs in this largeneſſe, and the largeſt is ſufficiently compriſed in this ſhortnes; And that this is the right foundation of the Church; firſt, appeares plainely by the difference betweene Chriſtians, and profeſſors of other Religions; If a Gentile or Pagan diſpute with a Chriſtian, how happineſſe is to be attayned? We ſay, by Ieſus Chriſt; they will reiect him and ſay, there is no Chriſt, and de ride vs, to thinke that he can make vs happy: So let a Iew and a Chriſtian diſpute about happineſſe; we ſay, by the true Meſſiah, Ieſus Chriſt, as he is thus reuealed; They ſay, by the Meſſiah, but this Ieſus thus reuealed,

The like in effect we haue in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23.24. there the Iewe and the Gentile, and the Chriſtian, they all fight about the foundation, Chriſt, <hi>to the Iewes hee is a ſtumbling blocke, to the Grecians fooliſhneſſe, but to them, that are called, the power of God to ſaluation, ſaith the Apoſtle;</hi> So we ſee plainely; this is the foundation, Ieſus Chriſt, God and man, the onely Sauiour of the world, as he is reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scripture: The reſolution then is this,<note place="margin">Reſol.</note> thoſe hereticall aſſemblies,<note place="margin">Thoſe that deny directly this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or any part thereof ceaſe to bee Chriſtians and are no more viſible Churcher.</note> that directly deny this foundation or any part therof, ceaſe to be Chriſtians, &amp; are no more viſible Churches; But thoſe that directly affirme the whole foundation and euery part thereof, though they doe hould ſome erronious Poſitions, wherby they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw ſome part of the foundation by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, are yet to be held true viſible Churches. Marke the termes of the Reſolution, there be many by-wayes there is but one right way; It is eaſy to miſſe of the right way, hard to hit it; to deny directly any part of this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is enought to make ſuch perſons no true viſible church; but to affirme one part,<note place="margin">The Greeke Churches be here ſpoken of, and what weare to thinke of them 1. of the Greeke Churches ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe in moſt at the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne parts of the world,</note> is not enough to make them a true, viſible Church; But they muſt affirme the whole and euery part of the foundation.</p>
            <p>Now then we are to ſpeake of the Churches accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their diuiſions; And firſt of the Greeke Churches they are generally diſperſt in moſt of the Eaſterne parts of the world; And to ſpeake plainely, God hath in ſome ſort euen a viſible Church diſperſed in euery part of the world at this day. Thoſe that are moſt remote from vs in the Eaſternely parts of the world, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended vnder the name of Greeke, or Eaſterne Churches
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16091:238"/>
becauſe though neither their language bee Greeke, nor their ſcituation altogether Eaſternly; yet they haue receiued their faith, for the moſt part, from the Greeke Churches: There are Chriſtians amongſt the Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, there are ſome there, making publique profeſſion of the faith of Chriſt, as others doe of Iudaiſme and Mahometiſme, &amp;c. whether they be the beginnings of faith, as being but lately planted amongſt them; or the remainders of faith, as being planted of old; I am not very certaine,<note place="margin">

In Armenia likewiſe are many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who are generally held to bee Eutychans, but they haue alſo cleared themſelues; but becauſe they oppoſed the Councell of Chalcedon, which condemned that hereſie: All theſe beleeue and profeſſe Chriſt

            <p>Now we come to ſpeake of thoſe which are more particularly and properly called Greeke Churches,<note place="margin">Secondly the Greeke Churches which are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and what we are to hold of them, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation. <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and about Greece; And theſe are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to be ſpoken to; And therefore wee will handle them by way of obſeruation, which is this, namely; That the Greeke Churches euen as they ſtand at this day, though they liue vnder the miſerable ſlauery of the Turke, yet are to bee accounted true viſible Churches: we will take our patterne by that of Conſtantinople, where there is a Patriarke at this day, who hath anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Obiections both of the Proteſtants and Papiſts to their Religion; Now there is a true Church, Firſt, becauſe they affirme the foundation and euery part thereof: Secondly, their errors doe not directly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the foundation, nor any part thereof: For the firſt, they hould ſo much of the right Catholique faith, as may iuſtly intitle them to the name of a true Church; The whole Creede that we profeſſe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine alſo; In the interpretation of ſome points they differ ſomewhat from vs, but in the maine ſubſtance they agree, holding the foundation firme and ſure, Chriſt Ieſus God and man, the onely Sauiour of the world, &amp;c. they renounce the head-ſhip of the Pope,

and many other points of Popiſh Religion; They ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to the direction of Scripture, though the interpretation thereof they would fetch moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly from their predeceſſours, the Greeke fathers, of whom ſome being more ſound, others leſſe, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not ſo ſincere as it ſhould: Therefore the ſecond part of the proofe is, whether their errors be ſuch as directly ouerthrow the foundation, or any part thereof; They are tainted with the errors of free will, Interceſſion of Saints and Tranſubſtantiation, and ſome other Popiſh opinions, which yet they doe not maintaine altogether ſo obſtinately as the Romiſh church doth:<note place="margin">The mayne error of the Greeke Churches.</note> But their maine error is, their denying of the holy Ghoſt, to proceede from the Sonne, from the Father they acknowledge, and by the Sonne; but from the Sonne, this they expreſly deny; Now wee know that the Doctrine of the maieſtie of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his nature, and in his perſons, is a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and principall point in Religion, and very warily to be conſidered of, Euery error therein being dangerous and fearefull, and neere to blaſphemy; And this very error, happly, if it be throughly ſifted, will be proued, to ouerthrow by conſequence the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet ſeeing firſt, it doth not directly ouerthrow any part of it, and ſeeing, ſecondly, wee heare they doe not eyther abſolutely oppoſe herein to the knowne truth, or omit the ſearch of Scripture for it, but profeſſe that vpon playner euidence of Scripture, they will yeeld; And thirdly, ſeeing they hold the foundation and euery part thereof in expreſſe words, we dare hardly charge them for hereticall Churches, much leſſe to bee no true viſible Churches at all; but that men liuing in thoſe Churches, beleeuing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aright in Chriſt crucified, and repenting of their manifold errors and ignorances may be all ſaued vndoubtedly.</p>

hatred againſt the contrary truth, and the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors thereof, and perſecutions by fire and Sword:  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Secondly, the Ieſuits, the Popes chiefe Agents, haue and doe vſe dayly, all cunning deuiſes and malicious practiſes to ſtretch theſe points to the furtheſt ſtraine, that ſo they may tyrannize in euery mans conſcience; And alſo to curſe and to defy all nations, and perſons,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  that will not drinke of this poyſonous cup: Thirdly, it is too apparent that they doe willingly blind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and for gaine, fauour, feare, ambition, and the like, they doe perſiſt in theſe courſes againſt their owne conſciences, that condemne theſe things in them; for as it cannot be thought that ſo many groſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts ſhould be ſwallowed downe by men of excellent gifts and vnderſtanding, but that they muſt ſtrayne at them; ſo the experience of many that are of that Religion, the ſincereſt, and the ſobereſt, that haue beene moſt ledde by Scripture, and haue beene freeſt from faction, that haue renounced and diſclaimed many of theſe abuſes, and freely confeſſed many contrary truthes that we hould, makes it plaine, that among ſo many,<note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, they are foulely corrupted in their ordinary manners, I know euery Church failes, ſpecially in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners exceedingly, but the corruptions in manners that are in the Church of Rome, are extraordinary, and in a manner heatheniſh: ſecondly they are ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vpon their Doctrine, and which themſelues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to be lawfull, whereas it is not ſo with other Churches, they doe not maintaine and profeſſe their corruptions of manners to be lawfull, the Church of Rome doth; take a taſte of theſe in their equiuocation and mentall reſeruation; ciuill honeſty abhors and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes theſe, they vſe and iuſtifie the vſe of them, breaking faith and promiſe; Nature denies it, they

affirme and defend it; that with Heretiques faith is not to be kept; diſobedience to ſuperiors, and maintaining others therein, with them is a familiar practiſe: whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is but a ſmall ſinne, and the ſtewes a tolerable euill; treaſons and murthers of Kings, Princes, and whole ſtates, are they ſinnes with them?

            <p>Now let vs come to the ſecond Branch of it,<note place="margin">The ſecond branche of the Doctrine.</note> which is the inference of the former; that therefore it is not lawfull nor ſafe to communicate with her.

So in the Sacrament they affirme that his body is really preſent in, vnder, and with the Bread and Wine; we ſay that Chriſt is really there onely to the faithfull Receiuer, and onely Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Spiritually, and not bodily, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.63. Theſe two be matters of very dangerous conſequence, ſuch as if they were throughly preſt, they would giue a ſhrewd blow to the ouerthrowing of the truth of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, for if Chriſt haue a true body, then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but in one place at once. I am not heere to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe theſe points, but onely as falling in by the way, haply heereafter I may haue ſome fit opportunity to ſpeake of them more fully; onely let it ſuffice for the preſent, that theſe their opinions, nor any of them, doe directly deny the foundation, nor any part thereof.

Fourthly, hence  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  wee learne the nature of truth, that neuer comes forth, but incumbred with many oppoſitions, both within and without, and ſtill mingled with ſome errors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, euen in the chiefe profeſſors themſelues. Laſtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  hence we learne the power, wiſedome and goodneſſe of God, ſo that doth reſtraine the rage of man, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Satan, that howſoeuer we differ in ſome points, yet we agree in the chiefe, as in Iuſtification by faith alone; and howſoeuer, we differ among our ſelues, yet each of vs agree againſt Anti-Chriſt and Popery, with a common hand, though not ſo throughly as otherwiſe we might doe, yet ſo, as neither of vs yeeld one iot to the Papiſt, though they expected long ere this to haue deuoured both them and vs as a prey, or at leaſt, that they ſhould haue ſlept in a whole skinne (as wee ſay) working vpon the aduantage of our former diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.<note place="margin">The third thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is, what wee are to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of them.</note>

            <p>The third point is, what wee are to eſteeme of theſe Churches, notwithſtanding theſe errors and diſſentions; Surlev, if we ſhould condemne them as falſe Churches, wee ſhould be very vncharitable and wicked: For they haue been the chiefeſt inſtrument vnder God of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16091:259"/>
therefore far be it from vs to deny them to bee a true Church; Beſides we ſhould wrong them much, for ſeeing they affirme directly the foundation, and euery part thereof, there is no colour why wee ſhould giue ſuch hard ſentence againſt them: therefore, let vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme them as brethren, and acknowledge them to be Gods owne Churches, and let vs commiſerate their blindneſſe and ignorance, and let vs beare with their infirmities, and let vs paſſe by the wrongs they offer vs; and let vs bleſſe God for the good that is in them, and let vs intreate God to open their eyes, and to pacify their mindes, and to reconcile theſe vnhappy differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are betwixt vs, and to knit our hearts together in the bond of peace, that we may be all of one minde and iudgement, and ſpeake one and the ſame thing.

            <p>And the firſt reaſon to proue this,<note place="margin">Reaſons to proue it to be a ſound viſible Church in ſome good meaſure.</note> is from the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible markes of a true and ſound Church; Whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Word and the Sacraments are in publique profeſſion in vſe, ſo that the Word in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is purely taught, and the Sacraments rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and obedience to them both accordingly profeſſed, there is a true, and in ſome good meaſure a ſound viſible Church; But in the Church of England, the Word and Sacraments are in publique profeſſion in vſe, ſo that Word is purely taught and the Sacraments rightly Adminiſtred, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them both in ſome good meaſure profeſſed; And therefore the Church of England is a true, and a ſound viſible Church. For the propoſition I haue handled it before in deliuering the markes of a true Church, and therefore I will referre you thither for the proofe of it: For the Aſſumption none will deny, but wee haue the Word and the Sacraments, and profeſſion of obedience to them both: but the Queſtion is, whether wee haue them purely or no; for the meaſure of the ſoundneſſe of a Church is eſteemed, according to the meaſure of the pureneſſe of theſe markes; where they are more pure, there is a more ſound Church; and where they are leſſe pure; there is a leſſe ſound Church: But in the Church of England, they are pure without traditions or mans inuentions;<note place="margin">The Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Except.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The vſes are theſe; firſt, for inſtruction; Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 1. for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly.</note> for reproofe: The vſes for inſtruction are theſe; firſt, Is it ſo that the Church of England is a true and a ſound viſible Church? Then this teacheth vs, that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  &amp; ſafely it may be communicated withal,<note place="margin">We may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate &amp; ioyne with the Church of England.</note> without diſhonour to God, or iuſt offence to any of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or danger to our owne ſoules, or ſcruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; And this we muſt not onely know, but wee muſt practiſe it, all thoſe that liue within this land, and ſo haue opportunity to be members of our Church, they may and muſt come and ioyne in communion with vs, and repaire to our aſſemblies, and heare our Miniſters, and profeſſe obedience to our faith. God requires this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5. <hi>ye ſhall ſeeke the place which the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe out of all your tribes to put his name</hi> there, and there to dwell, and thither thou ſhalt come; and as God commands it, ſo his children haue practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, as <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 26 5, 6, 8, <hi>I haue hated the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the wicked.

with her; And there are alſo many particular motiues to induce to it, which I alleadge not as reaſons to proue directly, that neceſſarily we muſt ioyne, but they may ſerue onely as perſwaſions to a man well affected, and not carried away with preiudice,<note place="margin">Motiues to moue to ioyne with our Church.</note> that hee may ſafely communicate with our Church: Firſt, if there were no other motiue but this, it were ſufficient, we hould the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1.2."/>  foundation. The ſecond motiue is this; we haue the whole Doctrine of ſauing faith taught amongſt vs, and in ſome good meaſure truely profeſt if any Church can teach any one ſubſtantial article of ſound Religion that we profeſſe not, then we may more colourably be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken; but ſeeing it is not ſo, there is no iuſt cauſe or pretence, but that they may communicate with vs; whither would they goe, we haue the words of eternall  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  life? as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.68. Thirdly, we haue a powerfull Miniſtery, to exhort, reproue, comfort, &amp;c. to beget faith where it is wanting, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and confirme faith where it is begun; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to holy obedience, and to renounce their ſinnes, and to make reſtitution of wrongs, and to bee ſound in Religion, and to hunger and thirſt after right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and to bee zealous for Gods glory, and for all good duties; And therefore wee are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o communicate with this Church where the miniſtery is thus power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and if we forſake her, it were iuſt with God to giue vs ouer to our former errors and worſe courſes;  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  The fourth motiue to perſwade vs to ioyne in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church of England, and not to forſake her, is this; we our ſelues here had our new birth, euen in this Church and by this Church; and therefore wee haue great cauſe to be louing and kindly affected, and to carry our ſelues dutifully vnto her; as the child to the mother that bare him; and if we doe not reſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her communion, but goe from her, how iuſtly may we feare to miſ-led, and eyther relapſe into former, or  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  runne into new errors. Fifthly many of our aduerſaries
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:16091:264"/>
were here begotten too; the ſoundeſt part of that faith, which the beſt of our Separtiſts haue, they learned and attayned vnto in our church; therefore the greater is their ſinne, firſt, to flye from vs: ſecondly, to deny her to be their mother: and thirdly, to purſue her with ſo many obloquies and repreaches, as if ſhee were no Church of God. Sixthly, our Church hath beene  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  planted and ſealed vp by the bloud of many precious and glorious Martyrs; which of vs, is not verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that <hi>Bradford, Latimer,</hi> &amp;c: are now mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the triumphant Church in heauen? then deſire to be and to continue members of the ſame viſible mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church on earth, renounce communion with them here, and renounce communion with them in heauen. Seuenthly, conſider what a ſhelter our Church hath  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>  beene to many afflicted churches, French and Dutch, &amp;c: if they, being Gods true churches, flye for ſuccour to vs, and are ſafe vnder our ſhadow, ſhal not we ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gladly continue vnder it, but fly away? If perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould come, we would be glad in our hearts, that we had ſuch a ſhelter; Let vs not bee alienated from that good eſtate, becauſe we haue it, which if we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted we would eſteeme moſt precious, and vndergoe any labour to recouer it. Eightly, conſider the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>  planting, and preſeruing, of our Church, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres: firſt, planted by King <hi>Edward,</hi> a childe, then preſerued in Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> time, being but a woman, againſt the whole rable of Gods enemies, Pope, and Spaniard, and Sathan himſelfe, and all his Inſtruments, this is no ſmall token that God tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of vs, as of his owne Church, and therefore may be motiue to vs to communicate with her. Ninthly, all other Reformed Churches acknowledge vs to bee a  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>  true Church, and reioyce for vs, yea euen thoſe that are moſt againſt vs for Diſcipline, (as <hi>Beza</hi>) yet pray for vs, and for the continuance of our State, euen as it is, to many generations, they are wiſe, Religious, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16091:265"/>
yet they approoue vs; Me thinks it ſhould aſtoniſh the Separatiſts, that all are for vs, but they as if they were holier and wiſer then all others; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſhould much incourage vs to keepe our hold, and to haue them in great iealouſly, becauſe they haue deceiued themſelues, and would deceiue vs. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who are they that condemne vs? None but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and ſome hot turbulent Spirits that haue a great felicity in ouerthrowing the Societies of other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and yet cannot throughly agree amongſt themſelues, what is to bee done in their owne Churches; So much for the firſt Inſtruction.</p>

               </gap>ring I haue Anſwered before; for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prophanely, I Anſwer, that doth not make a falſe Church: I haue ſhewed that there are more Hypocrites in the Church, then true beleeuers; yea, but ſay they, theſe are openly wicked, and yet are admitted into your Church, and to your Sacraments: I Anſwer, though they be wicked in their liues, yet they are not ſo in their profeſſion, and therefore there is no fault in vs, if vpon their profeſſion of repentance and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience we admit them to the Sacraments: the fault is, that they are not caſt out for their open notorious ſinnes, by them that haue authority, and not that vpon profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of repentance they are admitted to the Sacraments: So that we ſee that all that they can except againſt vs, is for petty matters, or elſe they bee perſonall faults, and therefore not to be charged vpon the whole Church; for there is none of theſe faults, but may be redreſt, and by this Gouernment which is in our Church; if they be not, it is mens perſonall ſinnes; for by law there ſhould bee a learned miniſtery, and that thoſe which ſinne openly ſhould be caſt out of the Church &amp;c: And therefore let not this be charged on our Church, we haue many abuſes in our Church, as well as in other Churches, and we are to intreate God to ſweepe them out, but yet wee are not thereupon to be condemned for a falſe Church. Thus ye ſee that our note ſtands true againſt all the exceptions, both of the Papiſts and the ſeparatiſts; namely, that the Church of England, euen as now it ſtands, is through Gods mercy, not onely a true, but a ſound viſible Church.</p>
