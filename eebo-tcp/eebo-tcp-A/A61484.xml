            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>But this of all I do the strangest deem,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who would <hi>Christians</hi> seem,</l>

               <l>Now let me give you but a Character</l>
               <l>Of a young <hi>Anglo-Scotic PRESBYTER:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>First he is one whose face with hair's thin thatch'd,</l>
               <l>One that in <hi>Scoggen</hi>'s pyde Crows nest was hatch'd,</l>
               <l>Who not yet fleg his godly Mother set</l>
               <l>An <hi>Ordination</hi> of the <hi>KIRK</hi> to get,</l>
               <l>Wherein she soon prevail'd, and at the grant</l>
               <l>He stretch'd his jawes, and gulpt the <hi>COVENANT;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He knew not what <hi>Epicopacy</hi> was,</l>
               <l>And that indeed made him the better pass.</l>
               <l>Strait then out-went this new imbrother'd Elf,</l>
               <l>And the next Village set up for himself.</l>
               <l>He call'd in th' Elders, and he chose out twelve;</l>
               <l>And now the Hatchet having got an Helve,</l>
               <l>He hew'd down sin, and that same very year</l>
               <l>Most of the sisters backward fell for fear,</l>
               <l>Or else for love; for on a time being sifted,</l>
               <l>They found the man most able and well gifted;</l>
               <l>He often knock'd the Fathers out of joynt:</l>
               <l>No matter though, he still press'd home the point.</l>
               <l>The Elders Wives were every Sermon at,</l>
               <l>Yet were not constant Hearers for all that.</l>
               <l>When any Law-sute in the Parish fell,</l>
               <l>He and his <hi>JURY</hi> judged <hi>ISRAEL.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>If any one without his leave should wed,</l>
               <l>They found his leaving when they went to bed:</l>
               <l>And more than this this Novice dares to do,</l>
               <l>Yet this is it ye bring the <hi>English</hi> to.</l>

But stay, though this of <hi>Scotish</hi> slaves be born,</l>

               <l>Here we might, may be, grant him our consents,</l>
               <l>If he were Register to both Testaments:</l>
               <l>But ramble how he please, he's in his Road,</l>
               <l>For in the Pulpit he still walks abroad;</l>
               <l>And if this hour he single out a Text,</l>
               <l>It is enough if they two meet the next.</l>
               <l>If he can but devoutly rail upon</l>
               <l>The pride of <hi>Prelats,</hi> all his work is done.</l>
               <l>Or if he can but tell the People how</l>

               <l>His Sermon nothing but Division is.</l>
               <l>Once he preach'd Faith, the <hi>Publick-faith</hi> I mean,</l>
               <l>And that did work Repentance on most men;</l>
               <l>For what that old News-monger <hi>Nedham</hi> saith</l>
               <l>Was call'd the <hi>Publick,</hi> prov'd the <hi>Punick</hi> faith,</l>

               <l>Scarce e'r was poor man sav'd, I'm sure no rich.</l>
               <l>But when ye pray, or rather when ye prate;</l>
               <l>For many times ye talk ye know not what.</l>
               <l>Then as if God forgat what went before,</l>

               <l>This cloud of smoak upon your duskie brows,</l>
               <l>And brands ye with <hi>Cain</hi>'s mark, where e'r ye go</l>
               <l>Any man may a <hi>PRESBYTERIAN</hi> know.</l>
               <l>And without judging doubtless men may say't,</l>
               <l>It is a Prologue to your future fate,</l>
               <l>Who thus forestall the Office of the <hi>Shrieve,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And hang your selves in spite of a reprieve.</l>

            <head>THE EXECUTION OF THE COVENANT, Burnt by the Common Hang-man <hi>Ed. Dun,</hi> Presbyter, <hi>May</hi> 22. 1661.</head>
            <l>THe news I pray! what doth this Throng infer?</l>
            <l>Do ye not know? <hi>DUN</hi> is turn'd <hi>Presbyter.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Well then! I see the Bretheren in spite</l>
            <l>Of <hi>BISHOPS,</hi> have obtain'd a <hi>PROSELITE;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>One that will soon be on the Rigid Score,</l>
            <l>And be a cause of turning many more.</l>
            <l>Make him an <hi>ELDER</hi> then! Indeed ye shall;</l>
            <l>For he is one that may Advance you all.</l>
            <l>That he is now a <hi>BROTHER</hi> you must grant,</l>
            <l>For I did see him take the COVENANT.</l>
            <l>Take it indeed; yet you must understand,</l>
            <l>'Twas but to give't the honour of his Hand:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59677:13"/>
Which he vouchsaf'd with freedom and a smile,</l>
            <l>And strait commits it to the Fun'ral pile.</l>
            <l>In which he shew'd himself a CHRISTIAN right,</l>
            <l>To let the works of darkness come to light.</l>
            <l>Bark then <hi>PHANATICKS,</hi> who, like <hi>Demophon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Glow in the shade, and freeze still in the Sun.</l>
            <l>Howl <hi>Millenaries, Independents</hi> too,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Anabaptists</hi> that Heretick Crew</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> By-blows; If these flashes</l>
            <l>Be sacred to you, come and Urn the Ashes:</l>
            <l>For we esteem the Reliques of these Sheets</l>
            <l>Too dirty and debaucht to pave our streets.</l>
            <l>This Mouth-Granado from that Scotch Witch came</l>
            <l>To set three glorious Kingdoms in a flame.</l>
            <l>A Covenant? No, 'twas a Conspiracy,</l>
            <l>Plotted by Brethren in Iniquity.</l>
            <l>Treason, to which the acts of <hi>Catiline,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> were deem'd Divine.</l>
            <l>Bold <hi>Assassins</hi> that durst attempt all ill,</l>
            <l>And Hollocaust whole Kingdoms to Self-will.</l>
            <l>Mend, mend for shame, your Brother else will look,</l>
            <l>To hang the Authors as he burnt the Book:</l>
            <l>But he presumes, or hopes ye'l rather turn,</l>
            <l>Than follow your black <hi>Juncto</hi> to the Urn.</l>
            <l>While I thus thinking am, who would desire</l>
            <l>(Were it to roast a RUMP) a fitter fire?</l>
            <l>In which it now hath pleas'd the Fates to grant</l>
            <l>The Dissolution of the COVENANT.</l>
            <trailer>FINIS.</trailer>
