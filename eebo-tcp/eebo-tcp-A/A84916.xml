            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>WHY NOT
Eight <hi>Queries,</hi> made to the PARLIAMENT,
From the People of ENGLAND, in 1649.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether this Nation ſhall be a free People, according to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
(now regained with ſuch a vaſt expence of Treaſure, and effuſion of blood)
and according to our truſt repoſed in you, and your ſolemn deep Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Vows, and Promiſes, made to us, to make us a free People? And
WHY NOT yet performed by you, according to your promiſe made
to us, ſince the Kings death?</p>
            <p>II. Whether you intend to paſs the National Act for Liberty or not,
and to take off all <hi>Capias</hi> for Arreſts, That ſo we the people of <hi>England</hi>
may be ſecured from trouble in our perſonal Liberties, and thereby inabled freely to follow our
Callings and Endevors for Livelihood? And WHY NOT, ſeeing it is our juſt Birth-Right?</p>
            <p>III. Whether this Nation ſhall ſtill be inſlaved in their Eſtates, perſonal Liberties, and
Lives, to the preſent corrupt, delatory, chargable practiſes of the <hi>Law,</hi> and to the cruel, impious
(unparalel'd) mercenary Inſtruments of the ſame (by whom thouſands of this Nation have
been ruined and deſtroyed) even by <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Gaolers?</hi> And WHY SO, ſeeing they are
abominable and wicked?</p>
            <p>IIII. Whether you intend to prefer the impious flouriſhing State of an inconſiderable
number of corrupt <hi>Judges,</hi> and mercenary <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and cruel murthering <hi>Goalers</hi> (Enemies to
<hi>Englands</hi> Liberties) before the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſt <hi>Liberties, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> of this great Nation? And
WHY SO? ſeeing he that treadeth in their <hi>Pathes,</hi> ſhall never have <hi>Peace</hi> nor <hi>Reſt, Iſai.</hi>
59. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>V.<note place="margin">Iſai. 59. 1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> Whether <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſhall be freely adminiſtred to all (both rich and poor) the oppreſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
with full ſatisfaction and reparation for their wrongs ſuſtained, and the impriſoned ſet
free, SO, as their perſons may not be ſtill ſubject to impriſonment every two or three dayes, or
as often as their malicious cruel Adverſaries ſhall think meet ſo to do? And WHEN, after
eight yeers <hi>Expectation?</hi> contrary to <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33 15, 16.</p>
            <p>VI. Whether the Creditors, according to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ſhall be enabled to reap <hi>Due</hi> and
<hi>Real Satisfaction</hi> for their <hi>Debts,</hi> out of the real and perſonal Eſtates of all able <hi>Debtors,</hi> in the
two third parts thereof (Intailed Lands alſo not exempted) without any tedious jugling,
chargeable delatory tricks in the <hi>Law?</hi> And WHY NOT, rather then <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Gaolers,</hi>
to rob them, and the <hi>Debtors?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. Whether all perſons by you intruſted with many Millions of the <hi>National Treaſure,</hi>
(and by them perverted) ſhall be called to a juſt and ſtrict accompt for the ſame, whereby the
Souldiery may be duly ſatisfied, and this whole Nation eaſed and acquitted from the unſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Burdens</hi> of all the ſeveral great <hi>Taxes,</hi> and daily <hi>Plunders,</hi> wherein the Souldiery is made
to appear the <hi>Actors,</hi> (conceived to be done by the <hi>Speaker</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi>) meerly to render
the Souldiers the more odious and deteſtable to this whole Nation (a ſubtle contrivance, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue
the Nation again into a Sea of Blood) through the daily increaſe of all the peoples heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings
againſt you, and the Souldiers? And WHY NOT, that ſo <hi>Knaves</hi> may be known?</p>
            <p>VIII. Whether you intend to aboliſh <hi>Tithes,</hi> reſtore the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Poor,</hi> call a new
<hi>Repreſentative,</hi> provided, That all mercenary <hi>Lawyers</hi> be exempted from being any more elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or choſen to ſit as <hi>Members</hi> of the ſame; the people alſo prevented from coming up to
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> practiſed in our Engliſh tongue, in ſome brief expedicious
way, without any delatory <hi>Cheats, Fees,</hi> or <hi>Bribes,</hi> (as now uſed) according to the command of
God, the preſent practiſe of all other Nations in the World, where more <hi>Juſtice</hi> is to be had for
eight pence, then here in our Land for 800l. And WHY NOT unjuſt things aboliſhed?</p>
            <p>Finally, our deſires are, That becauſe there is a far greater number of able, honeſt, Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
underſtanding men, in every of our Cities, Counties, Hundreds, Towns, and Villages, that
are able to judg and determine all <hi>Controverſies</hi> between a man and his Neighbor, better then
any of thoſe Inſtruments of <hi>Contention,</hi> The <hi>Lawyers, (Englands Cankerworms</hi>) whoſe Nature
and Profeſſion is to fiſh in troubled Waters, and to make the Wound of <hi>Contention</hi> deeper and
far larger, rather then to cure it, That therefore they may no ways be thought fit to decide any
<hi>Controverſie</hi> in <hi>Judgment,</hi> nor to ſit in our <hi>National Aſſemblies,</hi> but to be expunged and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
the <hi>Houſe of Parliament,</hi> even as the <hi>Biſhops, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> were before them? And
WHY NOT the power of ſuch <hi>Serpents</hi> deſtroyed, and quite confounded, confounded?</p>
            <closer>WHY NOT?
<hi>Amen.</hi>
