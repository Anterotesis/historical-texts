         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Matter herein doth more concern your ſelves then
me, and the beſt PRUDENTIALS that you have.
If this <hi>Quadruple</hi> Diſcourſe, do but come to your
<hi>Ears,</hi> the Commonwealth is an object preſented to
your <hi>Eyes,</hi> 1. As an ANATOMY (but moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably

<hi>Cauſe</hi> of Chriſt upon orders ENDEMICK (both to
MEN and to CHRISTIANS) as was contended
for, by the well-affected; and is by <hi>J. R.</hi> In every

either from Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s opening of his <hi>Stomach;</hi> Mr.

conſideration, <hi>Chilification</hi> or concoction of the
whole Matter.</p>
            <p>1. Upon the account of that PUBLICK TRUST
and <hi>confidence</hi> which the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> hath in you: if
<hi>Immanuel</hi> (your <hi>Motto,</hi> or) GOD WITH US, be
GOD WITH YOU, then <hi>Butter and hony ſhall be your
food, and you ſhall CHOOSE the GOCD, and REFUSE the
EVIL; yea, BUTTER AND HONY ſhall every one Eate
that is left in the Land,</hi> Iſa. 7. 15, 22. under ſuch a
Government. What is <hi>eligible</hi> (I hope) will be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,</hi>
and (upon your digeſtion) profitable and
nutrimental to the WHOLE BOBY; it may be (by
this) you may find out, who are (indeed) the <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-plotters,</hi>
and which are the <hi>Grand Deſigns</hi>
that would blow you up into the <hi>open Air.</hi> Some
<pb facs="tcp:119126:3"/>
are ſo confident of carrying it yet, that already they
conclude the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> is but a <hi>firme Nihil,</hi> or a
meer Nothing without a <hi>foundation;</hi> and it is hard to
ſay, whether they would propagate their work more
by a <hi>Faux</hi> under, or by a <hi>Fax</hi> in the <hi>Parliament Houſe.</hi>
All I can do in that, is but to tell you where and how
their <hi>Barrels</hi> are laid, and Inſtruments are at work.
In the next place, I could not do leſs (if not ſomewhat
more) then to preſent your <hi>Honours</hi> with the SPOIL
of thoſe GOODS that I have taken from your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
by way of <hi>repriſal</hi> or Letters of <hi>Mart,</hi> in this <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick</hi>
ſuſception for the ſervice of the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi>
and therein, the <hi>recovery</hi> made of the Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of your moſt worthy Members, Sir <hi>Arthur
Haſlerige,</hi> Sir <hi>Hen. Vane, &amp;c.</hi> and others (not loſt,
but) invaded by moſt <hi>Name-murthering</hi> and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<hi>Pickroons,</hi> who have infeſted and ranged the
Coaſts of our <hi>Commonwealth</hi> (now) many months (if
not years) together; to rob you and us, them and the
<hi>Commonwealth,</hi> as they have done. And this I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that as I hoiſed <hi>Sail,</hi> and was in purſuit of the
SPIT-FIRE (Mr. <hi>P.</hi>) I was ſet upon (and ſo fell in)
with the HUNTER (Mr. <hi>B</hi>) who came in to aſſiſt
the <hi>firſt:</hi> and afterward I met with the FOX in the
way (Mr. <hi>H.</hi>) though I cannot ſay, of the ſame <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi>
yet at the ſame imployment; All which I have
(with God's bleſſing) BOARDED (and without
much <hi>Fiering</hi> on my part) have brought them into this
BAY before you, as Prize (in the RESOLUTION)
where I now am bent to live and die (through Gods
grace) for the <hi>Good old Cauſe and a Chriſtian Commonw.</hi>)</p>
            <p>2. Upon the <hi>account</hi> of that late DEBATE had of
me, (unknown to me) in the COUNCIL; <hi>wherein</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119126:4"/>
ſome would render me what (I hope) they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
find me; <hi>herein</hi> ſome ſhall find me what (I fear)
they would never render me to be, both for <hi>Principles</hi>
and <hi>Practice</hi> as to Government; which I preſume are
ſuch as (infirmities excepted) you would be loath to
<hi>eject</hi> or not <hi>affect.</hi> And therefore (<hi>Curvis Poplitibus</hi>)
with bended knees, and a will broken and bowed to
the foot of the Lord) do I preſent my <hi>Requeſts</hi> to him
for you; and to you for him; and from him, that you
may give us but a due incouragement (that are ready
to engage our utmoſt in your ſervice for Chriſt and
the <hi>Cauſe</hi>) by a true judgement upon this <hi>Subject</hi> ſet
before you, <hi>viz.</hi> the HEAD (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt) and <hi>BODY
of the Commonwealth i.e.</hi> the adherents to the CAUSE,
as they are (indeed) the moſt <hi>ſound,</hi> ſanable, and <hi>ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
parts of it's <hi>Constitution;</hi> and this</p>
            <p>1. In the PHYSIO-LOGY of it; wherein all
things muſt be pondered that appertain to the <hi>eſſence</hi>
or nature of our <hi>Cauſe</hi> and conſtitution, (<hi>viz. Parts,</hi>
Temperaments, <hi>faculties,</hi> functions, moſt <hi>innate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
qualities, and the like) for then I dare aver, you
will give us freedom to pay the TENTHS of all the
SPOIL to our <hi>Melch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> and take the <hi>bleſſings;</hi> yea, to <hi>conſecrate
the gain unto JEHOVAH, and the ſubſtance to the ADON
of the whole earth.</hi> (Hacharamti, the <hi>word is;</hi> I will ſet
it apart, with an <hi>Anathema</hi> to any that ſhall alter that
<hi>property</hi> of it, <hi>Micah 4. 13.</hi>) to retrieve and drive on
this <hi>interest of Chriſt,</hi> (our ADON) in all, and of
JEHOVAH above <hi>All;</hi> as ſuits beſt with the very
<hi>being</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of our CAUSE. It is your Honour
to maintain HIS, and your <hi>intereſt</hi> to eſpouſe HIS;

without any <hi>contempt</hi> to your <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> or
to the Peoples juſt Rights and <hi>Liberty,</hi> plead this
CAUSE, and juſtifie it as YOUR'S, as THEIR'S,
as OUR'S, and as HIS; who ſhall be, who muſt be,
<hi>the deſire of all nations.</hi> But becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may
be heard with many when I may not, I ſhall uſher
in ALL, in his own words, that I have to offer for
this Chriſtian <hi>Commonwealth</hi> or <hi>Theocratick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as the CONCAMERATION and upſhot of
the <hi>whole</hi> Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>2. In the PATHOLOGY of it; and therein to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how the <hi>Principal parts</hi> might be <hi>affected</hi> (if not
<hi>infected</hi>) with the late <hi>Morbous eſtate</hi> of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:</hi>
And <hi>acted</hi> (for that time) ſo <hi>preternaturally,</hi>
that might render it as unſafe then to <hi>follow</hi> them,
as now to <hi>fall</hi> on them for no MEMBERS, (<hi>humanum
eſt errare, ſed inhumanum perſeverare,</hi> Cic. Phil. 2.) Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we be of opinion that the only way to cure a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
is to cut off the member; or to evacuate an <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi>
is to kill the <hi>man.</hi> So to meaſure the affections
of your <hi>old friends</hi> (who are ſound at heart) ADHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RENTS
to the <hi>Good old Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> by
any humorous or incompoſed reſentment of your
interruption (which was ſudden and amazing!)
however they took it, may be dangerous and unjuſt.
Seeing ſome that were more troubled fell in with the
<hi>Apostacy;</hi> and ſome that were leſs, <hi>fell out</hi> with it! yea,
ſeeing ſuch as were <hi>Active</hi> in it, and made their <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi>

into a Perpetration of worſer things (and in that
they did <hi>Triumph and boaſt</hi>) be the very <hi>Quivers</hi> of
thoſe Arrows that are ſhot at them? As ſoon as the
<hi>firſt ſort</hi> ſaw the ſnare, they eſcaped it, with the loſs of
Liberty, Eſtate and <hi>Livelihood,</hi> a many of them; but
the <hi>last ſort</hi> ſaw it, kept it, and became their enemies
that did it not. The <hi>firſt ſort</hi> were more in ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and (as they intended) upon the account of the
Cauſe (the <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Grounds</hi> in the <hi>Declaration An.
1653.</hi> pretended, were for the <hi>better carrying on of the
Cauſe, and a more abſolute weaning the people from Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and for ſucceſſive Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c.) but the laſt ſort
in <hi>Subtlety</hi> and Deſign (a many of them) upon the
account of themſelves, Places &amp; Profits. The <hi>firſt ſort</hi>
did ſink but like <hi>Peter,</hi> and as their feet ſlipp'd, their
hands held faſt upon Chriſt; but the <hi>laſt ſort</hi> ſunk
rather like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> having no principle to bear them
up, and nothing to <hi>hold</hi> faſt by: (only this we ſee by
it) that a man may <hi>ſink</hi> and <hi>riſe!</hi> and ſink and riſe
again! and yet be recovered at the laſt.) The <hi>first</hi>
were WITHOUT, blinded with Words, and knew
nothing but what was openly pretended; the LAST
were WITHIN, even in their <hi>Cabals,</hi> and might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb facs="tcp:119126:5"/>
gueſs at what they ſecretly intended. The <hi>first</hi>
did but <hi>ſtumble;</hi> but the laſt did fall, and lie in their
filth. It is a <hi>Good horſe</hi> that never ſtumbles, but it is
a <hi>Bad</hi> one that ever does; and that will wallow in it
too! To <hi>ſtumble</hi> once, is a <hi>common fault;</hi> but twice,
(at <hi>one Stone</hi> too) is a <hi>ſpecial one!</hi> and therefore (we
humbly think) that the <hi>firſt</hi> ought not ſo to be explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
if the <hi>laſt</hi> ought ſo to be applauded and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The Orator ſaid (<hi>Natura me Clementem fecit,

            <p>For my own part, I need no <hi>Apology</hi> in the matter,
who was poſſeſt with amazement at the raſhneſs of
the Action. I was ſo far from irritating or abetting
it (as ſome would ſuggeſt) that I never mention'd
or imagin'd it; or (to my knowledge) heard it of
any other, till it was performed: And then was ſo
unſatisfied with it (of which eminent Perſons are
my Witneſſes) as might free me both from the <hi>ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and the <hi>ſin</hi> of it. Beſides, it is in print to the

<note n="*" place="margin">Vide <hi>my</hi> Irenic. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. Epiſt <hi>to Church,</hi> p. 7.</note>. Yet when that <hi>interruption</hi> had ſo candid an
<hi>Interpretation,</hi> by <hi>Good People</hi> (who were <hi>over-credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
and ignorant of the Deſign) I did write to the

            <p>Neither expect I any thanks, to be an <hi>Advocate</hi> for

upon the whole, I am ready (in my <hi>Reaſon</hi>) to conclude,</p>
            <p>1. That it is one of the moſt ſubtile <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Plots</hi> which
the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have, to make us believe <hi>that</hi> to be their
<hi>SPAWN,</hi> which they never had the leaſt <hi>Sperma</hi> of; either
in the <gap reason="foreign">

they moſt deadly hate (and is moſt againſt their very <hi>nature</hi>)
on purpoſe to fright us from it, when they have no better way
to beat us off it; and to turn that out at the BACK-DOOR,
which they cannot keep out at the FORE-DOOR; <hi>This,</hi> this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119126:24"/>
is the very thing that they deſigne in it. And upon this (it
is like) they may give out, that they have <hi>fifteen Colledges of
Quick-ſilver'd Seminaries, and Jeſuites</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> his Speech, <hi>Septem. 4. 1654.</hi> p.
16, 17. <hi>That they have a Conſistory and Council that R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LES
all the Affairs of England</hi> (which it may be they did in his
<hi>Dayes, i. e.</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from the Commonwealth) and
that in <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſaid about four years ſince, <hi>They had
above fifteen hundred Jeſuites in England.</hi> So for that ſmart
<hi>Jeſuite,</hi> which Mr. <hi>P.</hi> tells us of, and of his reports, in <hi>p. 85,
86, 87.</hi> as <hi>Prodigious</hi> as <hi>Prolix.</hi> I profeſs I fear it might be
a <hi>Plot</hi> on purpoſe to amuze us, and to make our <hi>Joult-Heads,</hi>
(as they call us) believe <hi>Strange things,</hi> to deter us from our
<hi>Duty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Not but that a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jealouſie</hi> be had, and ſearch he made.</note> not our <hi>Danger</hi> thereby: Though I would not ſay <hi>one

(as I fear Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> do) by believing theſe CHEATS,
and moving upon the PRATE of ſuch <hi>Pragmaticks</hi> as the
<hi>Jeſuites</hi> are, to condemn the Commonwealth as theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they (it may hap for their intereſt) would ſay it and ſwear
it too with <hi>procacity</hi> enough to turn us from it. And this, I
think, may be rather the <hi>Plot</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi>
(or at leaſt the Porch of it) who fear us more as a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>

as Mr. <hi>Hooper</hi> (Martyr) ſaid to his Friends, <hi>Anno 1555. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
Extremity, and Enforcing, have been the onely Arguments

               <hi>Adam Contzen,</hi>
in's Directions for Reſtoring Popery, Chap. 17. (Lib. 2.) <hi>To
preſerve Popery, that no other Religion ſhould be permitted, and
the ſpeedy puniſhing of the Erroneous, cutting them off in their firſt
appearance, prohibiting their Books, and taking heed of</hi> Julian'<hi>s
Device, deſtroying of Religion by Liberty for all Sects.</hi> Thus they
do (ſayes Mr. <hi>B.</hi>) in <hi>Spain, Italy, Austria, Bavaria,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:119126:34"/>
deſtroy Liberty of Conſcience. Is this then the Jeſuites
way (by Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s own words) to let in Popery, or to deſtroy it?
The Jeſuite calls it, <hi>A deſtroying of</hi> the <hi>Religion,</hi> (vizt. Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
<hi>to give Liberty</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>to all Sects.</hi> Indeed Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
doth put me in minde of one <hi>Cacus</hi> a great Thief, that was
wont to pull all the Cattel he ſtole into his DEN, backward,
(or by the Tail) to avoid the purſuit of the people that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the <hi>Track;</hi> and this pretty Knack Mr. <hi>B.</hi> uſes, to pull
us into Popery (as we ſhall ſee preſently) and yet pretends to
keep us from it, by the <hi>Track,</hi> that whoever follows (as he
hath made it) ſhall no more finde out the <hi>Introductor</hi> of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
and Jeſuitick Principles, then the People did the <hi>Thief;</hi>
but be going from his <hi>Den,</hi> not toward it. And to ſee yet
further how much he ſerves the JESUITE <hi>Contzen,</hi> Chap. 18
to bring in Popery into a Land, he ſhews, 1. <hi>Do it ſlowly and
ſliely. 2. It's eaſie; when the common people are a while taken
with Novelties, and diverſities of Religion, they'l be weary, and
give themſelves up to the R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LERS wills,</hi> i. e. to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
in matters of Religion. And is not this the way (by
their own words) to introduce Popery? So the Jeſuites 7th
Rule, which is, <hi>To forbid them</hi> (they account erronious) <hi>in
their Aſſemblies,</hi> (and is not this to <hi>Impoſe</hi> upon them in
matters of Worſhip?) and his 8th Rule is, <hi>To uſe Violence.</hi>
And laſtly, another Rule is, That <hi>the Magiſtrate keep the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
Preſentations and Examinations of Ministers in his
own hand,</hi> &amp;c. So that all thoſe Miniſters that will ſide with
their power over the Conſciences of poor people, ſhall be
gratified with good Livings for it. Let any ſee now if Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s
be not the very Method of the Jeſuite to reſtore Popery, to
put the Magiſtrate upon <hi>Impoſing</hi> or infringing Liberty of
Conſcience. And indeed, to add hereto his familiar converſe
and parly with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> his eager invitation, and offers of
peace and communion with the <hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi> from p.
364. to 376. where (in 5 or 6 Chapters together) he offers
to the Papiſts love, peace and fellowſhip (but is far from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
it to his poor <hi>Brethren</hi> at home, who are farther off
from Popery then himſelf, both in Principles, Doctrine and
Practice) may leave the matter without Vacillation, That it
is Mr. <hi>B.</hi> not the Healing Queſtion that would uſher in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
The Grounds he goes upon are theſe, pag. 364.

as to this <hi>Negative</hi> granted by moſt or all the <hi>Orthodox</hi> of
theſe laſt <hi>ages</hi> (as well as ſome in <hi>former) That they ought not
to interpoſe or impoſe in the worſhip of God, or in the matters of
faith and Conſcience</hi> (as ſuch) <hi>but as they come under their Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance</hi>
(Quatenus Magiſtrates) <hi>or a civil conſideration,</hi> ſo they
may and muſt: And ſo the <hi>Healing Queſt.</hi> freely and fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones
it, p. 6. They <hi>are to content themſelves with what is plain
in their Commiſſion; as ordained of God to be his Miniſters to
men for good, whiles they approve themſelves the doers of that
which is good: In like manner he is to be a Miniſter of Terrour
and Revenge to thoſe that do evil in matters of outward pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
converſe, dealings,</hi> &amp;c. What can be more deſired? this
<hi>Controverſie</hi> was ſo cleared in the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> and
in the <hi>heat of the Wars,</hi> that we made no Queſtion of it then.
Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in's 3. lib. <hi>of's ſurvey of Ch. Diſc.</hi> Cha. 1. aſſerts
it, <hi>That the Civil power may</hi> (as a thing civil) <hi>require men to
be Civil, and to come under the call or outward tender of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel:</hi>
(which is <hi>vox ſignificativa Chriſti,) but cannot compel
them, or force their Conſciences by any means.</hi> Much leſs force
them to this <hi>place</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> this <hi>man</hi> or <hi>that;</hi> this part of the
<hi>worſhip of God,</hi> or <hi>that;</hi> but can compel them to be peaceable,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119126:37"/>
               <hi>Civil, &amp;c.</hi> no otherwiſe. Thus Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> ſaid to Mr.
<hi>Prynne</hi> (in's <hi>Vindic.</hi> and Anſw. to's 12. Inter. p. 70.) <hi>We must
put a difference betwixt Conſcience, and practice: God alone is
Judge, and Chriſt is Lord of the Conſcience; but the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
of mens Actions, whether good</hi> (to encourage them) <hi>or
evil, to</hi> diſcourage and puniſh, Rom. 13. 3, 4. and ſo ſaith the
<hi>Healing Queſt.</hi> upon theſe reaſons, p. 7. <hi>That it is not good
for the people to be brought up in a biting, devouring, wrathful
ſpirit one againſt the other; or be found to do that to another,
which we would not have them do to us were we in their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Now this is the Golden Rule indeed, were it but <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered</hi>
with Silver Practices; and ſo no Conſciences could
be <hi>impoſed</hi> upon in the worſhip of God: Beſides, for himſelf
and that party Mr. <hi>B.</hi> urgeth a <hi>neceſſity of liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi>

in the <hi>dignity,</hi> (or good, ſound and beſt of the whole body)

to conclude, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himſelf ſaith, (whom I preſume you will
hear when you will not me) p. 221. Theſ. 206. <hi>It is this
Theocratical polity, or Divine Commonwealth, which is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
Reign of Chriſt on earth, which all Christians are
agreed may be ſought; and that temporal dignity of Saints
which undoubtedly would bleſs the world.</hi> So in p. 223. Theſ.
207. <hi>I think the promoting of this holy Theocratick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is the point of reformation, that we are called to deſire,
by them that now plead for the Reign of Chriſt and the Saints.</hi>
And what do we deſire more? Wherefore (we hope) you will

we hope are) ſo to you, (<hi>Right Honourable!</hi>) which you
would do well to look after and encourage; ſeeing the very
