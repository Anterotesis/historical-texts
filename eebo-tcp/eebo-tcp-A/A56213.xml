            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

head of necessity, <hi>reducing all the grounds of our seisure &amp; sequestration

and no justification at all if true.</p>
            <p>But to take away this ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of necessity altogether, it stands but upon
these two generall feet. First, that the Members secured, and secluded,
<hi>were a corrupt Majority of the House, Secondly,</hi> That if they had not
thus secured and secluded them, <hi>they would have proceeded to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of a speedy peace with the King in pursuance of this their
Vote: Ergo</hi> the Army were extraordinarily necessitated to secure and
seclude them. This is the Logick of the whole answer, all surmises
concerning forepast miscariages in the House, and <hi>packing of New E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections</hi>
[in which themselves and their owne party are most peccant,
few of their Elections being due or faire, and divers of them voted
voyd, as Mr. <hi>Fryes, Blagraves,</hi> and others who now sit and vote]
and all miscariages concerning <hi>Irel.</hi> which are false, [specified only without
verity or proof against any of us] relating nothing at all to our present seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of which they confesse the vote of Decemb. 5. to be the onely impulsive
cause. The plaine English of the first ground of their Necessity is this.
The <hi>Majority</hi> of the House of Commons [which in all debates is and
alwayes hath been the house] over-voted the <hi>Minority</hi> or lesser part. <hi>Ergo</hi>
there is a necessity, that the Army should s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lude them, that so the <hi>smaller
Number</hi> might sit alone without them and vote what they please, [as now
they doe] and null and repeal what ever the Major part had voted repugnant
to the Armies designes.</p>
            <p>This new <hi>Utopian</hi> necessity [never heard of nor pretended in the world till
now] ought to be eternally exploded, as the horriddest distructive Monster to
Government, and States, ever yet produced in the world, as I shall cleare by
these particulars.</p>
            <p>FIRST, It utterly subverts, the undoubted rights, priviledges,
and constitutions of all Parliaments or Councells whatsoever. from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106039:8"/>
the beginning of the world till now, whether civill, military, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,
wherein the Majority of voices upon the question, ever car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the Vote, and is still reputed the act of the whole Councell or
Parliament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> adly, It overthrowes the legall forme and proceedings
in all popular Elections of Knights, Citizens, Burgesses, Mayors,
Bayliffs, Coroners, Verderers, Wardens of Companies, Common-Councell-men
&amp; all others, ever carried &amp; determined by the plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of voices, of those who have right to elect. 3dly, It overturnes their
<hi>New Bable,</hi> to wit the <hi>Agreement</hi> of the people, and new Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,
in which themselves resolve, the Majority of the Electors
ought to chuse their new Representatives, and the Votes of the Major
part of them who meet, ought to bind all the rest, and not the minor
part to seclude or sway the rest. 4thly, It will soon dissolve their new
erected strange generall Councell of the Officers of the Army, where
all matters are yet concluded by plurality of voices, where if the major
part should vote against the Kings trayterous beheading, or the <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the people,</hi> the Levellers, being the lesser part, upon this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

soize on &amp; secure them, and make themselves the only General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
though the fewest, and act what they please, when the others are
secluded. 5ly, It subverts all rules of Judicature &amp; Justice in al Courts
of. Justice, where there are more Judges &amp; Justices then one, where the
majority of voices (as likewise at Commitees) over-rule the minority:
who upon the pretence of necessity, and being a corrupt majority, may
be kept forcibly from or pulled off the Bench, by any persons who
suspect they will encline or give judgement against them, in any cause
depending before them. 6ly, It lays a foundation for all the Tyranny,
villany &amp; oppression that can be imagined, which the Levellers begin
in some places to pursue, &amp; the Army too. For example. The King (say
they) if he &amp; monarchy continue, will in time grow too strong for the
people. <hi>Ergo</hi> there is a necessity we should pul down monarchy &amp; him
now, &amp; have no more Kings to rule over us. The house of Lords will
be too potent for the Commons &amp; have a negative voice to cross what
they shall Vote. <hi>Ergo</hi> we are now necessitated whiles we have power
in our hands, to pull downe the house of Lords and lay their honour
in the Dust. The City of <hi>London</hi> was too powerfull, rich and wealthy
for the Countrey and us heretofore, and kept down Sectaries from
publick Offices, <hi>Ergo</hi> whiles we have the power in our hands, we
must break down all their out workes, divide &amp; lay aside all their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi>
empty their bagges, pull downe their pride, throw out their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106039:8"/>
old Officers, put in new ones of our own faction, take away their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and freedome of Elections contrary to their Charters, &amp; sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Acts of Parliament, dispense with Common-councel-mens
Oathes; and so inslave the City to our vassalage. This is their present
practise. The Land-lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

extraordinary necessity, now abate the Tenants Rents, alter their
Tenures and Customes, share their Lands and wealth amongst our
selves and the poore: and if any poore man by forging an Act of
Parliament or otherwise, pretend a Title to any rich mans Lands,
turne the rich man out of possession, and put the poore into it: as some
Levellers and Souldiers have lately done in <hi>Essex</hi> in the case between

Law and conscience, Such a Monster is this plea of necessity for
publick good, already grown unto through the Armies power, and
how soon it will proceed to draw the blood of many gallant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Lords, and Members now secluded (for fear they should prove
the stronger as well as the major number, and therefore must lose
their heads to prevent al future dangers &amp; revenge) God only knows.</p>
            <p>The second ground for the necessity of our seisure and seclusion is
this: that the pretended corrupt majority of the House would have
closed with the King, &amp; setled the Kingdomes peace before this time
had they not been secured. <hi>Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the people and Kingdome, being by the Armies principles, the originall

are their trustees to make and setlle. Peace, but no necessity for the army to
hinder or secure us from effecting it, yes a necessity for them to assist us
in it, and release us to accomplish it, which by Gods blessing we had done
ere this.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer: 1. It is the foulest, falsest, and most
malicious scandall that ever man could invent, which the ensuing
Speech will abundantly refute, to the shame of those who dare to aver
it in print. 2. Admit it true: yet an unjust and unequall peace, is
better, safer, and more honourable for us, (now we are quite exhausted,
and can manage warre no longer, and Ireland so neere its ruine) then the
justest Warre; which ought not to be undertaken at first without abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity, and nes to continue one houre longer then that necessity
endures, especially if it be a Civill Warre between those of the same
Nation, blood, Religion; or a defensive Warre, as our Warre is,
who have now no armed Enemies to encounter; and so there can be no
pretence of necessity to continue a Warre, or so great a recruited Army,
unlesse it be to enslave us to martiall Law and Tyranny, in stead of peace
and Liberty. 3. Neither God, nor the Kingdome, nor Majority of the
people, ever made the Army Iudges of the goodnesse or badnesse of the
intended peace, but the Parliament onely; the onely proper Iudges
likewise of the necessity of peace or Warre: And therefore for them
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106039:9"/>
thus forcibly to wrest this Iudicatory out of the Houses bands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

it, is neither<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 12. 13, 14. 1 Per. 4. 15. Thes. 4, 11. 2 Thes. 3. 11. Heb. 5. 4.</note>

pull all the Members out of the Houses, and Iudges from the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that would not give Iudgement for him, be his cause never so

open view of all the World: against their trusts, duties, covenants.
And whereas some of them repented and were sorry for it, these Saints doe not
onely not repent of it but persevere in and justifie this Treason in print, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of their restraints to be <hi>injurious</hi> and <hi>mistakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In being Iudges in their own cases, and accusers and witnesses
too against the secluded Members; sundry Members of the Commons
House, being both Members of the <hi>Generall Councell</hi> and Army (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the<note n="*" place="margin">A Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection p. 634.</note>

Ireton, Harrison, Ingoldesby,</hi> Sir <hi>William Constable, Henry
Martin, &amp;c.</hi> and sitting and acting in both; hammering all things they
design in the Generall Councell first, (as the <hi>Agreement of the people,</hi> and
the like) and then presenting them to passe for current in the House, and penning
their <hi>Declarations, Remonstrances, &amp;c.</hi> against the Priviledges and
Members of the House; A thing never practised by any Members till these:
who make the Councell in the Army the principall engin to carry on all their
projects in the House. From which intolerable abuse all the late distempers
of the Armie, and mutinies against the Houses have for the most part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In that they being but between 40 and 60 Members only,
have presumed by this <hi>vote</hi> and a <hi>Declaration</hi> of Ian. 15. to censure above
200; and to consent to their long restraint and seclusion, in stead of righting
and releasing them; and impeaching or committing the chief Authors of and
actions in their securing and secluding, and bringing them to speedy Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

Members.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> In presuming to passe such a Vote as this, whiles under
a visible armed force; when as this House adjourned and refused to
sit upon the Kings demand of the five Members, till they were righted.
And Mr. Speaker, and most of the Members now sitting, deserted
and fled away from the House, upon a far smaller force then this; even
after the force was ever, refusing to sit till the Houses were restored
to a condition of honor, freedom and safety; and declared all Votes,
Ordinances, Orders and proceedings <hi>meerly null and void,</hi> during their
absence; though not made under any such apparent force as is now upon the
House, and when there were at least twice as many Members sitting
as now, and not one secured nor secluded from coming freely to it without
fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> In justifying these two Iesuiticall and destructive
grounds and pretences of this violence upon the House and Members
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106039:12"/>
of <hi>honest publique intentions, and necessity for publique ends,</hi>
which I have proved so absurd, impious and dangerous in sundry
respects, and such as by any armed Party whatsoever may bee
made use of upon all occasions to force and destroy all future Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Vpon all which considerations, I shall now take out the <hi>Solemn
League and Covenant,</hi> these <hi>Members of the House, and Officers
of the Army</hi> have so <hi>solemnly</hi> taken and made to God, <hi>with hands
lifted up to heaven,</hi> and most apparently violated in this and other
particulars of late; and (in case they proceed still obstinately in these
violent and perfidious wayes) shall use the same words as<note n="*" place="margin">Knols Twkish history, <hi>p.</hi> 297. 298.</note>

               <hi>I shall answer only two Scripture-Texts,<note n="*" place="margin">Right &amp; Might, p. 20. 21.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by</hi> John Godwin, <hi>and others, to justifi the force upon us. sThe first
is,</hi> David's eating of the Shew-bread, which was lawfull on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the Priests to eat; which yet was lawfull for him and
his men to eat in case of necessity to preserve life, there being no
other bread, <hi>1 Sam. 21. 4, 5, 6. Matth. 12. 4. And that</hi> to save the life
of a man, ox, or beast fallen into a ditch; a man in such a case of
necessity may break the Sabbath, Luke 14. 4. Ergo, <hi>The Army in
case of necessity may lawfully imprison and seclude the Members. The sum of
a his Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> That the Argument is a meer inconsequent, if granted: I or,
first, The eating of Shew-bread in it self was no morall evill; nor the saving
of a Mans, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>x, or Asses life, but a thing lawfull and commendable: But the
resisting of lawfull Authority contrary to Duty, Oath, Covenant, aud offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unjust violence to the persons of those whom the Army are obliged to
protect, and have no authority by the law of God or Man to seize or
imprison; is a morall sinne against the Fifth Commandement, and
many expresse Texts fore-quoted. Therefore the cases are no wayes pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The eating <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>of Shewbread, in case of necessity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
life only, is neither within the intention nor meaning of
<hi>Exodus</hi> 25. 30. 31. as <hi>Abimelech</hi> himself acknowledged to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
in these words, <hi>The Bread IS IN A MANNER COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON,
&amp;c. 1 Sam.</hi> 21. 5. And our Saviour himself seems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 4. That the pulling out of an Ox or Asse on the
Sabbath day, being an extraordinary act of mercy and necessity too,
was not within the intent of the Fourth Commandement, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the words. Whereas the violence done to our persons and the
Houses is both within the words and intention of the forecited Texts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:106039:13"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> These two necessities were present, absolute, certain, and that
onely to save the life of a hungry or sick person; or of a perishing beast. But
the Officers and Armies lives were not now in any imminent danger of death
for want of bread; nor their Horses of Asses cast into a ditch by us: and
the imprisonment of our persons was neither to preserve their own, nor their
horses lives from present death; but to hinder us from preserving the lives of
three dying Kingdoms. Therefore these examples and Texts are very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Though <hi>David</hi> and his Young-men did eat the Shewbread;
yet it is observable, that they did not take it away violently from the Priests,
though it were to save their lives, (as souldiers now take free-quarter against
mens wills) nor offered any violence to <hi>Abimelech's</hi> person, nor put him
by his Priests Office, (as some Souldiers now forcibly enter into our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
Pulpits, when there is no necessity:) But they staid, till they
had his opinion in point of conscience, whether they might take it, and <hi>till the
Priest</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> 21. 6.</note> 
               <hi>GAVE HIM THE HALLOWED BREAD:</hi>
So as the Argument from hence must be; <hi>David</hi> and his men, even in
case of necessity to save their lives, would not take so much as a loaf of bread,
till the Priest voluntarily gave it them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Officers and Army
may lawfully take Free-quarter upon, and forcibly seclude and imprison
the Members of Parliament against their duties, Covenant, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents.
Is not this pretty Logick and Divinity from <hi>John Goodwin,</hi>
who deems himself the only compleat Disputant and Divine in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
Doth not the contrary directly follow from the Text: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
they ought not to take Free-quarter, nor offer the least violence to their
persons without their consents; according to <hi>John Baptists Doctrine</hi> to
Souldiers, <hi>Luke 3. 14. Do violence to no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The other Argument is as absurd. It is lawfull to pull an Ox
or an Asse on the Sabbath day out of a ditch, to save their lives: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
It is lawfull for the Officers and Army forcibly to imprison and seclude
200 Commoners out of the House, and keep a force upon the House; (yea, to
send armed Regiments of Morse upon the Sabbath day round about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
streets and the Countrey when there is no necessity) to destroy mens lives
and liberties, and three Kingdoms too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Could Oxen and Asses fallen into a ditch speak, as well as men
in a ditch, they would call for help to draw them forth to preserve their lives.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106039:13"/>
So that this Act of Charity, (not Violence in pulling them out on the Sabbath
day, is with their full and free consents and desires. Then set the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
right, and the Argument thence must be this: A man on the Sabbath
day) out of meer charity and necessity may lawfully pull a Man, Ox, or Asse
out of a deep ditch at their requests and desire, (where as the Iew at Teukes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
perished in the Iakes, out of which he would not be pulled on his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;)
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the Officers and Army may lawfully cast the Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by force and violence into Hell, prison and use them worse then any Oxe
or Asse, without and against their consents and priviledges. I hope<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam's</hi>

            <p>I have no more to add, but only this, That if holy <hi>David</hi> himself had now
been a Member of the Commons-house, or King of <hi>England,</hi> he had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

were satisfactory or not satisfactory?</head>
            <opener>Mr. Speaker,</opener>
            <p>BEing called to be a Member of this House without my privity
or seeking and against my judgment (having formerly refused
many places freely tendered to me) by the unanimous ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
(without one dissenting voice) of that Borough for
which I serve, and by a divine providence entring within these
doors in this great conjuncture of the highest publique affairs that
ever came within these wals, wherein the very life or death, the <hi>weal</hi>
or <hi>ruine</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> (if not of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> too) consist in
our <hi>Ay</hi> or <hi>No,</hi> upon the question now debating, I shall with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
boldness, crave liberty to discharge my conscience towards God,
and duty to my dying country, which now lies at stake: and so much
the rather because [for ought I know]it may be the last time I shall
have freedome to speak my minde within this House.</p>
            <p>That I may, in this great debate more sincerely speak my very heart
and soul without any prejudice, I shall humbly crave leave, briefly
to remove two seeming prejudices, which may (perchance) in some
members opinions inervate the strength of those reasons I shal hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
represent unto you, to make good my conclusion touching the
satisfactorinesse of the Kings answers to the Houses Propositions.</p>
            <p>The first, is that wherewith some Members have upon another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion<note place="margin">The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

suffered from the King and Prelates for this my opposition, more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106039:17"/>
then any man. That if the King and Prelates be ever restored to their
pristine Arbitrary power and illegall prerogative, I must expect to
suffer from them as much, if not more then any man.</p>
            <p>That all the Royal favour I ever yet received from his Majesty or
his Partie, was the cutting off both my ears, two several times one
after another, in a most barbarous manner; the setting me upon
three severall pillories at <hi>Westminster</hi> and in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> in a disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
manner, each time for two houres space together: stigmatizing
on both cheeks: the burning of my licenced books before my face
by the hand of the hangman: the imposing of two fines upon me of
50001.2 peece; expulsion out of the Innes of Court and University
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and degradation in both, the losse of my calling almost
nine yeares space, the seisure of my Bookes and Estate, above eight
years imprisonment in several prisons, at least 4 of these years spent
in close imprisoment and exile in <hi>CARNARV AN</hi> in <hi>Northwales,</hi> and
in the lsle of <hi>IERSEY,</hi> where I was debarred the use of pen, inke,
paper, and all books, almost but the Bible, with the least accesse of
any friend, without any allowance of diet for my support. And all
this for my good service to the State in opposing Popery and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
Tyranny; for all which sufferings and losses, I never yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
one farthing recompence from the King or any other, though I
have waited above 8 years, at your doors for justice and reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and neglecting my own private calling and affairs imployed
most of my time, studies, and expended many hundred pounds out
of my purse, since my inlargement, to maintain your cause against
the King, his Popish and Prelaticall party. For all which cost and
labour, I never yet demanded nor received one farthing from the
Houses, nor the least office or preferment whatsoever, though they

as this, I wish he may receive no other badges of Royall favour from
his Majesty, nor greater reward or honor from the Houses then I have
done; and then I beleeve he will no more causlesly asperse or suspect
me, for being now a <hi>Royal</hi> favourite, or <hi>Apostate</hi> from the publike cause.</p>
            <p>True it is (which it behoves me now to touch) that about 4 years since
I published a Book, entituled, <hi>The Royal Popish Favorite;</hi> wherein [as
likewise in my <hi>Hidden works of Darknesse brought to publique light;</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
a year after it] I did, with no little labour and expence, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the world, the severall plots and proceedings of the <hi>Iesuites,
Papists,</hi> and their <hi>forraign and domesticke confederates,</hi> to introduce and
set up <hi>Popery</hi> throughout <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and how farre
they had inveagled the K. not only to connive at, but to countenance
and assist them in a great measure, more fully &amp; evidently then any else
had done. And those worthy Members of this House who drew up that
<hi>Declaration</hi> whereupon they voted, No more Addresses to the King,
plowed but with my heyfer, borrowing all or most of their real mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
from my writings; A convincing evidence, that I am yet no more
a <hi>Royal favourite</hi> then themselves. Yet this I must adde withall, to take
off that aspersion, of being an <hi>Apostate</hi> from my first principles, that I
never published those Books (as I then professed in them, and now
again protest) to scandalize or defame the King, or alienate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
affections from him, much lesse to depose or lay him quite aside,
though I am clear of opinion, that Kings are accountable for their
Actions to their Parliaments and whole kingdoms, and in case of
absolute necessity, where Religion, Laws, Liberties, and their kingdoms
will else be inevitably destroyed by their Tyrannicall and flagitious
practises, be deposed by them, if there be no speciall oaths nor obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
upon their consciences to the contrary, (which is our present
case:) much less did I it out of any malice or revenge for the injustice
I received from him in the executions done upon my person and estate,
which I have long since cordially forgiven, and do now again forgive
him from my soul, beseeching God to forgive him likewise: but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to discover his former errours in this kinde unto himselfe, that he
might seriously repent of them for the present, and more carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,
and detest them for time to come: and that the Parliament and
whole kingdom might more clearly discern the great danger our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was in before we publikely discerned it, and the several wayes
and stratagems by which Popery got such head and growth among
us, that they might thereby the better prevent the like plots and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
for the future by wholesom Laws and edicts, as I have more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared in the books themselves.</p>
            <p>

This grand prejudice against me being thus removed,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</note> I proceed to the
the second, to wit, that I am an enemy to the Army; and therefore what I
shall speak, may be interpreted to proceed only from opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and their <hi>Remonstrance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to it.</note> concerning which I freely uttered
my suddain thoughts immediately after its reading in the House.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that I have alwaies been a real friend, and welwisher
to this Army from their first modelling til now, in what ever they have
acted in their sphear, as Souldiers for the publique safety. When they
were first formed into a body, the Committee of Accompts (whereof I
was a Member) &amp; those they engaged, advanced about thirty thousand
pounds of the fourscore thousand, to set them out. Since that, I have
freely contributed towards their pay, prayed constantly for their good
success, joined in all publike thanksgivings for the Victories obtained
by them; made honorable mention of them and their heroick actions in
some of my writings, and particularly dedicated one <hi>Book,</hi> I since com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled,
to the General himself, (as I had done former Books to others of
your Generals) for to do him all the honour that possibly I could, for
his renowned Actions. Besides I have lately signed Warrants to get in
their Arrears, and promoted an Ordinance for that purpose, all I could
since my entrance into this House. All which considered, with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that some of them have bin my ancient intimate friends, &amp; never
did me the least injury, I hope no Member can be so partial, as to report
me such a professed enemy to them, as in this grand debate to go against
my judgment or conscience in opposition only unto their desires. True
it is when the Army have forgot their duty, or offered violence to the
priviledges, Members, freedom or proceedings of Parl. or endeavoured
to engage them to break their publike faith to the King or kingdom, in
breaking off the <hi>Treaty,</hi> contrary to their votes and engagement, or to
infringe their solemn League and Covenant, or to enforce them to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the fundamental Government, Laws, &amp; Liberties of the kingdom,
or the very freedom and being of Parl. as they have done in their late
Remonstrance, and Declaration, and some other printed papers since, &amp;
heretofore, I have then (in discharge of my covenant, conscience, and
duty) opposed and spoken against these their exorbitances, as much as
any, not out of malice, but out of love, to reclaim them from their
evill destructive courses and counsels, according to Gods own precept
<hi>Lev. 19. 17. Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but shalt in any wise
rebuke thy Neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.</hi> And seeing I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
with like freedome opposed and written against the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
and errour of the King, Court, Prelates, Parliament, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106039:18"/>
Presbyterians, Independents, Lawyers, and all other sorts of
men in reference to the publick good, the Army and their friends have
no cause at all to censure me as their enemy, but rather to esteem me as
their friend, for using the like freedom towards them, and their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
especially in this House.</p>
            <p>Having removed these two prejudices, I shall now addresse my self to
the question in debate, which hath been thus propounded,</p>
            <p>Whether the Kings answers to the Propositions of both Houses taken altogether
upon the whole Treaty,<note place="margin">The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</note> be satisfactory or unsatisfactory?</p>
            <p>This being an equivocall question not hitherto clearly stated and
debated by those who have spoken to it, most of them being much
mistaken in it, I must crave leave to give you the true state of it,<note place="margin">The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion truly stated.</note> before
I shall debate it; for which purpose I must distinguish, in what sense it
is not satisfactory to any in this House, &amp; yet in what respect it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
satisfactory to all or most of us, who are not blinded with passion
or prejudice agaisnt the King, or misled by affection meerly to please
the Army, which many have made their principal argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not satisfactory.</p>
            <p>If the question be propounded and intended in this sense, Whether
the Kings answers to all the Propositions be satisfactory? that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King hath granted all the Propositions sent unto him in as
large and ample manner as both Houses did propound them? then it is
certain, his Answers are not satisfactory, in tha which concerns De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents,
Bishops and Bishops Lands, and the Covenant, though they
are voted satisfactory as to all the rest by both Houses. And in this
sense only, those who have concluded them not satisfactory, have stated
and disputed the Question.</p>
            <p>But this, under favour, neither is, nor can be the state or sense of the
question, for these reasons.</p>
            <p>First, because these Propositions were sent by the Houses to the King,
not as <hi>Bills</hi> of Parliament, to be granted <hi>in terminis</hi> without debate or
alteration, but only as <hi>Propositions</hi> to be debated &amp; treated upon perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
with the King, as the Votes of both Houses, and <hi>instructions to the
Commissioners</hi> sent to the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> resolve past all dispute: now it is
directly contrary to the nature of all treaties, especially such as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall,
to tie up the parties of either side so precisely, that they shall
have no liberty to vary from their first proposals in any particular, or if
they condescend not to what ever was at first demanded by the stronger
party, that the condescensions should not be satisfactory though they
yeeld to all just things, and fall short only in some few of least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106039:19"/>
This is evident by all Treaties heretofore between <hi>England, France,
Spain,</hi> and other <hi>forraign Nations,</hi> if you peruse their first demands,
which were never condescended to, but alwaies receded from, and
qualified in some particulars on either fide, <hi>Iniquum petas, ut justum fer as,</hi>
being a rule in Treaties amongst Statesmen. There have been many
Treaties during these Wars, between the Officers of the Parliament
and Kings party about surrenders of divers Cities and Garrisons,
wherein the first Propositions on either side have been moderated or
changed, and yet agreed and accepted at last as satisfactory to both
sides. In all ordinary Treaties concerning Marriages, purchases, and
ordinary bargains in Fairs, Markets or Shops, there are usually greater
sums of money demanded at first on the one, and lesse proferred on the
other side, then is accepted and given at last, and yet both parts close, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and are ful satisfied: so may we do now with the King upon the
whole Treaty, though the King grants not fully all that we at first
proposed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because the Houses have already voted, the Kings Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Great Offices of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to be at their disposal
for 20. years, to be satisfactory; though their demand was for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity:
which they would not have done, had the satisfactorinesse of the
Kings answers depended upon the full concession of that Proposition
as amply as it is penned.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because the Houses in their last propositions demand farre
more then ever they did in most former Treaties, and the King hath
granted them more now in this then they have demanded heretofore;
And therefore having granted more then what would have fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
them in former Treaties, his Concessions in this may be fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
to us, so far as to close with him, to settle a firm peace in the
Kingdome (now at the brink of ruine) though they fall short in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
which we now propounded.) which do not much concern our
security, as I shall prove anon. The true state then and sense of this
Question must be this, and no other.</p>
            <p>Whether the Kings finall Answers to the Propositions of both Houses in this
Treaty,<note place="margin">The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion truly stated.</note> considered and weighed all together, be not so full and satisfactory in
themselves, that this House may and ought to accept of and proceed upon them,
for the speedy settlement of a safe and wel-grounded Peace, both in Church and
Common-wealth, rather then reject them as unsatisfactorie, and so hazard the
life of all, and the perpetuating of our wars and miseries?</p>
            <p>In this sense, I humbly conceive and hope to evidence them so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; fully <hi>satisfactory,</hi> that we can neither in point of duty, prudence,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106039:19"/>
justice &amp; honor, or conscience reject them as unsatisfactory, but ought
to imbrace them, as the only safe &amp; ready way to our peace and settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though they come not up so fully to some of our Propositions,
as I could have heartily desired, for the avoiding of this hazardous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
<hi>For my clearer progresse in this grand debate I shall observe this method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, I shal clearly manifest, that the King in this Treaty hath granted
us whatsoever we can wel desire for the present settlement &amp; future se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Common-wealth or state, when ratified by Acts &amp; a regal
oath, as is intended; yea, far more then ever our Ancestors, or any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in the christian world enjoyed or desired of their Ks. for their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
&amp; preservation against their armed power, or legal prerogatives.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the King hath granted as much in this Treaty, as will
settle and secure the Peace and Government of our Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
against Popery and prelacy on the one hand, and prophanenesse
on the other hand; and more then we or any Protestant Churches ever
enjoyed, or demanded heretofore for their security and settlement.</p>
            <p>When I have made good these particulars and answered the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made against them; I hope every one of us, who have any ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
reason, or conscience in their brests, and are not transported with
passion, or private engagements to the contrary; will, and must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
vote these Answers <hi>satisfactory</hi> in the sense forestated.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with the first of these; namely, the Kings Answers to
all these Propositions which concern the present settlement, and future
security of the State and Republike against any armed force, or inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Regall Prerogative, to the enslaving or prejudicing of the
Subject; which in my poor judgement are so full and satisfactory, that
little or nothing can be added to them; and if we well consider them,
we have cause to say; <hi>O fortunati nimium bona si sua norin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>!</hi> I shall give
you a full view of them all, because many of them have not been so
much as once remembred in this debate, and apply them to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
settlement, and future safety, as I mention them.</p>
            <p>The first Proposition, <hi>for the settlement of a safe and wel-grounded Peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The first Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fully granted; and the benefits ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> by.</note>
is that which concerns the justification of the <hi>Parliaments War,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it by an Act of Parliament to be passed, <hi>to be in their just and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
defence:</hi> justifying the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant in prosecution
thereof:</hi> and repealing all Oaths, Declarations, and Proclamations
heretofore had, or hereafter to bee had against both or either Houses
of Parliament, their Ordinances or proceedings, or against any for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
unto, or executing any Office, Place, or Charge under them,
and all Judgements, Indictments, Outlawries, Attainders, &amp; Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106039:20"/>
in any of the said causes, and all Grants thereupon made, had, or to
be made or had, to be declared <hi>null,</hi> suppressed, forbidden, and never put
into execution. And this to be published within all Parish Churches,
and all other places needfull within his Majesties Dominions.</p>
            <p>To this proemiall and advantagious proposition, the King hath fully
and readily condescended at first, in every tittle, as was desired.</p>
            <p>By this concession, the Parliament hath gained sundry considerable
advantages, tending to their present honour and future security.</p>
            <p>First, a full publick acknowledgment of the justnesse of their Warre
and Cause, to be ratified and perpetuated to posterity by the highest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
that can be, an Act of Parliament, and that to be read in all Parish
Churches throughout <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and other the Kings Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and proclaimed in all Counties, Cities, Corporations, and at As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizes
and Sessions of the peace; that so all men may take publick
notice of it. Which is such an honour to, and justification of them and
their Cause, as was never condescended to by any King that took up
arms against his Subjects since the creation to this present: and so low
a humiliation and Legall disclaimer in the King of his Warre against
the Parliament, and disavowing of his Cause and Party, as could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be imagined or expected.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It secures the Lives, Liberties and Estates of all the Members
of both Houses engaged in these Wars, and of all persons whatsoever
that have adhered to, or acted for them, against all former, present, and
future Impeachments, Prosecutions and Judgments whatsoever; and
makes void and nul, what ever hath been, is, or may be objected against
them. Which coupled with the Act of Indempnity and Oblivion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by the King, and agreed to by the Houses, wil extraordinarily se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
pacifie, &amp; content all wel-affected Members, and persons who have
adhered to them in this Cause, and preserve them from the danger of
25 <hi>E. 3.</hi> and other Laws concerning Treasons, which otherwise upon
any revolution of times and affairs, might by corrupt Judges and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
be extended and rested to their prejudice aud undoing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it laies a foundation for the lawfulnesse of a defensive War
by Authority of both Houses, upon the like occasion, in all future ages,
without incurring the guilt of Treason or Rebellion; which will be a
great encouragement and security to the Subjects, and engagement to
them to adhere to the Parliament in after-times.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It wil very much discourage and deter all kind of men from
taking up Arms in the Kings, His Heirs and Successors behalfe, against
the Houses of Parliament, when they shal cast their eyes upon this Act
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106039:20"/>
and behold the King himselfe passing such a censure upon all his own
proceedings, and retracting his own Oaths, Proclamations, Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Inditements, Grants, against such Members &amp; all others who have
now taken up arms against him, for the Houses &amp; Kingdoms defence.</p>
            <p>So as this very first Proposition only, if well weighed, without any
others added thereunto, being so fully and freely consented unto by
the King, tends very far towards our present settlement and future
safety, being more then was ever thought of, or desired in the Treaty
of Peace, in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> 1642.</p>
            <p>The second Proposition fully granted by the King for the setling and
securing of the State and Religion too,<note place="margin">The Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia fully consented to, and the Kingdoms advantage and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereby.</note> against the Kings armed power,
is the setling of the whole Militia by Sea and Land, and Navy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Ireland,</hi> and the Isles and Dominions thereunto belonging, by Act
of Parliament, in the hands and disposall of both Houses, and such as
they shall appoint, for the space of twenty years: with power to raise
moneys for all forces raised by them for Land or Sea service, during
that space or time; which forces are authorised to suppresse all forces
raised or to be raised in, or any forraigne forces which shall invade the
Realms of <hi>Engl. Ireland,</hi> or the Dominions and Isles thereunto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
without Authority and consent of the Lords and Commons in
Parliament: And it further provides, that after the expiration of the
said 20. years, neither the King, his heirs and successors, nor any person
or persons, by colour or pretence of any Commission, power, Deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Authority to be derived from the King, his Heirs or Successors, or
any of them, shall raise, array, train, imploy or dispose of any of the
forces by Sea or Land of the Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the
Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> Isles of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ernsep</hi> and <hi>Iersey;</hi> or of <hi>Barwick</hi> upon
<hi>Tweed,</hi> nor execute any power or authority touching the same, invested
in the two Houses during the space of twenty years, nor do any thing
or Act concerning the execution thereof, without the consent of the
Lords and Commons first had and obtained. And that after the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the said twenty years, in all cases wherein the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
shall declare, the safety of the Kingdome to be concerned, and
shall thereupon paffe any Bill for the raising, arming, training and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of the forces by Sea and Land of the Kingdomes, Dominions,
Isles and places aforesaid, or concerning the leavying of moneys
for the same, if the King, his Heirs and successors shall not give the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
assent thereto, within such time as both Houses should think conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that then such Bil or Bills after Declaration made by the Lords &amp;
Commons in that behalf, shall have the force and strength of an Act
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106039:21"/>
or Acts of Parliament, and be as valid to all intents and purposes, as if
the Royal assent had been given thereunto.</p>
            <p>After which it disables any Sheriffe, Justice of the Peace, Majors or
other Officers of Justice, to leavy, conduct, and imploy any forces
whatsoever, by colour or pretence of any Commission of Array, or
extraordinary command from the King, His Heirs or Successors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
consent of both Houses. And concludes, That if any persons to the
number<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of 30 shall be gathered together in warlike manner, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and not forthwith disband themselves, being thereunto required
by the Lords and Commons, or command from them, or any other
specially authorized by them, that then such person or persons not so
disbanding, shall be guilty and incur the pains of High Treason: any
Commission under the great Seal, or other Warrant to the contrary
notwithstanding, and be uncapable of any pardon from His Majesty.
His Heirs and Successors, and their estates disposed of as the Lords and
Commons shall think fit.</p>
            <p>To all this new grand principle security of our present and future
peace and settlement, the King hath given his full and free consent in
<hi>terminis.</hi> And what greater security then this wee can imagine or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
against the Kings armed power and sword of War, transcends
my capacity to imagin. Therefore if we have not lost our brains and
consciences too, we cannot but vote and conclude it satisfactory, and
restabundantly contented with, yea exceeding thankful for it. And that
upon all these ensuing considerations.</p>
            <p>First, both Houses in their <hi>Treaty with the King in February,</hi> and
<hi>March,</hi> 1642.<note n="*" place="margin">An Exact Collection, p. 88, 89, 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 909. &amp;c.</note> demanded only the Militia of <hi>England</hi> not of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
yet so, as they did <hi>leave the Nomination and disposing of the chiefe
Commanders, Officers, and Governors of the Militia, Forts and Navy
of the Kingdome, to the King: provided only they might be such persons
of honor and trust as both Houses might confide in:<note place="margin">A Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the publik Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c pa. 49, 50, 51, 57, 58, 77, 84.</note> and likewise promise
restitution of all Moneys, Forts, Garrisons, Arms and Ammunition of the
Kings which they had seized upon, or to give him present satisfaction for the
same; which being granted and performed, they professed, it should bee their
hopefull endeavour, that His Majesty and His people might enjoy the blessing
of Peace, &amp;c. and be derived to Him, and to His Royall Posterity, and the
future Generations in this Kingdome for ever.</hi> Whereas in this Treaty
the King denudeth himselfe of the Militia of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> too,
and of the Nomination and approbation of all Officers, Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Governors of the <hi>Militia,</hi> or forces by Sea or Land; and leaves
all the Forts, Navy and Magazines only to the Houses disposall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106039:21"/>
any compensation for his Magazines or Armes formerly seized by
them. And if far lesse was deemed sufficient for our settlement and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
then, much more will all this be thought so now.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because the King hath wholly stript Himself, His Heirs
and Successors for ever, of all that power and interest which His Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
alwaies enjoyned in the Militia forces, forts, Navy, not only of
<hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Ireland, Wales Iersey, Garnsey,</hi> and <hi>Berwick</hi> too, so as He and
they can neither<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> raise nor arm one man, nor introduce any forraign
forces into any of them, by vertue of any Commission, Deputation, or
authority, without consent of both Houses of Parliament, and hath
vested the sole power and disposition of the Militia, Forts and Navy
of all these, in both Houses in such ample manner, that they shall never
part with it to any King of <hi>England,</hi> unlesse they please themselves. So
as the King and His Heirs, have no military power or authority at all
left, to injure or oppresse the meanest Subject, much lesse the whole
Kingdome, or Houses of Parliament, had they wills to doe it; and the
Houses having all the Militia by Land and Sea, not only of <hi>England,</hi>
but even of <hi>Ireland, Wales, Garnsey, Iersey</hi> and <hi>Berwick,</hi> to assist and secure
them in case He or His Heirs should attempt to raise any domestick, or
introduce any forraign force against them, is so grand, so firm a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in all probability, for insuring and preserving of our Peace, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Lawes, Liberties, Lives, and Estates, against regall force and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
that none of our Ancestors ever demanded or enjoyed the like,
nor no other Kingdome whatsoever since the Creation, for ought that
I can find in Histories or Republicks (who have perused most now
extant to do you service) and such a selfe-denying cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sconsion in the
King to His People, in this particular, as no age can president.</p>
            <p>In the 17 year of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> the <hi>Barons</hi> having by force of Armes,<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Paris, Matthew Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshead, Speed, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in his life.</note>
compelled him to confirm the great Charter at <hi>Runningmead,</hi> near
<hi>Windsor,</hi> thought this their greatest security, that 25 of the eminentest
<hi>Barons</hi> should be made Conservators of the <hi>Magna Char.</hi> and that all
the rest of the <hi>Barons</hi> and people should take an Oath to be aiding and
assisting to them in their preservation thereof; and that the King
should surrender into their hands his four principall Castles, that so it
he infringed his Charter, they might compell him to observe it. This
was the highest Militia, and security of that kind our Ancestors ever
demanded or enjoyed; (which is nothing comparable unto that now
granted us by the King,) who rested <hi>satisfied</hi> therewith.</p>
            <p>3. Because the King and his successors are hereby not only totally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to
raise any forces to oppresse the people, or disturb their peace,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106039:22"/>
and settlement, but all persons discouraged from aiding or assisting
them by any Commission or authority whatsoever, under pain of
high Treason, and losse both of life and estate, at the pleasure of both
Houses, without any benefit of pardon from the KING, disabled for to
grant it. So great a discouragement for any persons of fortune or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to appear for the King or his party in the Field for time to come,
that in all humane probability, none ever will or dare to appear in
arms hereafter for the King, against the Parliament, being sure to forfeit
all without any hopes of pardon. And if this Act had been passed as
a Law before our Wars, I dare presume not any one English Lord, or
Gentleman durst once to have appeared in the Field for the King, and
wee had never felt the miseries of a civill War.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Because the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Ireland, Ier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, Guernsey,</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> as
well as <hi>England,</hi> is wholly transferred from the King, to the Houses, so
as we need fear no danger thence; and the Militia of <hi>Scotland</hi> being in
their Parliaments disposall, if wee hold a Brotherly correspondency
with them, I know no other enemies we need to fear; for the Navy
being in the Houses power, wee need not fear any forraigne invasion
that can hurt us, if we can agree at home.</p>
            <p>All which considered, I dare assert, we have now the greatest security
of any people under Heaven against all armed regall force and power,
the King having given up all his Military power into the Houses
actuall possission,<note place="margin">The King hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Houses for 20 years the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of all great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Civill, Judiciall, and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary for twenty years both in England and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The security and consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> and resigned his Sword and Armes into their hands.
And if we refuse to accept it now he so freely resignes it, we may fight
till doomesday, but never win nor hope for the like security or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
yea the present age and all posterity will curse and abhor us, for
not embracing, and resting satisfied with such unparalleld security.</p>
            <p>But is this all the security the King hath granted us in this Treaty?
No verily: there is yet much more behind, which hath not yet been
opened. The Kings of <hi>England,</hi> have alwaies held two swords in their
hands, which when ill managed, have hurt &amp; destroyed their Subjects.
The first is the sword of <hi>Mars,</hi> in times of War, which is already shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,
and resigned into the Houses hands by the precedent concessions,
so as it can never wound them more. The other is the sword of <hi>Iustice</hi>
in times of Peace; and this likewise the King hath wholly given up
into the Houses power, for twenty years, as he hath the Militia; so, that
it can never hurt them nor any English man or other Subject hereafter,
at least for twenty years.</p>
            <p>This sword was formerly intrusted by the King in the Judges and
great Officers hands<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had they been so couragious, so upright as they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106039:22"/>
should, the King could never have wounded or ruined the meanest of
his Subjects with this Sword. <hi>Shipmoney, Kingh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hood,</hi> with other <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
&amp; Monoplies,</hi> neither would nor could have been imposed on the
people by the Kings Prerogative or power, had the Judges, according
to Law and duty, declared them illegall. The Kingdome can do no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
to any, it his Judges be so just and stout as to do justice. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this House impeached only the Judges, not blamed the King, for the
project of <hi>Shipmony,</hi> to which their opinions in Mr. <hi>Hampdens</hi> Case, gave
life &amp; vigor. Now the King in this Treaty, hath for twenty yeeres at
least, granted to both Houses the nomination and appointment of all
the Great Officers, Civill or Military, and of all the Judges and Barons
of his Courts and Exchequers within <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to continue
in their places only, <hi>quom diu bene se gesserint.</hi> So as these great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
&amp; Judges having now no dependence at all upon the King, who can
neither place nor displace any of them, but wholly upon the Houses of
Parliament, and such as they shall appoint to nominate them in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
of Parliament; if the Houses have a care to make good Officers
and Judges in all Courts at first; and to displease and punish them (as
they may and ought to do) when they degenerate, or misdemean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the King with all his legall power now left him, can neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
nor oppresse the poorest Subject in body, goods or, Estate; nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the greatest malefactor from justice. And what more can we desire
to expect for the security of our lives, liberties, or estates than this?</p>
            <p>Besides, as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> King hath intrusted you with the Sword and Courts of
Justice and Revenue, so hath he with his Conscience and Courts of
Equity too: You have the nomination of the Lord Chancellours, Lord
Keepers, and Commissioners of his great Seals of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
of the Chancellours of the Exchequer and Dutchy, and Masters of
the Rolls, as well in <hi>Ireland</hi> as <hi>England,</hi> who are the Dispensers of
his Equity &amp; Conscience to his Subjects, the Issuers of al his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Writs, Patents, and keepers of all his publique Records. If this be
not enough, you have the disposall of his purse, and Treasure too: The
nomination of the Lord Treasurers both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the
Chancellours and Barons of the Exchequers in both, and of the Vice-Treasurer
and Treasurer of Wars in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Would you have yet more?
You have the nomination of the Lord Deputy, and chief Governour of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and of all the Presidents of the severall Provinces of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for twenty years, and of all other forenamed great Officers,
Judges and Treasurers there; a great strength and reall addition to the
<hi>Militia</hi> of that Kingdome, which can never doe us harm, if we accept
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106039:23"/>
of these concessions, which invest us in such power there, as no Parl.
of <hi>England</hi> ever yet expected nor laid claim to. What is there yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
for your safety? Perchance you will suspect, the King may have
many secret designs and intercourses with forraign enemies and States,
and grand Malignants at home, to undo all, which we shall never disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
without some further provisions then yet we have made. Truly no:
you have a remedy already provided and granted for this; The nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and appointing of the Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, the
principall gates to let in, or keep out Forraign Enemies or Spies; and
of the Secretaries of State, who will be privie to all his Maj. secrets and
transactions of publick concernment, receive all letters of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
directed to him, and most commonly return all Answers to them.
There is now but one thing more wanting to make this security com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and firm, the Kings <hi>Great Seals of England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Regall Assurance &amp; confirmation he can give you; and of these you

both of the L. Chancellors, L. Keepers, and Commissioners of the
<hi>Great Seal</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> To summe up all these Grants to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
Some Parliaments in former times have had the nomination
of the Lord Chancellor, some of the Lord Treasurer, some of the great
Iusticiar or some few Judges of <hi>England</hi> only: But never any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> claimed or enjoyed, the nomination and appointment
of any the <hi>Great Officers, Barons, Iudges, or Treasurers</hi> places in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns of the Exchequer of England;</hi> yet all these the King for peace
sake hath parted with to us; and shall we be yet so froward and peevish,
as not to be satisfied with all those Offices? We have a long time mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and abused the world, with a <hi>self-denying Ordinance,</hi> disabling any
Member to retain or receive any Civill or Military Office, by grant
from the Houses, whiles he continces a Member; though there is scarce
one day, or week at least doth passe, but we are still bestowing some
place or Office upon Members, for which we are weekly censured and
reviled in printed Pamphlets, and become odious to the Kingdome. But
here is a self-denying Act and Ordinance in good earnest, in the King,
in parting with so many Offices, (of which He and his Predecessors have
had the sole disposall for some Ages without interruption,) to the
Houses; &amp; shal we not yet rest satisfied? If not, what will the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
what will all forraign Kingdoms and Nations report of us? but
that we are so foolish, so unreasonable, that nothing can or will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106039:23"/>
us, because we are resolved not to be content with any thing that
the King shall grant us, be it never so advantagious for our present or
future safety, and settlement.</p>
            <p>But seeing we have the disposall of all these Officers in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> both <hi>Military</hi> and <hi>Civill,</hi> of his Sword of War and Peace, his
Justice, his Conscience, his Purse, his Treasury, his Papers, his publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
his Cabinet, his Great Seal, more then ever we at first expected or
desired: I must really for my owne part, professe my selfe abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfied with these Concessions, and so must every one who hath so
much judgement, as to understand the latitude &amp; consequences of them
for the whole Kingdomes, and dying <hi>Irelands</hi> safety, settlement, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at this season, when they are so neer their ruin.</p>
            <p>To this I shall adde another grant of great concernment for the
Peace and safety of this Nation, which the King hath fully consented to
in this Treaty, and I presume no Member of this House will rest unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
therewith, when he fully understands it.</p>
            <p>Both Houses of Parliament upon the Lord Keeper <hi>Littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the House, and conveying away the Great Seal;<note place="margin">The King hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the new Oreat Seal, &amp; all that hath passed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, nulled the old, aud what ever passed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority since its carrying from the Houses.</note> were pleased for the
better distribution of Justice, and transaction of the great Affairs of the
Realm, to appoint a new Great Seal to be made. The Ordinance for its
approbation and use sticking long in the Lords House, who were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
doubtfull in point of Law, I thereupon compiled and published a
Treatise, intituled <hi>The opening of the Great Seal of England,</hi> which
fully satisfied them, and opened the doors to let it out, for publick use,
though some who have had the custody of it (as Mr. Speaker knowes)
have but ill requited Me for this my pains &amp; good service. Many Grants,
Commissions, Presentations, Writs, Processe, Proceedings, and other
things have passed under this Great Seal, (and some Patens for <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>
and <hi>Bishops Lands,</hi> to Members of this House, who differ in opinion
from me, and yet would be glad to have their Patents confirmed by an
Act of Parliament.) The King in this Treaty, hath not only consented
to ratifie all the Grants &amp;c. that have passed under this new Seal, by
Act of Parliament; and to enact them, to be as effectuall to all intents &amp;
purposes as if they had passed under any other Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>
heretofore used, but to continue it to be used hereafter for the Great Seal
of <hi>England,</hi> and hath likewise so farre disclaimed his old Great Seal
from the day it was carried from the Parliament, that he is content, to
make and declare all Grants, Commissions, Presentations, Writs,
Processe, Proceedings and other things whatsoever passed under, or by
any Authority of any other Great Seal, since the 22 of <hi>May</hi> 1642. To be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106039:24"/>
invalid and of no effect, to all intents and purposes; except one grant to
Mr. Justice <hi>Racon,</hi> to bee Judge of the Kings Bench, and some other
Writs, Processe and Commissions mentioned in that proposition: And
he hath further yeelded, That all Grants of Offices, Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or hereditaments, made or passed under the great Seale of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
unto any person, persons, or body politick, since the Cessation in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> the 15 <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1642. shall be null and void, with all Honours
and Titles conferred on any person or persons in that Realme since that
Cessation.</p>
            <p>By this Concession the Houses of Parliament and their adherents, have
gained these extra ordinary advantages, most of them not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld
in any Age of King, from <hi>Adom</hi> till this present.</p>
            <p>First, an acknowledgement of both Houses Authority to make and
use a new great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> without the King, in cases of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
necessity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a power in the Houses to null and voide the Kings usuall
Great Seal upon the making of their New, and conveying the old Seal
from the Houses without their consent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a ratification of all Judiciall and Ministeriall Acts, Writs,
Processe, presentations, Grants, Decrees, Commissions and other things
which have passed under the New Seal since its making till this present;
which tends much to the qulet and settlement of many mens Estates; to
the confirmation and justification of all legall proceedings in all Courts
of Justice, and at all Assises and Sesstons of Peace, held by vertue of
Commissions under this Seal, and of Justices appointed by it (whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and proceedings might else hereafter prove disputable, and bee
drawn into Question:) and to the fight constitution of the Parliament
it selfe, many Members of this House being elected, and some Members
and Assistants of the Lords House being called thither, by VVrits under
this New Seal.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, an absolute disavowing and repeall of all Commissions
whatsoever, or other things passed under the old Great Seal, against the
Parliament or its proceedings, and an exposing of all those of the Kings
Party, who have acted any thing by any Commission or Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Seal against the Parliament, to publick Justice, who cannot plead
it in Barre or excuse in any Court, after it shall be nulled and repealed
by an Act.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, a great disparagement, dishonour, and disadvantage to the
<hi>English</hi> Cavaliers, <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, and their cause and proceedings, with a
future disingaging of them and al their Party from the King and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106039:24"/>
who hath so far dishonoured, deserted, and disclaimed them,
as thus to null and repeal all Honours, Titles, Grants of Offices, Lands,
or Tenements bestowed on any of them, for any services done, or Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
given by them to the King in his Warres against the Parliament:
A very high point of humiliation and self-deniall in the King, and such
a blow to his Popish and Malignant party, that I dare presume they will
never engage in his behalfe, nor trust him for the future: which will
much conduce to the settlement of a firm and lasting peace, and prevent
new VVars, if accepted of.</p>
            <p>6ly. Indempnity and security for all the Commissioners of the new
Great Seale, against all scruples which may arise upon the Statute of 25.
E. 3. for using and sealing with it, if ever the times alter: which every
prudent man will readily embrace, where it is freely offered, and not
peevishly reject, in such an age of danger and incertainty as this, in
which no man is secure of his life, liberty, or estate on either side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next Concession of the King in this Treaty is this:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale of new Peers and other Honours granted by the King, with the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof.</note> That by Act
of Parliament, all Peeres made since <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Littleton</hi> deserted
the Parliament, and convey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d away the Great Seale on the one and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
day of May 1642. shall be Vn-Peer'd and set by. And all other titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and precedency (<hi>as Lordship, Knighthood, and the like</hi>) confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on any without consent of both Houses of Parliament since the twentieth
of <hi>May,</hi> 1642. shall be revoked and declared null and void to all intents,
and never hereafter put in use. And that no Peere who shall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
made by the King, his heirs or successors, shall sit or vote in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England</hi> without consent of both Houses of Parliament; <hi>This
Concession of the Kings is of great concernment to the Kingdome, and
I conceive, without president, or example in any age or King in the
Christian world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, it secures us from our formerly feared danger of a designe in the
King, by new created Peers, to make an over-ruling party at any time,
in the Lords House, wherein the Iudicatory of the Parliament princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
consists: which danger and inconvenience, by secluding the Bishops
out of that House by an Act already passed, and by this disabling all new
Peers hereafter to be made, to sit in that House without consent of both
Houses, is for ever totally prevented.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It gives such an extraordinary new power to the House of
Commons, as they never formerly enjoyed or pretended to; to wit,
that no Peer created by the King himselfe, or by the King or Lords in
Parliament, (who usually created Peers in Parliament without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
privity or consent in former times) shall be henceforth ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106039:25"/>
to sit or vote as Peers of Parliament, but by consent of the House
of Commons as well as of the King and Lords. By which provision, the
Commons are made not only, in some sense, the Judges of Peers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(which they could not try or judge beforeby the expresse letter of
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> chap. 29. and the<note n="*" place="margin">Sec Cook! n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stitures on Mag. Cha. cap. 29.</note> Common Law) but seven their very
Creators too.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is an extraordinary prejudice and blemish on the Kings
cause, and an extream dishonour, dissatisfaction &amp; disengagement upon
his own party, then which a greater cannot be imagined. For what
higher affront or disgrace could the King put upon those Nobles, Gent.
&amp; others who have spent their estates, lost their blood, limbs and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
their very lives in this cause against the Parliament, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
no other reward for it but an empty title of honour [perchance a
Kightship, Lordship, or the bare title of a Marquesse, Earl, or Viscount,
which they have enjoyed but a year or two, with little benefit and lesse
content,] to be thus by Act of Parliament with the Kings owne Royall
assent, (who conferred those titles on them for their gallant services in
his behalfe) thus suddenly degraded and divested of them all, as if they
had never been? A perpetuall brand to them &amp; their posterity, who must
be inforced to give place to such of whom they have had precedency &amp;
place by vertue of these dignities. Which high affront and scorne, I am
verely perswaded, will pierce and break many of their own, at least their
<hi>Ladies</hi> hearts, and for ever disoblige them in the highest degree.</p>
            <p>4thly, It will make all the ancient and new Nobility and Peers of
<hi>England</hi> lesse dependent on the King, &amp; lesse complying to serve his ends
upon all occasions, being never able to gratisie or reward them (though
never so ambitious) with any new Honours or Peerships, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of both Houses of Parliament, whom they dare not displease, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige,
for fear of crossing them in their desired dignities and titles,
as well as in their great Offices, which are both now in their disposall
not in the Kings alone.</p>
            <p>In brief, the King in his Concession, hath manifested the greatest hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
and self-deniall, that any King since there was a Kingdome
in the world hath done. It is, and hath been the ancient and undoubted
prerogative of all Kings in the world, but especially of the Kings of
<hi>England,</hi> to conferre honours &amp; dignities of all sorts (especially Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood)
on whom they shall think meet, and more principally on those
who have merited it by their gallantry in the field; as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
proves at large in his <hi>Titles of honour,</hi> and others who have written of
that Subject. Now for the King out of a desire only of a happy peace
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106039:25"/>
and settlement, not onely to part with much of the Royall Prerogative
which all other Kings in the world enjoy for the future, but to repeal the
Honours and Titles conferred by him on his adherents, for reward of
their services in times past, during all these wars, is such a miracle and
high degree of selfe-deniall, as no age hath produced the like, and that
which most of this house, had the King prevailed, would have rather lost
their lives (had they conferred any such Titles on their Generalls and
Commanders) then have condescended to, should the King require it:
And therefore I cannot agree with those over-censorious Gentlemen,
who so oft inculcate this, that they can see no humiliation at al or change
of heart in the King, when I find so great a change, and deep a humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
in Him in this, and all other forementioned free Concessions,
without any or little hesitation; and I heartily wish their owne hearts
were as much humbled as his, and then I doubt on: but they would
thankfully embrace, &amp; rest fully satisfied with his concessions for their
owne and the Kingdomes benefit. The next proposition tending to the
peace and settlement of the Kingdome is this.</p>
            <p>That the King do give his Royall assent to such Act or Acts for
the raising of moneys for the Parliament,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position for raising moneys for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of publike debts, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tears, &amp;c. granted; with its benefits</note> &amp; satisfying of the publique
Debts and Damages of the Kingdome, and other publique uses as shal
hereafter be agreed on by both Houses of Parliament. And if the King
do not give his assent thereto, then it being done by both Houses, the
same shall be as valid to all intents and purposes, as if the Royall assent
had been given thereunto. To this Proposition the King hath conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended,
so as those Acts be passed within two years after the Treaty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
which the Houses have now voted to be satisfactory.</p>
            <p>This Proposition secures all moneys lent upon the publike faith: all
arrears due to Officers &amp; souldiers, yea all moneys advanced by any who
have purchas'd Bishops lands, for their losses by reversions after 99 years
or any present rents, to be reserved to the Crowne for the use of the
Church, (with which those Members who have purchased such lands or
advanced moneys upon them, declare themselves most unsatisfied) &amp; all
those who have sustained publique losses. Yea, if the King denies his
royall assent thereto, it enables both Houses, to make a valid Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
without the King in this case, and in case of the Militia likewise,
which was never challenged by, nor granted to both Houses in any
Kings Reign before; &amp; takes away the Kings Negative voice as to these
particulars: which those who conclude the Kings answers unsatisfatory,
have so much contended for, yet now stand in their own light, in not
accepting of these Concessions as satisfactory, and striking at the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:106039:26"/>
The next Concession of the Kings for the settlement of the State,<note place="margin">The court of Wards aud Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures in Capite &amp;c. abolished: with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</note>
is the taking away of the Court of Words, and of all Wardships and
Tenures in Capite, or by Knights service, which draw on Wardships,
Primer seisures, liveries, and such like incombrances, to the intolerable
vassalage and prejudice of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> and
great landed persons, and that only upon giving the King and his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
one hundred thousand pounds yearly for compensations, being
one principall part of his Royall Revenue.</p>
            <p>This Concession is of so vast consequence to the Kingdome, to enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise
the Subjects from the Norman yoak of bondage (as some stile
VVardships and Tenures in Capite, though others deem them more
ancient then <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror) that our Ancestors never enjoyed
the like: It exempts mens heits under age, and their estates from being
made a prey for hungry Courtiers, or over-reaching Committees of them
&amp; their estates: It exempts them from being married to any against their
free consents, without any single or double forfeiture of the values of
their marriages, to which they were formerly liable; from marriages to
persons of small, or no, or broken fortunes, and different dispositions,
which have ruined many families, from many chargeable suits, expences,
&amp; excessive fees &amp; gratuities to Escheators, Feodaries &amp; all sorts of gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Officers in the Court of Wards, and from vast expences and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
vexation in finding, and traversing Offices, suing out Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
&amp;c. and many suits and questions arising thereupon, which have
undone too many: And it deprives the King of such an over-awing
Prerogative over the persons and E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tates of the Nobility and Gentry,
which usually fell into his custody after every Tenants decease, as will
very much weaken his interest in, and their over much dependence on
him, and make them lesse subject to engage for, or with him against the
Parliaments or Kingdomes common interest.</p>
            <p>The next Proposition relating to the Kingdomes safety and settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents how sarre granted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</note> not so immediately and directly as any of the former, is that which
concernes Delinquents: in which alone (as to the State) the Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
are pretended unsatisfactory, not in all, but only in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
of no extraordinary concernment in my apprehension, though so
much insisted on by many, as to vote all the Treaty unsatisfactory. In
opening the state of the Kings Answers to this proposition, I shall doe
these 3. things: First I shall shew how far the King and you are both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.
2dly, In what particulars you really or seemingly differ. 3dly, I
shall examine, whether these differences herein be of any such moment,
as to induce the House to vote, the answers to this and the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106039:26"/>
upon the whole Treaty unsatisfactory, and so reject and lose
whatever the King hath granted in the rest, because he hath not satisfied
our demands in this one, and two others concerning the Church.</p>
            <p>For the first, both Houses by their Votes, have thought this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
touching Delinquents, so needless to beinfisted on in every puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,
for the publick settlement [which will certainly more obstruct then
promote it, merey &amp; moderation being the nearest way to peace, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion]
that you have reduced, since the Treaty, the persons excepted in the
first qualification both from life &amp; composition, from 37 to 7 only: six
of those are beyond the Seas, quite out of your power, the 7th, aged,
scarce worth your Execution. The King consents that they should be
banished during the pleasure of both Houses, which is a civill death, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
being next to death, the severest punishment, and to some men,
more grievous then present Execution. But if that will not satisfie, then
he leaves them wholly to your justice, to proceed against them, if you
please, according to Law, and promiseth not to interpose, nor pardon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them if legally condemned; only he adds <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in <hi>justice or honor, assent to any Act, to take away their lives by a meer Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slative
Power, ex post facto,</hi> if they have done nothing that was formerly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
by the known Laws of the Land, by which Hee leaves them to be
tryed. This Answer many <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who have spoken, have coucluded
very unsatisfactory, and made many large descants on it, because they
did not rightly weigh nor understand it; when as in truth, it Answers
the very Proposition in <hi>terminis:</hi> as I shall clearly manifest to all who
understand what Law is.</p>
            <p>First, it is apparent that one of the first quarrels and cause of taking
up Arms on our parts, was to bring <hi>Delinquents to condign punishent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm,</hi> as you have declared to the
Kingdom in many printed <hi>Declarations,</hi> and in your Petitions to the
King, you alwayes desired <hi>him,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Exact collection <hi>p.</hi> 464. 585 619. 631. 633. 908.</note> 
               <hi>to leave Delinquents to the course of Iustice;</hi>
not to cut them off by a meer Legislative Power, when as you could
not doe it by any known Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you have professed to all the World, and to the King and
Delinquents themselves, that you have taken up Armes to defend and
preserve the Ancient fundamentall Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom,
and to oppose the introduction of any Arbitrary and Tyrannicall
Power; Yea, your selves and the Army likewise, have declared against
all extraordinary proceedings and tryals in the Lords House to fine or
imprison without any indictment, or legall tryall by Jury or Verdict
according to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Common-Law. Therefore your
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106039:27"/>
bringing Delinquents to punishment for Life and Estates, which in the
first branch of this Proposition must be intended only of a just and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
TRYALL (as your selves have alwayes professed) not by a new
Law in the post: And if so, then the King, in case you will not rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the seven excepted persons banishment, is content to leave
them to your Justice, even for Life and Estate, according to the known
Laws of the Realm, and will no wayes interrupt your proceedings
therein, nor pardon them. Therefore in this he fully consents to the
Proposition.</p>
            <p>But it hath been objected,<note place="margin">Object.</note> First, that the King denyes to yeeld them
up to Justice, or to have any hand in their prosecution; and therefore
his Answer is unsatisfactory. Secondly. That this expression, <hi>That he ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
neither in Iustice nor honour consent to any Act for to take away their Lives or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,</hi>
is as high a justification of them and his own cause, as possible, and
contradictory to the first Proposition, and declares the Kings heart to be
still in the same and unchanged.</p>
            <p>To which I Answer:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> First, both these are so grosse mistakes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequences,
that I wonder how any intelligent man can insist upon
them: For first, the King in positives terms, if you will not accept of their
banishment, yeelds them up to a Legall tryall, in which himself must be
the Prosecutor, the Indictment being in his name, the prosecution at his
suit by his Counsell at Law, and the Witnesses produced on his behalf,
as all men know, who understands what belongs to a Legall tryall.
Therefore to infer from the Kings Answer, that he disclaims all prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, is direct contradiction and falsehood.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Kings very condesconsion to their banishment and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of their Estates for adhering to his Cause and putting them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their legall tryall, is an express disavowing of his own cause as just,
and an acknowledgment of its badnesse and illegality; and if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
should yeeld up those who have acted for and adhered to them
to banishment, confiscation of Estate, and legall tryall for their lives,
I am certain the Objectors themselves would protest, that therein they
had betrayed their righteous Cause, and deserted their best affected
friends. Thirdly, <hi>Expressum facit cessare tacitum:</hi> the King having in
direct terms, justified your <hi>Cause and War as just,</hi> in the first Proposition,
acknowledged those persons exempted in this, and treated for under the
very name &amp; notion of Delinquents, to be such, in this very Proposition,
and consented to their banishment and losse of Estate, cannot without
apparcht absundity be averred to justifie them and their Cause in this his
Answer, which yeelds them up to the strictest legall Justice, as <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:106039:27"/>
5ly, Those words of the King [so much excepted against]
<hi>that he can neither in honour nor justice, consent to any act to take away
their lives, who have acted any thing by his command,</hi> used and intended
by him only in relation to his regall consent to a new Law to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
them, <hi>ex post facto,</hi> where there was no Law before, are so farre
from any exception, that for my part I should have held him neither
<hi>just</hi> nor honourable had he omitted this expression. For can it be <hi>just</hi>
or honourable for a King, to engage men in his service by special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
or Command, when there is no known Law to make their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
criminall, and yet afterwards to give his Royal consent to a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
Law to take away their lives, &amp; forfeit their estates for obeying
his own Royall commands? Suppose we were now in the Kings condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and he in ours, and he should press you to consent to a new Law, to
make all those who have acted for you and by your Commission in this
war, Traytors, and to lose their lives and estates for it, when there
was no former Law to punish them, would you not all give the self same
answer as he doth, that you could neither in honor, nor justice (nor yet
in point of conscience) consent to such a Law? and would not your selves
and all other protest, you had neither justice nor honesty in you, should
you be so base and persidious as to condescend unto it to betray all
those you had engaged, and to give them such a requitall for their servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
Would any person ever after honor, serve or trust you, should you
do it? or could you or any other honor, trust or serve the K. in any dubious
imployment after this, if he should thus unworthily <hi>ex post facto</hi> betray
his own party now? This answer therefore of his clearly discovers to us,
that there is yet so much justice and honor in him, as by no fear or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to consent to such an unjust and unworthy Act, as by a new Law to
cut off the heads of those himself engaged in his service, when there was
no Law extant then to do it, makes it more satisfactory unto me, then
otherwise, and shews he doth not dissemble but is reall in his answers;
and I shall sooner trust and beleeve him now, then if he had consented to
such an unworthy act. 6ly, This answer is both just and honorable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if the King should assent to a new Act to forfeit their lives and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
he should condemne them rashly and unjustly without hearing
their defence or evidence.</p>
            <p>And for the King to condemn any for Traytors by a Bil without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cause or evidence against them, or to make men Traytors by a
law subsequent to their offences, is neither just nor honorable in every

informs us, the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the inventer of such Acts of Attainder,
being the first that lost his head by this new invention. All which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
there is no rationall man but must conclude, the Kings Answer
unto this branch touching Delinquents, to be fully satisfactory even to
your own demands, as well in words as substance, notwithstanding the
Objections against it.</p>
            <p>But admit the answer as bad as any have made it, shall we therefore
conclude it so unsatisfactory as to break off the Treaty upon it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
the Kingdom in another War of which no man can know the end
or issue? God forbid we should ever be so unadvised. The persons
whose lives you desire for a Sacrifice to publick Justice, are but seven in
number, fix of them out of your power in forraign parts, where a new
war will not reach them: the 7th an aged man, who may chance to
dye before judgment or execution pass against him: you have all their
whole estates at your disposal already, and their persons too by way of
banishment, during both Houses pleasure: And will you adventure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seven years war, and the losse perchance of seventy thousand mens
lives, and as many millions of Treasure to the ruine of the Kingdome,
for the bare lives of seven Delinquents only, or in truth of one alone,
who is fully in your power, which you may take away by a legall try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
without a war? will not all the Kingdome, nay all the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and whole world cry out upon you for such a frantick unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
act as this? yea and for such an unjust and wicked resolution, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the lives and shed the bloud of many thousand Innocents, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
men to take away the head of one or only of 7. vile Delinquents?
the sparing of whose lives will<note n="*" place="margin">Sec 2 Chron. 28. 2. 10. 16.</note> more conduce to settlement, and reall
unity, then their deaths by the axe of Justice. For shame then let us not
vote the Kings answer to this branch of Delinquents so unsatisfactory,
as to break off and lose all upon it, since I have proved it fully satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
in all things to your own last demands.</p>
            <p>As to the Delinquents specified in the 2d. and 3d. Qualification, the
King and you are fully agreed. Besides, the King consents to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Delinquents specified in the first qualification from sitting
in Parliament, being of his Councells, coming within the verge of his
court, bearing any office, or having any imployment in the State, during
the pleasure of both Houses. Thus far you are both agreed: only
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106039:28"/>
he desires this mitigation of their penalty in case they shall offend here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that they may not be guilty of high Treason and uncapable of any
pardon, and forfeit all their estates, nor that those who shall return
from banishment without leave may incur so high a penalty, but a more
moderate, sutable to the Law they shall offend. And to break only upon
this excesse and extremity of punishment (too high even in many wise
mens opinions for such offences, and of dangerous president to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it being the wisdome of our Ancestors, to make as few<note n="*" place="margin">See Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalls A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment, Tit. <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
               </note> new trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as possible, being only for the Kings advantage and peoples preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice)
when as a lesser penalty may as well, and sooner too, prevent the
mischief, is neither safe nor prudent.</p>
            <p>As for the compositions of such persons, the King only desires their
moderation, if you think fit, even to such proportions as the Army it self
in their proposals to him in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1647. thought reasonable; and if you
please not to grant it, then he leaves them to compound at such rates as
you and they shall agree: and those are only such as you have already
fixed on in former compositions, from which you will not vary; and in
case they will not compound at your rates, you have then the benefit
of all their sequestred estates till their composition be made, which is
your benefit and their losse. Therefore in this [though some have pleased
without any colour of reason to assert the contrary] you are both fully
accorded.</p>
            <p>To the Delinquents in the fifth Qualification, the King consents to all
your desires, with this exception only: That such Delinquent Ministers
who are not scandalous in their lives or Doctrine, &amp; are already seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
may injoy the third part of the profits of their Livings, for the
support of them and their families, and be capable of future prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
if they be thought fit to enjoy them. This some have concluded
very unsatisfactory, because it craves some little favour for Malignant
Ministers: But I beseech you consider, how inconsiderable the difference
is, and how just and charitable the Kings request is in their behalf.
Your selves, both by Ordinance and common practise, grant the ful fifth
of the profits of sequestred Livings to the Wives and Children of
sequestred Ministers, as well in case of scandall and insufficiency, as Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity:
the King desires only, that such who have bin sequestred meerly
for Malignancy, and are not scandalous, may receive a third part in stead
of a fifth, and for their future encouragement, having spent their time in
fitting themselves for a Ministry, and being fit for no other calling,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106039:29"/>
and having lost their former livings, he requests only, that in this scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of able Ministers, they may be capable meerly of future preferments,
for which they shall be adjudged meet in such way as you shall appoint,
not he or they. A just, a charitable request, and that which your selves
have done, there being many able godly Ministers of eminent parts and
exemplary life who have not been so clearly convinced in point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as to concur with you in the late Wars, for which they have been
sequestred, and have since been better satisfied: and God forbid that such
should be made utterly uncapable of the Ministry, and they and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
starve for want of bread. I beseech you therefore, of al other things
let us not break with the King upon this Act of Charity, of Piety, lest
all the world condemne us for uncharitablenesse, and judge the King to
be more pious and charitable then we. And no doubt it will be the
greatest charity to our selves, to our Church, our Religion, our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
at this time, rather to close with the King in this particular, then
hazard all for a few third parts, and to be as charitable as his Majesty.
The more charity we shew, the greater unity, peace, amity, and better
settlement we may expect.</p>
            <p>But the greatest dissatisfaction of all (referred to this head of Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents)
is in the Kings answers concerning his present recalling of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
Ormonds</hi> Commission, to Treat with, and unite the Irish Rebels.</p>
            <p>To which I answer: first, that this was no part of the propositions first
sent, but a collaterall emergement discovered since the Treaty upon Col.
<hi>Iones</hi> his letter, and so the unsatisfactorinesse of the Kings Answer as to
this alone, can be no just cause or ground, to vote the other Answers <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactory,</hi>
or break off the Treaty.</p>
            <p>2dly, The Kings granting of this Commission to <hi>Ormond</hi> at the time
he did it, is no such hainous thing as many have made it, al circumstances
considered. The King when the Army would not close with him upon
their own tearms the last year who treated with him without your
privity, and against your Orders, even then when they unjustly impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the eleven Members for holding secret intelligence with him and
his party (of which themselves were only culpable;) was shut up close
Prisoner in <hi>Carisbrooke</hi> Castle in the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> by their procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by the Votes of both Houses (proceeding originally from the
Officers and the Armies projection, promoted by their Declaration, and
engagement to joyne with the Houses in setling the Kingdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106039:29"/>
&amp; against the <hi>K.</hi> and forcibly passed the Lords House by the Armies
garrisoning <hi>White Hall,</hi> &amp; billeting a Regiment of Horse in the Muse to
terrifie them to a concurrence with the Commons) quite laid aside like
a dead man out of minde, and no more addresses to be made to him by
the Houses, or from him to them, and no accesse of any to him under
pain of high Treason, without both Houses licence: the King in these
extremities, the better to procure his own enlargement and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
settlement by a Treaty, grants a Commission to Marquesse <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
to unite the <hi>Irish</hi> forces then divided for the foresaid ends. Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
certainly put honest and wisemen too [as the Armies friends
grant] upon hard shifts for self-preservation, and this extremity put the
King upon this of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King is flesh and blood as well as we, and nature teacheth him to
use the best means he may for his own preservation, and deliverance in
such a strait: The Army the last Summer refused to disband or suffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their forces to go for <hi>Ireland;</hi> to preserve and secure that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
only from this ground of self-preservation, upon which they
would now enforce you by their REMONSTRANCE,
and marching up to your doors with their forces, to break off the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or vote it wholly unsatisfactory<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whence most Gent. that differ in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
from me have made this their sole or chief argument that the Kings
answers are unsatisfactory, because the Army else will not be satisfied.
If then your own Army may thus disobey your votes, and force your
consents, only upon a pretence of self-preservations and defence, when
they are in no visible danger, the King by as good or better reason in
this extremity of danger, might justly make use of <hi>Ormonds</hi> endeavours
for his better safety and enlargement. And if some Members have affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the House, (as hath been alleadged in this debate) that they
would joyn with Turks or the worst of Nations, and call them in to
their assistance rather then the King should come in by conquest: then
the King by like reason might joyn with <hi>Ormond</hi> and the Irish, rather
then be thus laid aside and destroyed. And what we our selves would
do in his or the like condition, we cannot justly blame in him. Thirdly,
The King did never absolutely deny the recalling of <hi>Ormonds</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
but only suspended it til the Treaty ended, and if you then close
with him, you have his engagement presently to recall it: if then you
agree with him upon this<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Treaty, your demand in this is granted, and
danger prevented, but if you will not agree at all, it is very hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106039:30"/>
to presse the King to a present disadvantage, who is like to receive
no advantage by you, nothing being obligatory on either side til all be
concluded. In fine, the King hath so far condescended to satisfie you in
his finall answer, as to write a letter to <hi>Ormond,</hi> to suspend the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Commission for the present, and engaged to revoke it so soon
as you and he agree in future, and more then this, as the case stands, wee
cannot well in justice require, and we should hardly grant so much were
it our case as it is the Kings: and seeing all our dangers may be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by our agreement with the King, and this demand then fully gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
there is no reason to vote this unsatisfactory, when we may have all
we desire if we please our selves. However: I see no such differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and Us, in this of ORMOND and that of Delinquents,
as to vote the finall answer to them and all the rest unsatisfactory and
so to lose England, distressed Ireland, and all the former Concessions for
an unconsiderable dissatisfaction in these two particulars.</p>
            <p>The last <hi>Proposition</hi> relating to the security of the State,<note place="margin">That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>London</hi> fully gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it.</note> is. That the
City of <hi>London</hi> shall enjoy all their Rights, Liberties, Franchises, and usa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in raysing and imploying the forces thereof, for its defence; in as
full and ample manner as they used and enjoyed it heretofore. That the
Militia and City and Liberties thereof, shall be in the Ordering and
Government of the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common-Councell, or
such as they shall appoint, and be imployed and directed as both Houses
shall direct; so as no Citizen, or forces of the City shall be compelled
to go out of the City or Liberties for Military service without their
own free consent. That an Act shall be passed for the granting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
of the Cities Charters, Customs, and Franchises, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Non-user, Misuser, or abuser, and for confirmation of all by-Laws
and Ordinances made or to be made by the Lord Major, Aldermen,
and common-councell concerning the calling, convening and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Common-councell: That the Tower of <hi>London</hi> may be in the

upon all exigencies, and those to whom (under God) you pricipally owe your
victories and preservation. Now for the King to honour the City with such
concessions as these, which hath beene most hurtfull to, and deepest engaged
against him in this Warre, is almost as high and full (if not a greater)
justification of, and countenance to your cause, as this consent to the first
Proposition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> A great satisfaction to the City for all their services and expences,

and all succeeding Parliaments, upon the like cause and occasion, and to other
Corporations to do the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> A great security and advantage to the whole Kingdome, whose weal
and safety principally consists in <hi>Londons</hi> welfare, its principall Magazine,
Mart, Bulwarke, Refuge, and Military security both by Sea and Land,
wherewith the whole Kingdome stands or falls: had the King once gained <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
in these Warres, the Parliament, and all <hi>England</hi> had been quickly lost,
without hope of recovery, which will be in a secure or recoverable condition at all
times, if it be safe and true to the publique interest, from which some have studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of late to disengage it, to ruine it, and the Parliament too, which were alwayes
free from eminent danger whiles cordially united, and near to both their ruines
being now disjointed.</p>
            <p>I have thus as briefly as I could, (with discharge of my conscience
and duty) run through all the propositions which concerne the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and settlement of our State against the KINGS armed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or Exorbitant civill Sword or Prerogative, and other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
relating to its peace and safety, with the Kings respective Answers
thereunto.</p>
            <p>And for mine owne opinion, I humbly conceive them so fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106039:31"/>
and abundantly sufficient for our Weal and safety, against
all future Dangers, and Encroachments on our Liberties: that if we
conjoyn them with those other acts, the KING hath already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to this Parliament, We can neither desire nor expect any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to make us more compleatly happy and secure then any people or
Kingdome under Heaven.</p>
            <p>The KING hath already by Acts of Parliament condemned and
suppressed <hi>Ship-money,</hi> his owne <hi>Monopoly of making Gunpowder and Saltpetre,
Fines for Knight-hood, Impositions upon Merchants goods, Tonnage and Poundage,
without grant by Parliament, Coat and Conduct money, Forrest bounds and Laws,</hi>
the grand <hi>grievances</hi> under which we groaned, heretofore, so as we need
never feare their revivals, nor any others of that nature: Especially
since we have the <hi>Nomination</hi> of all great <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi> the
chiefe promoters of them. Besides, by Act of Parliament, hee hath
for ever suppressed the <hi>Bishops sitting and voting in Parliament,</hi> (a great
disadvantage to him, they commonly voting what he pleased, and being
wholly at his devotion) together with the three Grand Oppressive
Courts and shops of Tyranny, Oppression, and Injustice in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the great Terrors of Mens Spirits, the Invaders of their Rights,
Members, Liberties, the chiefe inlargers and maintainers of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
prerogative, and Authors of all our late illegall projects,
pressures, <hi>the Starchamber,</hi> the HIGH COMMISSION, and
COUNCELL TABLE: the Kings chief Engines to scrue up his
Prerogative to the highest, and lay his Subjects lowest; to which a
fourth is since added in this Treaty, <hi>the Court of Wards.</hi> All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
totally abolished, the KING hath now no Court nor instrument
left (that I can thinke of) whereby to injure, or oppresse his people
as in former times. The oppressions likewise and extortions of the <hi>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Courts,</hi> and of <hi>Clerkes of the Market,</hi> are rectified by acts this Session,
yea this Parliament by Act perpetuated, without any power in the
KING to <hi>adjourne and dissolve it,</hi> till all <hi>concurre to dissolve it by an Act of

and redresse of all growing mischiefs which may endanger us,
there is a provision by another <hi>Law</hi> for a <hi>Triennall Parl.</hi> with power
to summon it, in case of the Kings refusall, <hi>without him or his writ, and
authority for the Houses to sit for a convenient time</hi> (sufficient to redresse
all grievances, punish all publike Offenders and settle usefull Lawes)
without <hi>dissolution or adjournment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:106039:31"/>
To which I may adde, the Act of <hi>Oblivion, Pacification, and union with
our Brethren of Scotland:</hi> Upon granting of four of which Acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
the House of Commons in their<note n="*" place="margin">An exact Collection p. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Remonstrance of the State of

that His Majesty had passed more good Bils at that time, to
the advantage of the Subjects, then have been passed in many ages.</hi> And if
he shall now accumulate all the fore-mentioned Propositions turned
into Acts, to those already enacted; with some few Laws more for
the regulating of some grievances and corruptions in the Common
Law: the punishing and restraining of some publike mischiefs and
crimes, and punishment of Extortions, (which will be readily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to, there being no losse or prejudice to the Crowne in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them) We may through Gods blessing, in all humane probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
(if our sins deprive us not of so great a felicity) be the freest,
happiest, securest, most flourishing and best ordered Kingdom, and
People in the World, and injoy such priviledges, and immunities,
as our Ancestors never so much as once imagined, much lesse aspired
after. And if we will not now rest satisfied, and thankfully contented
with all these large extraordinary Concessions, and blesse God for
this tender of them to our hands, the present, and all future ages,
will Chronicle us, for the most unreasonable and ungratefull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that ever sate within these wals, or the world produced since
the Creation.</p>
            <p>Having now at large demonstrated (I hope to every rationall and
honest mans conviction) the <hi>satisfactorinesse</hi> of the Kings Answers to
all our Propositions relating to the safety and settlement of our
State:<note place="margin">The satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factoriness of the Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church &amp; Religion.</note> I shall in the next place proceed to those Propositions and
Concessions which concerne the Peace, Settlement, and Security of
our Church and Religion, wherein there appears the greatest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
the most whereof I shall dispatch with greater brevity then
the former.</p>
            <p>There are three things especially which may endanger and disturb
the Peace and settlement of our Church and Religion, 1. Popery, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
corruptions and innovations, introduced by Jesuites, Papists,
and superstitious Clergy-men Popishly addicted; 2. Prophanenesse;
3 Prelacy: and one chiefe thing to promote Religion and the
Churches happiness; the propagation of the Gospel, by settling preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ministers throughout the Kingdom, and establishing the publick
Worship and Church-Government in such sort, as is most agreeable
to Gods word. For all these there is sufficient ground in the Kings
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106039:32"/>
answers to our Propositions concerning them, to vote them satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
as I humbly apprehend, and hope to manifest.</p>
            <p>For the first of these dangers to our Church and Religion, there
is as good security and provision granted us by the King, as we did
or could desire, even in our own terms. First, he hath fully consented
to pass an <hi>Act for the more effectuall disabling of Iesuites, Papists,<note place="margin">Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against Papist, Popery and Popish Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and
Popish Recusants, from disturbing the State, and deluding the Lawes; and
for the prescribing of a New Oath for the more speedy discovery and conviction
of Recusants.</hi> Secondly, to an Act of <hi>Parliament, for the Education
of the children of Papists by Protestants, in the Protestant Religion.</hi>
Thirdly, to an Act <hi>for the due levying of the penalties against
Recusants, and disposing of them as both Houses shall appoint.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>to an Act, whereby the practices of the Papists against the State
may be prevented, the Lawes against them duly executed, and a
stricter course taken to prevent the saying or hearing of Mass in the
Court, or any other part of the Kingdome;</hi> whereby it is made
Treason <hi>for any Priests to say Masse in the Court or Queenes owne Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi>
and so no place left for the suying of Masse throughout the
Kingdome, no not in the Queens owne Chamber. Fifthly, to
an <hi>Act for abolishing all Innovations, Popish Superstitions, Ceremonies,
Altars, Rayles, Crucifixes, Images, Pictures, Copes, Crosses, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices,
Vestments, bowings at the name of Iesus, or towards the Altar, &amp;c.
out of the Church, and to prevent the introduction of them for the future.</hi>
By all which Acts added to our former Lawes against Recusants.
I dare affirme, we have now far better provision, and security a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Papists, Iesuits, Popish Recusants, their Popish pictures, Innovations,
Superstitions, and Ceremonies,</hi> both for our <hi>Churches and Religions</hi>
safety, and States too, then any Protestant Church, State, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
whatsoever; So as wee need not feare any future danger from
Papists or Popery, if we be carefull to see those Concessions duly put
into execution, when turned into Acts, and our former Laws.</p>
            <p>Secondly, against the growth and danger of Prophanenesse, His
Majesty hath condescended to an Act of <hi>Parliament,<note place="margin">Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> as large as
can</hi> be drawne, against <hi>all Prophanations whatsoever of the Lords day,
with severe punishment for the prophaners of it in any kinde; and
against all such who shall write or preach against its morality, and due
observation.</hi> And likewise to an <hi>Act to be framed and agreed upon by
both Houses of Parliament, for the reforming and regulating both Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and of the Colledges of Westminster, Winchester, and Eaton,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
of Learning and Education of youth, to serve and rule
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106039:32"/>
in our Church and State. By which two Grants, if duly executed,
all impiety and prophanenesse which can endanger our Church and
Religion, will easily be suppressed for the present, and prevented
for the future.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Against the danger and revivall of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances
thereunto belonging, the King hath clearly condescended
to these particulars <hi>in terminis.</hi> First, to an Act <hi>for the abolition of all
Archbishops, Chancellors, Commissaries, Deanes and Sub-Deans, Deans ard
Chapters, Arch-deacons, Canons, Prebendaries, &amp;c. and all other Episcopall,
Cathedrall or Collegiate Officers both in</hi> England, Wales <hi>and</hi> Ireland: <hi>and
to the disposall of all their Lands and Possessions for such uses as the Houses
shall thinke meet:</hi> So as there is no feare at all of their resurrection
to disturb our Church. All the question and difference now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and Houses, is onely concerning the Office and
power of Bishops, and their Lands and Possessions; in which two I
finde most Members declare themselves to be unsatisfied, especially,
those who have purchased Bishops Lands, who are very zealous in
that point for their own Interests.</p>
            <p>For the clearing of these two scruples, I shall examine and debate
these two particulars.</p>
            <p>First, how far the K. hath consented to the Houses Propositions for
the abolishing of the office &amp; jurisdiction of Bishops in the Church?</p>
            <p>Secondly, how far He hath condescended, to the sale and disposal
of their Lands and Possessions? And whether his Concessions in both
these be not sufficiently satisfactory, in the sense I have stated the
question in the beginning of my debate of it?</p>
            <p>For the first of these; It is clear, that the King in his two last Papers
hath <hi>abolished</hi> and <hi>extirpated</hi> that Episcopacy and Prelacy which we
intended, and have so earnestly contested against; and contends now
for no other but an Apostolicall Bishop, which is but the same in
all things with an ordinary Minister or Presbyter; which Bishop
being Apostolicall, and of divine Institution, we neither may, nor
can, nor ever intended to abolish by our Covenant. To make this
evident to all mens consciences: 1 The King hath yeelded to take
away all the power and jurisdiction whatsoever exercised by our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in point of censure or discipline, in his former answer: and
contends for nothing now but their power of Ordination only: and
that not solely vested in the Bishop, but in him and other Presbyters
jointly: yet so as the Bishop should have a negative Voice in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
But the Houses voting this unsatisfactory, because that the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106039:33"/>
Bishops for three years, during the continuance of the Presbyterian
government, should have the chief power of Ordination; &amp; after those
three years the sole power, there being no others vested or intrusted
with that power after the three years expired; so as Bishops might
by this means creep in, and get up againe by degrees as high as ever.
Thereupon the King in his finall Answer hereunto, though not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfied in point of conscience, but that the <hi>power of Ordination is
principally vested onely in Bishops by Divine Authority,</hi> hath yet <hi>for our
satisfaction, thus far condescended to us: First, that for three years next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing,
during the Presbyteriall Government, no Bishops shall at all exercise
this power of Ordination in the Church.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That if he can be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in point of Conscience within that time, upon conference with Divines,
That this power of Ordination, so far as to have a Negative voice in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
not only unto Apostolical Bishops by a divine Right; then he wil fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the utter abolition even of this power of Ordination in the Bishops.</hi>
Thirdly, That after the three yeares are expired, if the King can
neither satisfie his Houses in point of conscience, nor they him upon
debate, That this power of Ordination belongs <hi>Iure Divino</hi> to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
that <hi>yet the exercise of that power shall be totally suspended in them till
He and both Houses shall agree upon a Government, and by Act of Parliament
settle a Form of Ordination. So as if both Houses never consent that Bishops shall
hereafter have a hand or negative voice in Ordination, this power of Bishops
is perpetuaily suspended,</hi> and as to the exercise of it, perpetually abolished
even by this Concession, so as it can never be revived again without
both Houses concurring assents. And by this means, <hi>Episcopacy is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
extirpated root and branch,</hi> according to the Covenant, which hath
been so much pressed in this debate, though the words of it have
been somewhat mistaken, that we therein absolutely covenant to
extirpate Episcopacy; when as the words are only, <hi>That we shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the extirpation of Prelacy, that is, of Archbishops and Bishops, &amp;c.</hi>
And that certainly we have done, and in a great measure accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
so far as to satisfie both the words and intention of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
though a concurrent power of Ordination be left in Bishops,
which yet is now totally suspended: For as we covenant in the
same clause to <hi>endeavour to root out Popery, Superstition, Heresie, Schisme,
Prophanenesse, and whatsoever shall be found to be contrary to sound Doctrine,
and the power of Godlinesse;</hi> in the extirpation of which, I am certain
we have not proceeded by an hundred degrees, so farre as we have
actually done in the extirpation of Episcopacy, there being no
Proposition at all in the Treaty for the extirpation of <hi>Heresie,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106039:33"/>
Schisme</hi> and <hi>Errors,</hi> as there is of Episcopacy;) and yet the Gentlemen
who are so zealous for the Covenant, perswade themselves, they and
we have not violated it in these particulars: therefore much less in
the point of Prelacy and Bishops, since we have left them nothing
at all but a meer power of Ordination, actually suspended from any
future execution, but by both Houses assents. Fourthly, the King
by abolishing <hi>Archbishops, and Deans and Chapters,</hi> hath also therein
actually abolished all Bishops too for the future, except those who
are already made. For by the Laws and custome of the Realm<note n="*" place="margin">See the Book of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, &amp; Bishops, &amp;c. 1. &amp; 2. <hi>Ph.</hi> &amp; <hi>Mar.</hi> c. 8.</note> 
               <hi>No
Bishop can be consecrated but by an Archbishop, or some deputation from him,
in case of sicknesse;</hi> nor any <hi>Bishop made or consecrated, unlesse he be first ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Dean and Chapter, upon a</hi> Conge deslier <hi>issued out to them to
choose one.</hi> Now there being no Deanes and Chapters left to elect,
nor Archbishop to consecrate any Bishop for the future, there can
be no Bishop at all hereafter made in England or Ireland: and so the
Bishop being thereby abolished and extirpated, his power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
must be destroyed with his Function, as well as suspended.
All which considered, I cannot but conclude, the Kings finall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
as to the Office of, and Ordination by Bishops, to be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfactory to our demands.</p>
            <p>And so much the rather, because the King in this particular of
<hi>Ordination,</hi> pleads only <hi>dissatisfaction in polnt of Conscience</hi> for closing
with us in this seeming punctilio; and if it were not meerly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
(though some have over rashly censured it for a meer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to keep up Bishops still) he that hath granted and yeelded us
the greater, would never contest with us for the lesser, nor go so far
in the abolition of Episcopacy as he hath done. And truly, I doubt
not, but His Majesty by conference may soon be satisfied in this point:
Nay, had his own Divines dealt faithfully with him, in the Isle of
<hi>Wight,</hi> He might have beene easily satisfied in this particular: in
which I doubt not by Gods blessing to undertake to satisfie him
both in point of Episcopacy, that it is in all things the same with
Presbytery; and that the ordination of Presbyters and Ministers by
divine Right, belongs only to Presbyters as such, and not to Bishops
as Bishops; who for above a thousand years after Christ claimed
the chief, but not the sole interest in it, not by divine Right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but meerly by Canons and Custom long after the Apostles
time; which I have proved at large long since, in my <hi>Vnbishoping of
Timothy and Titus,</hi> which none of the Bishops or their Patrons ever
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106039:34"/>
yet attempted to answer, though I particularly challenged them to
do it.</p>
            <p>Only this, I shall now say in brief, for some satisfaction in the
point to other Members.</p>
            <p>1. That there is no one Text of Scripture to prove, that Bishops
<hi>Iure divine</hi> are distinct from Presbyters in any thing, much less in this
particular of having a negative Voice, or sole, or principall interest,
as Bishops (so distinguished) in the power of Ordination<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but a direct
Text to the contrary, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14 to omit others.</p>
            <p>2 That the pretence of impropriating Ordination to Bishops di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from Presbyters by divine Right, is grounded upon these two
gross mistakes, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Bishops properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
the one of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the other of <hi>Crete;</hi> and that this power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
Elders, was vested in them <hi>quatenus</hi> Bishops only, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
by divine institution; for proof of the first, the Postscript<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles to them (and no one Text of Scripture) are cited; and
the 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 22. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. relating only to Ordination, for the latter.
But it is clear as the noon-day Sun, by Scripture, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was
never a Bishop properly so called, much lesse the first or sole Bishop
of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as is evident by sundry texts, especially by <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 4, 5, 6, 15,
17, 18, 21, 29, 30, 31. compared together; nor <hi>Titus</hi> a Bishop proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so termed, distinct from a Presbyter; much lesse the first or sole
Bishop of <hi>Crete:</hi> nor do either of those texts prove, that they had
the power of Ordination by divine Right vested in them two, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as Bishops distinct from, or superiour to Presbyters, as I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyably
manifested in my <hi>Vnbishoping of Timothy and Titus.</hi> And as
for the Postscripts to these Epistles, terming <hi>Timothy ordained first
Bishop of Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus of Crete,</hi> they are no part of the text, <hi>first
extant in, and invented by</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">This I have fully proved in my <hi>Vnbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoping of Timothy &amp; Titus.</hi> And of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of English Prelacy to Unity and Monarchy, par 1. 2. c. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Occumenius</hi> (none of the authentickst Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) <hi>above</hi> 1050 years after Christ, and annexed <hi>only to the end of his
Commentary on those Epistles, not</hi> adjoyned <hi>to the Text;</hi> and they are not
only, <hi>omitted in most Manuscripts and printed Editions and Translations
of these Epistles, but apparently false in themselves, as I have at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
in some printed Books.</hi> Therefore this point of conscience
may soone be satisfied.</p>
            <p>3 That no Bishops for 1200 years after Christ, did ever claim the
chief power in Ordination by any Divine Right as Bishops, but
meerly by Canons or Custom long after the Apostles; and that in
the Primitive times, before any re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>ordain Ministers and Deacous without

and sometimes joined in the <hi>consecration and enstallment of</hi> Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>and Archbishops,</hi> for defect of Bishops.</p>
            <p>4. That it is the<note n="*" place="margin">See this largely proved in my <hi>Vnbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoping of Timothy &amp; Titus,</hi> and in <hi>Gersom. Bucerus de Gubernat. Ecclesiae.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>constant tenent of all the eminentest Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
(and some learned Papists too) <hi>and the practice of all the reformed
Churches, that the Divine right of Ordination belongs originally to the whole
Church; but ministerially to Presbyters as such, not to Bishops as Bishops:</hi>
and that which undeniably clears it up to mee, is this. That in the
New Testament wee find both Apostles, some of the 70 Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Evangelists and Presbyters equally ordaining Elders or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters:
but not any one who is once in Scripture stiled a Bishop,
either conferring orders upon any, much lesse <hi>eonomine &amp; jure,</hi> as a
Bishop. And since the Apostles time wee find in point of use and
practice, Popes, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Metropolitans, Cardinalls,
Abbots, in some places (who are not <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> nor Bishops pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called, but distinguished from them in degree) ordaining
Presbyters and Ministers as well as Bishops <hi>quatenus</hi> Bishops; and
that never by themselves, but all by the Presbyters joint concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
then present, who by the fourth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
law, the very Canons of <hi>Trent</hi> also, and our owne book of
Ordination and our Canons ought also to join with them in the
Ordination: Now all these distinct Orders and Degrees, claiming
and exercising this power by a Divine Right, and many of their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
being confessed not to be of Divine Right, (as Popes, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,
Archbishops, Metropolitans, Abbots and Chorall Bishops)
who yet ordain; and these alwaies necessarily calling Presbyters (who
are clearly of Divine Right) to join with them in their Ordination,
and not doing it alone, is an unanswerable proof to me, that they all
concur in this action in no other right or notion at all, but meerly as
they are Presbyters, in which they all accord, and have one and the
same authority; not in their own capacities, wherein they are all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminated,
and are not all of Divine, but only of humane instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Presbyters, <hi>quà</hi> Presbyters, being the properest persons to ordain
others of their owne degree and function; as Doctors of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
law and Physick in the Universities, create Doctors of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Professions; and Bishops consecrate Bishops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops;
even as a man begets a man of his own quality and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
and all other creatures generate those of their own kind,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106039:35"/>
without the concurrence of any her distinct species paramount them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As</hi> for the <hi>Angel of the Church of Ephesus</hi> (much insisted on in the Isle
of <hi>Wight,</hi> to prove an Episcopacy <hi>Iure Divino</hi> distinct from Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
I never read that this <hi>Angell ordained any Presbyters; eit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er quatenus
Angel</hi> or <hi>Bishop:</hi> nor find I the name of a <hi>Bishop</hi> in any of St. <hi>Iohn's</hi>
Writings, but the title of a Presbyter or Elder very frequent, by which
himself is stiled. And I wonder much the King or his Bishops should
now so much insist upon this Angel, and assert him to bee a Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
not an ordinary Minister.</p>
            <p>For first,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See my</hi> Antipathy of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, part. 2. pag. 479. to 484.</note> King <hi>Iames</hi> himself, and all the <hi>Bishops of</hi> Engl. with those
learned men imployed by them in the <hi>last Translation</hi> of the Bible, in
the very contents prefixed to this Chap. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. resolve the Angells of
those Churches to be Ministers, in these very words: <hi>What is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be written to the Angels, THAT IS THE MINISTERS</hi> (not
Bishop) <hi>of the Churches of Ephesus, Smyrna, &amp;c.</hi> If then the <hi>Angels,</hi>
by their joint confessions, when these Contents were first composed
and prefixed, were only the <hi>Ministers</hi> (not <hi>Bishops</hi>) of these Churches,
and have ever since been constantly admitted, confessed, and this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
to be so even in our authorized Bibles used in all Churches,
Chappels, Families, and printed <hi>cum privilegio</hi> five or six times a yeer,
without any alteration or disallowance of this Exposition: I marvel
much how the Bishops now dare inform the King, That these <hi>Angels</hi>
certainly were only <hi>Bishops</hi> but not <hi>Ministers,</hi> diametrally contrary to
these authorized Contents of their own or Predecessors affixing, with
learned King <hi>Iames</hi> his approbation; or how his Majesty when Hee
knowes it can beleeve them, though they should averr it, against His
own Fathers, and the whole Church of <hi>Englands</hi> resolution, which
hath so long received and approved this Translation (excluding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in publick) and these Contents thereto prefixed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Admit this Angell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to be a Diocesan Bishop,
distinct: from an ordinary Presbyter, yet he was but an Apostate, who
<hi>had lost his first love, ver.</hi> 4. And if <hi>Timothy</hi> (as they affirm) was sole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he must be the Apostate (being at that time living)
unlesse he resigned his office to some other, which is improbable. And
for our Bishops to father that divine Right of their Prelacy upon an
Apostate Angell, is no good Divinity, and lesse Policy at this instant.
And this their rotten foundation upon an Apostate, may probably
be the ground, why so many Prelates in this and former ages have
turned Apostates after they were created Bishops.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:106039:35"/>
Thirdly, if those <hi>Angells</hi> in the Revelation were really Lord <hi>Bishops,</hi>
then certainly the <hi>Elders</hi> therein mentioned can bee no other then
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> not <hi>Bishops,</hi> as the Prelates themselves will grant: And if
so, then verily the <hi>Presbyter</hi> is the supream of the two, both in point
of Dignity, Ministry, and precedency; which is very observable. For
first, I find the 24 <hi>Elders there mentioned, sitting upon twenty four seats
round about Christs Throne</hi> (and nearest to it) <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 4. c. 11. 16. <hi>but
the Angells standing</hi> (not sitting) <hi>round about it</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> without any
seats at all provided for them (as inferiour attendants,) <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 11.
c. 7. 11. Secondly, I find these Elders not onely sitting on seats next
Christs throne; <hi>but likewise cloathed with white rayment and having on
their heads</hi> Crownes of Gold the embleme of supream Authority,
power and honor) Rev. 4. 4. 10. whereas the Angells had neither
white rayment nor Crowns; so it seems Bishops had no lawn sleeves,
nor Rochets, nor Miters then, though they have since usurped and
robd the Presbyters of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>These Elders,</hi> not the <hi>Angells,</hi> are there alwayes introduced
<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 4. 10, 11. c. 5. 8, 9. c. 11. 16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>worshipping and falling downe before Christs Throne; holding harps and
golden viols in their hands full of odors, representing the prayers of the Saints,
and singing the new song to him;</hi> as the principal Officers and Ministers
of Christ) when as the Angells standing by, act or speak little in
these kinds, like our late dumb unpreaching and rare-praying Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the 24 Elders (not the Angells) sing this new Song of
praise to Christ, 1 <hi>Rev. 5. 9. 10. Worthy art thou to take the booke,</hi> &amp;c.
And hast made us Kings and Priests (not Angells or Bishops) to <hi>God
the Father; and we</hi> (not the Angels) <hi>that REIGN on the Earth,</hi> therefore
in all these respects, if the Angells in the Apocalypse bee Bishops,
as our Prelates dreame; the Elders must of necessity <hi>jure divino,</hi> bee
their Superiors and Lords paramount in point of dignity, honour,
Soveraignty, Ministry, and they inferiour in jurisdiction and
power unto Presbyters, not superior, as they would really make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
When his Majesty shall be informed of these, and many other
particulars of this kinde, I doubt not but his conscience will be so
much satisfied, as wholly to forgoe and lay aside his pretended Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
Bishops, both in point of function and ordination too, as
being the same with Presbyters. And since in his last paper but one, he
hath professed to retain no other Bishops, but such as are Apostolicall;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106039:36"/>
he must presently quit all those about him, and their possessions too,
since neither of them are Apostolicall,<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 20. 17. 28. Phil. 1. 1. Tit. 1. 5, 6, 7.</note> the Apostolicall Bishops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>many alwaies over one Church and Congregation,</hi> not one over many
Churches, or an whole Diocesse, as ours are: and having no
Palaces, Mannors, Lands and Possessions: as I shall prove in the
next particular, which comes to be now debated, having fully cleared
this to be satisfactory.</p>
            <p>For the second question concerning the sale of Bishops lands, how
far the King hath condescended to it? And whether the Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to the first branch of that Proposition bee satisfactory in the
premised sense?</p>
            <p>I confesse I find this the grand and most swaying Argument of all
others used by those who differ from me in the Treaty, as not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
because the King absolutely refuseth to agree to the sale of
Bishops Lands, for the satisfaction of those publike debts, for which
they are engaged by both Houses, whereby purchasers and lenders
upon that assurance, will be not only defrauded but cheated of their
debts and purchases, many of them quite undone and ruined, and the
honor and publick faith of both Houses for ever forfeited and laid in
the dust. And indeed this is a very sensible argument, especially to
such Members who have either purchased Bishops lands, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
moneys upon their security, very fit to bee fully answered;
which I shall endeavour to doe, I hope to their full satisfaction and
content.</p>
            <p>I confesse it to be most just and equall, that all who have purchased
Bishops Lands, or advanced moneys to the State upon them, should
receive ful satisfaction, and be no losers by it, but rather gainers: And I
could have as heartily desired as any Member in this House, that the
King in this particular of Bishops lands had given us plenary satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
the rather because I was imployed by the Houses as one of
the Contractors (though without my seeking, and to my prejudice,
by neglecting my calling, and receiving as yet not one farthing sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for it, though I have spent and lost some hundred of pounds in
and by that imployment) and had he really done it, I presume few
Members of this House now of a different opinion, would have voted
the Kings Answers to the whole Treaty unsatisfactory. But to take
them as they are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:106039:36"/>
First, the King hath so far condescended to their sale and disposall,
made or to be made; as that the purchasers shall by Act of Parliament
enjoy a lease of them, not from the Bishops themselves but from the
Crown for 99. yeares space, reserving only the reversions afterward
to the Crowne, and that for the use of the Church in generall
terms.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The King will bee content with the reservation
only of the old, or some other moderate rent to Him and
His Heirs, to bee imployed only for the Churches use and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That for the absolute sale or alienation of them, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in point of conscience consent unto it, being Sacriledge, and an
unlawfull Act in the opinion of all Divines, as well in forraigne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches as Domestick.</p>
            <p>This (I remember and conceive) is the sum of his finall answer to
this Proposition.</p>
            <p>To examine these particulars a little in the generall, and then by
parts.</p>
            <p>First, I must make bold to inform you in the generall; That the
King and His Predecessors, Kings of this Realm, were the<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See Goodwin,</hi> Catalogue of English Bishops. <hi>Rastalls</hi> abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Tit. Bishops sust fruits &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>,</note> 
               <hi>Originall
founders of all our Bishoprieks, and patrons of them. That all their Lands,
Rent and Revenues whatsoever, originally proceeded from the Crown and
Kings of</hi> England, <hi>of whom they are bolden; and that in times of vacancy, the
King enjoyes the profits of their temperalities, as a part of His Royall Revenue,
and receives both tenths and first-fruits out of them upon every death or
translation of the Bishops.</hi> And therefore there is very great reason and
Justice too, they should be still held of the Crowne, and not totally
translated out of it, and that the King and His successors should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
some reasonable Revenue or compensation out of them, parting
with such an interest in recompence for them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That in the severall Treaties with the King, <hi>Februar. 1.
1641.</hi> and <hi>Iuly</hi> 11. 1646. All <hi>the Lands, Possessions, Rents and Reversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
both of Archbishops and Bishops, and likewise of Deans and Chapters,
and other Officers of Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches, were by Act of
Parliament to be settled in the very reall and actuall possession of the King, His
Heirs and Successors for ever, to their own proper use, except only their Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations,
Advowsons, Tythes, and Pensions which are not now to bee sold.</hi>

               <hi>Bill
passed by them for that purpose;</hi> was to enjoy to himselfe, his Heirs and
Successors all the demesne Lands, Mannors, Possessions, Reversions,
Rents, Inheritances and Revenues of Archbishops and Bishops; and
likewise of Deans and Chapters, Prebends, and the like, it seems to me
very just &amp; reasonable, that he should demand and enjoy the Reversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them after ninety nine years, and such a moderate Rent as
he and both Houses shall agree on. And that this Answer of the
Kings, wherein he demands so little now, only for the Churches
use and benefit, not his own should be fully satisfactory, because we
were very well content in former Treaties, He and his Heirs should
enjoy the whole, only to their own use.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That near one moiety of the Archbishops and Bishops
possessions and revenues, consists in <hi>Impropriations, Tythes, Pensions,
and the like,</hi> which the King is content wholly to part with for the
encrease of Ministers means, and the <hi>benefit of the Church,</hi> without
any Reservation or Recompence: And with all Deans and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Lands and Revenues to boot. Therefore it should be unsatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
or unreasonable in no mans judgement, for the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
some interest in the Reversions and Rents only of their demesne
lands.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The King demands the <hi>Riversions of the Lands after
ninety nine years,</hi> and some present <hi>moderate Rent,</hi> not for the use
and support of the Bishops, and to keep a root for them to grow up
again in our Church, (as hath been mistaken by some;) Archbishops
and Bishops too, being extirpated root and branch by the Kings
former Answers (as I have manifested;) but only for the use of
the Church, in such manner as the King and we shall agree to
settle them who shall take care that no Bishop shall be a sharer in
them, all being to bee setled in the CROWNE alone, and
nothing in Reversion or Possession to, in or upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The King consents, that <hi>the Purchasers of Bishops Lands
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106039:37"/>
shall by Act of Parliament have a Lease of them for ninety nine years,
reserving the Reversion only after that terme: which I conceive is no ill,
but a very good bargain for the Purchasers;</hi> such a Lease by Act of
Parliament, being far better then the whole Inheritance by a bare
Ordinance of both Houses, which for ought I know, if not confirmed
by a subsequent Act of Parliament, will prove little better then a
Tenancy at Will, or a Lease so long only as this Parliament conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues;
Ordinances of both Houses only without the Kings Royall
assent thereto being a new device of this present Parliament; to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
some present necessities for our necessary defence and preservation,
during the Kings absence and hostility, never known nor used in any
former Parliaments, what ever hath been conceived to the contrary.
Therefore this offer of the K. is no prejudice at all, but a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the Purchasers, wherewith they should rest fully satisfied. But
admit it be any losse at all to them, and not rather a gain (as things
now stand in our tottering condition,) yet it is only of the reversion
of these lands after ninety nine years, worth not above one quarter or
halfe a years purchase at the utmost; which considering the low va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
at which Bishops lands are sold, and the cheap rate now that most
purchasers gave for Bills of Publick faith, with which they bought
them, they may be well content to lose, to secure their purchases for
ninety nine years, in these tumultuous and fluctuating times; when
some wise men who have made such purchases, would very gladly
give two or three years purchase, if not more, at the assurance Office,
to any who will ensure their estates in Bishops lands for so long a
term, and think they had a good bargain too, at leastwise far better
then the Bishops in case they should revive again, as some fear, who
must be kept starving for 99 years, in expectation of a dry Reversion.
All which considered, the Kings Answers touching such Reversions, I
humbly conceive will be very satisfactory to the purchasers of Bishops
lands themselves; who are most displeased with it.</p>
            <p>As to that which hath been objected,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that some have purchased Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
of Bishops Lands after 99 years in being, who must absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lose their purchase money after this rate, which is neither just nor
honourable for the Parliament.</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> that this is but the case of three or foure only:
that their purchases are of no considerable value: nor bought
fingly by themselves, but jointly with Lands or Rents
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106039:38"/>
in possession of good value; in which they had the cheaper
purchase to take off the Reversion after so long a term, which losse
in the Reversion they may contentedly undergoe to purchase their
owne and the Kingdomes peace, and enjoy what they have purchased
with these Reversions in possession, without trouble or eviction by Act
of Parliament for 99, years space, or receive other satisfaction from
the King and Parliament to their contentment in such manner as I
shall presently inform you.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, To that concerning the present Rents which the Kingde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
out of Bishops Lands which sticks most with Purchasers: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them having purchased nothing but Rents, and others more
rents then Lands in possession, which Rents must all be lost, if they
must pay their old rents over to the King to their undoing, which
would be both unjust, unconscionable, and dishonourable to the
Houses, upon whose assurance and engagement to enjoy their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains,
they were induced both to lend money on, and to purchase
these Lands afterwards, and would be no better then plain cheating,
and render them odious to all the world, as some have objected.</p>
            <p>I will not answer it with <hi>Caveat emptor,</hi> but desire them to observe
that the King in his answer, doth not peremptorily require the
Bishops old rents during the 99. years, but only disjunctively, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the old Rent, or some other <hi>moderate Rent</hi> to be agreed on, and
if only a moderate proportion of the old rent be paid to the King,
the Purchaser is sure to enjoy, the residue during the 99 yeares,
and so his purchase money not totally lost, as is objected. Besides,
the King will not reserve these Rents to the use of himselfe, or the
Crown, but only to the Church, and maintenance of the Ministers,
in such manner as He and his Houses shall agree in the Bill for setling
these Lands, in the way propounded by him. Which offer opens this
just and honourable way for the Houses to give all Purchasers of
Bishops Land and Rents full satisfaction both for the losse of their
reversions after 99 years, and for the present rents which shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to the Crown out of Bishops Lands to the Churches use, which
I beleeve the King and Houses will readily consent to; and that is,
to settle by Act of Parliament, so much of the Dean and Chapters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mein
Lands and Rents, upon the Purchasers, as the losse of their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106039:38"/>
Reversions after 99. years, and present Rent to the Crowne shall
amount unto, upon a just computation. By which means the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers,
by way of Exchange of Deans and Chapters Lands and
Rents for their Bishops, shall have such full and satisfactory content,
even in kind, as will cleare the Honour, justice, and Reputation of
the Houses fair dealings in this particular, throughout al the world,
and give the Ministers full satisfaction likewise, for the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of whose livings and maintenance the Deanes and Chapters
Lands and Rents are designed; by settling the reversion and Rents
reserved to the Crown out of the Bishops Lands, for the Churches
use, upon those who should have enjoyed the Deans and Chapters
Lands thus settled on the Purchasers by exchange, which being of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
value, can be no losse nor prejudice to any.</p>
            <p>This is such a visible and reall satisfaction to all purchasers, as
none of them can justly open their mouths against, being both for
their owne security and advantage, and the Kingdomes settlement.
But if any of them dislike this reall satisfaction (which the King no
doubt will yeeld to) there is an other means provided by this very
Treaty for their satisfaction; and that is, by ready money, for what
ever they shall lose by Bishops Lands in possession or reversion, by
this Reservation to the Crown, which I am sure they never will
nor can refuse in Justice or equity; they having the Bishops Lands
conveyed to them only, by way of Morgage or security for Moneys
lent upon the publike faith. And the houses by the 12th. Article
of this Treaty have time within two years space by Act or Acts, to
raise any summes of money for the payment of the publique debts
of the Kingdome, whereof the moneys lent upon Bishops Lands
and the publique faith, are a principall part; and the same Justice of
the Houses which hath already provided by severall Ordinances, a
sufficient recompence and satisfaction for purchasers of Bishops
Lands in cases of eviction, or of emergent charges and incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
discovered after the purchases made, may be a sufficient assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to them of the Houses Justice, that they will give them as
good or better satisfaction by one of these two wayes I have here
propounded, for any thing they shall part with to the King or
Church for the settlement of the Kingdomes peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:106039:39"/>
Seventhly, it hath beene the solemn Protestation and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of both Houses of Parliament, in all their <hi>Remonstrances to
the King, Kingdome and forraigne States, that they have taken up defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Armes against the Kings Party, onely for the maintenance of Religion,
Lawes, Liberties, &amp;c. and to bring Delinquents to condigne punishment.</hi>
Now Bishops Lands and Rents, I am certaine, are neither our
<hi>Religion, Lawers,</hi> nor <hi>Liberties;</hi> and I thinke they are no <hi>Delinquents,</hi>
though most Bishops are. And shall we now after seven yeares
Warres, and sixty dayes Treaty, make Bishops Lands, which for
five yeares time or more of our Warres were never thought of, the
sole or principall cause at least of our present breach with
the King, and the onely ground of a new Warre? God forbid:
will not the world then justly censure us for notoriou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
and impostors, pretend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng one thing, and intending ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
will they not then say, that Bishops Palaces and Lands were
the onely <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> we have fought for, the onely <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents</hi>
we have brought to publick Justice and execution? that we
would never have suppressed Archbishops and Bishops, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a solemne <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> with <hi>bands listed up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
to endeavour <hi>to extirpate them as Antichristian,</hi> but onely to
gaine and retaine all their <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Revenues,</hi> and never condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their <hi>Functions,</hi> but onely to seize on their <hi>Possessions?</hi> And
that we must now maintaine an <hi>Army</hi> upon their exhausted Purses
and Estates, only to defend these Parchasers Titles to the Bishops
Inheritances? If so, for shame let us never break off this Treaty, nor
ruine two or three Kingdomes upon such an absurd dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as this: And if our Parchasers of Bishops Lands shall still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to rest satisfied with that twofold recompence I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned, and keep up an <hi>Army</hi> to maintaine their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases,
rather then yeeld to any reason, I shall humbly move, that
not the whole Kingdome, but themselves may defray the Armies
Taxes and Quarters, and then I am certaine they will have a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
bargaine then what the King or I have proposed for their satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>And the better to perswade them to embrace this compensation
I have onely this more to offer both to them and you; That if
you break off with the King upon this point, or close with the
Army, they are most certaine to lose all for a bare Ordinance of
both Houses in no legall Title, nor good security aganst King or
Bishops, without the Kings concurrence and Royall assent unto it,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106039:39"/>
and valid no longer then maintained by the Sword, the worst
and most hazardous Title of all others, which will quickly cost
the Purchasers and Kingdome treble the value of all the Bishops
Revenues: and if they close with the Army to break the <hi>Treaty,</hi>
they tell them in direct termes in print, <hi>in The Case of the Army
truly stated</hi> (presented to the Generall by the Agitators of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
at <hi>Hampstead,</hi> October, 15. 1647.) pag. 16. That <hi>whereas the times
were wholly corrupt, when persons were appointed to make sale of Bishops
Lands; and whereas Parliament-men, Committee-men, and Kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>folks
were the onely buyers, and much is sold, and yet it's presended, that
little or no money is received: And whereas Lords, Parliament-men,
and some other rich men, have vast summes of Arrears allowed them
in their Purchase, and all their moneys lent to the State paid them, while
others are left in necessity, to whom the State is much indebted, and
so present Money that might be for the equall advantage of all, is not
brought into the publike Treasury by those sales: Its therefore to bea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, that the sale of Bishops Lands bee reviewed, and that they may
be sold to their worth; and for present Moneys for the publike use, and that
the sale of all such be recalled as have not been sold to their worth, or for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>particular</hi> among others, they <hi>professe</hi> they have entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>solemne engagement</hi> to prosecute, and are now marched up to
<hi>London</hi> accordingly to pursue it, as their late <hi>Remonstrance</hi> and <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
intimates, and themselves professe by word of mouth; which I
desire the <hi>Members</hi> who have purchased <hi>Bishops Lands</hi> (who are
generally most unsatisfied with the Kings answers, especially in
this particular) seriously to consider, and then to make their
Election; Whether they will now close with the Kings Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and what I have here propounded for satisfaction of their
Reversions after 99. years, and present Rents they may chance to
part with, and so secure their purchases for this terme by Act
of Parliament, and have full compensation for what they part with,
either in ready money, or Deans and Chapters Lands and Rents,
and so be no losers, but great gainers by the bargaine; or else break
with the King to please the <hi>Army,</hi> and so be certaine to lose all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, not onely once, but twice over: for the <hi>Agitators</hi> in
the <hi>Army</hi> tell them plainely, That <hi>all their Purchases shall be review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
and if they <hi>have purchased them to an under rate, or not for ready
Money</hi> (which not one of them hath done, but by Tickets of
their owne, or bought at very low values of others, which 'tis like
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106039:40"/>
they will also examine) <hi>that then their sales shall be absolutely recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
and sold to others at full values for ready money, and so all
is lost in good earnest; or else they must re-purchase them for
ready moneys at higher values, without any assurance from the
King by Act of Parliament, and so lose them againe the second
time, if ever He or his Prelaticall party should prevaile, and yet
be enforced to answer and restore all the meane Profits they have
taken to boot. A very hard chapter and bargain to digest, if they
advisedly consider it, which by accepting the Kings offer is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
prevented: Who perchance in shore time, upon second
thoughts, and conference with learned men for the satisfaction of his
conscience in the point of sacriledge, if he should consent to the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
alienation of these Lands from the Church, may come up fully
to our desires, and part with the very inheritance to the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,

and the Kingdomes interest wholly unsettled.</p>
            <p>And for my part, I make little question, that had the Prelates
and Clergy-men with the King at the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> dealt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
and cleerly with him in this particular, of the sale of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
Lands, that might have easily satisfied his conscience in this
very thing, as well as in others; from these grounds and matters
of fact, which I shall but point at, to satisfie others, who perchance
are scrupulous herein (even in point of conscience) as well as the
King.</p>

and Bishops with temporall Lands and possessions, the voice of an Angel
was heard in the Ayre, crying out;</hi> Hodie venenum insunditur in
Ecclesiam, <hi>this day is poyson powred into the whele Church of God:</hi> And
from that time, say they, <hi>because of the great Riches the Church had,
she was made the more secular; and had more worldly businesse, then spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
devotion; and more pomp and boast outward, then holinesse inward:

all or most of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> before that time were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
scarce one of them proved a Martyr afterwards; but in
stead of being Martyrs, fell a persecuting and making Martyrs.
And if this voyce of the Angel (perchance a <hi>Bishop,</hi> since our
Prelates will needs have the Angels in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. to bee Bishops)
weretrue, and subsequent experience hath found it so, That
Bishops and Church-mens Temporall Lands, Possessions and

hath so much infected, corrupted, and would in fine destroy it and

if their Predecessors were anciently so poore, it is no point of

Servants, why do we envy the eternall gains of our Lord for our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sublimities? Our Episcopall dignity will be more fruitfull to us, if being
laid downe, it shall more unite the flock of Christ, then if it shall desperse
it being retained. If when I shall retaine my Bishoprick, I shall
disperse the flock of Christ, how is this dammage of the flocke the
honour of the Pastour? for with what forehead shall we hope for the
honour promised in the world to come from Christ, if our honour in this world
hinder Christian Vnity?</hi> They had no Bishops Lands then to part
with, but yet for Peace and Unity sake, they were thus content to
part with their very Bishopdoms themselves. And will not the
King then in point of conscience part with the Bishops Lands for
our present Peace, when he shall know or be truly informed of all

more Sacriledge in taking away Bishops Lands in <hi>England</hi> then
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or Abbey Lands heretofore from Abbeys and Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
I cannot yet discerne. All which considered, I hope his
Majesties conscience may and will be rectified in this particular,
before the Treaty be absolutely confirmed by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so as this of Bishops Lands shall make no breach between us:
In clearing which, I have beene the more prolix, because it is
most insisted on of any thing, in point of dis-satisfaction, both by
the King and us.</p>
            <p>As for all our other Propositions, relating to the Peace and
settlement of the Church, the King hath fully assented to them
<hi>interminis:</hi> as namely, <hi>to the Bill for the better advancement of
the preaching of Gods word, and setting godly Ministers in all parts
of the Kingdome: To a Bill against Pluralities, and Non residen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
To an Act of Confirmation for the calling and setling of the
Assembly of Divines: To an Act for the confirmation of the Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and abolishing the Booke of Common-Prayer throughout the
Kingdome, and in the Kings owne Chappell too</hi> (yeelded unto in
the Kings finall answer, though formerly stuck upon;) to <hi>an Act
for taking the covenant throughout the Realme,</hi> only the King sticks
at it (as yet unsatisfied in conscience) as to the taking of it himselfe
without some qualifications in it, which a Committee were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106039:42"/>
to consider of, but have not yet reported ought to the
House. Besides, he hath approved the lesser Catechism as far as you
desired, who rest satisfied with his answer concerning it: And as for
the <hi>Presbyteriall Government,</hi> he hath absolutely consented to settle it
for three years.</p>
            <p>But it hath been much insisted on by many,<note place="margin">Object.</note> That the Kings Grant
of the Presbyterian Government is no wayes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> satisfactory, because
only for three years; And therefore they will break off the Treaty
for this reason, and vote the Kings answers upon the whole unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
because too short in this particular.</p>
            <p>To which I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> That the King <hi>in terminis</hi> hath granted as
much as we desired. We desired its settlement but for three years,
and many who most pretend dissatisfaction in this point now did,
and do indeed desire no setled Government at all, no not for three
years space: Therefore if there be any default in this, it was in the
Houses Proposition only, not in the Kings answer, who was not
obliged to grant us in this particular, or any other, more than we
desired. Secondly, after the three years expiration the Presbyterian
Government must remain till a new be agreed upon by consent of
the King and both Houses, upon conference and advice with the
Assembly of Divines, or that further established if found best and
most sutable in the <hi>interim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So as now upon all the branches of this Treaty, and the Kings
answers thereunto, I conceive the Kings answers to be compleatly
satisfactory in that sense I have stated and debated the question, as
well for the safety and settlement of our Church and Religion as
Kingdom; though the Kings Answers come not up fully to the
Propositions in some two or three particulars only.</p>

We have demanded of the King in our own and the Kingdomes
behalf in former Treaties, but a penny in comparison, and then
the King refused to grant it, though we would have been heartily
contented with it, or lesse: But now we have in this Treatty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a <hi>Talent,</hi> and the King hath not thought it overmuch for
him to grant, or for us to receive, and if we shall now ungratefully
reject it, we know not why our selves, unlesse it be that God hath
infatuated, and designed us unto speedy ruine for our sins; I must

I pray God they be not so far hid, that we shall never live to see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
peace or settlement at all in Church or State, if we embrace not
those Concessions now; the best, the largest, the honourablest, the
safest, and most beneficiall that ever was tendred to any People by
a King; and if we now reject, we shall never have the moity of them
granted us again, no though <hi>we soek them carefully with tears,</hi> as
<hi>Esau</hi> did his last blessing, when he had overslipt his time but a very

            <p>For mine own part, I value no mens bare opinions in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
but their reasons which inforce them; and if I have not
quite lost my reason and senses too, I have not heard one solid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
given by any Gentleman that differs from me, why the Kings
Concessions upon the whole <hi>Treaty</hi> should be so unsatisfactory as
utterly to reject them, and proceed no further. Most of the reasons
to the contrary have been either cleer mistakes, both of the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Kings Answers, or our Propositions; (and mistakes are no
reasons, but irrationall;) or a fear in some Purchasers of Bishops
Lands of an ill bargain, which I presume I have fully satisfied,<note place="margin">Object.</note> or
that which is to me the most unreasonable (though many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
chief and only reason) the Armies discontent and dissatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
in case we vote it satisfactory: to which I shall give this
Answer:</p>

unreasonable extravagant demands, (who are but ours and the

I have observed a dangerous practice in some <hi>Officers and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
only of the Army, to make use of the whole Armies name,
(without their privity or consents) forcibly to drive on their
own private <hi>pernicious Designs</hi> in the House, and to fright and
cudgell us into Votes (as some say we were <hi>cudgelled</hi> into a

them, contrary to our expresse commands (as heretofore
and now they have done) to force us to Vote against our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
consciences, reason, and the publique safety, what ever they
shall dictate, be it never so absurd, dishonorable to our selves, or
destructive to the Kingdom; and though the Army, and those
who usurp their name be not present at our debates (as they sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
are, though some of them are Members) yet if they suit not
with their foreplotted Designs, they will presently censure them
and those that passe them, without hearing or weighing of their
reasons: And though they contend most earnestly for <hi>Libertie of

from the House; especially in this instant debate, for the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106039:44"/>
               <hi>settlement of our Peacè,</hi> to which those <hi>who make a Trade of War,</hi> will
certainly be most averse, having little else to live on, or support
their present greatnesse, if the wars be ended.</p>
            <p>Yea, but they further object,<note place="margin">Object.</note> That if we discontent the Army by
voting the Answers satisfactory, we are undone, they will all lay
down their Arme (as one Commander of eminency hath here open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told you he must do) and serve us no longer, and then what will
become of us, and all our faithfull friends?</p>
            <p>I Answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> That I hope the Army will not be so sullen, as to desert
or turn against us, for voting what our consciences and judgments
prompt us, is most for theirs, ours, and the Kingdoms safety; and that
without hearing or scanning our debates: If they be, I shall not
much value the protection of such unconstant, mutinous, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
servants; and I doubt not but if they desert us on so
sleight a ground, God himselfe and the whole Kingdome will
stand by us who else I fear will both unanimously rise up against
us, to ours, and the Armies destruction: And if the King and we
shall happily close upon this Treaty, I hope we shall have no great
need of their future service. However, <hi>fiat justitia, ruat coelum,</hi> Let us
do our duty, and leave the issue to God. It is better for us to perish
doing our own duties, then to be justly destroyed by following o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens wills against our duties and consciences too. He that
thinks to save himself or the Kingdom, by such a sinful and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
compliance, shall be certain to lose both himself and it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
            <p>However, both the Arguments of <hi>displeasing</hi> the Army, and the <hi>ill
consequents</hi> of it, are altogether extraneous and impertinent to the
question, and amount but to this <hi>Non sequitur.</hi> The Army will not
have us proceed further upon the Treaty to settle peace; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the
Kings Answers are unsatisfactory. What will all wise men, what
will the Kingdom, what will <hi>Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and our friends abroad
(whose eyes are all intent upon the result of the Treaty, and must
be satisfied in the reasons of our breach upon it lest they all fall
foul upon us) think of such absurd Nonsense as this? Had the Treaty
been only between the King and the Army, not him and the Houses,
this reason might have contented some men; without expressing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
grounds of their dissatisfaction (of which they think the Army
more competent Judges then the Parliament:) but the Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only between the King and both Houses, not the Army; that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106039:44"/>
we who are the only Parties to the Treaty, and Judges of the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorinesse
thereof, should set aside our own reasons, consciences,
judgements, and make the Armies absolute peremptory will, the
only principall reason of our <hi>dissatisfactorinesse</hi> with the Kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
(which I am confident not ten men in the Army ever heard
of, but by report alone and never seriously scanned, as we have
done) is such an absurdity, as will render us for ever both ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousand
odious to all our <hi>friends and foes,</hi> to present, to future Ages.
For shame therefore let us no more insist upon such <hi>extravagancies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having answered these two <hi>Iron Arguments,</hi> against the unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorinesse
of the Kings Answers, and all others hitherto insisted
on: I humbly conceive, I have fully satisfied every rationall mans
conscience, that the King hath granted us all we have demanded,
that is really necessary or conducing to the speedy settlement of a
lasting and well-grounded Peace, and the future security of our
State, Kingdom, Church, Religion, against all feared dangers from
the King or any others; and I shall challenge and put it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of any Gentleman dissenting from me, whether he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
any one thing more (except an Oath which is intended when
all is concluded) essentiall, for the fuller and firmer setling of our
Laws, Liberties, Priviledges, Lives, Estates, Religion, Kingdoms, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
Army, and satisfying of all publike interests, then what
have been already propounded and the King compleatly granted
in this Treaty: If then the King hath granted us every thing, our
selves during seven years advice and consultation could possibly
think of for our security and settlement, far more then we our selves
demanded in two or three former Treaties, and would have bin glad
with the moity of it within these few months, &amp; ten thousand times
more then we can gain by a breach with the King upon such disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;
why should we not all rest thankfully contented, and
blesse our God, that he hath at last inclined the Kings heart to grant
so much, whereas heretofore he refused to condescend to the tithe
of that he hath granted now<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Doubtlesse we can never answer such
a peevish absurd ingratitude either to God or men, and those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Cities, and Buroughs, who sent us hither in their steads, will
conne us little thanks, for refusing Peace, upon such honorable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
and safe Concessions, as neither they nor we can ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
hope for, if rejected now; upon no grounds of reason, but
peevishnesse and will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:106039:45"/>
If any object<note place="margin">Object.</note> (as some have done) that the King indeed hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all we can desire; yet he is so perfidious in his Oaths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
(as we have found by sad experience, in all his Reign) that we
cannot trust him; and therefore all he hath granted, is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> That if all he hath granted were still in his own
power to dissolve or recall at pleasure, this Argument were mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall:
But since he hath put all our desired security in our hands
alone, and such as our selves shall appoint, and left nothing unto
his sole or joint disposall with us, the objection is but weak,
and recoils upon our selves, that we dare not trust our selves with
our safety. It a Sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k come to borrow some money of a Usurer,
whose word and hand he dares not take; yet if he give him a Pawn
or Morgage of his Lands in hand, he will then trust him without
any scruple: The King hath given such a sufficient Pawn, Morgage,
and put it into our own hand, therefore we need not doubt him
now.</p>
            <p>Besides, if we cannot trust him for what he hath granted, it was a
mockery of him and the Kingdome to treat with him to grant it:
and if so, the Kingdom will say, they have little cause hereafter to
trust us for such palpable dissimulation, as the King. For my part,
I have seen so much experience in the world, that I dare trust none
with my own or the Kingdoms safety, but God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in men of all sorts since our troubles, that we cannot trust
neither the King, nor Prince, City nor Countrey, this Generall,
nor that Generall; this Army, nor those that were before it, nor
yet our selves who are jealous one of another, trecherous one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
distrustfull of all; and now distrusted by all, ever since we

               <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> and by some who have spoken in

are and will be void, because made by duresse of imprisonment whiles under
restraint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> That the King during all this Treaty hath been in
such a condition of honour, freedom, and safety, and had such
free liberty of consultation and debate upon his own earnest desire
and his parties too, as well as the Houses; that he can neither with
honour nor justice avoid those. Concessions by any pretext of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse;
especially since he hath denyed some things, and had the same
liberty not to have granted other things, had he been pleased not
to grant them. Besides, the King is to confirm the whole Treaty
by Acts of Parliament, to which he is to give his Royall assent
(and Oath too) when all is concluded, and that in a free condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
&amp; then no Duresse can avoid them, nor more then <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
it self first gained by the sword, and oft confirmed in Parliament
by our Kings against their wills. In the year of our Lord 1222
<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Paris, <hi>p.</hi> 305. Speed, <hi>p.</hi> 597.</note> 
               <hi>The Barons demanding of King</hi> Henry <hi>the third, the confirmation of the
great Charter, and their Liberties according to his Oath upon the conclusion
of the Peace with</hi> Lewis <hi>of France:</hi> William Brewer <hi>one of his (evill)
Councell, answered; That the Liberties they demanded were not to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

growing between the</hi> Barons, the Archbishop of Canterbury, <hi>and</hi>
Brewer; <hi>the King closed up the strife with this honourable Answer: All of us
have sworn to these Liberties, and that which we have assented and sworn to,
ALL OF VS ARE BOVND TO OBSERVE.</hi> We to this day injoy
these Liberties, being confirmed by Act of Parliament, and sworn
to by our Kings, though forcibly extorted at the first. And so
may we much more enjoy the Kings Concessions when turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Acts, and sealed with a sacred Oath, superadded to a Royall
assent.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I have now waded through the whole <hi>Treaty,</hi> and
given you the best reasons I can out of every parcell of it to prove
the satisfactorinesse of the Kings Answers, and answered all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
hitherto made against my conclusion, I shall now, by your
patience and leave, proceed a step or two further, to evidence by
cleer demonstrations and reasons to your consciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:106039:46"/>
First, that our closing with the King upon these Concessions, is
the only, the speediest, best, loyallest, safest and certainest way to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a firm and lasting Peace, between the King, Parliament, and his
three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the new way to Peace and settlement proposed
and prosecuted by the Generall, the Officers of the Army, and
their friends in the House, is a most desperate, dishonourable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
course, and certain way to speedy ruine, both of our King,
Parliaments, Army, City, Country, and three Kingdomes too; yea,
a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eer project of the Jesuites, to destroy the King, dissolve this
present, and all future Parliaments, betray <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Popish
Rebels, subvert our Religion, Reformation, Laws, Liberties, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
introduce Popery, Tyranny, slavery, and makes us a prey to
our forreign Enemies: and if I make this clearly appear to all your
consciences and reasons, I beseech you lay all your hands upon
your hearts, and consider what you vote in this debate, lest you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
instrumentall to the Jesuits, &amp; accomplish these their designs,
in stead of setling a safe and well grounded Peace upon their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled
foundations of liberty and safety, but indeed of slavery and
ruine.</p>
            <p>To begin with the first branch of the first of these assertions;
That our closing with the King upon these Concessions, is the
only way to settle a firm and lasting Peace between the King, the
Parliament, and his three Kingdoms. Not to insist upon this
generall; that <hi>Treaties</hi> in all Ages have been the usuall and only
way to conclude and settle Peace and Unity between Kings and
their People, and all dissenting Kingdomes, States, Persons, and
therefore this <hi>Treaty</hi> now is the only way to our pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sent Peace and
settlement: I shall pitch only upon particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, that your selves in this House, and the Lords in their
House, have severally and joyntly voted and resolved over and
over heretofore, and published to all the world from time to time
in sundry Declarations, Remonstrances, and other printed Papers
since the Kings departure from the Houses, and the late Warres:</hi>

unwearied endeavour to settle a speedy, firm and well grounded Peace between
His Majesty, his People, and three Kingdomes; and that this hath been the
only end they have aymed at in all their Warres and Treaties with the King.

great necessity and importance towards the removall of our Distractions,
Feares, Iealousies, the happy beginning of contentment betweene the KING
and His People, and the settlement and preservation of the Peace and
Safety of the Kingdome, and KINGS Person. That they thought they had
not discharged their duties untill they had declared and backed it with
some Reasons. That those persons who advised His MAIESTY to absent
Himselfe from His Parliament, are an Obstruction, and Enemies to the Peace
of this Kingdome, and justly suspected to be favourers to the <hi>Rebellion
in Ireland.</hi>

the KING, and a good close with Him and His Commissioners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
is the only way to settle a firme, safe, and lasting Peace. And this is
the only way and meanes you have hitherto pursued to obtaine such a Peace and
settlement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Parliament of Scotland</hi> and their Commissioners
here imployed, have voted and resolved this, the onely way and
meanes to such a<note n="*" place="margin">A Coll. p. 900.</note> Peace and Settlement, both for this kingdom,
and their own too, and have joyned with us in all former Treaties,
and promoted this.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the generality of the People, and all the wisest and
most cordiall to the Publique Interest both of the Parliament
and kingdome, have approved and desired a Treaty and close
with the KING, as the onely meanes of Peace and settlement,
as is evident, by their frequent and multiplyed Petitions to both
Houses.</p>
            <p>

with the miseries of War, have desired and embraced a Treaty, as the only means
to close our bleeding wounds, and make a firme Vnion betweene the King, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the Generall, Officers, and Councell of the Army them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
when in their right senses, and not intoxicated with selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit
and Iesuiticall Principles, have Publikely declared, that
compliance by a Treaty with the KING, and restitution of Him
to a condition of Honour, Freedome, and Safety, was the only
way to a lasting Peace and settlement; yea, the Grandees of the

I hope our Treaty shall be reall, and not in their power to

how justifiable and advantagious to the kingdom our closing with
the King upon these Propositions, are before all the world, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to take notice of these following passages in their own Letters,
Declarations, and Remonstrances: made upon mature advice a year
before this Treaty.</p>
            <p>

suggestions of that sort, are most false, scandalous &amp; absolutely
contrary not only to our declared desires, but also to our principls,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106039:47"/>
which are most clearly, for a generall Right and just freedom to all.
And therefore, upon this occasion, we cannot but declare particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,

security of the same for the future) And we do further clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
we do not see how there can be any peace to the kingdom firm

            <p>In a Letter of St. <hi>T. Fairfax</hi> to both <hi>Houses of Parliament,</hi> giving an

from <hi>Redding</hi> July 6. 1647. there is this passage [which he there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares

                  </gap>ness,
and afford all kind usage to his Majesties person, in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
with the peace and safety of the kingdom, is the most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
honorable, and prudent way: and in all things we think, that
tender, equitable and moderate dealing, both toward his Majesty and
his Royal family, and late party, so far as may stand with the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the kingdom, and security to our common rights &amp; liberties,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
is the most hopefull course to take away the seeds of war, or future
seeds amongst us, for posterity; and to procure a lasting peace and
a government, in this distracted Nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Since this: the</hi> Officers and Army <hi>in their proposals</hi> 1 Aug. 1647.
<hi>for the settlement of a firm peace: have this for one,</hi> That His Majesties
person,<note place="margin">Note.</note> Queene and Royall issue, may be restored to a condition of safety, honor,
and freedome in this Nation, without diminution of their personall Rights,
or further limitation to the exercise of the regall power, then according to the
particulars aforegoing.</p>
            <p>These proposals of the Army, were so pleasing to His Majesty, that
in his answer to the propositions presented to him at <hi>Hampton Court</hi>
the 7 of Septemb. 1647. by the Commissioners of both Houses and
of the kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he refused to grant the Propositions by
them tendred, as being destructive to many principall interests of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106039:48"/>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">Army, and of all those whose affections concurred with them.</hi> And
he gave this further answer to them. <q>That his Majesty having seen
the proposals of the Army to the Commissioners from his 2 Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
residing with them, and with them to be treated in order to the
clearing and securing the Rights &amp; liberties of the kingdom, as to
the settling of a just &amp; lasting peace. To which proposals, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
his two Houses not to be strangers, so he beleeves they will
think with him, that theymore conduce to the satisfaction of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
&amp; may be a fitter foundation for a lasting peace then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
which at this time are tendred to him. He therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
(as the best way in his judgement in order to peace) that his
two Houses would instantly take into consideration those propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
upon which there may be a personal Treaty with his Majesty,
&amp; such other proposals as his Majesty shall make, hoping that the
said proposals may be so moderated in the said Treaty, as to render
them the more capable of his Majesties full concessions, wherein he
resolves to give ful satisfaction to his people, for whatsoever shall
concern the settling of the Protestant profession, with liberty to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
consciences &amp; the securing of the laws, liberties, and properties
of all his subjects, and the just priviledges of Parliament for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
&amp;c.</q> In which Treaty, his Majesty will be pleased (if it be
thought sit) that Commissioners from the Army, whose the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
are, may likewise be admitted.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oe, here we have the <hi>General, Officers,</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> it self so zealous
of a personal Treaty with the King, for settlement of this kingdoms
peace, and the carrying on of their owne interests, that themselves
draw up proposals for a Treaty with him, without the Houses pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:
yea, prevail<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyy</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> with him to lay aside the Houses Propositions to
treat upon theirs, as more advantagious to him and his, and less be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
to the kingdoms interest.</p>
            <p>In which <hi>Treaty</hi> he desires, that Commissioners from the Army
(whose the proposals were) might likewise be admitted: &amp; yet these
Zealots for a Treaty then, are most furious to break off our Treaty
now, even by open force and violence, almost upon the very close,
though they never made any opposition against it during<note n="*" place="margin">From July 30. till Nov: 20.</note> all its
Agitation; perchance to bring on another <hi>Treaty</hi> with the King upon
their own <hi>proposals;</hi> wherein the King and they will be the only <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,</hi>
and the Houses but idle Spectators, to rob them of the honor
and benefit expected by our present <hi>Treaty</hi> and of settling of the
kingdoms peace, on so good terms for the publike interest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:106039:48"/>
In fine, the <hi>Generall</hi> and <hi>Army under his command,</hi> in their <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,</hi>
of the 18 of <hi>August,</hi> 1647. [approved and printed by <hi>Order of
the House of Peers,</hi>] p. 14. do thus expresse their readinesse and desire for
the Parliaments closing with the King, upon good grounds, and his
bringing up to LONDON [though now they cry out for nothing bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <q>Justice and execution to be done upon him, as their capital Enemy;]
For our parts, we shall rejoice as much as any, to see the King brought
back to his Parliament, [and that] not so much in place, as in affection
and agreement, on such found terms and grounds as may render both
him, and the kingdom safe, quiet, and happy. And shall be as ready
as they to bring his Majesty to LONDON, when his being there may
be likely to produce (not greater disturbances or distractions, but) a
peace indeed, and that such, as may not [with the Shipwrack of the
publike interest] be shaped and moulded only to the private advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of a particular party or faction, but bottom'd chiefly on grounds
of common and publike welfare and security.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The General, Officers and Army therefore, being so zealous for a
Treaty and close with the King, in all these severall <hi>Remonstrances,
Papers,</hi> and <hi>Proposalls,</hi> as the only hopefull way of settling and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the kingdoms peace, cannot without the highest injury, and most
detestable jugling, Hypocrisie, and Apostasie from their own ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
&amp; principles (wherewith they do now falsly charge the House)
dislike our present proceedings in the selt same way, upon his Majesties
Concessions in this Treaty; which by all these particular resolutions,
and the Armies own acknowledgments, is the only way of Peace and
settlement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As it is the only, so the speediest way of all other: if we
now accept of these Concessions, (the most whereof I have turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Bils already, and shall turn all the rest into Bils by our next sitting)
I see no reason but we may in one fortnight, at least by the first of <hi>Ian.</hi>
next, have fully settled and concluded all things in difference between
the King and us, to the general content and safety of all honest men:
and so end the old and begin the new year with peace. Whereas if we
now break off and let go all the King hath granted, I see no end of
our Wars and miseries, nor any probable means of peace and settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in many years at least, if ever in this or the succeeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And the speediest remedy in this case (especially considering the
kingdom is so far exhausted, that we know neither how to pay our
publike debts, our Fleet, or Army their present Arrears, much lesse
their future) must needs bee the best, and be preferred before all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106039:49"/>
others that will require more time, and expence, and be more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
and contingent in the event.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As it is the speediest: so the best, and legallest, safest and
certainest way of all others.</p>
            <p>First, there is no danger nor hazard at all in it, nor any expence of
mony or effusion of bloud: 'tis but accept, and then confirm by Acts
and Oaths, and the work is presently done: If we think of settlement
in any other way, we must fight again, and that will be both costly &amp;
hazardous: and when all is done, we must Treat again, perchance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
worse terms, else there will be no peace nor settlement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This is the way we have ever formerly pitched upon, the
way all parties have consented to and approved, but those alone
who desire neither peace nor settlement: Therefore best, safest, and
durablest.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is the legallest, certainest, because a peace and settlement
by Acts of Parliament the highest security to English men under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to which King, Lord, Commons, &amp; in them the whole kingdom
consent, &amp; wil all acquiesce in what is done, without question or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
dispute: What peace soever is settled otherwise, either by a bare
Order or Ordinance of the Houses, or by the Sword &amp; power alone:
will neither be sure, safe, nor lasting, no longer then maintained by
the Sword, &amp; every man will be sure to question and unsettle all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
upon the least advantage given. The highest security that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ever had, was <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Charter of the Forrest: these
were gained by the Sword, but not held by it.</p>
            <p>That which hath kept &amp; perpetuated these since their making was
those Acts of Parliament which confirmed them, These are only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for what ever we enjoy, which will survive all other we can
think of, <hi>Nullum violentum est diuturnum:</hi> Whereas priviledges kept and
held by publike Acts will last for ever, and be entailed to us and our
posterities, with peace and happiness attending them. This was the
way of settling peace between Kings and Subjects heretofore in <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the 3. <hi>Edward</hi> the 2. <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. Raigns, and an Act
of <hi>Pacification</hi> and <hi>Oblivion</hi> was the only safe and usuall way the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> lately fixed on, to settle a firm
and lasting peace between both Nations, kingdoms. All other set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements
will be but like an ul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r skinned over, which will soone
break out again, with greater pain and danger then before.</p>
            <p>2dly, For the new way proposed by the Army, for a firm peace &amp;
settlement, it is certainly the most desperate, dishonourable, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106039:49"/>
and destructive that can possibly be imagined, and such as we can
neither in honour, justice, conscience nor prudence imbrace. To exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it a little by parts:</p>
            <p>The first way to peace and settlement propounded by them, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to break off the Treaty: and that, contrary to our publike faith
to the King and kingdom, yea, to our own votes, before the Treaty
was fully ended: this is the drift of their whole <hi>Remonstrance.</hi> Which
as it will totally, if not finally deprive us of the fruit &amp; benefit of all
the K. Concessions in the Treaty, [all which are by mutuall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
no wayes obligatory to either party in any particular unless
all be agreed] being all that we can possibly think of for our safety
and advantage, and more then any Nation under heaven yet injoied,
so it wil inevitably cast us upon present wayes of new distractions,
confusions and civill wars, now we are quite exhausted, and end at
last in our absolute destruction, instead of a wel-grounded peace, and
those blessings we may forth with enjoy for the very accepting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further charge or trouble. But if God, beyond our hopes, should
after any new embroylments give us peace, yet it must be upon a new
Treaty, and that perchance upon far worse terms then now are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
Therefore it must needs be dangerous to reject a safe way, to
follow a hazardous or destructive one.</p>
            <p>The next thing proposed by them for a speedy peace and settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is the bringing of the<note n="*" place="margin">Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance p. 60. to 64.</note> King to speedy justice for all his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and bloodshed in the late wars, and then to depose and execute
him as the greatest capitall malefactor in the kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>This certainly is a very dangerous aund unlikely way to peace and
settlement, First of all,<note n="*" place="margin">Zech. 13. 7. 1 King. 22. 17.</note> 
               <hi>The smiting of the Shepheard, is the way to scatter,
not unite the sheep.</hi> The slaying of the King or Generall in the field,
<note n="*" place="margin">Zech. 13. 7. 1 King. 22. 17.</note> scatters and <hi>dissolves</hi> the <hi>Army, not secures them.</hi> To cut off an aking
head, is the next way to destroy, not cure a diseased body: such kind
of State policy may destroy, or disturb, but never settle us in perfect
peace: The Prince, his next heir, the Queen, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> all his
Children, and Allies both at home and abroad, will certainly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
revenge, and all Kings in Christendom will assist them, even for
their own interest and safety, lest it should become a president for
themselves. And will this then secure or be a likely way to peace
or settlement?</p>
            <p>2. The greatest part of the Members in both Houses, the
Lords, Gentlemen, and all sorts of people throughout the
kingdome, the whole kingdomes of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> (who
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106039:50"/>
have as great an interest in the Kings person being their lawfull
King, as we have, and are obliged by Allegiance and Covenant to
protect his person and Crown from violence) will unanimously, as
one man oppose and protest against it, and by force of Arms, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to bring those to execution who shall presume to advise, or
attempt to depose or destroy the King in any kinde, contrary to
their Allegiance and solemne Covenant: Yea all Protestant Realms,
Churches, States in forraign parts will abhorre both the fact, and
adjudge it contrary to their principles and Religion, and that
which may irritate Popish Kings and Princes to take up arms to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
them, lest they should fall into the like Jesuiticall practice. And
can this be a safe or speedy way to peace and settlement, especially
when we know not what Government shall succeed upon it, and
can expect nothing but bloody consequences from such a bloody
Jesuiticall advice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, I never read of any peace or settlement in any kingdom,
where</hi> King-killing <hi>was practised or approved. When the</hi> Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<hi>began once to kill their Emperours, and cut off their heads,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius</hi> and <hi>Grimstones</hi> Imperiall History.</note> they were scarce ever free from civill warres. One Army set up one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
another Army another, the Senate a third, who alwayes <hi>warred</hi> till they
had cut off one anothers heads. Most of those Emperours had very short reigns,
few of them above a year or two, and some of them scarce two months, but most
of them untimely deaths. <hi>In</hi> Sclavonia <hi>and</hi> Norway, <hi>where they had a Law,</hi>
that he that slew a Tyrant King, should suceed him in the Throne: <hi>They had
almost every</hi> year a new King, perpetuall wars and discords, and not one of all
their Kings for above one hundred years together ever came to a natural death,
<hi>but was murthered as a Tyrant, and succeeded by a worse and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tyrant: as</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Danicae <hi>Histor.</hi> l. 8. p. 120.</note> Saxo grammaticus <hi>and</hi> Nubrigensis testifie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the sacred story it selfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">* Rerum Anglica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum l. 3. c. 6. 2 Chron. 5. 5, 6. 2 Kings c. 1. to cap. 25.</note> 
               <hi>it is very observable, that after</hi> the
ten Tribes revolted from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> though by Gods Iustice and approbation
for <hi>Solomons</hi> sinnes; they had never any peace or settlement, but perpetuall
Wars with one Kingdome or another, or between themselves; Their Kings, or
most of them were all Tyrants and Idolaters, and by the just hand of God, for
the most part tumultuously slaine and murthered one of and by another, who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
them: he that murthered his Predecessor, being usually slain by his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
or his Predecessors Sons, Servants, or by the People of the Land, in a
tumltuous way: <hi>In the</hi> 2 Kings 15. We read in that one Chapter of no lesse
then 4 of those Kings slain one by another: <hi>and as for the</hi> people under these
Kings they had never any rest, peace, settlement, or freedome, but lived under
the greatest misery and oppression that ever any <hi>Subjects under Heaven did,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106039:50"/>
as the sacred History records. This King-killing certainly can be then
no probable way at all to peace, safety, settlement, freedome, but the
Jesuits pollicy to deprive us eternally of all these, and of God, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to boot; as it did the ten</hi> Tribes <hi>heretofore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly this way to peace and settlement, is directly contrary to

peace in all the three Kingdomes; to preserve the <hi>Person</hi> and

and invasion as is now suggested by the Army; which all three of them
engage us, and all three Kingdoms, with our lives and fortunes
really and constantly to oppose, against all lets and impediments, &amp;c.
and to bring those to condigne punishment as Incendiaries and evill
Instruments who suggest it. So as if the Army will proceed in this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suiticall
destructive way, of Treason and ruine; Wee, and all three
Kingdoms are solemnly engaged with our estates and lives unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
to oppose and bring them to Justice. And is this then the way
to publike peace and settlement, to raise another new War to murther
one another in this new Quarrell, wherein the Army and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
must be the sole Malignants and enemies we must fight with, &amp;c?
No verily, but the high-way to the Kingdoms &amp; Armies ruine, whose
Commissions wee are obliged to revoke; whose Contributions wee
must in conscience withdraw; and whose power wee must with our
own lives resist, unlesse we will be perjured, and guilty of breach of
Covenant in the highest degree, if they persist in these anti-Covenant
Demands.</p>
            <p>7. Both Houses having held a Personall Treaty with the King so
lately, and he having granted us in that Treaty whatsoever we have or
can demand for the safety and preservation of our Religion, Laws,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106039:52"/>

Honour, and Safety, according to the Lawes of the Realm</hi> (which
was the <hi>Armies</hi> own proposals in his behalfe in <hi>August,</hi> 1647.) Wee
can neither in honesty, honour, justice nor conscience (were hee ten
thousand times worse then the Army would render him) depose and
bring him to execution. It being against all the rules of Justice, and
honour between two professed enemies, who had no relations one
to another; much more between King and Subjects in a civil War,
and a thing without president in any ages. To this the<note n="*" place="margin">P. 61, 62.</note> 
               <hi>Army Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance</hi>
answers, That <hi>this would be thought an unreasonable and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
demand in a personall Treaty, between persons standing both
free, and in equall ballance of power; but not when one party is wholly
subdued, captivated, imprisoned, and in the others power.</hi> But this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is a difference spun with a Jesuiticall thred; For to treat with
any King in our power, or out of it, on articles of Peace, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these terms; That if he consent to them, We will restore him to
his Throne with Honor, Freedom, Safety; and when he hath yeelded
us our Demands, then to depose and out off his head, is the highest
breach of Faith, Truth, Honor, and Justice, that can be imagined:
and those who dare justifie such perfidious and unchristian dealing
deserve rather the stile of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>equivocating Iesuites,</hi> then <hi>pious
Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. There is no president in Scripture, that the Generall Assembly,
or Sanhed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in of the Jews or Isrealites, did ever judicially imprison,
depose or execute any one of the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> or <hi>Israel,</hi> though
many of them were the grossest Idolaters, and wickedest Princes
under heaven; who shed much innocent blood, and oppressed the
people sundry waies. We know that <hi>David</hi> himselfe committed
adultery with <hi>Vriah</hi> his wife, a faithfull Servant and Souldier, whiles
he was with his Generall <hi>Ioab</hi> in the field: and then afterward cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to be treachero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sly slain. Yet neither the Assembly of the
Elders, nor <hi>Ioab</hi> and the Army under him, did impeach or crave
Justice against him for these sins, though hee lived impeniently in
them. And when hee numbred the people afterwards, for which
sin seventy thousand of his Subjects lost their lives; yet was hee not
arraigned nor deposed for it: and God who is Soveraignly just,
though <hi>David</hi> was the principall malefactor in this case, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not the

cryed out; <hi>Lo, I have sinned and done wickedly; but these Sheep, what
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106039:53"/>
have they done? Let thy hand bee against mee and my Fathers house:</hi>
Yet God spared him and his houshold, though the principalls, and
punished the people only with death, for this sin of his. After him
<hi>Solomon</hi> his son, a man eminent for wisdome and piety at first, apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized
to most grosse Idolatry of all sorts, to please his idolatrous
Wives, and became a great oppressor of his people, making their
burthens very heavy; yet his Subjects or Souldiers did neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
nor depose him for it;<note place="margin">1 Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g. 11 &amp; 12.</note> and though he were the principall
offendor, yet God spared him for <hi>Davids</hi> sake, in not taking the
ten Tribes from him for these sins, during his life; though he rent
them from his son <hi>Rhehoboam,</hi> who was at most but accessory, for his
Fathers sins, not his. True it is, some of the Idolatrous Kings of
Israel, by the just avenging hand of God were slain by private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies,
and popular tumults, in an illegall way; but not deposed
nor arraigned by their Sanhedrins, or Generall Congregations; and
those who slew them, <hi>were sometimes</hi> stain by others <hi>who aspired to the
Crown, or by the people of the Land, or by their children who succeeded
them;</hi> and came to untimely tragicall ends.</p>
            <p>9. Though there be some Presidents of Popish States and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
deposing their Popish Kings and Emperors at home, and in
forraign parts, in an extraordinary way, by power of an armed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Yet there is no president of any one Protestant Kingdom or State,
that did ever yet judicially depose or bring to execution, any of their
Kings and Princes, though never so bad, whether Protestants or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists;
and the Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> though some of their Kings,
when they had invested them in their Thrones, became Apostates to
Popery and persecuters of their people; albeit they resisted them
by force of arms in the field to preserve their lives; did never once
attempt to pull them from their Thrones, or bring their persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Justice: And I hope our Protestant Parliament will never make
the first president in this kind, nor stain their Honor or Religion with
the blood of a Protestant King, against so many Oathes, Protestations,
Covenants, Declarations, and Remonstrances made and published
by them to the contrary.</p>
            <p>10. For the presidents of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
in times of Popery, they were rather forcible resignations by
power of an Army, then judiciall deprivations, neither of them
being ever legally arraigned and brought to tryall in Parliament.
And <hi>Mortimer</hi> who had the chief hand in deposing King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Second, in the Parliament of 1 E. 3. was in the Parliament of 4 E. 3.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106039:53"/>
impeached, condemned, and executed as a Traitor, and guilty of high
Treason, for murthering <hi>Edward</hi> the second after he was deposed, at
<hi>Berkley-castle,</hi> and Sir <hi>Simon Bereford,</hi> (together with <hi>Thomas Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
and <hi>William Ocle</hi>) were adjudged Traitors for assisting him
therein; one of them executed, and great rewards promised to the
apprehenders of the other two. And as for <hi>Richard</hi> the second
though he was deposed after <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was crowned by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in Parliament; yet this deposition after his resignation only, not
before it: and without any formall tryall or arraignment, or any
capitall judgement of death against him; for which I find no
president in any Parliament of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> nor yet in
<hi>Denmark</hi> it self, though an elective Kingdome; who, though they justly
deposed <hi>Christiern</hi> the second, for his most abominable Tyrannies
and Cruelties, yet they never adjudged, or p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t him to death, but only
restrained him as a prisoner. I shall only add this, that though the
elective Kingdoms of <hi>Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi>
have in their Parliaments and Diets deposed sundry of their Kings for
their wickednesses and tyranny yet they never judicially <hi>condemned any
one of them to death,</hi> though Papists, And for a <hi>Protestant Parliament</hi> (to
please an Army only, acted by Jesuites in this particular; to render
both Parliament, Army, and our Religion too for ever execrable
throughout the world; and set all mens pens and hands against them
to their ruine) to begin such a bloody president as this, upon a most
false pretext, of setling peace; contrary to the express command of God
himself; who commands Christians <hi>To pray for Kings, and all in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that they may live a quiet and peaceable life under them in all godlinesse and
honesty,</hi> (not to depose or cut of their heads; as the only way to peace
and settlement; will not only be scandalous but monstrous.</p>
            <p>The next thing they propose for a present peace and settlement;
it the executing of the <hi>Prince if hee come not over upon summons at
a short day, and give not satisfaction to the Houses: or else to declare
him and the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>if they appear not upon summons, to bee
uncapable of any Trust or Government in this Kingdom, or any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
thereunto belonging, and thence to stand exiled for ever as Enemies
and Traitors, to die without mercy, if ever taken or found therein.</hi> A Jesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
inevitable way to civill Wars and ruine. For the King being depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and cut off; the Prince no doubt is next heir to the Crown, both
by the common Law, and the statute of 1. <hi>Iacobi cap.</hi> 1. to which I
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106039:54"/>
doubt a Vote or Ordinance of both Houses only, will be no such le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
barre in any Lawyers or Wisemans Judgement, but that hee will
claim his right; and the generallity of the Kingdome (at least ten
thousand to one proclaim and embrace him for their lawfull King,
and assist him with their lives and fortunes, both to regain and retain
his right, being bound by their Oath of Supremacy and Allegiance,
and their Solemn League and Covenant so to do. And must not this
of necessity beget a present lasting War; in stead of a speedy setled peace?
undoubtedly it will. But consider further, that the Prince is not only
Heir apparent to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> but of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>
too: and though we reject; yet undoubtedly <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>
will readily imbrace him as their lawfull King, notwithstanding any
Votes of ours; and will both unanimously assist him with their lives
and fortunes to recover his right to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> and those
two Kingdoms falling off wholly from us, and proclaiming Warre
against us, and joining with that potent party here, which certainly
will appear in his behalfe, out of a naturall inclination to the right
undoubted Heir, or hopes of favour and preferment <hi>(since Plures solem
orientem quam occidentem adorantur)</hi> and with all his friends and allies
Forces from abroad; whether this wil not be an unavoidable occasion,
not only of a present war, but of certain destructions and desolation
to this poor Kingdome, and more especially to the Army and their
adherents in this desperate advice, (who must stand or fall upon their
own bottome, without the least aid or contribution from any other,)
I desire them, and all others who have either eyes or brains in their
heads most seriously to consider. But that which makes me most of all
detest this desperate advice, is this, That it is the only way that can
be thought upon to accomplish the Popes and Jesuites designs, to set up
Popery, and subvert the Protestant Religion, and professors of it in all
our three Kingdoms, and in all forraign Realms beyond the Seas. For
if this reforming Parliament, which hath pretended so much to the
extirpation of Popery, shall so far play the Popes and Jesuites (the
undoubted contrivers of this <hi>Armys New-model</hi> of our peace and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement)
as to depose and behead the King his father, and forever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit
him of the Crown, &amp; <hi>bring him as a Traitor to die without mercy,
if he come hither:</hi> It wil so far provoke and exasperate him &amp; the Duke,
being both young and of generous spirits, not throughly grounded
in our Religion; and under the Queens tuition, and in the power of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106039:54"/>
this popish party abroad, who will aggravate these high affronts
and injuries put upon them to the utmost, and on whose protection
they will be in this case necessitated to cast themselves; that there
is great fear and probability, they will immediately renounce such
a bloody and detestable Religion, as shall ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igate us to such horrid
actions and Councels, and abominate all the professors of it, so as
totally to abandon them, and turn Roman Catholicks in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest;
and then match themselves to great potent popish Alliances:
and by their purses, forces, and assistance; and of the Popes, and all
his Catholick sonnes in Forraigne parts for the advancement of the
Catholick cause; and of the popish, Malignants, and discontented
parties in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (which will questionlesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and assist the Prince as their Soveraign Lord and King) invade
our poore, impoverished, divided and distressed kingdom with such
a power, as in all humane probability would speedily over-runne
and destroy this mutinous Army, and the Houses too, put them with
their adherents to the Sword, without mercy or quarter, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit
them and their heirs for ever, to revenge their Fathers blood,
and their dis-inherison of the Crown, &amp;c. And then Popery and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
will both return with greater authority, power, &amp; approbation
then ever; over-spread our whole three kingdoms, and extirpate our
Religion, &amp; the professors of it, as the most anti-Monarchical, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
and perfidious bloody Miscreants under heaven; &amp; excite all
other forraign States and kingdoms to do the like to prevent the
springing up of a new generation of treacherous King-killing,
<hi>State-subverting Agitators,</hi> and Hypocritical &amp; perfidious <hi>Army-Saints;</hi>
and engage all Protestant kingdoms, Churches, and States, for their
own security and vindication to disclaim and declare against us.</p>
            <p>This questionlesse will be the sad inevitable issue of this Jesuiticall
advice if ever the Houses or Army shall put it into actuall execution,
and not speedily prevent it; it being long since fore-plotted by the
Jesuites, as I shall prove anon, at the beginning of the late Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Scots.</p>
            <p>But if the Prince and Duke be set aside; I would gladly learn of
these Statists, who, and what King they would set up? Not any of
the Kings posterity certainly, since they dis-inherit two at a blow;
and the blood being corrupted by the Kings and their attainders, no
other heir can inherit it by descent; it must escheat to the Houses or
Armies disposal, and become no kingdom at all but an Elective
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106039:55"/>
one, if any: And is this the next way to peace and settlement? If so,
I have certainly lost my reason and senses too. No, it will be a semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of lasting Wars; of which few elective Kingdoms are long free,
every new election producing commonly a new Warre, where there
is no pretence of an hereditary succession, much more where a right
heir is forcibly and unjustly dis-inherited: I shall give you but one
instance, (though I could name you divers) and that is a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
one at home in our owne kingdom.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the first, having one onely daughter<note n="*" place="margin">Mat: Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Speed, Daniel <hi>in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Maud,</hi> to reserve
the Crown unto her after his death, caused her to be crowned, and
made all the Prelates and Nobles swear to receive her as their Queen
and Princesse after his decease. But she marrying afterwards to the
Emperour; and being out of the Realme when King <hi>Henry</hi> died:
The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> with the rest of the Prelates and
Nobles (contrary to their Oath and agreement) elected <hi>Stephen</hi>
Earle of <hi>Bloyes</hi> for their King, and put by <hi>Maud</hi> the right heir; <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
taking an Oath to grant and confirm those Laws and Liberties
for the kingdoms peace and settlement, as they propounded to him
before his Coronation: A very likely means to settle Peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
as they imagined. But was the event answerable? No ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily;
this cursed perjury and pollicy brought all the chiefe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of it to great calamity and miserable ends; and engendred a
bloody civill Warre in the bowels of this kingdom, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
no lesse then seventeene years together, with interchangeable
successes; till the whole kingdom was laid waste and desolate, most
Houses, Towns, and Villages burned to the ground; their Gardens
and Orchards quite destroyed, their monies and estates exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
and plundered; their Cattle and flocks consumed and eaten up,
their Fields over grown with weeds in stead of Corne, most of the
people devoured by the Sword, Famine and Pestilence, and eleven
hundred Castles, Holds, and Garrisons erected, which were no other
but dens of Theeves and Plunderers. This was the peace and settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
this policy produced. At last both Parties weary of the Wars,
out of pure necessity, came to a Personall Treaty, and in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
made this agreement, That <hi>Stephen having no issue of his body,
should enjoy the Crowne during his life;</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> son and heir to
<hi>Maud,</hi> and next heir also to <hi>Stephen,</hi> should succeed him, after
his death, and in some sort officiate with him in the kingdoms
Govenment during his life. And so these long lasting Warres conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106039:55"/>
after which there were at least eleven hundred Castles demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by order of Parliament crected during these wars, to the
Countreys utter undoing. But if we dis-inherit the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Duke,</hi>
for ought I discern, if they suddainly recover not their possession of
the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> after one seven years of Warre already e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed,
we may have seventeen years more, and seventeen after
that again, and be reduced to a more miserable condition then our
Ancestors were in King <hi>Stephens</hi> dayes: And that upon these two
grounds. First, the contest then, was onely between two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors
for this one kingdom, who had no other kingdoms of their
own to side with them. But the Prince and Duke being successively
heirs as well to the Crowns of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as <hi>England;</hi> will
have their aid and assistance, and of their forraign Friends too, to
carry on the wars, till they have got possession of the Crowne of
<hi>England,</hi> upon better terms then ever they are like to enjoy it, if we
accept of the K. Concessions, which we can never expect from them,
if we depose and kil the King, and dis-inherit &amp; banish them for Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
Secondly, <hi>Stephen</hi> the actuall King then had no issue at all, and
<hi>Henry</hi> was next heir to the Crown, both to <hi>Maud</hi> and him, so as both
Titles meeting in him, the controversie and wars must needs cease.
But if we shall now set up a new King by Election, either of the
Kings line or otherwise; as long as there is either an Elective King,
or hereditary, to exclude this Prince or Duke, or either of their
heirs to whom the inheritance of the Crown belongs of right, we
can neither hope for, nor expect either peace or settlement in this
kingdom, as the bloody and long lived wars between the two
Houses of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York</hi> will inform us, which never ended till
they were both united in King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh.</p>
            <p>The Armies next proposall to settle the kingdoms peace, is as bad
as any of the former; to wit,<note n="*" place="margin">Remon: Nov: 20. 1648. pag: 65, 66, 68, 69, 70</note> 
               <hi>the speedy dissolving of this present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:</hi>
which if not presently consented to, for ought I discerne

the Jesuites raising, to blow down this Parliament, as they would
have blown up that of 3 <hi>Iacobi</hi> with Gun-powder. But is this a way
to safety and settlement, to dissolve the onely visible meanes of
both? If the King, Prince, Duke, Parliament be all dissolved, and
quite laid aside, what meanes or hopes at all of peace, of safety, of
settlement, can any man in his right senses rationally see or imagine?
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106039:56"/>
Is the overturning of the very Foundations and Pillars of our
Church and Kingdom, the best and safest way to settle and preserve
them? Is it not the onely certain way to subvert and ruine them?

of our deplorable &amp; almost desperate condition both at home and
abroad, pertinent to the point in hand.</p>
            <p>We are all weary of a long and costly Warre (and yet God hath so
infatuated many, that though in words they desire, yet in deeds they
reject alwayes of Peace, and cast them out of their hands when put
into them; as if they delighted to have our Warres spun out (like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleck's)</hi>
from <hi>generation to generation.</hi> Wee are unable any longer

you are already brought, and how the true state of your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
stands in relation to your Forces and Friends, both at home and
abroad.</p>
            <p>There are many thousands of <hi>Reformadoes</hi> who have formerly
served you in your Warres, who lie dayly clamouring at your doores
for Arrears, complaining they are ready to starve, and some of them

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106039:57"/>
to raise it; and after many debates upon their generall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
you cannot in diverse months pich upon any probable meanes
to secure their Arreares, amounting (as is conceived) to above two
hundred thousand pounds. The Arreares alledged to be due to the
Army (who now take free quarter, and eat up the Countries where
they lye) amount to above three hundred thousand pounds: and
how to raise money to discharge this debt, or so much as to disband
the supernumeraries, and reduce the Army into their Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
hath put you to a stand for many weeks, and as yet you know
not how to doe it: So as free quarter must still continue to ruine us
on the one hand, and your debts and arrears be dayly multiplied to
undoe us on the other hand. Your Navie is now comming in to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
and your Mariners expect a present considerable Sum, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to many thousands, to pay them off; and you have not yet one
peny in your Treasury to satisfie their arrears, and can pitch upon
no way to raise any present monies but onely by the <hi>Earle of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundels
Composition;</hi> amounting in all but to six thousand pounds,
and the moity of it not to be paid till three months end at least. What
your other debts of the Navy are, and how many thousand pounds
you owe to Mariners, Masters, and Tradesmen, the Committee of the
Navie can best informe you. Your debts to your Artificers, Waggo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nars,
and such who have advanced monies upon the Publick Faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to two or three Millions at least: Besides, your debts to <hi>Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
and other Garrisons are so great, that they are all ready to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
and disband for want of pay. Your Debts to the Souldiers and
Officers in <hi>Ireland</hi> are vaste; and if speedy and large supplies of Men,
Provision and Monies arrive not there within one month, Colonell
<hi>Iones,</hi> and your other Officers there professe, the whole Kingdome
will be utterly lost: and you (for ought I sinde) have no possible means
to supply them with either.</p>
            <p>If then your Debts are already so great, to <hi>Reformadoes,</hi> Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the Army, Navie, Garisons, and those who have lent you
Monies, that you know not how to satisfie any one of them: If
you have not money to pay your Army or Navie at the present,
nor to maintaine them for the future why doe you now refuse that
Peace which is tendered you upon such great advantages, and chuse a
Warre which you know not how to maintaine, and must needs break
yours and the Kingdoms backs in few months more? Your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits

Besides, the City, Country, and whole Kingdome are how quite
exhausted, and almost as poore as naked <hi>Iob</hi> was. Many Countries
of the Kingdome are so impoverished and exhausted with the last
Warres, (especially the foure Northern Shires next to <hi>Scotland</hi>) that
(as their <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> assure you) they are so farre unable to
pay any Taxes, that they already starve and perish in most places
for want of food, and are petitioners to you for some reparation
towards their great losses, and present support to keep them from
starving. The rich Associated Counties have beene harressed and
undone by the last Summers Warres, that they are growne poore,
unable to lend or contribute to you any more force or assistance. The
excessive dearth of corn and provisions the last year, the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of corn by unseasonable weather this present year, which
makes that which is wholesome exceeding deer; The extraordinary

               </gap> Counties; the generall scarcity and decay of Trade
by Land, of Merchandize by sea, and apparent probability of their
decaying every day more and more, by reason of the revolted Ships
and Irish Men-of-warre; and the Sequestrations of the Malignant,
and plunderings and losses of the wel-affected Nobility and Gentry
have so impoverished all sorts of men, (but the Souldier and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and some fow Treasurers and Officers) that they know not
how to live or subsist almost, much lesse to lend or contribute to
maintaine such a numerous Army by Land and Sea, and supply <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
pressing necessities. If you cannot tell how to pay your present
Debts, what folly is it to augment them for the future? If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pay your Army or Navie now, how will you be able to do it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?</p>
            <p>If then you will have no peace with the King upon the Treaty,
but break it off, and keep up a Warre and Army still without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:106039:58"/>
or reason in this your impoverished and exhausted condition,
then mark the consequences: Your Forces being not duly paid,
will live upon free-quarter still, and that will undoe the Country,
&amp; make them desperate: And when they have eaten out all the poor,
then they will mutiny, and fall on all that are rich, put them to
present Fines and Ransoms at their pleasure, eat them out of House
and home, share their Estates and Offices, which many of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
professe to be thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s by Conquest; and then the longest sword
will be the only true Judge and measure of al mens properties, and
divider of their Estates, as well in this as former ages; of which we
already begin to feel some sad experiments. And as the Souldier on
the one hand, so the penurious poor people in every place, for want
of work and imployment, and bread to put into their head, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by the Souldiers uncontrolled insolencies, will fall to
plunder and levell all rich men on the other side. And if the Army
<hi>Remonstrance</hi> and <hi>Agreement of the People</hi> (now in hot persuit) take
place, Ministers shall receive no Tythes, Landlords no Rents, Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
no Debts, and oppressed ruined persons no Law not Justice.
Kings must go down, Princes and Peers quite down, Parliaments
down, Judges, Justices, Magistrates, Laws, Tenures, Inclosures down,
all rich and landed persons down; their very wealth and estates will
be sufficient cause to make them Malignants to a starved Peasantry
and al-conquering unpaid Army; and then what follows but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
and irrecoverable ruine? I beseech you therefore consider in
what a desperate, hazardous condition we and the whole Kingdom
now stand at present; how neer we and <hi>Ireland</hi> are to the very brink
of ruine. If we will now put into that safe and sure harbour of
Peace which the present Treaty invites us into, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cost, or fear of shipwrack, we may yet through Gods blessing
be safe and happy: But if we now wilfully put forth to Sea again,
among so many rocks, shelves &amp; quick sands which surround us on
every side, and will yet chuse War instead of Peace when the golden
and silver nerves that formerly maintained it are quite shrunk up,
we can expect nought else but drowning, &amp; sudden shipwrack of
all our Kingdoms, Parliaments, Liberties, Estates, and of our
Church and Religion too.</p>
            <p>Yea, But (say some) though all this be truth, we must not displease
the Army,<note place="margin">Object.</note> who are our present strength and safety; for then we are
are lost indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:106039:59"/>
I have answered this Objection once before in one sense, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>Treaties satisfactorinesse;</hi> I shall here answer it in another.
I say then,</p>
            <p>1. That we have a God to please, who wil be displeased, if we please
the Army in their unjust demands: And better is it to please God,
then to please any Army whatsoever: <hi>If God be with us, who can be against
us?</hi> We need no Armies protections, if the Lord of Hosts be our
Guardian.</p>
            <p>2. We have a conscience to please, as well as an Army; and we
must satsifie that, though the Army, (who pretend so much for <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of conscience,</hi> yet will allow us none, or very little) be never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
with it.</p>
            <p>3. We have a Kingdom, nay three Kingdoms to please, and to save
too: And we must rather please and save them, by rejecting the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Proposals, which will inevitably ruine them, then please the
Army in being any way instrumentall for their destruction, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
their destructive counsels: If our Kingdoms be preserved, we
may have another Army, though this be disbanded, dissolved, yea
destroyed; but if the Kingdoms perish by our pursuing their rash
Proposals, we shall neither have Kingdoms: nor yet an Army, nor
this Army, who must certainly perish in and with the Kingdoms
ruine.</p>
            <p>4. We have a <hi>Navie</hi> to please as well as an Army; and which is
more considerable to us then an Army: A new Army may soon be
raised, though the old be disbanded; but a Navie being once lost,
Ships will not grow again, nor another Navy built in many years.

if we should please the Army in their present demands, to their
prejudices, and scandall, and our Religions too. There was no man
of publick Spirit that engaged with, contributed towards, or took
up Arms in the Parliaments service or Cause at first, but meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these five grounds, expressed in all the Houses Remonstraces, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
Petitions, Protestations, and in the Solemn League and
Covenant: 1. To defend and maintain the true Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
against Popery, Error, and Superstition. 2. To defend the
Kings Royall Person, Dignity, and legall Authority, against vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
treachery, and usurpation. 3. To maintain the Priviledges,
Rights and Freedom of Parliaments, and the Fundamentall Laws
and Government of the Kingdom, against State-Innovations, and
Tyranny. Fourthly, to rescue the Kings person from evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors;
and bring such Incendiaries and Delinquents to condign
punishment, Fifthly, to settle the Kingdom in freedom, safety, and
peace, against Crueltie, Dangers, and imminent Wars and tumults.</p>
            <p>Upon these grounds, and for these ends only, did both Houses,
and all who adhered to them, or took up Arms for them, by their
Commissions, engage, and so did this<note n="*" place="margin">A Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>pag.</hi> 599. 623.</note> very Army. I appeal then to
every mans Conscience, Whether the Houses, or any who engaged
with them, did ever contribute any Moneys, Plate, Horse, Atms, or
march out as an Officer or Souldier under them in these Wars,
with any such intention as this, to depose and bring the King to
Justice; disinherit the Princes, and Kings posterity; dissolve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Parliament, and pull all future Parliaments, and' their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
up by the roots, subvert the Fundamentall Government of
the Realm, and set up a new representative to dash all these in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and destroy Religion, Magistracy and Ministry? Did they not
all abhor and disclaim in Publique all such thoughts and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as these? and when objected by the King and his party out of
jealousie amd fear; did not the<note n="*" place="margin">Exact Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>p.</hi> 298. 657. 658. 695, 696, A Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <hi>p.</hi> 117.</note> Houses presently resent and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
against it as the grossest scandall, and their adherents too? Or
would ever a man have engaged with the Houses, or the Houses with
them in this War, or enrolled his name even in this New <hi>Model'd</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
had he been told at first, That he must fight to depose and bring
the King to execution, to dis-inherit his posterity, dissolve this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the very Rights, Priviledges, and being of all future
Parliaments, to set up a new Government and representative in our
Church and State, to alter and change all things at their fancies,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:106039:60"/>
and to break every clauses and article of the Solemn League &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
If not one of these was the true end of our Wars and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
against the King at first, and all along till now, but the
clean contrary to them; then how can they now be propounded
as the only fruits of our wars, and means or conditions of our Peace
and Settlement? Will they not all say, (if the Houses or Army pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in their Proposals for Peace and Settlement, mentioned
in their last Remonstrance) that they engaged and took up Arms to
doe quite contrary to what they now propose to the Houses, and
endeavour to enforce them to put it in punctuall execution? And
will they not now say, That they are by their originall Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Covenants obliged with their lives and estates to oppose
and oppugn the Army in all these particulars; that having thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and resolved, they cannot pray for, but against the Armies
late successes herein; that they cannot henceforth contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their future pay and support in point of conscience or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but must withdraw and withhold their contributions, and
resist them to their Faces, declare their Commissions null, and not
look on, or take them as an Army, but as a tumultnous rout of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
assembled <hi>without Commission,</hi> to act over <hi>Iack Cades</hi> Treasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and quite pull down that frame of Government and Order
which they have been building up and supporting these many years,
with such vast expence of Treasure and bloud? Better then displease
the <hi>ARMY,</hi> then that all these Covenanters and Engagers should
suffer, to theirs, the three Kingdoms hazard, <hi>Ireland's</hi> certain losse,
and this very Armies overthrow, which these Jesuiticall designs
wil certainly destroy in a very short space, if they <hi>Iehu</hi>-like, drive on
so furiously in prosecution and execution of them, as they have
done of late.</p>
            <p>Consider I beseech you of the desperatenesse and excessive una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
destructivenesse of these monstrous wayes to the speedy
peace and settlement of our Church and State, and of the safety

and confusion of those Counsels, and
pretended wayes of settlement which the Officers of the

heart to unbosome my very soul unto you, and discover you
that secret which God hath so clearly manifested to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that I dare not (under the highest penalty) but
acquaint you with; That the Jesuites, and Roman Priests
and Catholicks are the originall contrivers and principall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters
of the late and present distempers, and undutifull
mutinous proceedings and counsels of the Officers and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and chief contrivers of the new <hi>Babel,</hi> or model of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
which they have tendred to you in their late Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
as the only way to peace and settlement. And if I
shall clearly demonstrate this unto the House, I hope every
Member present, and the whole Army and Kingdome, when
they know it, will eternally abhor and renounce it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
henceforth countenance or promote this Jesuiticall
and Romish designe: which I am perswaded the Generall,
and most of the Officers and Souldiers in the Army, in the
simplicity of their hearts (with honest and publick inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Justice and common Freedom) have been ignorantly
drawn into, by over-reaching pates and Machiavilian Policies
of these cunning <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who can metamorphose themselves
into any shapes, and invisibly infinuate themselves into their
counsels and actings, to promote their own interest and our
destruction.</p>
               <p>I do not prosesse my self to be any great Statesman, or
exactly to know what ever is secretly transacted among us:
But this I can say, without <hi>disparagement</hi> to others, or
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106039:61"/>
                  <hi>vain-glory</hi> to my self, That I have for many years last past
been as curious an observer of all the great transactions
of Affairs in Church or State, and of the instruments
and means by which they have been covertly contrived
and carried on, as any man in this House or Kingdom:
and that God hath honoured me in being one of the first
discoverers and opposers of the Jesuites and Papists plots
to undermine our Religion, and usher in Popery by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
into our Church, by making use of our Popish and
Arminian Prelates and Clergy-men as their Instruments,
and broaching one Arminian and Popish Doctrine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
one Popish Superstition and Innovation after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
of which I have given this House and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
the fullest and clearest discoveries of any man; and
likewise of introducing Tyranny, Arbitrary power and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
combustions in our State, of which I likewise made
seasonable discoveries and opposition, the ground of all my
sufferings, close imprisonment and banishent, to prevent
the like detections and oppositions. And since my return
from exile, I have in my <hi>ROME'S MASTER-PIECE,

and all sorts of people to reduce us back to Rome, supplant
Religion, subvert Parliaments, set up tyranny and involve

as none else before or since mee have done; all
which both Houses have since approved and made use of
in severall <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Remonstrance</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may with greater confidence and better grounds ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
on this discovery, of which most here present (who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106039:61"/>
are little acquainted with mysteries of State or Politicks'
and trouble not their heads with such inquiries after them
as I have done) are utterly ignorant, and so apt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,
and easily over-reached; the plainest open-hearted
men being easiest to be over-witted by Jesuites and their
Instruments; especially when they transform themselves
into Angels of Light, or become <hi>new lights,</hi> to broach new
<hi>strange opinions,</hi> or revive old errors under the notion of

               </p>
               <p>To make out this discovery so cleerly evident that none
can rationally deny, but be sufficiently convinced of its truth,
I must minde you of these particulars of undoubted truth

make the houses odious to all, and put all things into a present

               <p>But that which further demonstrates it is this; That after the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
&amp; Officers of the Army had confessed their error *in medling
with *State affaires, &amp; settling &amp; reforming the Common-wealth,
in the *General Councell at <hi>Putney</hi> [where they voted &amp; acted more
like a Parliam. then a Councell of War) &amp; promised to proceed no
futher in it, but acquiesce with the houses determinations: these Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,
by the help of their instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts the Agitators, to carry on their
design of putting a speedy period to the present &amp; all future Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
draw up a moddle of a new Representive, which they intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>The Agreement of the people,</hi> subscribed by divers Regiments of the
Army (9 of horse and 7 of foot) and then caused it to be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the house of Commons in November 1647. The matter end,
and time of it conpared together, and the houses votes upon it, are
very considerable; and discover a Jesuit in the front and reare of it:
We all know, that the Jesuits and their popish confederats, ever
since Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, when so many strict laws were made
against, have had an aking tooth against Parliaments, Their first
and most disperate attempt was in the third year of King <hi>Iames,</hi> to
blow up the K. and both houses of Parliament with Gunpowder,
the orginall plotters of this horrid Treason, were the Pope and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits:
as is clear by, Del Roi. his book, &amp; other printed papers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a year before: the chiefe actors in it, were discontented Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and Souldiers, <hi>Catesby, Percy, Winter. Faux,</hi> and others, as our
stories<note n="*" place="margin">See the arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Traytors, Mr. <hi>Vicars</hi> History, <hi>Speeds</hi> Chronicle and others</note> relate, fit instruments to blow up Parliaments: The
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106039:65"/>
day when this was to be executed, was the fift of November: but
this treason, being through Gods great mercy discovered on that
day, the King and Parliament adjudged these Iesuits, and Popish
Traytors to be executed, and that day by Act of Parliament to be
perpetually observed for a Thanksgiving day of this happy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from that treason. The Jesuites who have broken off all
former Parliaments in this Kings reigne till this, and would eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
dissolve this, and all succeeding Parliaments, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
for their ill successes then, have these two last yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in this very moneth of <hi>November,</hi> conspired to blow up or
pull down this and all other Parliaments; so as the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the moneth and time, discovers in my apprehension, the
Jesuites to be chiefe actors in this tragedy. The first attempt of this
kind was on the fift of <hi>November,</hi> 1647. the very day of the <hi>powder
plot,</hi> but by the Houses occasions put off till the 9th. Then the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of the People</hi> was ushered into the House of Commons, with
a Petition by the <hi>Agitators:</hi> when this Agreement of the people and
Petition was presented, <hi>Gifford</hi> a <hi>Staffordshire Gent.</hi> and a Jesuite (a
yeare before sent from beyond the Seas, who at first seigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a convert to our Religion) was present in the lobby with the
<hi>Agitators,</hi> and promoted it all he could, expressing his approbation
of it, being gotten into the Generalls owne life Guard, and the
next man to him, when he came to bring the Speaker unto the
House of Commons, <hi>August,</hi> 6. 1647. He was afterward very active
to perswade the <hi>Staffordshire</hi> supernumerarie forces not to disband,
and prevailed so much with them, that there were severall orders
from the house &amp; General ere they wovld obay: therefore its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
he and they perswaded the <hi>Army</hi> at first not to disband, or to
goe for <hi>Ireland</hi> After which he was taken this summer at a meeting
in Ramme-alley to raise a new Warre, and being carried priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to the Committee of safety, made an escape from thence, by
bribing his Keepers, as is conceived, having offered fifty peeces to a
Captaine to suffer him to escape. This Petition and <hi>Agreement of the
People,</hi> thus presented by the Agitators, and this Jesuite, Upou rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

I shall further offer this to your consideration, that as soon as ever
this Agreement of the people was suppressed in <hi>Novem.</hi> 1647. and
the king perswaded to reject the propositions tendred him by both
Houses, by some officers in the army, of purpose to treat on their
<hi>proposals:</hi> The agitators &amp; Jesuits in the army, opposed these <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals</hi>
and threating to offer some violence to the <hi>Kings</hi> person, caused
him secretly to withdraw himself from <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> into the Isle
of <hi>Wight,</hi> where they shut him up close prisoner, without the Houses
privity: which done, they caused their confederates (when most of
the <hi>Members</hi> were sent into the Country to disband the supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

to passe a vote in the Commons house, to <hi>make no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to the King, not to set him aside,</hi> (as they then professed to many
dissenting members) but only to induce the <hi>K.</hi> to seck first to them;
without, which protestation, they had never caried this vote; which
passed, &amp; most of the Membrs departing, the 2. ensuing Votes were
set on foot, &amp; passed at an unseasonable hour, &amp; gotten by surprize.
The very next morning there came a <hi>Declaration</hi> from Sir <hi>Thomas
Fairfax,</hi> and the <hi>Gen: Councell of the Army, Ian.</hi> 11. 1647. signifying
their resolutions, to adhere to the Houses, <hi>for settling and securing the
parliament and kingdom, without the King and against him, or any other that
shall hereafter pertake with him.</hi> But the Lgrds sticking at these Votes,
there was a regement or two of foot sent from the <hi>Army</hi> to garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>White hall;</hi> and a regiment of horse bilited in the <hi>Mues,</hi> to fright
and force the Lords to a Concurrence. And some few dayes after, a
Book written by <hi>Dolman, (alyas Parsons</hi> the Jesuite) against <hi>King
Iames</hi> his Title to the Crown; and concerning <hi>the lawfulnesse of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects &amp;
Parliaments deposing &amp; chastising of their Kings for their misgouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; the good &amp; prosperous secceesse that God commonly hath given to the
same [printed out of Dolmans</hi> own printed Copy <hi>verbatim,</hi> except the
word Parliament added to it now and then, was published to the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106039:69"/>
world, with this Title: <hi>Severall Speeches delivered at a conference,
concerning the power of Parliaments, <hi>to procéed against their King
for misgovernment:</hi>
                  </hi> which Book with this false new title published
at this season, intemated to the world, that this discourse of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
(for which he was condemned of high treason) was nothing
else, but speeches <hi>mad by some Members of the Commons house, at a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the Lords,</hi> The highest dishonour &amp; affront ever put upon
a protestant Parliament, to have the book and doctrine of a lesuit
thus falsly fathered on them: of which, though I may self and others
complained, there was nothing done to vindicate the houses from
this grosse imputation: And about the same time, there was another
book intituled, <hi>Royal tyranny discovered:</hi> Discovering the tiranny of
the Kings, of <hi>England</hi> from <hi>William</hi> the invader and robber &amp; Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<hi>alias</hi> the Conqueror, to this present <hi>King Charles;</hi> who is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved, <hi>to be worse and more tyrannicall then any of his predecessors, and
deserves a more severe punishment from the hands of this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then either of the dethroned Kings, Ed.</hi> 2 or <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. had <hi>from former
Parliaments which they are bound by duty and Oath, without equivocation or
collution, to inflict upon him, he being the greatest delinquent in the three
kingdoms, and the head of the rest;</hi> so the title. In the Table, there are
these passages amongst others, <hi>Charles Steward guilty of this treason.</hi> p.
92, 93, 94, 95, 97. <hi>C. R (Charls Rex) <hi>Ought to be executed,</hi>
                  </hi> p. 57. where
the houses are not only pressed to <hi>depose</hi> and <hi>execute him</hi> but his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
[in their neglect] foretold, &amp; that in <hi>
                     <hi>An exemplary manner,</hi>
in dispite of all his protectors and defendors.</hi> Which Iesuitical books and
counsels published at that instant, discovered clearly to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
their votes for laying the King then aside, &amp; the deposing
&amp; executing of him to be then intended, [only interrupted by the
<hi>Scots</hi> invasion &amp; the last summers commotion, occasioned by those
votes of <hi>Non addresses]</hi> and the forceing on of them then &amp; now by
the army, with the violence they use, to be no other but a very plot
and project of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> to ruine and distroy the King and us.</p>
               <p>I shall only add to this, what I manifested but now, that it was the
<hi>Iesuits</hi> plot when they engaged and assisted the King in his warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Scots,</hi> to dash the protestants in both nations in peeces
one against another, &amp; so be masters of both kingdoms, &amp; extirpate
our religion in both; and that if the King consented not to grant
them a generall free exercise of their religion throughout all his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106039:70"/>
realms &amp; Dominions, or did but sticke at it, that then they would
presently poyson &amp; dispatch him, possesse themselves of the <hi>Prince,</hi>
next heire to the Crowne, &amp; then by flattery or menaces draw him
to their Religion, match him to a Papist, and then all three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
would soon turn <hi>Papists,</hi> and all <hi>Protestants</hi> be murthered, or
burnt for <hi>Heretiques.</hi> Now these <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> understanding,
that the <hi>King</hi> [beyond &amp; contrary to their expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>] bath granted
all or most of our <hi>Propositions</hi> in the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> and fully condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
to five <hi>New bills,</hi> for the <hi>extirpation of Masse, Popery, and Popish
innovations out of his Dominions,</hi> and <hi>putting all Lawes in execution against
them,</hi> and for a <hi>speedier discovery and conviction of them then formerly,</hi> and
that their good friends and Confederats our <hi>Arch-Bishops, Bishops,
Deans and Chapters,</hi> and other branches of the <hi>hierarchy,</hi> are tobe
<hi>wholly routted out,</hi> both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> so as they are never
likely to have any more footing in them againe, after all their late
warres, charges, hazards, plots and designes, to set up their <hi>Catholique
Religion &amp; party</hi> are so inraged with the King, &amp; so inexorably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
against him both at home &amp; abroad [as I am credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med]
that now they are mad against him, &amp; thirst for nothing but
his blood; which they think they cannot advantagiously &amp; effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accomplish, but by engaging the <hi>Army</hi> to dessolve the <hi>Treaty,</hi> &amp;
force the Parliament, in case <hi>they vote his answers satisfactory:</hi> and
then by themselvs, are a confederate party in the <hi>House,</hi> to depose &amp;
cut off his head. Which done, the <hi>Prince</hi> being now beyond Seas in
their power, destitute of his hopes of succession to this <hi>Crown, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and declared <hi>a Traitor</hi> and to <hi>dye without mercy</hi> if <hi>he returne hither,</hi>
&amp; to lose his head as well as his father, upon such high affronts put
upon his <hi>Father &amp; himself,</hi> &amp; that by a <hi>Protestant Parliament, &amp; Army
of Saints,</hi> will be so inraged against all professors of our religion
that he will probably professe himself a <hi>Roman Catholique</hi> (and his
brother too) match with a <hi>Catholique Princes,</hi> &amp; then ingage all the
<hi>Papists</hi> in forraign parts, <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to unite their
forces, purses &amp; councels by way of revenge, to cut all the <hi>Protestants</hi>
throats in all three <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> who have adhered to the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
and hew the <hi>Army</hi> it selfe in peeces, when they have thus accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
their designes: which will render them and the <hi>Parliament</hi>

massacre the <hi>Protestants,</hi> lest they should fill to the like perfidious
practises. This I am most confident is their designe, by what I have

into any Protestant Church:</hi> by those very steps which our Prelates
followed, who were directed by them, and to alter and subvert any
Protestant State and Kingdom, by this new modelling of them into
such a <hi>popular Anarchy,</hi> as is now suggested and presented in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

turn their hearts, from prosecuting their present designes.</p>
               <p>I shall onely adde one thing more, and so conclude. That many
of the <hi>Agitators</hi> and Armies papers, [especially <hi>Putney projects,</hi> and
some late <hi>Declarations]</hi> savour of a <hi>Iesuites</hi> stile or spirit. That I
have been credibly informed, that not onely <hi>Gifford</hi> a Jesuite, was

but one <hi>Thomas Budds,</hi> alias <hi>Peto</hi> (the last Popish Priest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

of some great Officers in it, obtained a Reprieve instead of an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:

which all their Popish conspiracies, armies and confederates from
the beginning of <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> reign, could never yet effect by all
their treachery, policy, power: and how farre they have proceeded
and engaged the Army and Officers unwillingly in it, out of honest

               <p>I beseech you Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> let us all lay this speedily to our hearts,
and goe about to prevent it, ere it be too late. If we Vote the <hi>Kings
Answer</hi> now <hi>unsatisfactory,</hi> and so breake off the <hi>Treaty</hi> with him, our
onely means of peace and settlement; we have all our hopes and all
these large concessions which the <hi>King</hi> hath granted both for our
present and future security; our Monarchy, Magistracy, Ministry,
Parliaments, Laws, Liberties, Kingdoms, and that which is dearest
to us, our Religion also endangered, yea lost at once, and such a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
foundation laid to carry on all these <hi>Iesuiticall designes</hi> I have
here discovered, and that by authority of this House, as will staine
the honor of this most glorious and renowned Parliam. to all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
and put a dishonorable speedy period to this and all future
Parliam. for ever. But if we Vote it so far <hi>satisfactory,</hi> as I have stated
it (and humbly conceive proved it substantially to every rationall
mans understanding &amp; conscience) as that we may lay present hold
upon it, and proceed therein without delay, to turn all the Kings
Concessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s into Bils (which I have for the most part already drawn)
and get the <hi>Kings Royall assent</hi> unto them, I doubt not but by Gods
blessing on our endeavours, we may before this Month be ended, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
such a firme and well grounded Peace between the King &amp; all his
People and kingdom; upon such honorable, safe, and advantagious
terms for the Publick interest, &amp; such strong securities, as no State,

               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore Mr. Speaker, upon this long and tedious debate
(for which I must humbly begge pardon of the House, being a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of such infinite concernment to our present weale or ruine)
I must and doe conclude,</hi> That the Kings Answers to the Propositions of
both Houses, are so farre Satisfactory, at the least, as that this House may
upon safe and firme grounds, and great advantages, forthwith accept
of, and immediately proceed upon them, to the speedy settlement of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106039:71"/>
Peace of the Kingdome; and are bound both in honour, prudence, justice, and

APPENDIX.
For the Kingdoms better satisfaction of some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
since this SPEECH.</head>
            <p>THis Speech, uttered with much pathetique seriousnesse, and heard
with great attention, gave such a generall satisfaction to the House
that many Members, formerly of a contrary opinion, professed, they
were both convinced and converted; others who were dubious in the
point of satisfaction, that they were now fully confirmed, most of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
opinion put to a stand: and the <hi>Majority of the House,</hi> declared
both by their <hi>cheerfull Countenances and Speeches</hi> [the Speaker going into
the withdrawing Room to refresh himself, so soon as the Speech was
ended) that they were abundantly satisfied by what had been thus spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
After which the Speaker resuming the Chair, this Speech was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by many able <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and the debate continuing Saturday,
and all Munday and Munday night till about nine of the Clock on Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
morning; and 244 Members staying quite out to the end, though
the House doores were not shut up (a thing never seen or known before
in Parliament) the question was at last put, and notwithstanding the
Generals and whole Armies march to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and Menaces against
the Members, in case they Voted for the Treaty, and did not utterly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it as unsatisfactory, carryed in the affirmative by 140 Voyces (with
the four Tellers) against 104 that the question should be put, and then
without any division of the House it was,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved on the question,</hi> That the Answers of the King to the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of both Houses, are a ground for the House to proceed upon for the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:106039:72"/>
And to give the General Officers and Soldiers satisfaction, and keep
a fair correspondency between the house and them, they so far conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended,
as likewise further to vote at the same time</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> Mr. Peirpoint, Sir John Evelyn of Wilts, Mr. Solicitor, Col.
Birch, M. Ashurst, Sir Thomas Witherington, and Mr. Maynard, <hi>are</hi>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">appointed to repair to the head-quarters this afternoon, to confer
with the Lord General and his Officers, to keep a Right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and a good correspondency between the House and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and the Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which done, the House who sat up all the day and night before, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
until Wensday morning; At which time the <hi>General</hi> and
<hi>Officers</hi> of the Army highly displeased with the vote and those Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
who assented to it, sent two or three whole Regiments of Foot
and Horse to <hi>Westminster;</hi> set a strong guard at the Houses doors, in
the lobby, stairs, and at every passage leading towards the house, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
none but Parliament men themselves to enter into <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi>
or the back stairs leading to the Court of Requests, and excluding
their servants who attended them; Col. <hi>Pride,</hi> Col. <hi>Hewson,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Hardress Waller</hi> seized upon divers Members of the Commons house,
some at the House doors, other in the Lobby, others on the stairs
near the House, without any warrant, or reason alleadged, but their
sword and power, as they were going to sit and discharge their duties.
Among others, Col. <hi>Pride,</hi> seized upon <hi>Mr. Prynne</hi> going up the
stairs next the house, and told him, Mr. <hi>Prynne, you must not go into
the House, but must go along with me; M. Prynne</hi> returned this answer,
<hi>That he was a Member of the House and was going into it to discharge
his duty, from which no man should or ought to hinder him, whether he
would go, and he should not keep him back, and thereupon thrust up a
step or two more.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Pride</hi> thrusting him down before, and
Sir <hi>Hardress Waller,</hi> and others laying hands on, and pulling him down
forcibly behind to the Court of Requests great door, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
thereupon demanded by <hi>what Authority and Commission, and for what
cause they did thus violently seize on, and pull him from the house?</hi> to
which <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> shewing him their armed Souldiers standing
round about him with swords, muskets, and matches lighted, <hi>told
him that there was their Commission:</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Pryme</hi> answered,
that they were no legal <hi>commission,</hi> nor cause for them to seize upon
him being a Member, and openly protested, <hi>that it was an high breach
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106039:72"/>
of the Priviledges of Parliament and affront to the house, and desired
the standers by to bear witnesse of this violence and his Protestation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and that they being more and stronger then he, and all armd
and he unarmed, they might forcibly carry him whether they pleased,
but stirre he would not thence of his own accord,</hi> whereupon they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
pushed him into the Queens Court, where some other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
a little before seized, were kept Prisoners by them.</p>
            <p>The house bein informed by Mr. <hi>Dodridge,</hi> a member who came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> of this violence upon him and high breach of
priviledge in seizing him and other Members, sent the Serjeant of the
House, to <hi>demand them of the Captain that guarded them,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>their present attendance in the House:</hi> which message though
delivered by him, and the prisoners thereupon requiring obedience,
that they might accordingly attend the House: was yet slighted and
disobeyed, whereupon the House ordered the Serjeant the second time
to go with his mace and demand the Members, and bring them unto
the house forthwith; the house refusing to do any businesse till their
Members were restored, but <hi>Pride</hi> and his confederates stayed the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent
in the lobby, and would not suffer him to go to the members;
whereupon he returning into the House, acquainted them with the
contempt, which was entred into the Journall. Thereupon the House
concluded, not to proceed till their Members were restored, and sent a
Committee to the <hi>General</hi> to demand them, Mr. <hi>Edward Stephens</hi> and
Colonell <hi>Birch</hi> being in the house were sent for to the doore by some
of the Officers by false tickets, and pulled out from the house doores
by violence, Col. <hi>Birch</hi> putting his head within the doore, and crying
out to the Speaker, <hi>whether they would suffer their members to be pulled
out thus violently before their faces, and yet sit still?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When night approached St. <hi>Peters</hi> (who now keeps the prison
door keyes of <hi>hell</hi> and Purgatory) released two of the imprisoned
Members (Sir <hi>Benjamin Ruddiard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nath. Fiennes) by the
same power of the Sword</hi> (as he said) <hi>that had taken and held them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi>
belike they were all prisoners of War, and so their marching up
to Westminster was a leavying open warre against the Parliament,
and so Treason by their own Declarations and Remonstrance, in as
high or higher degree, as that for which they demand the <hi rend="margQuotes">King to be
brought to speedy justice and execution.</hi> Soon after, he and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106039:73"/>
other <hi>Officers,</hi> promised the imprisoned Members, that they should be
removed to <hi>Wallingford</hi> house, where the <hi>Generall</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant
Generall</hi> would come and conferre with them, and they should have
all sitting accommodations, there provided for them; and that Coaches
were provided to carry them thither; whereupon they all took Coach
to go thither: but coming to <hi>Hell</hi> back gate, the Coaches were all
there stayed, and the Members thrust all prisoners into <hi>Hell,</hi> where
they were kept all that cold night, without either bedding or other
needful accommodations, though some of them aged &amp; infirm, &amp; there
enforced to lye upon the bare flower and Benches instead of <hi>Beds,</hi> few
of them taking any rest at all that night. The next morning a little
before Dinner, they were all carried fasting to <hi>White Hall,</hi>
by the <hi>Generalls</hi> order garded with foot and horse, before and behind,
and on every side, like so many Traytors to attend the <hi>General, and his
Councell,</hi> who desired presently to speak with them, as the Marshall
informed them under whose custody they were put. But when they
came there, they waited on their more then Royall new Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
till six a clock at night, without eating or drinking: and then
received this cold Message, without being admitted to the <hi>Generalls</hi>
or <hi>Councells</hi> presence. <hi>That the Generall and Officers were now so
busie in consultation about other important affaires, that they could
not speak with them that night,</hi> but had given order for their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
at the <hi>Kings Head,</hi> and <hi>Swan</hi> in the <hi>Strand, whither they
should be carried that night, and the next morning some Officers would
wait on them with Propositions: Which done they were guarded every
man with his musqueteer at his back,</hi> and others by his side, and horse
and foot before and <hi>behind their persons, like so many Rogues or felons,
and so sent on foot through the dirty street, except six who were lame, who
got a Coach</hi>) to these two Inns; and there kept prisoners severall daies
till some were after by degrees without any condition, or cause
assigned of their commitment, and others not released, removed els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
The next day after those Members were thus violently seised,
Mr. <hi>Gewen</hi> was seised at the <hi>House,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vahghan</hi> at his Lodging,
and sent Prisoners to the other Members: Sir <hi>William Litten</hi> was
likewise seized that day, and kept Prisoner in <hi>White Hall:</hi> but after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
by Sir <hi>William Constables</hi> Order: That day and five or six
dayes following, above one hundred and sixty Members more, whose
names were listed by the officers and souldiers that stood at the house
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106039:73"/>
Doors, who kept back every one that was so listed, were forcibly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
and driven away from the House, which could hardly get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
45. or 50. (most confederates with the army to carry on their
designes) and Vote their Counsells Imperiall Dictates, as the houses
votes &amp; not above 3. or 4. Lords at most attended and made up that
Honorable house: all of them still sitting under the armies armed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
&amp; over-awing terror. These 45. or 50. only whiles under this
horrid force, during the restraint and forcible seclusion of above 200
members by the army, (and so all their Votes, <hi>Orders, &amp; proceedings</hi>
meerely <hi>null</hi> and <hi>void,</hi> by their own <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 20. 1647.
which declared, <hi>all Votes, Ordinances and proceedings during the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
absence in the army, though not above 40. at most to be nul &amp; void,
from Iuly</hi> 26. to <hi>August</hi> six, <hi>though the houses were then</hi> almost treble
the number they are now, and no one member secluded or actually
forced away from either house) have assumed to themselves the name
&amp; power of the house, and presumed to repeal all <hi>Votes</hi> concerning
the <hi>Treaty</hi> as <hi>dishonorable</hi> and <hi>destructive:</hi> &amp; among others the Vote
made upon this solemne and long debate when there were 244
Members present at the Question, and above 340 at the debate when
fullest through age &amp; infirmity could not hold out all night til the
question put, &amp; some members contrary to the course of all former
Parliam. after these Votes passed, have presumed to draw up &amp; enter
particular protestations against it: for which other members in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times have bin suspended the house, &amp; sent prisoners to the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
The list of those who have entred their dissents &amp; protests against
it, follow: because the secluded Members &amp; those who concurred in
that Vote, being above three times their number, expect they will
give the Kingdom and world some solid and satisfactory reasons of
this their dissent, against which there is so great reason in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
dissents without reasons to back them, being no wayes satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
to any man.</p>

Nov. 28. 1648, there is this passage: <hi>I am fallen into the acquaintance of three or four
Catholicks of great ingenuity, and in their way, of much Religion: undoubtedly, it is an
errour to look at all</hi> Papists <hi>through the same prospective; for they are more to be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
then English Protestants can be. I finde their opinion of, and dependance upon
the Pope, little or nothing what we imagined it to be, and better principled</hi>
               </hi> To make
Members of a free Common-wealth, then the most English. Their
opposition to the King is not to be reconciled.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Their hopes now are
upon the Army, to whom they wish all prosperity as to the setling of
a Representative, being extremely distasted with Regal hereditary
Power through the world.</p>
            <p>This Letter compared with the close of the fore going Speech, the Armies
late force upon both Houses and their Members to dissolve them, their impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
and removing the King to bring him to tryall, their voting at their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

into bloudy feuds and factions to destroy one another, and make way for
the common forraign Popish Enemies, to invade and conquer us in our present
low condition, without any opposition, and lose Ireland past all recovery; their
casting of the eminent imprisoned Members into hell it self in highest contempt
and scorn; their setting up a new Parliament of State, and a Convocation too
at White-hall, as the supreme Councel, to vote, settle and determine all affairs
of Church and State, and new mould the whole Government of this Kingdom;
with the Petition of <hi>Robert de Luke</hi> to the General within these few dayes, for
him and his fellow-Messengers, authorized by the State to apprehend Priests
and Jesuits, for his Warrant to apprehend the Jesuits and Priests in his Army
and Quarters without any Officers disturbance, where they have discovered
many of them since their march to London; their present complyance with Sir
<hi>Iohn Winter</hi> the archest Jesuited Papist (a person excepted in the Propositions)
and using him and Sir <hi>Toby Matthews</hi> that pragmaticall Jesuite, to draw <hi>Owen
Roh Oneal, and the bloody Popish Rebels in Ireland,</hi> to joyn with them against Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
and the Princes Title; with their late extraordinary favours to Priests
and Papists, of which they boast; the repealing of the Oaths of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106039:74"/>
               <hi>Allegeance</hi> (made principally against the Pope, Papists, and their Jesuiticall U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpations,
Innovations and Antimonarchicall practices of excommunicating,
deposing, dis-inheriting and murthering our Protestant Princes; and their
manifold Treasons, Conspiracies and attempts upon their Persons, Crowns
and Kingdoms.) Their late illegal and treasonable murthering and beheading
of the King, and the late Petition of the Army that all imprisoned for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or Religion, may be released, extending unto Popish Priests and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,
and purposely intended for their benefit, there being none else but such
restrained, and but few of them: And their present actings are a cleer evidence
to every rational mans conscience, that all the Armies present councels, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
force, and proceedings against the King, Prince, Parliament, Members
and their new pretended Representative, are but the Jesuits and Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
Brats Impostures and undermining Projects, to accomplish their own
ends; and that they have already got the greatest sway in all their consultations
and proceedings, of purpose to work our speedy ruine, if the Officers and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
will neither timely discern nor repent of it, and be no longer spurred on
and ridden with a full career by these Jesuiticall Furies, who fear a discovery
ere they have completed their work, and therefore make such post haste to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
it by the Armies present distempers, uncapable yet of better councel,
or timely informations, to recall them from their own approaching speedy ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
their ears being so deafned, and their brains so intoxicated with their Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suiticall
Enchantments, which all the Kingdom and world will now clearly
discover, and I hope the Officers and Army will do so too by this discovery of
them, and thereupon repent of all their violence and late proceedings, at which
the Papists at ROME and in forraign parts do much rejoyce and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
            <p>I shall close up all with these words of both <hi>Houses of Parliament</hi> in their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi>

CAN BE EXPECTED, <hi>unlesse God in mercy prevent it, and incline his
Majesties heart to the faithfull advice of his great Councel of Parliament</hi> (as now he
