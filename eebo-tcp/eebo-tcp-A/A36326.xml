         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ACcording to the ſeveral Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(nearer or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote)
wherein ye ſtood to
Mr. <hi>Benjamin Lindſey,</hi> when he was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with you, Nature and Reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
that ye must be differently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
<pb facs="tcp:93656:3"/>
as to Degrees, by his being by
Death removed from you, yet being ſo
much beloved and reſpected <hi>by you all,</hi>
it is eaſy to determine that his Death
was Matter of Sorrow <hi>to you all;</hi> but
the Religion ye all profeſs, and the
Chriſtian Doctrine ye all do own,
must be inſtructive to you, that ye
ſorrow, not as thoſe that have no Hope,
either that his Soul, being ſo Pious,
was not carried by Angels into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Boſom, or that his Body, that
ye carried and lodged in the <hi>Boſom
of the Earth,</hi> ſhould not be raiſed
again to a joyful Reſurrection, and be
hereafter, where the Soul at preſent
is, in Happineſs and Glory: Of which
Two Things, the believing Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould drie your weeping Eyes,
relieve your mourning Spirits, and
comfort your Sorrowful Hearts.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Mother</hi> I ſend this ſhort
following Advice:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you would not ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
that your Son's Body is gone down
<pb facs="tcp:93656:3"/>
to the Grave, as rejoice that his Soul
is gone up to Heaven: Not ſo much
mourn, that he whom you did bear,
bring forth, and bring up, is taken
from you, as be comforted that God
hath taken him to himſelf: As know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he is better pleaſed to be where
he is, and more Happy, than if he had
continued to be on Earth, with you,
and that he would not be from thence,
to come again to you: And let this
make you the leſs Sorrowful in this
World, becauſe his Soul is now trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
in the other, which is a better
World: for I ſuppoſe you loved your
Son better than to grieve at his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That conſidering the Greatneſs
of your Age you would clear your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
for Heaven, and not have
them to ſeek, when you ſhould have
them to ſhew, nor to get<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when you
ſhould have them to uſe for your more
comfortable Departure; that as you
are <hi>ſure</hi> your Body muſt go down to
your Son's Body, ſo you might be <hi>as
<pb facs="tcp:93656:4"/>
ſure</hi> that your Soul ſhall go up to his
Soul, that as he was where you are,
ſo you might be with God, where he
is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That you daily remember, you
are almoſt at your Journey's End; in
a Courſe of Nature ſo near the Door of
Eternity, that you <hi>cannot</hi> be much
longer in Time; therefore when you
cannot move ſo ſpeedily in Natural
Motion, run more ſwiftly in your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Race, that you might not fall
ſhort of the Joy and Crown that is ſet
before you.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That ſince your Son (now gone
from you) hath made ſuch competent
Proviſion for you, that you need not
ſpend your Breath in asking, What
ſhall I eat, or what ſhall I drink, or
wherewithal ſhall I be clothed? Your
Enquiries might be, How ſhall I love
God more, pleaſe him better, and be
more prepared for my Eternal State?
Since now <hi>you need not cark for
Earth, take more Care for Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93656:4"/>
5. That ſince you have more Benefit
of your Senſe of Seeing, than of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſupply the Defect of Hearing, by
your diligent Reading; and the leſs
you can hear Men ſpeak to you in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing,
the more do you ſpeak to God
in Praying; and the leſs Converſe you
can have with the Creature, the more
Communion do you deſire, get, and
maintain with God.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Reſt</hi> of you, let me be your
Remembrancer, that ye get a ſanctified
Improvement of this Breach by Death,
that God hath made amongst you,
that ye ſo mind Temporal, as not to
forget your Eternal Concerns, to
watch and be always ready, becauſe
the Son of Man might come, in an
Hour that ye think not of; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to follow him and others that are
gone before: to keep up the Power of
Godlineſs in your Hearts, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
it in your Lives: Seriouſly
and believingly to think of another
world, and every Day you live in this,
<pb facs="tcp:93656:5"/>
to ſtand in Time, and look into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
To be Good, and to do Good,
as he <hi>was, and did,</hi> that is taken from
you, whereof (in Part) ye have been
Eye-witneſſes: To live Holily, that
ye might die not only Peacably, but
alſo Triumphantly; as is his Prayer
for you, who deſires it might be yours
for him, who is,</p>

TO
HEAVEN.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Luke XVI. 22.</bibl>
               <q>And it came to paſs that the Beggar
died, and was carried by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
into Abraham's Boſom.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>SOME think it is not material
whether the Diſcourſe of our
Lord Jeſus concerning the Rich
Man and the Beggar, be taken
as a <hi>Parable,</hi> or an <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or compoſed
of <hi>both;</hi> when it is confeſſed, that under
this Narration, Chriſt deſcribes the
State of the Good and Bad in the other
World, and aſſerts the Exiſtence of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93656:6"/>
Soul, after its Separation from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and that it immediately paſſeth to
Heaven or Hell, before the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Body, and general Judgment
of the great Day.</p>
            <p>Tho' there was a Diſparity between
<hi>Lazarus</hi> ſpoken of in the Text, and our
Friend, whoſe Death is the Occaſion of
this Diſcourſe upon it, in regard of their
outward Circumſtances in this World;
yet if the latter be a Partaker of Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the former, in the other World,
I might eaſily be excuſed for chooſing
this as my Theme upon this ſad, but
righteous Providence: eſpecially, when
there is no other ſo expreſs to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
as this is.</p>
            <p>The Rich Man here ſpoken of, was
a voluptuous Sinner; who, while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
did live in outward Pomp; and,
when he died, was buried in great
State. The Poor Man was full of Sores,
and Hungry, while he lived; and no
mention is made of his Funeral, when
he died.</p>
            <p>The one was Rich on Earth, but now
a Beggar in Hell. The other a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
on Earth, but now Rich in
Heaven.</p>
            <p>The Poor Man, on Earth, begged for
ſome Crumbs at the Rich Man's Door;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93656:6"/>
but he could not obtain them. The
Rich Man, in Hell, begged for a Drop
of Water; but it was denied him.</p>
            <p>Some live and die Poor, and in a
State of Sin: Theſe have their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Things here, and hereafter too:
Miſery on Earth, and more in
Hell.</p>
            <p>Some live and die Rich,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 25</note> and finally
Impenitent: Theſe have their
Good Things here, and their Evil
Things hereafter: A ſhort Heaven
in this World, and a long Hell in
the next.</p>
            <p>Some live and die Poor, but in a
State of Grace: Theſe have their
Evil Things in this Life, and their
Good in the next: Short Miſery
on Earth, and long Felicity in
Heaven.</p>
            <p>Some live and die poſſeſt of a good
Eſtate, and in a State of Grace:
Theſe have their Good Things
here, and better hereafter: <hi>Now</hi>
ſome Earneſt, <hi>then</hi> actual Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>It is better to live and die in the
Depths of Poverty, and have the Soul
Everlaſtingly ſaved; than in the
Heigths of Proſperity, and the Soul E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
loſt. The worſt Condition of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93656:7"/>
a Child of God, be it never ſo bad, is
better than the beſt Condition of a
Wicked Man, be it never ſo good.</p>
            <p>In the Words of the Text Five Things
may be obſerved:
<list>
                  <item>1. The Paſſage of a Believer to the
Place of his Eternal Abode. He is <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,</hi>
or tranſported to it.</item>
                  <item>2. What of the Believer is carried to
that Place or State? And that is, the
Soul. <hi>He was carried;</hi> his Soul, not
<hi>then</hi> his Body. His Soul was tranſported,
his Body was left behind. The Soul is
carried at his Diſſolution; the Body
not till the Reſurrection.</item>
                  <item>3. Whither was the Soul carried;

but where ſhall it be? There are but

Two Places in the other World, where
Souls ſhall be,<hi> Heaven, </hi>or<hi> Hell. </hi>Do you
know in which? Or do not you think

Lodging in boiling Lead or Oyl, or
burning Brimſtone, will cauſe you to
cry out,<hi> I am uneaſy, I am uneaſy in my

But if I may not go back to my old Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
in that World from whence I came,
Let me ſeek a cooler Lodging where I am;
Let me rove from one ſide of Hell unto the
other, if I might find ſome eaſy Corner,
where I may a while be free from Pain and

I cannot! Every Nook is Hot, is Hot, is

Devils follow me; and the Fire burns me
to what Place ſoever I haſten; and there is
no Hope; O Deſperate Caſe! there is no

Hope, either of Deliverance, or Mitigation
of my Miſery. Die I would, but cannot;
ceaſe to be I would, but muſt not. Curſed
Caitiff that I am, in this Extremity I muſt
lie and lodge to all Eternity.</hi>

comfortable would this Knowledge be,
on a dying Bed, when you ſhall ſay,
This Tabernacle muſt be taken down,

            </p>

the Soul of this Beggar, who could not
obtain the leaſt Alms at the Rich Man's
Gate, into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, where
his Wants were all preſently ſupplied.
The Rich Man was a Churl; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was Charitable. The Poor Man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93656:11"/>
was carried from the Churl's Door, to

            <p n="4">4. From the <hi>Imperfection of their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
Here our Faith is ſo feeble, our
Love to God and Chriſt ſo little, our
Delight ſo ſmall, our Knowledge ſo
ſhort, our Deſires ſo faint, our Hope ſo
wavering, and all our Graces in ſuch
low Degrees, that we often call all into
Queſtion, doubt of our Sincerity, fear
Hipocriſy, and think our Attainments
great, if we mourn the more, becauſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93656:12"/>
we love no more; and have more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to deſire more; and ſorrow the
more, becauſe we delight in God and
Chriſt, and Fore-views of the glorious
State Above no more. And theſe make
us more reſtleſs on our Sick Beds, becauſe
our Souls are Sick, as well as our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and our inward Man as Weak as
our outward Man is: And too many,
inſtead of departing in Triumph, with
Aſſurance of Salvation, breath out their
Souls with mourning Complaints and
Fears, concerning their future Eternal
State; leaving the World with theſe
piercing Queſtions, <hi>Is God mine? Is
Chriſt mine? Shall Heaven be mine? I
am going, but I know not whither. I muſt
I muſt leave all my deareſt Friends in this

doth it ſtay in any other ſuppoſed Place,
but is inſtantly on its Journey to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and immediately paſſeth into the

            <p>The ſure Word of God doth aſſure

we muſt grant the other, ſince it is ſo

            <p>Deſigning Brevity in this, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alledge a few Texts that do confirm
it:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke 23. 43. Jeſus ſaid unto him, Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I ſay unto thee, to day ſhalt thou be with

(the penitent dying Thief.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Manner of his Aſſertion. Verily,</hi> I
ſay unto thee: A Word of Aſſeveration
commonly uſed by Chriſt, in Matters
of great, undoubted Certainty and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Thing Aſſerted. To Day ſhalt

            </p>
            <p>Where obſerve,
<list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Place</hi> ſpoken of: That is, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe;
that is, the Third Heaven,
where God doth manifeſt his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Preſence. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Man caught up to the
Third Heaven, preſently ſubjoins,
<hi>He was caught up into Paradiſe:</hi> by
Two Words intending one and the
ſame Place: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2, 4.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Who</hi> ſhould be in that Place of
Paradiſe: Thou that art now a

Soul; for of his Body it could not
be underſtood.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>With whom</hi> the penitent Thief
ſhould be in Paradiſe: With Chriſt.
Thou that art with me on the

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The different Pointing of the Words,
corrupting the Senſe, is ſuch a bold At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
that ſhould it be admitted in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Places, as the Oppoſers of the Soul's
immediate paſſing into Glory, ſawcily
do in this, it would be ſuch a mangling
of the Scripture, that we ſhould be at
a Loſs to know the Meaning of many
plain Texts.</p>
            <p>What need had Chriſt to ſpeak the
Words thus; <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee to
day?</hi> Did not he know Chriſt then ſpake
to him? Did not he hear him? And
did he hear him that Day, and could
not he tell that Chriſt ſpake to him that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93656:17"/>
day, except Chriſt added, to Day I ſay
unto thee? What need Chriſt add his
aſſerting <hi>Verily,</hi> to theſe Words, <hi>I ſay
unto thee to day?</hi> Could not the Thief
truſt his own Ears, that he then heard
Chriſt ſay to him, except Chriſt add,
<hi>Verily,</hi> I do aſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure thee that it is to day
that I ſay this to thee?</p>
            <p>Which is greater Ground of Support
and Comfort to a dying Penitent, to
acquaint him, I ſay unto thee to Day,
thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe; but
I do not tell thee when, nor how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Thouſand Years hence, this ſhall be
thy Happineſs; or thus, <hi>Verily I ſay to
thee, to day,</hi> this very Day, <hi>thou ſhalt be
with me in Paradiſe?</hi> It is but a Dream,
that the Soul ſhall ſleep when a Man
dies.</p>
            <p>A Second Text is,<hi> 2 Cor. 5. 6. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are always confident, knowing that
whilſt we are at home in the Body, we are
abſent from the Lord, </hi>Ver. 8. <hi>We are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
I ſay, and willing rather to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from the Body, and to be preſent with
the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here note:</p>
            <p n="1">1. While the Soul is in the Body, we
are in our Earthly Home.</p>
            <p n="2">2. While the Soul is in its Earthly
Home, it is abſent from its true Home,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93656:18"/>
which is in Heaven, from the Viſion
and Fruition of God in Glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Soul doth leave its Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Home, it goeth to its Heavenly Home:
for when it is abſent from the Body, it
ſhall be preſent with the Lord, in the
Glorious Enjoyment of him to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Oppoſition of theſe Two is
immediate. To be preſent in the Body
is to be abſent from the Lord: To be
abſent from the Body, is to be preſent
with the Lord.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Confidence of the Apoſtle
that there is ſuch a Glorious State, which
is the reaſon of our Willingneſs to leave
the Body, that from thenceforth we
might be with the Lord in Heaven. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Souls <hi>immediate paſſing</hi> to God in
Glory, and you take away the Reaſon
of the Choice, rather to be abſent from
the Body, than to be preſent in it.</p>
            <p>The Third Text is,<hi> Phil. 1. 23. </hi>For<hi>I am in a Straight betwixt two; having a
deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which
is far better. </hi>Note,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Apoſtle's Straight.</hi> Two things
were before him, to live or die, Reaſons
ſwaying him ſometimes to the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to the other: For the Good of
God's Church, it would be better for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93656:18"/>
him to live than die, Ver. 22. For his
own Advantage, it would be better for
him to die than to live, Ver. 21. This
was his Straight.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>own Inclination,</hi> and vehement
Deſire, in reſpect to himſelf, that he
would chuſe rather to depart, than to
continue upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Reaſon</hi> of his Deſire and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs
to depart, that he may be with
Chriſt: But there would be no Reaſon
in this Reaſon, if by departing, he ſhould
be nothing the ſooner with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Preference</hi> of one State before
the other, or the comparing of the one
with the other: It is better to die and
be with Chriſt. There is an excellent
Gradation in the Text:</p>
            <p>It is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, better.</p>
            <p>It is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, far better.</p>
            <p>It is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, far better by
much.</p>
            <p>But if a Believer die, and the Soul
is not the ſooner with Chriſt, than if he
had lived longer, it would not have
been better but worſe, for while the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
lived he had himſelf much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, but if he departed,
and not with Chriſt, he had none.</p>
            <p>While he lived he was uſeful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to the Church on Earth, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93656:19"/>
after his Departure he could not.</p>
            <p>While he lived he did glorify God on
Earth; but if he departed, and
went not to Chriſt, he could not
glorify him, neither on Earth, nor in
Heaven.</p>
            <p>While he lived, he knew God, and
loved him, and delighted in him,
and was ſenſible of God's Love to
him; but if he departed and went
not to Chriſt, he was capable of
none of theſe; and ſo ſtill it was
worſe, far worſe, far worſe by much,
to depart than live.</p>
            <p>This might be largely improved by
way of uſe, which I hope you will pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically
uſe in all your Ways, though I
cannot ſtay to ſpeak, what ye ſhould,
and I hope you will do, if you keep in
Remembrance, that a pious ſeparated
Soul is preſently on his Journey to the
higheſt Heavens, and who ſhall be his
Convoy thither: Which was my firſt
Deſign in chuſing this Text, to
entertain your thinking Minds upon
this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>IV. Obſervation,<hi> The Holy Angels of
God are the Bearers that carry the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Souls of Believers into Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:93656:19"/>
Men take care for the Bearers of the
Body, when dead: God takes care
for the Bearers of the Soul, when
departed.</p>
            <p>Men are Bearers that carry the Body
to the Grave: Angels are the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that carry the Soul to Glory.</p>
            <p>Men mourning follow the Corpſe to
the Houſe appointed for all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
Angels triumphing go along
with the Soul to the Manſions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for all the Believing.</p>
            <p>The Miniſtration of Angels, for the
Good of Believers, is aſſerted in general,
in<hi> Heb. 1. 14. </hi>Are<hi> they not all miniſtring
Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them, who
ſhall be Heirs of Salvation? </hi>Where may
be noted,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Nature of Angels:</hi> They are
Spirits, intellectual, immaterial, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and active Creatures; the nobleſt and
moſt refined Part of God's Creation:
more excellent than Man; yet Servants
to Chriſt their Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Their Office:</hi> They are Miniſtring
Spirits.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Their Number:</hi> All of them are ſo,
if there be Degrees and Orders among
them, all and every one of them, from
the higheſt to the loweſt are God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
waiting and attending upon him,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93656:20"/>
to go and come as he appoints, for the
Good of the People of God, whoſe
Fellow-ſervants they own themſelves to
be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. and 22. 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Their Commiſſion:</hi> Being ſent before
they go, they muſt have their Warrant
from God, before they move; <hi>Pſal. 103.
20. Bleſs the Lord, ye his Angels, that
excell in Strength, that do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hearkening to the Voice of his Word:</hi>
tho' they have Power to Act, yet they
muſt not, nor do they ſtir, without a
Command from God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Their Execution:</hi> They are ſent, and
then they Miniſter; They hearken to
the Voice of his Word, and then they
do his Commands.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Object</hi> of their Miniſtration,
or the Perſons they are charged with:
Such as ſhall be Heirs of Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Angel</hi> is a Word not ſo much to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
their Nature as their Office, that is
to ſay, they are Meſſengers, to go at the
Command of their Sovereign Lord, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Errands from Heaven to Earth,
and back again from Earth to Heaven;
<hi>Gen. 28. 12. And he dreamed, and behold
a Ladder ſet upon the Earth, and the Top
of it reached to Heaven, and behold,
the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending
on it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:93656:20"/>
The Miniſtration of Angels in the
Behalf of thoſe that ſhall be Heirs of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
from their Birth to their Death,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 10. Judg. 13. 3, 4, 5. Luke 1. 11, 13, <hi>to</hi> 18.</note>
(yea, and ſometimes before their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception)
is copiouſly treated of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but from <hi>their Death to their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to Heaven,</hi> and afterwards, is more
ſparingly mentioned; but one Saying
of Chriſt (as this concerning the Poor
Man's Soul) is ſufficient Evidence of
their conveying of them from the Place
where they die, to the Place where they
ſhall live for ever.</p>
            <p>It will be needful, to more clear Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedings
about the Angels conveying the
Souls of Believers, from their Death, to
the Place and State of Happineſs, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
ſome Propoſitions; which are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God by <hi>his abſolute Power</hi> is
able to do thoſe things, which in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
courſe of Providence, he maketh
uſe of ſecond Cauſes, to accompliſh and
bring to paſs. What he doth by Means,
he can do without any Means; he hath
tied us to the uſe of Means, which he
himſelf is not obliged, thro' any need of
them,<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 28. 1 King. 19. 8.</note> to make uſe of. So by his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
he ſupported <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> Forty
Days, without Eating or Drinking; yet
in the ordinary Way of God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that we might live, we muſt both
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93656:21"/>
Eat and Drink. Therefore when we
ſpeak of the Conveyance of Souls, by
the Miniſtration of Angels, to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Boſom, it is not to be thought, that he
could not do it without them tho' he
doth it by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Good Pleaſure</hi> of God is the
higheſt and moſt ſatisfying Reaſon, why
he that could ſafe-guard Souls to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by his own Almighty Power, will
have them conveyed thither by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
of his Holy Angels. To the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,
that ſeeks for Reaſons in the moſt
ſublime Myſteries of Religion (as Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Special Redemption, Effectual
Vocation, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> why one, and not
another, is an Inſtance of God's
Grace; the Anſwer, That it is God's
good Pleaſure, is, and ought to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory;
<hi>Mat. 11. 25, 26. Eph.</hi> 1. 5, 11.
and this good Pleaſure of God is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Armies of Heaven, as well
as to the Inhabitants of the Earth, <hi>Dan.</hi>
4. 35.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God's <hi>good Pleaſure,</hi> in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Angels and Men, is made
known, not only in <hi>his Word,</hi> but alſo
by the Events of his <hi>Providence:</hi> In our
preſent Caſe, Chriſt relates it as a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact done by the Angels, that
they did carry the Soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> into
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93656:21"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom. Now we know, what
Holy Angels do, is God's Pleaſure they
ſhould do; for they do nothing but
what doth pleaſe him. That Angels
ſhould convey his Soul to Heaven, was
God's good Pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As it is God's good Pleaſure to give
the Kingdom, not to Men, as Men;
but <hi>as</hi> believing, ſanctified Men; and
ſo to every one that is ſuch, to one, as
well as another: So it is the good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of God, that his Holy Angels ſhould
convey Souls to this Kingdom, not as
Souls, but <hi>as</hi> believing, ſanctified Souls;
and ſo every Soul that is ſuch, one as
well as another.</p>
            <p>It might be thought by ſome, that
from this Particular Inſtance, of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
carrying <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Soul to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
an univerſal Concluſion cannot
be gathered, that they thus Miniſter to
all other godly ſeparared Souls.</p>
            <p>But what may be ſpoken of one Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual,
under this Reduplication (as
ſuch) of any Kind, may be ſpoken of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Individual of the ſame Kind. As
this individual Perſon <hi>(Peter) as</hi> a Man,
is a rational Creature: Therefore, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, that is a Man, is a rational
Creature. By which, here I mean the
ſame with <hi>Animal Rationale,</hi> in Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93656:22"/>
on from Angels, it being nothing to my
purpoſe to debate, whether they may
be called <hi>Rational,</hi> as well as <hi>Intellectual</hi>
Creatures.</p>
            <p>So this individual Perſon <hi>(Abraham)</hi>
was Juſtified, not <hi>as</hi> a Man, but <hi>as</hi> a
believing Man: Therefore every Man
that is a believing Man, is Juſtified; and
thus the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> draws an Univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all Believers,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 23, 24.</note> from what was
written in the particular Caſe of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
as,</hi> a Believer; For from a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<hi>as ſuch,</hi> the Conſequence is good
<hi>to all and every one that is ſuch.</hi> Which
Axiom is commonly allowed.</p>
            <p>In the Matter before us, it is certain,
Holy Angels did not carry <hi>Lazarus</hi> his
Soul to Heaven, <hi>as</hi> a Soul; for then
they ſhould carry <hi>all</hi> Souls thither: But
<hi>as</hi> it was an Holy Soul; and if a Soul <hi>as</hi>
Holy, ſhall by Angels be conducted to
Glory; then <hi>every Soul</hi> that <hi>is Holy,</hi> ſhall
be ſo conveyed alſo.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Angels conveying Holy ſeparated
Souls to Heaven, doth not detract any
thing from the Glory of God; but doth
rather make it the more manifeſt, and
is ſubſervient thereunto. For,</p>
            <p>Chriſt is their only Saviour, Angels
their Carriers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:93656:22"/>
Chriſt is their Commander herein,
they his Servants to do it.</p>
            <p>Chriſt by Angels brings Souls to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
that Happineſs, which ſo many
Angels fell from.</p>
            <p>Chriſt, as Mediator, is exalted above
thoſe Noble Creatures.</p>
            <p>Chriſt manifeſts his conſtant Love to,
and Care of the Souls of all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
till he puts them into the
actual Poſſeſſion of what he hath
purchaſed for them: Chriſt came
himſelf from Heaven to procure
it, and ſends his Angels from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to fetch them to it: And this
will be made more manifeſt, by
conſidering the uſeful Service of
the Miniſtration of Angels, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
Holy Souls into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Holy Angels are the <hi>Guides</hi> of
ſeparated Souls, in their Journey to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It is a long Journey from a dying Bed
on Earth, to the Heaven of Heavens:
The one being diſtant from the other,
ſome Millions of Miles, and a Way the
Soul never went before, and to it, an
unbeaten Path; it ſtands in need of a
Guide, to direct it in its Way, which
is well known unto the Angels, that
have ſo often gone to and fro, from the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93656:23"/>
one to the other. Many Paſſengers in
a Ship, from hence to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi>
thro' the vaſt and wide Ocean, will
need a Pilot to ſteer their Courſe, or
elſe might never arrive to their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and deſired Harbour: So the Soul
that is to paſs through the vaſt Regions
of the fluid Air, in a longer Voyage, (in
reſpect of Diſtance) will need ſome to
conduct it, that it might not miſs its
Way. It may be, it goes out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
not knowing whither it is going,
and how then ſhould it know its Way?
Therefore God that hath ſent his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to direct and proſper the Way of his
Servants on a Journey from one Place
to another upon Earth, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 7, 40.)
will much more ſend his Angels to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their Souls, in their Travel from
Earth to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Angels are ſent to be the <hi>Guard</hi> of
ſeparated ſanctified Souls. They are to
paſs through the Devils Territories, who
is the Prince of the Power of the Air,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 3. where are numerous and
powerful unclean Spirits, which are
Principalities and Powers, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Wickedneſſes in high Places, <hi>Eph. 6.
12.</hi> Theſe would intercept the Holy
Soul, in its Journey Home to Heaven;
but Holy Angels are its Guard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93656:23"/>
it through the Hoſts of Devils, and
protect it as it paſſeth along.</p>
            <p>This hath been the frequent Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Angels for the Safety of God's
People from their Enemies in this Life:
As when <hi>Jacob</hi> was to meet his Brother
<hi>Eſau,</hi> who did reſolve to kill him; <hi>Gen.</hi>
32. 1, 2. Jacob <hi>went on his Way, and the
Angel of God met him, and he ſaid, this
is God's Hoſts; and he called the Name of
the Place, Mahaniam, i.e.</hi> Two Hoſts,
or Two Camps; the one to go before,
the other behind him, or one on the
one ſide, and the other on the other,
to keep him ſafe from Danger every
way.</p>
            <p>If God ſend his Angels to guard his
Servants in this Life, when in Danger
of their Enemies, will he not much
more to defend their ſeparated Souls in
their Paſſage to Heaven, when they are
to paſs through the Air, where Devils
do ſwarm? eſpecially if theſe Things
be conſidered:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> When the Hoſt of Devils that
the Soul is to paſs through, is far more
<hi>numerous,</hi> than <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Company againſt
<hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When Devils are more <hi>impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable</hi>
againſt the ſeparated Soul, than
<hi>Eſau</hi> was againſt <hi>Jacob;</hi> for he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93656:24"/>
to him; but Devils never will
to Holy Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When Devils are more <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful</hi>
to act againſt the ſeparated Soul
on its way, than <hi>Eſau</hi> and all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he was
on his Way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When the <hi>Danger</hi> at the
moſt, that God's People are in from
Wicked Men, is the Life of the Body,
but without doubt, ſuch is the Malice of
Devils againſt holy Souls ſeparated from
their Bodies on their way to Heaven,
that if not defended, they would ſeize
them, to keep them from Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When this is the <hi>Last Seaſon</hi>
they ſhall ever have to make any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon the Holy ſeparated Soul,
which when once entered into Heaven's
Gates, ſhall be aſſaulted no more for
Ever.</p>
            <p>Tho' the War with Devils, in ſome
Reſpects, might be over as ſoon as the
Soul is ſeparated from the Body, that
it ſhall be no longer managed by the
ſame Subtilties, alluring Temptations,
Fleſhly Enticements, evil Suggeſtions,
ſenſible objective Snares; yet I conceive,
in other Reſpects, the War is not end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
till the Soul is ſafely arrived in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93656:24"/>
Heaven, but is carried on in a different
Manner, to what it was in the Body:
When in the Body, he aſſaulted the
Soul not by Violence, but Perſuaſion;
out of the Body, he knows it will be in
vain to aſſault by Perſuaſion, therefore
on its Way would ſeize it by Violence,
did not God, by his Angels, powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſerve it.<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 9, 28, 29.</note> For as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his

when they had eſcaped out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to

Waters to <hi>Iſrael</hi> to paſs thro', and ſhut
them upon <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> ſo Devils will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
the Soul to the Gates of Heaven,
till God open to the Soul, and ſhut them
againſt the Soul's Purſuers.</p>
            <p>For as there are Principalities and
Powers of Hell, that way-lay the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

Powers of Heaven are ready to ſecure
it.<note place="margin">

3. God's <hi>Love to, and Care of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
is manifeſted in the Miniſtration of
Angels, in that they are charged to be
their Keepers in all their Ways, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
91. 11, 12. Now the Way of Believers
is Two-fold, and they are to keep them
in both, or elſe they do not keep them

            </list>
            <p>Is it likely God ſhould charge his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
with them, to keep them from
Dangers, while they keep in the way
of Duty, and give them a diſcharge
from keeping them on their way to their
Reward? eſpecially when they are in
Danger of Devils, not only in the way
of their Duty; but alſo (paſſing thro'
their Territories) on their Way to their
Reward, paſſing from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Do not the Angels of the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp
round about them that fear him,
to deliver them? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 7. Do not
ſeparated Souls, on their Paſſage, fear
God with an holy, reverential Fear, as
well as when they were in their Bodies,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93656:25"/>
and much more, and ſo have ſtill the
Qualification of ſuch as are the Objects
of Angels Miniſtration? Do they now
encamp round about them on every
ſide, to deliver them from Danger,
while they are liable thereunto, and
will they decamp from them on every
ſide, to deliver them no more, tho' ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with Dangers after Death, till
their Souls enter into Heaven?</p>
            <p>Eſpecially when their deareſt Friends
that take care of the Burial of the Body,
can be no help to the ſeparated Soul, in
its Travel to Heaven. Their Friends
and Relations that miniſtred to them
when ſick, and on their dying Beds, till
the Moment they gave up the Ghoſt,
from that Inſtant have no more that they
can do unto, or for their Souls; no, not
ſo much as by their Prayers for them:
And will Angels then forſake them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and afford them no more Help on
their way to Heaven, than their Friends,
whom they have left behind can do?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Holy Angels <hi>promote</hi> and <hi>rejoice</hi> at
the <hi>Converſion</hi> of God's Elect, becauſe
then they have a Right and Title to

care where to lodge his Soul at Night;

ſo many ſo ſtrong, to one ſo weak? Are all
of one Mind? Are ye all agreed to hurry me
to Hell? Is there not one amongst you all
will ſtand my Friend? Not one to take my
Part, to be on my Side? Alas for me! Tho'
they are many, they are as one. How ſtrange
is this! that a Legion of Devils ſhould be ſo
unanimous in my Ruine, that all are called
by one Name, as if many were one! </hi>As the

               <p n="3">3. This will aggravate the Sorrow,
the Soul in its Paſſage to its long and
doleful Home will be filled with, That
<hi>theſe Carriers are ſo ſwift and active in their

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe <hi>by flight it cannot eſcape

evil Spirits are ſuch agile, ſwift,
and active Creatures, that move ſo faſt,
that the Soul cannot be more ſpeedy
than they: Tho' Holy Angels, as they
are ſtronger, ſo they are ſwifter than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate
Spirits, being more able, ready
and ſpeedy to protect and defend us,
than Fallen Angels are to hurt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
us;<note place="margin">Iſay. 6. 2. 6.</note> and therefore the Good are
ſaid to have <hi>Wings,</hi> (which, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
is not ſpoken of the Bad); yet
theſe <hi>Infernal Spirits</hi> are ſo much ſpeedier
in their Motion, than the Soul, that it
can have no Hope of preventing their
tranſporting of it from the dying Bed, to
its Lodging in the Flames of Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, </hi>Becauſe by them it will be
brought<hi> ſo ſoon </hi>to the Place of Torment.
Men on Earth ſin ſo much, ſwear ſo
faſt, and run in the Ways of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as tho' they could not get to Hell<hi>ſure </hi>enough, nor<hi> ſoon </hi>enough: But
when they have done ſinning upon
Earth, and are on their Way to their
Eternal Miſerable State, they will think
Devils put them on<hi> too faſt, </hi>and carry
them with too much ſpeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to that Place
where their Entertainment will be ſo
bad. We may imagine the ſeparated
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93656:30"/>
Soul, in the Devil's Arms, to lament it
ſelf, ſaying<hi> What! Is my Journey like
to be ſo ſhort, when my Journey's End will
be ſo bad? Am I going whither I would not,
and yet do theſe Carriers make ſuch haſte?
muſt I thus be poſted to ſuch grievous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whence I ſhall never be delivered?
Tho' the Way be ſo uncomfortable; yet the
Place will be ſo much more, when I come
thither; therefore let me move more ſlowly
to it: Tho' I have an Hell within me, on my
way to Hell; yet, O that it might be a
Thouſand Years before I enter into it! but I
wiſh in vain; for this ſwift Motion will
quickly bring me to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The<hi> Inſultings </hi>of the Devils over
their<hi> Priſoner, </hi>will aggravate its Miſery
on the Way to Hell; when, as they
carry it along, ſhall reproach it to this
purpoſe,<hi> Here is the Fool we took captive
at our Pleaſure! Here is the Soul that had
no more Wit than to ſtop his Ears to the Calls
of Mercy, to the Offers of Grace, to the
Tenders of a Saviour, to the Commands of
God: God called him to repent, but he
would not; God commanded him to believe,
but he did not: We perſuaded him to ſin,
and he did; we enticed him, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented;
we ſuggeſted, and he yielded. We
have him, we have him; away with him,
away with him; he is condemned, make

haſte, away with him to the Place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:
We led him with a String, we drew
him with a ſingle Thread, when in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
whither we liſted, but now we have him

art waited for, make haſte and come
away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Moreover, the<hi> Mercileſs Nature of
the Devils, </hi>will add to the Amazement
of the Soul in his Paſſage to the Place
where it ſhall find no Mercy. As the
Damn'd in Hell cry out for Mercy, for
a ſmall Meaſure of Mercy, as may be
in a Drop of Water,<hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 16. 24, 25.</note> 
                  </hi>and no Mercy ſhall
be ſhewn to them: ſo the ſeparated
Soul on its Way thither, tho' it cry to
its Tranſporters for the leaſt Favour,
ſhall find none. Might not we ſuppoſe
it to cry out and ſay,<hi> What! Will nothing
ſerve you but my Ruine! will nothing 
pleaſe you but my Damnation! Will nothing
ſatisfy you, </hi>but that I<hi> be made as miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as your ſelves! have Pity upon me, if
ye have any Pity in you, have Pity upon
me! All I have, I would give, that I may
find ſome Mercy from you. Thou ſilly Soul!
Thou haſt nothing left to offer unto us, to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93656:31"/>
ſpare thee, or to ſhew any Kindneſs to thee,
that we ſhould let thee go: Death hath
ſtripped thee of all, and thou art fallen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
into our Hands: But it was thy ſelf and
not thy Money we deſired: Thy Friends have
got thy Money, and did let thee go, but we
have gotten thee, and will not let thee go.
Oh miſerable Soul that I am! Did I ſerve
you ſo conſtantly, ſo heartily, ſo chearfully,
when in my Body; and do ye ſerve me ſo
cruelly, ſo unkindly, ſo unmercifully, as
ſoon as I am ſeparated from my Body! Is
there none to whom I might look for a little
Mercy? Is there none in whom I might hope
for help and Succour, in this diſtreſſed Caſe
that I am in? Let me turn mine Eyes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way, if I may ſee any hope of Help, when
this Company I am fallen into, will afford
me none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If I look back to thoſe <hi>my Friends,</hi>
that loved me dearly, that miniſtred to
me conſtantly, Night and Day, while I
was with them; that parted with me
with weeping Eyes, with wringing
Hands, with ſorrowful Hearts, cannot
they relieve me? Cannot they give Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
to me? When I was with them,
they did Comfort me; when I was Sick,
they gave me Cordials; when I was in
Pain, they did turn me, hoping I might
have Eaſe; when I was afraid to Die,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93656:32"/>
they ſpake Words of Comfort to me.
But now, <hi>Woe is me!</hi> being ſeparated
from my Body, I am out of their reach,
I am paſt their Help, I am no more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving,<note place="margin">Pſal. 49. 7, 8.</note> nor they of afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Benefit unto me. They are in
Time, I am entred into Eternity; they
are in one World, I am now in another,
and there is no Converſe I can have with
them, and there is no Kindneſs they
can ſhew to me.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they might be ignorant of my
Caſe, they might not know what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
I am fallen into, nor what is the
way that I am going: Nay, they might
be deceived, thinking I am travelling
to Heaven; when, alas! I find I am
poſting to Hell: Suppoſing the Holy
Angels of God are carrying me to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and therefore ſay, <hi>Our Loſs is his
Gain:</hi> While we are left in Trouble, he
is going to his Eternal Reſt: and ſo
they do not ſo much as pity my Caſe;
and tho' they are weeping over my dead
Body, yet they do not Mourn becauſe
of the Miſery that I am in, when they
imagine I am on the Way to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
tho' I find, I know, I am ſure I
am on the Road that leadeth to Eternal
Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tho' theſe Devils of Hell
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93656:32"/>
that ſeized me, are mercileſs Devils,
yet the <hi>God of Heaven</hi> is a merciful God,
may I look up to him, and cry, Moſt
Merciful Lord, behold my Miſery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
my deep Diſtreſs; behold me, if
ever, now behold me and have Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
on me! See whither this Troop,
this Hoſt of Internal Spirits are carrying
me; Stop them, oh! ſtop them in their
Way! or, if <hi>they</hi> will, and muſt to Hell,
let not <hi>me</hi> go with them: Reſcue, O
reſcue me out of their Hands, while on
the Way; for if I enter thro' the Gates
of Hell, and they be ſhut upon me, there
will be no coming back for Ever: no
Hope, no Help for Ever.</p>
               <p>But alas! Woe is me! I call in vain,
I Cry in vain, my Petition is in vain:
Devils now can tell me, and Conſcience
now doth tell me, it is too late, and as they
do tell me, ſo I find that now it is too
late, if I had begged ſooner, I might have
ſpeeded better: Mercy once, yea often
begged of me, and I would not accept
of Mercy: now I beg, and cry, and
call for Mercy, and the God of Mercy
doth deny me Mercy. Mercy hath
done with me, and Patience hath done
with me, and Grace will have no more
to do with me; but Wrath will, and
Vengeance will, and Juſtice hath and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93656:33"/>
will have to do with me for Ever; God
is now inexorable, his Wrath is now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable,
his Anger againſt me, is never
to be appeas'd.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 25, 26.</note> The Adverſaries have
haled me to the Judge, the Judge hath
delivered me to theſe Officers, that have
their Commiſſion from him to caſt me
into Priſon, to which I am now on my
way; from which I ſhall never return,
till I ſhall pay the uttermoſt Farthing,
which will never be. The Merciful God
hath ſealed their Warrant to apprehend
me, and they have ſerved it upon me,
and to carry me to the Place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and I am with them upon my
Way unto it, without all Hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve,
or Pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> May I not with better hope
look unto Chriſt, that he that is the
Way to Heaven might pity me, and
ſtop me in my Way to Hell. It was he
that came down from the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to prevent Sinners going down to
the loweſt Hell. It was he that was Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
Arraigned, Accuſed, Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Crucified, that Sinners might
be releaſed, diſcharged, and acquitted
from the Guilt and Puniſhment of Sin.
It was he that delivered Men that were
poſſeſſed with Devils, rebuked them
and caſt them out, and freed them from
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93656:33"/>
their Power. O that Chriſt would Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
me! O that he would have Mercy
on me! O that he would ſhew ſome
Bowels of Compaſſion to me, <hi>now,</hi> even
<hi>now,</hi> before I am actually lodged in the
Flames of Hell!</p>
               <p>But this Cry, <hi>Poor Wretch that I am!</hi>
this calling alſo is in vain; for he did
not die to ſave Finally-impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and <hi>curſed I</hi> was ſuch an one: He
did not deſign to ſave ſuch Souls that left
their Bodies, Unbelieving and Unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
and yet I did ſo, <hi>curſed Caitiff!</hi> I
did ſo. He would have ſtopped me in
my Courſe and Way of Sin, but I would
and did go forward; and now he will
not ſtop me on my Way to Hell, but I
muſt go forwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It will be much more vain
for me, ſeized by theſe Evil Angels, to
look to the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> of God for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and Relief: For they are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
Spirits for the Heirs of Salvation,
but I am an Heir of Hell: They are his
Servants to execute his Will againſt the
Servants of Sin and Satan, and ſuch an
one I was, all the time of my Life of
Trial:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 24.</note> As they ſtood with flaming
Swords, which turned every Way, to
keep fallen Man from the Tree of Life,
ſo they ſtand, as ſet by God, with Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93656:34"/>
Swords, turning every Way, to
keep unſanctified Souls from entring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Way into Eternal Bleſſed Life. Nay,
they are to gather out of his Kingdom
ſuch as work Iniquity,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 41, 42.</note> and to caſt them
into the Furnace of Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Still will it be in vain for me
on my Way to Hell, to look to <hi>Holy
Souls</hi> lodged in Heaven; as it was for
the Rich Man in Torments, to look to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in Glory. My
Friends (when I and they did live on
Earth) did often reprove, exhort, and
counſel me, did then pity me, and
mourn over me, becauſe they ſaw me
walk in the Ways of Sin, and longed for
my Converſion and turning unto God;
they died before me, and were carried
by Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I alſo was ſeparated from my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and Devils are carrying me to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Torments, which they in Heaven
do not know, or if they do, they are ſo
far from pitying of me, that they rejoice
in the Righteous Judgments of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all his implacable Enemies, how near
ſoever they were related to them.</p>
               <p>If I then on my Paſſage to my dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Home, am ſuch a forſaken Soul, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
of God, forſaken of Chriſt, forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of all in Heaven and on Earth, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93656:34"/>
am ſurprized by this Hoſt of Devils, there
is no hope, the Way is bad, the End
will be worſe, without End: <hi>O forlorn!
forlorn! What a forlorn Soul am I!</hi> I and
all my Friends are ſeparated; my Body
and I am ſeparated; my Hopes and I
am ſeparated; my Body is left to be
Meat for Worms, and I am taken as a
Prey to Devils; my Body will be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by Men to a cold Grave, and I am
carrying by Devils to an hot Hell, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
hot, where my Pain will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme,

               <p>Who can tell the Greetings, the Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
betwixt theſe Glorious Angels and
the Gracious Soul, at their firſt Meeting,
after its Separation from the Body? All
Hail, O Bleſſed Soul! Haſt thou fought
a good Fight? We are come to carry
thee in Triumph. Haſt thou run thy
Race? We are appointed to fetch thee
to thy incorruptible Crown. Haſt
thou finiſhed thy Courſe? We are
ſent to conduct thee to thy Eternal
Reſt. The Soul might be conceived to
reply, what Joy am I filled with at this
your Salutation! O ye Holy Ones, how
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93656:37"/>
glad am I to ſee you? ye Men of God,
ye Sons of God, how do I rejoice to
meet you? Are the Gods, the Hoſt of
God, come to guard me on my way to
Glory? Are theſe <hi>Seraphims</hi> flaming
with Zeal for God, burning in Love to
me, come to take me newly ſeparated
from my Body, to convey me to my
Manſion in my Father's Houſe? Are
theſe Cherubims, Thrones, Dominions,
Principalities and Powers come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me from the Principalities and
Powers of Hell, and from the Spiritual
Wickedneſſes in high Places, through
whoſe Territories I am to paſs, unto the
Place and Happineſs purchaſed, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and prepared for me? O how glad
am I of your Company in this long
Journey I am to go! How am I rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
I ſhall have your Conduct in this
Way I never went before?</p>
               <p>And Bleſſed, for ever Bleſſed be my
God, that hath ſent his Angels to be my
Guide and Guard. I muſt Praiſe him,
I muſt Praiſe him before I get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
who hath ſent ſuch a glorious Train
to lead me to it: This is the Hoſt of that
God that I did love, and ſerve, and
Truſt and hope in: This is the Army of
that God of Heaven, to whom I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
my ſelf, and reſigned my ſelf,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93656:37"/>
when I was parting with my Body on
my dying Bed: He hath not forgot me,
nor his Promiſes that he made unto me:
when my Father, my Mother, and all
my Friends forſook me, becauſe they
could go no further with me, he hath
ſent his Angels to take me up. O the
Difference betwixt the Company that I
have lest, and this which I have found!</p>
               <p>In the Body I was in Company with
ſinful Men, which were my Grief;
out of the Body I am in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with Holy Angels, which is
my Joy.</p>
               <p>In the Body I did converſe with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Saints; now out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
with pure, ſpotleſs Angels.</p>
               <p>In the Body I was with mourning
Friends; out of the Body, with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
Angels.</p>
               <p>In the Body I was with weak, tho'
loving Relations, that would have
helped me, but they could not;
out of the Body I am with theſe
Angels that both can and will.</p>
               <p>In the Body, on my dying Bed, I
was with a few that watched with
me Night and Day, till I had
made them almoſt weary; but
now, out of the Body, I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Holy ones ſent from Heaven,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93656:38"/>
to watch me on my way unto that
Place, where they and I never
ſhall be weary.</p>
               <p>O Bleſſed Company! O Bleſſed
change of Company! I never was on
ſuch a Journey before; I never was in
ſuch Company on any Journey before;
I never found ſuch Pleaſure in any Way
I went, in any Company I was ever in
before; and ſure the Place I am going
to, I ſhall find to be ſuch, as I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               </p>
               <p n="2">II.<hi> The Safety of the ſeparated Soul by
the Convoy of Angels, will increaſe its Joy
on its Way to Glory. </hi>It ſhall be preſently
freed from all Fears of Danger.</p>
               <p>In the Body it was not without its
Fears: Fears from without and within;
from above and below: many Fears it
was filled with.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From a <hi>Tempting Devil,</hi> that on
his dying Bed endeavoured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
his Peace, ſuggeſting evil
Thoughts, repreſenting the Evil
of his Sin, multiplying and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
them by the Aggravations
that did accompany them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From <hi>In-dwelling Sin;</hi> there being
the Remains of Sin abiding in his
heart. I fear what this hard, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93656:38"/>
Heart will expoſe me to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the <hi>Imperfection and Weakneſs
of his Grace.</hi> I fear I do not love
God; I fear God loves not me;
I fear I am not ſincere; I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
all my Duties have been done
in Hypocriſy, and that I have not
walked before God with an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From <hi>approaching Death.</hi> Poſſeſt
with Fear about the Pains and
Pangs of Death, how to bear them,
and go thro' them; about his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
and preparedneſs for Death;
about his Meetneſs for a Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Inheritance of the
Saints in Light.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And therefore from the <hi>Want</hi> of his
<hi>Evidences of his Title to Heaven,</hi> and
<hi>Aſſurance of Salvation:</hi> For which
Cauſe the departing Soul was filled
with trembling, perceiving it could
not continue much longer in the
Body, and yet afraid to leave it,
ſaying, what if I ſhould be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
What if I ſhould make an
Error in my Death about my Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
State? What if, while I am in
the Body, I ſhould ſuppoſe that I
have the Truth of Grace, and when
out of the Body find that I had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93656:39"/>
none? This makes me afraid to
think of Heaven, leaſt I ſhould
miſs of it, or of Hell, leaſt I ſhould
be doomed to it.</p>
               <p>But as ſoon as the Gracious Soul is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from its Body, and beholds the
Chariot and Horſes which God hath
ſent for him, all his Doubts are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
reſolved, and all his Fears pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
expelled, and the Clouds that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
the Light of God's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from him, are forthwith ſcattered
and diſperſed.</p>
               <p>Now the Safety of the gracious ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Soul, and its Freedom from all
Fears of Danger on its Travil to
Heaven, by reaſon of this Angelical
Convoy, will appear by theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
or rather Qualifications of the
Meſſengers ſent for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Soul is guarded
with ſuch <hi>powerful</hi> Angels. Evil Angels
that will endeavour to way lay the Soul
are ſtrong and powerful Spirits; but
the Holy Angels that are to defend it
on its way, are ſtronger and more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
than they; not only in themſelves,
compared with the other, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Evil Angels oppoſe the Soul in
their own Strength, by meer <hi>Permiſſion,</hi>
without Aſſiſtance from God; but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93656:39"/>
Angels act not only by that Power
they are indued with from God, but
alſo by <hi>Commiſſion</hi> and Aſſiſtance from
him; and therefore when we read of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Fight and Conflict between the Bad
and Holy Angels, the Good always over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came;
becauſe Chriſt, who is that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi>
is the Lord General of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Hoſt, and they fight under his
Banner, and he that <hi>is</hi> the Captain of
our Salvation, is the Captain, Leader,
and Commander in Chief of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Army: <hi>Rev. 12. 7, 8. And there
was War in Heaven,</hi> Michael <hi>and his
Angels fought againſt the Dragon, and the
Dragon fought and his Angels, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not, neither was there Place ſound any
more in Heaven. 9. And the great Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
was caſt out, that old Serpent, called,
the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the
whole World; he was caſt out into the
Earth, and his Angels were caſt out with
him, Rev. 20. 1. I ſaw an Angel come
down from Heaven, having the Key of the
Bottomleſs Pit, and a great Chain in his
Hand. 2. And he laid hold on the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
that old Serpent, which is the Devil
and Satan, and bound him a Thouſand Years.
3. And caſt him into the bottomleſs Pit,
and ſet a Seal upon him, that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Nations no more.</hi> Thus the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93656:40"/>
Holy Angels are celebrated for their
Power, being mighty <hi>Angels, 2 Theſ. 1.
7.</hi> and do excel in Strength, <hi>Pſal. 103.
20.</hi> Their Power, under God, is the
Soul's Safety, on its Way from Earth to
Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Soul by this Convoy
is ſafe, becauſe conducted by ſuch
<hi>knowing</hi> Angels: Evil Angels, though
they have loſt all that Holineſs they
were at firſt created with, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
great Meaſures of Knowledge,
therefore we read of the Subtilty,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 3. 2 Cor. 2. 11. Eph. 6. 11.</note> of the
Stratagems and Devices of the Devil; yet
the Holy Holy Angels are more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than they, for when Devils are caſt
out, the good Angels do always behold
the Face of God in Heaven, <hi>Mat. 18.
10.</hi> So that God revealing his Will to
them about any Matter, Meſſage, or
Perſon, they readily know, and as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
execute what he reveals to them to
be his Will to be done by them. As to
our preſent Purpoſe, by God's Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them:
<list>
                     <item>1. They know <hi>thoſe</hi> that are ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Holy; for they rejoice at their
Converſion.</item>
                     <item>2. They know <hi>when</hi> any Believer is
diſſolved by Death, and when his
Soul is ſeparated from his Body;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93656:40"/>
elſe how ſhould they know <hi>when</hi>
to come for it?</item>
                     <item>3. They know <hi>where</hi> any Believer
dies, at home or abroad, on his
Bed or in the Field, by Land or
Sea; elſe how ſhould they know
<hi>where to come</hi> for it?</item>
                     <item>4. They know the Soul ſeparated, <hi>which</hi>
is the Soul of a ſanctified Man, and
which of one unholy; elſe how
ſhould they know which to take,
and which to leave; which to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Heaven, and which to leave
to Devils to be carried to Hell; and
here (thro' Divine Revelation) they
never make any Miſtake.</item>
                     <item>5. They know the <hi>Way</hi> from any part
of this World, to the bleſſed World
above, by their often coming and
going, and never miſs their Way.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>All which laid together, ſhews the
Safety of Believers Souls, wherever they
live, wherever they die, whoever they
be, that there is no fear that they ſhould
not be found by the miniſtring Angels,
or that finding them at Death, they
ſhould loſe their Way to Heaven. So
that the ſeparated Soul at the firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Angels to it, will ſee the
Love and Care of God concerning it,
and with admiring Thoughts thereof,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93656:41"/>
may ſay, <hi>hath God made known to you the
Place where I did leave my Body, and the
very Moment when I parted from it, and
that I was ſincere in Heart to God, and gave
you charge to come and guide me in my Way,
unto his Glorious Preſence; how chearfully
will I go with you? knowing that by your
Power, under God, I ſhall not be ſeized by
evil Spirits, and by your Skill I ſhall not
loſe my Way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſeparated Soul, by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
Miniſtration, is ſafe, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed
by ſuch <hi>faithful</hi> Angels, that are
always true to their Truſt. If a Man be
on a Journey in Company that is able
to protect him, and skilful to direct him,
yet if any in the Company be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
they may betray him; but here can
be no Danger, nor Ground of Fear in
reſpect of this Convoy.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Elſe Holy Angels would not be
faithful to God the <hi>Father,</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
any one Soul choſen by him
to Eternal Life.</item>
                  <item>2. Nor to God the <hi>Son,</hi> in loſing any
whom he hath redeemed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
by his moſt precious Blood.</item>
                  <item>3. Nor to the <hi>Holy Spirit of God,</hi> by
dropping any by the Way, which
by the ſpecial Operation of his
powerful Grace, he hath prepared
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93656:41"/>
and made meet for Glory, and had
given to them the Pledge and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
thereof.</item>
                  <item>4. Nor to the <hi>Soul</hi> committed to their
Charge to bring to Heaven; for
wherein could greater Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to it be ſhewn, than in what
concerns its Eternal State.</item>
                  <item>5. Nor to their own <hi>Office</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to them, without fail to
conduct ſuch an one to the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of Heaven.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Such Unfaithfulneſs is inconſiſtent
with the Perfection and ſpotleſs Purity
of Holy Angels, which being confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
cannot at any time fall into the leaſt
Error or Miſcarriage, for then would
they ceaſe to be Holy Angels.</p>
               <p>What Joy then is this to the ſeparated
Soul, that hath ſuch a Convoy ſent for
it, as ſhall not indanger it by Weakneſs
or want of Power, by Ignorance or
want of Skill in the Way, or by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs
or want of Fidelity to their
Truſt: <hi>O how happy am I on my Way to
Happineſs! How ſure am I my Way will
be proſperous! How certain is it I ſhall get
ſafely thither!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The gracious ſeparated Soul
will be ſafe, becauſe tranſported by ſuch
<hi>zealous</hi> Angels,<note place="margin">Iſay. 6. 2, 6.</note> therefore called <hi>Seraphims,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:93656:42"/>
becauſe they have a burning Zeal in
executing all that God gives them a
Charge to do. Devils are furious, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
and malicious, and are bent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,
devour and damn as many as they
can, by watching, by walking to and
fro throughout the Earth,<note place="margin">Job 1. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> by tempting,
and at laſt by dragging Souls to Hell,
when ſeparated from their Bodies. The
Holy Angels are more for God's Glory,
the Intereſt of Chriſt, the Good of Souls,
than Devils are againſt them, for I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Holy Angels do more exceed
in Goodneſs, than evil Angels, as bad
as they are, are filled with Wickedneſs:
For in Devils there is ſomething <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi>
Good (beſides their Being) tho' it
may be <hi>Formally</hi> or <hi>Circumſtantially</hi> Evil,
as much of their Knowledge: but in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels there is nothing that is <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi>
or <hi>Circumſtantially</hi> Evil.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Holy ſeparated Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Company of Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
on its Way to Heaven, may delight
it ſelf and ſay, While in the Body, I was
aſſaulted with Satans Temptations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
did endeavour to perſuade me to ſin;
but whatſoever Violence they may now
aſſault me with, they ſhall no more with
any Hopes entice me from my God,
and the good Company I am in will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93656:42"/>
me from them. What Zeal do
theſe Holy ones ſhew in protecting of
me? What burning Love do I feel in
their Embracements? What Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Anger do they diſcover, as I go
along, againſt any evil Spirits appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to endanger me? What Aſſaults the
Spiritual Wickedneſſes have made, my
Convoy hath ſecured me from: when
they did draw near, theſe did beat them
back: they are repulſed; and I, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with theſe, go ſafely on.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The gracious ſeparated Soul
will be ſafe, becauſe defended by</hi> nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Angels. Whether more Angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
than are confirmed, is not needful
to enquire: ſure we are, there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of Thouſands that did never ſin,
but retain their Integrity,</hi> Dan. 7. 10.
A thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him,
and ten thouſand times ten thouſands ſtood
before him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 11. And I beheld, and
I heard the Voice of many Angels round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Throne, and the Beaſts and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the Number of them was ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times ten thouſands, and thouſands of
thouſands. <hi>So many that they are</hi> innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable,
Heb. 12. 22.</p>
               <p>How <hi>many</hi> Angels may be ſent to
convey <hi>one</hi> particular Soul, is more than
I do know: But we may be ſure of this,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93656:43"/>
that a Guard of <hi>ſo many</hi> ſhall be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as is ſufficient to protect it againſt
all the Principalities and Powers of
Hell; ſo that the Soul might paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear of Danger, and ſay, This Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
God hath ſent, will ſee me ſafe in
Heaven; for every one of them is Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Powerful, every one is Knowing and
skilful in the Way, and every one is
Faithful to his Truſt,<note place="margin">2. King. 6. 16. 17.</note> every one is Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for God's Glory in my Salvation,
and mine Eyes being opened, I ſee there
is more for me than againſt me.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Convoy of Angels ſhews us
<hi>the Dignity and Honour</hi> that God puts
upon the ſeparated Soul. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was
much deſpiſed, ſlighted and neglected,
when Body and Soul remained united,
and whatſoever Contempt his dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was expoſed to, his ſeparated Soul
was honoured with the Company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
<hi>Strange Change!</hi> one while lying
amongſt the Dogs, and another while
carried by Angels: It's ſaid, the <hi>Romans,</hi>
after their Victories, in their Triumphs
had their Charriots drawn ſometimes
with Elephants, ſometimes with nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed
Jennets, ſometimes with Pyde
Horſes; and <hi>Amaſis,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
had his Chariot drawn with Four Kings,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93656:43"/>
whom he had conquered. But the Soul
of a Believer is carried in greater Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
by Angels into Heaven.</p>
               <p>When the King asked<hi> Haman, </hi>what
ſhall be done to the Man whom the
King delighteth to Honour, he (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it ſhould be himſelf) ſaid,<hi> Let the
Royal Apparel be brought, which the King
uſeth to wear, and the Horſe that the King
rideth upon, and the Crown Royal which is
ſet upon his Head, and let this Apparel and
Horſe be delivered to the Hand of one of the
King's moſt Noble Princes, that they may
aray the Man withal, whom the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
to Honour, and bring him on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
through the Street of the City, and
proclaim before him, thus ſhall it be done to
the Man whom the King delighteth to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Eſth.</hi> 6. 6, to 12.</p>
               <p>Tho' we cannot ſee the Soul when it
leaves the Body, nor the Guard of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
ſtanding ready to receive it, nor
hear the Songs of Triumph as they paſs
along, yet we may conceive what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
(if not verbally, yet really in
the thing done) in the Heavenly Hoſt,
as they paſs through the Air, <hi>Thus ſhall
it be done to the Soul, whom the King of
Glory delighteth to Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:93656:44"/>
We may alſo imagin how the Soul it
ſelf is tranſported with Joy, and beats
its Part in thoſe Triumphant Songs, and
is revived more than <hi>Jacob</hi>'s fainting
Heart was, when his Sons told him all
the Words of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and when he ſaw
the Wagons which <hi>Joſeph</hi> had ſent to
carry him,<note place="margin">Gen. 45. 27.</note> ſo when the Soul ſeeth the
Chariots that God hath ſent to carry it
to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is comforted and filled with
Admiration, ſaying, I have lived hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
in a ſtrange Land, where God
did ſet me to be prepared for a State of
Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be taught and inſtructed in
Chriſt's School, by his appointed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
to be made meet to be a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of the Inheritance of the Saints in
Light: I have been a Pilgrim and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer
in the lower World, where I
dwelt in an Earthly Tabernacle and
Cottage of Clay, where I looked for a
City which hath Foundations, whoſe
Maker and Builder is God; and now
my Father hath ſent, lo, what Glorious
Angels he hath ſent to fetch me home,
to poſſeſs the Manſion prepared for me
in his own Houſe, and ſtately Palace in
the higheſt Heavens: I am going to a
better Country than ever yet I was in:
I am on my Way to my Eternal Bleſſed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93656:44"/>
Home, and with what Honour am I
conducted thither? For</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nobleſt</hi> of God's Creatures are
ſent by him to fetch me to his
Glorious Preſence, to the Place of
Light, and Life, and Love.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Courtiers</hi> of Heaven, are my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
thither.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Favourites</hi> of the great King
are come to lead me to his Palace,
and to introduce me (under Chriſt)
into his Preſence.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Morning Stars</hi> are to go before
me (which make me to rejoice with
exceeding great Joy) theſe are to
go before me to guide me to the
Place where Jeſus is (not lying in a
Manger, but) ſitting on his Throne
at the Right Hand of the Majeſty
on high.</p>
               <p>Theſe that are to God, what <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Bed chamber</hi> are, to Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Kings are come down to fetch
me up. Never had an (unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving)
Earthly King ſuch a Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
as this; nor ſuch Attendants
to wait upon him or to miniſter to
him: All his Lords and Nobles
and Captains, are far inferior to
theſe Angels, and it is the great
God's good Pleaſure, that it ſhould
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93656:45"/>
be done thus, to all the Souls
whom he delighteth to honour.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Celerity and ſpeedy Paſſage</hi> of
the ſeparated Soul, from Earth to
Heaven, is evidenced by its being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by Angels from the one Place to
the other: Tho' the Diſtance from this
Earth to the higheſt Heaven, is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be <hi>Millions</hi> of Miles, and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Voyage than from any part in this
lower World, to another moſt remote,
in point of <hi>Diſtance;</hi> yet the Paſſage is
not ſo long, in reſpect of <hi>time,</hi> tho' the
Way be long between the <hi>Term from
which, and the Term to which</hi> the Soul is
carried; yet it is not long the Soul is
paſſing through the intermediate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
becauſe it is helped by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Motion of the Angels; which, that
we may the better conceive, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Motion of Angels from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Earth, and back again, cannot
be but through the <hi>Intermediate Diſtance</hi>
of the one from the other: For the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity</hi>
of Angels Motion is not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
only from the Continuity of the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
(while they move) but alſo from
the Continuity of the <hi>Space</hi> through
which they remove.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:93656:45"/>
2. The Motion of Angels from ſuch
diſtant Extreams as Heaven and Earth,
cannot be properly and ſtrictly an <hi>inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous</hi>
Motion. When an Angel is <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
in Heaven, the Term from which,
it is only <hi>potentially</hi> on Earth, the Term
to which: Now if an Angel could move
<hi>in one indiviſible inſtant,</hi> from one to the
other, it would be in Heaven and on
Earth at the ſame Inſtant, and ſo in the
ſame Moment it would be <hi>actually</hi> in
both the extream Terms, when he was
only actually in the one, and potential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the other, which is to ſay, he is
actually in one, and not in the other
in the ſame Moment, and yet in the ſame
Moment he is in both, which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Angels being <hi>Spirits,</hi> and not corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Subſtances, are not hindered in their
Motion by thoſe things that Bodies are:
Bodies move more ſlowly or more ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
according as the <hi>Medium</hi> is, as they
move ſwifter in the Air than in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
becauſe the Air being more thin
and ſubtile doth not ſo much reſiſt the
Mover, as the Water that is more denſe
and groſs, muſt needs do: alſo becauſe
one Body cannot be penetrated by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as a Man cannot go thro' a Door,
when it is ſhut, the one muſt hinder the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93656:46"/>
other in its Motion: But Angels, being
Spirits, cannot be retarded in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by the Solidity or Thickneſs of
Doors or Walls, to hinder them from
coming into a Priſon, Caſtle or a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
where a Believer is a dying, for
the receiving of his Soul: For though
one body cannot be in the ſame parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Place where another Body is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
then there would be a <hi>Penetration
of Dimenſions;</hi> yet Angels by Bodies are
not excluded, becauſe they are immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
as appears by a Legion of evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
(which is Six Thouſand Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred)
being in one Man: And tho'
One Angel, becauſe <hi>Finite,</hi> cannot be in
Two diſtant Places at once, yet many
Angels, becauſe <hi>Immaterial,</hi> might be
in One (where) or Place together at
once; and ſo their Motion not hindred
by the Preſence of Bodies, or the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
one of another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Motion of the Angels is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Swift;</hi> and to expreſs it, they
are ſaid to have Wings,<note place="margin">Iſay. 6. 2. Dan. 9. 21.</note> and that they
fly ſwiftly, more ſpeedily than the Sun
that moves Thouſands of Miles in an
Hour; it might <hi>come near</hi> in reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to the Motion of the Eye, that
can ſo quickly turn and look up to
Heaven, or to Lightning, that runs in a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93656:46"/>
little time, from one part of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
to the other, and ſo comes <hi>nearest</hi>
to an inſtantaneous Motion.</p>
               <p>But the Scripture, that is the ſureſt
Rule to judge by, doth teach us, that
an Angel can come from Heaven to
Earth, while a Man is making of his
Prayer to God,<hi> Dan. 9. 20. While I was
ſpeaking and praying, and confeſſing my Sin,
and the Sin of my People I<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rael, and preſenting
my Supplication before the Lord my God,
for the Holy Mountain of my God. 21. Yea,
while I was ſpeaking in Prayer, even the
Man </hi>Gabriel,<hi> whom I had ſeen in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
at the Beginning, being cauſed to fly
ſwiftly, touched me about the time of the
Evening Oblation. 22. And he informed
me, and talked with me, and ſaid, O</hi>Daniel,<hi> I am now come forth to give thee
Skill and Underſtanding. 23. At the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of thy Supplication the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
came forth, and I am come to ſhew
thee, for thou art greatly beloved.—</hi>Where we might obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>ſpeedy Return</hi> that is ſometimes
made to Prayer; while a Believer is
praying, the Anſwer is made; <hi>While
the Prayer is going up, the Mercy is coming
down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Angels <hi>ſtand ready</hi> before the
Lord, waiting to be employed by him
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93656:47"/>
for the Good and Comfort of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
at his Pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God doth but give the <hi>Word,</hi> and
Angels doth obey: <hi>The Commandment,</hi>
or the Word, <hi>came forth, and I am come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Angels<hi> make Haſte </hi>to execute God's
Commands:<hi> Gabriel was cauſed to fly
ſwiftly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Time</hi> of his coming was, while
<hi>Daniel</hi> was praying: At the <hi>Beginning</hi>
of his Prayer <hi>Gabriel</hi> was in Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Ending</hi> of it, he was with <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Soul is not long in its Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to Heaven, is clear, from Chriſt's
Word to the Thief on the Croſs, <hi>Luke,
23. 43. Verily I ſay unto thee, to Day ſhalt
thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> The ſame
Day he was on the Croſs, he was in
Heaven: The ſame Day he was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
the ſame Day he was Glorified:
And though the Day was far ſpent, yet
<hi>that Day</hi> was his Soul in Heaven: The
Soul may be carried from its Body to
the Place of Glory, in a part of a Day.
This is wonderful.</p>
               <p>How comfortable is this to a dying
Believer; who might, ſpeaking to his
weeping Friends about his Bed, ſay,
What mean your Tears, your Sighs and
Groans? Why are ye caſt down? And
why are your Hearts troubled? Would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93656:47"/>
you grieve <hi>thus</hi> if I were going a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to the <hi>Indies,</hi> in Hopes of Gain, with
a ſafe and ſtrong Convoy? Why I am
going to a better Place, with a ſafer
Convoy, for greater Gain, and tho' the
Place be far off, I ſhall ſoon be there; the
ſame Day I go from you on Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
helped on my Way by ſwift and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Angels, I ſhall go to Chriſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<hi>So ſoon!</hi> O then how near will
my ſeparated Soul be to my Manſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove!
What! turned out of the Body,
and received into Heaven the ſame
Day! Make what ſpeed you can or
will to interr the Body I ſhall leave with
you, my Soul ſhall be carried by God's
Holy Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Body can be carried by Men,
and lodged in the Boſom of the Earth.</p>
               <p>And when the Soul is breathed out,
and received into the Angels Arms, and
perceives the ſwiftneſs of the Motion
they carried it with, how greatly will
it be delighted to think, tho' the Way
be long, yet it will not be long before I
ſhall be at my Journey's End: O the
haſte! the haſte! the ſpeedy haſte they
do make to lodge me in my Saviour's
Arms! <hi>Methinks,</hi> they think it long till
they ſhew me, what in Heaven is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for me! <hi>Methinks,</hi> they are Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93656:48"/>
Ambitious to help me forward, that
I might ſee the State, and Place, and
Company above, and how Glorious they
all are! O, how do they fly! How do
they fly! How ſwiftly do they fly with
me in their Arms, that they may lodge
me in that Place of Reſt and Joy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they have for ſo long a Duration
ſeen the Face of God, joyed in their
Reſt, and reſted in their Joy, and are
deſirous to have me there, that I, with
God, and Chriſt, and them, might Reſt,
and Joy to all Eternity. I am now out
of hearing of the Clocks, and ſee not
the artificial Dials, by which Men ſee
hourly the Motion of the Sun, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they meaſure their Time, and on
their Journeys know how many Miles
an Hour they go over: If in an Hour
to their Earthly Home, they travel, with
the Help of Horſes and Chariots, Eight
or Ten Miles, what haſte do they think
they make? How ſoon do they think
they ſhall be at Home, received and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
with Joy, with loving Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements,
by Friends waiting, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
longing for their coming Home?
But their ſwifteſt Pace to their Earthly
Home, is ſlow to mine, to my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Home: It is, to mine, as the
Crawling of a Snail, to the Motion of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93656:48"/>
the Sun. God is looking for me, and
Chriſt is looking for me, and the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Inhabitants above are looking for
me: Is the Cry in Heaven, Why is yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Soul ſo long a coming? When will
it be here, that we might have a new
Lodger in our Dwellings? Angels were
ordered to go for him, the Horſes and
the Chariots were ſent to fetch him up:
Why is his Chariot ſo long a coming?
Why tarry the Wheels of his Chariot?
The Soul on its Journey looking out of
his Chariot, and up to Heaven, and
ſeeing them out of the Windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
looking for him, and calling, come
away, make haſte and come to us, it
replies. I haſten, I haſten, I come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I come quickly.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Angels being the <hi>Carriers,</hi> and
the Soul the <hi>carried,</hi> it will be Matter of
Joy to <hi>both,</hi> at their <hi>Arrival at the Port
of Happineſs;</hi> both Angels the <hi>Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and the Soul that is the <hi>Paſſenger,</hi>
ſhall rejoice when landed at their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Seas, ſtormy Winds, and raging Waves,
having eſcaped the Sands and Rocks, and
Hands of Pyrates, and being come to
their deſigned Harbour, are filled with

Joy, and do ſhoot and ſhout, thereby
giving out their Signs of Joy: So the
Angels, and the Soul whom they have
conveyed to the Gates of Heaven, do
rejoice that their Voyage hath been ſo
proſperous.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Angels, that were the Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

ſaying, O our Lord and King, thou

Heaven, and to declare his coming
again, by audible Voice; ſo they by
their Example in taking the Care and
Charge of Holy ſeparated Souls, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them to Heaven, teach us ſeveral
Duties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By their Love to Believers ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Souls, <hi>we ſhould be excited to great
Love to them.</hi> Love ſhould be recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
in loving them that love us: Should
not we love the Angels in Heaven, who
are ſo ready to help us up to Heaven?
Should we love every one on Earth,
in whom we ſee the Holy Image and
Likeneſs of God in ſmalleſt Meaſure,
and ſhould not we love theſe Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
that are like to God in higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees?
Should we love the Miniſters of
God, whoſe Preaching God hath made
inſtrumental for our Converſion and
Preparation for Heaven, and ſhould we
not love theſe Meſſengers of God, who
are ſent by him to fetch us to the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93656:54"/>
of our Manſions in Heaven? Do
we love the Company of good Men that
travel with us upon Earth, as they are
Guides and Guards unto us on our Way,
and ſhall we not love theſe Holy Angels
of God, that will be our Companions in
our Journey to Heaven? If we are to
love ſuch as are our Enemies in Life,
ſurely we ſhould love theſe that will be
ſuch Friends unto us after Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By their Condeſcention in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the Soul of the meaneſt Believer
to Heaven, we ſhould learn <hi>Humility,</hi>
and to condeſcend to Men of low E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
for the Good and Welfare of
their Souls. What meer Creatures are
more Noble and Excellent than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels in Heaven? And what Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
as to outward Circumſtances,
was poorer and more loathſom than <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus?</hi>
Was he not a <hi>Beggar</hi> that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Bread? Was he not a <hi>Cripple,</hi> that
could not go <hi>to,</hi> but was laid <hi>at</hi> the
Rich Man's Gate? Was he not only
ſore, but full of Sores, that a nice and
ſqueamiſh Perſon would have diſdained
to look upon him, but much more to
dreſs his Sores? And yet the Angels of
God did not diſdain to carry this Poor
Man's Soul into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom? Did
they take him in their <hi>Arms,</hi> whom the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93656:55"/>
Rich Man would not take and lay in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his <hi>Out-houſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are any of the Sons of Men more
Excellent, more Noble, more Knowing,
and ſet higher in any Capacity above
the Pooreſt and moſt Contemptible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
upon Earth, than the Angels in
Heaven? and yet are they ready to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
to the Meaneſt, and ſhall any of
us be ſo Great in our own Eyes, and
look upon our ſelves in ſuch a Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Glaſs, as to refuſe to help forward
the Salvation of the Pooreſt Soul?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the Miniſtration of Angels, in
carrying Souls to Heaven, <hi>be a Pattern
of our Obedience to God,</hi> all the Days of
our Life on Earth. As they obey God
in this, as in all things elſe, ſo let us
write after their Copy,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 10.</note> to do the Will
of God, as by them in Heaven it is done:
Tho' we cannot do it <hi>equally</hi> in Degrees,
yet let it be our Holy Ambition to come
as near to them as we can, in theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, They do not ſtir</hi> to fetch a Soul
to Heaven, <hi>without a Warrant</hi> from God;
they are ſent before they Come: So let
us ſee what Warrant we have from God
for <hi>what</hi> we do, before we do it; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
of our ſelves, hath God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
this? Hath he ſpoke the Word?
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93656:55"/>
Will the Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 11.</note> wherein God's
Will and my Duty is revealed, bear me
out, if I do this or that? What a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Sins by this would be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Angels come and carry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Souls to Heaven, <hi>with greateſt
Alacrity and Cheerfulneſs:</hi> As they joy in
their Converſion, ſo in carrying them
to Eternal Salvation, if they be ſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo often, to fetch never ſo many,
they never grudge their Labour, they
have not the leaſt Regret nor Repining,
but the more they are ſent for the more
they are pleaſed and do rejoice. So we
ſhould <hi>ſerve the Lord with Gladneſs, and
and come before his Preſence with Singing,
Pſal.</hi> 100. 2. We ſhould pray to him
with Delight, hear from him and obey
him with Cheerfulneſs, and Joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Angels having a Charge to
fetch a Believer's Soul, <hi>come ſpeedily,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay; they make haſte to receive
it, that they may be preſent at the very
Moment of its Separation: <hi>They never
come too late.</hi> In like manner we ſhould
imitate their Obedience in ours, <hi>Pſal.
119. 60. I made haſte, and delayed not to
keep thy Commandments.</hi> God commands
you <hi>now</hi> to repent, but you put it off till
hereafter: God enjoins you <hi>to Day,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:93656:56"/>
whiles it is called to Day,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 7, 8.</note> to hearken to
his Voice; but you ſtop your Ears <hi>to
Day,</hi> and ſo you will <hi>to morrow,</hi> if you
ſhall have the ſame hardneſs of Heart to
Morrow, as you have to Day. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in conveying Souls do not ſo; but
when God gives the Word, they obey
ſpeedily and fly ſwiftly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Angels in carrying Souls to
Heaven are <hi>Faithful in their Service</hi> in
fetching as <hi>many</hi> as God ſends them for,
and no more, and the <hi>very ſame</hi> Souls
and no other; they never miſtake one
for another, and never drop or loſe any
by the Way committed to their Charge.
We, in Imitation of them, ſhould be
faithful in doing what God commands
to every Perſon, in what Capacity, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Relation we ſtand to them:
to one as well as another, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to one, neglecting another, when each
are equally committed to our Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly.</hi> Holy Angels ſerve God in
this Miniſtration <hi>with perſevering Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy:</hi>
They have been imployed in
Tranſporting Souls for many Ages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
paſt, innumerable Souls have been
conveyed from this World to that above,
and ſo they do ſtill, as oft as Believers
die, and ſo they will to the World's End,
till all the Souls, ordained by God for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93656:56"/>
Eternal Life, are lodged in the Heavens.
To which Pattern we ſhould conform
our ſelves in our Obedience to God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering
therein to our Lives End, <hi>Pſal.
119. 112. I have inclined my Heart to
perform thy Statutes always, even to the
End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the Care of Angels, in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
Holy Souls to Heaven, <hi>make us
careful of our own Souls,</hi> that they be ſuch,
and ſo qualified with ſpecial Grace, that
they may be the Object of their Care,
when they ſhall be ſeparated from our
Bodies, as you deſire they, and not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
ſhould have them, when out of the
Body; do you make it your great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
to have them Sanctified in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
For Holy Angels will not touch an
unholy ſeparated Soul, to defend it from
the Devil's ſeizing of it. If the Soul be
unholy while you live, and leave the
Body unholy when you die, it will be
unfit for the Glorious Preſence of God,
for the Holy Place and Company A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and it will not be in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to carry it thither, neither will
they do it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Grieve not, nor offend the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of God,</hi> as you expect and hope they
ſhould carry your Souls to Heaven when
you die. Good and Evil Angels are
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93656:57"/>
your Spectators and Obſervers, when
you might think little of it: When you
do Evil, bad Angels rejoice, good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are offended: when you pleaſe God,
Devils are diſpleaſed, but good Angels
are delighted at it.</p>
               <p>Take heed in ſecret what you do, for
there may be more Devils and Holy
Angels with you, tho' not ſeen by you,
than you are aware of.</p>
               <p>Be mindful how you behave your ſelf
in the Publick Ordinances, becauſe of
Angels, good and bad, for when you
come to theſe, good and bad Angels
come alſo;<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 19</note> the Devil to catch the Word
from you, that you might not be ſaved,
but that he might catch and carry your
Soul at Death, to Hell: Good Angels
to promote your Converſion now, that
they may carry your Souls to Heaven
hereafter. Becauſe of theſe Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in the Aſſembly watch your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 10.</note>
ſhall they ſee your Eyes rolling
after ſinful Objects? Shall they ſee
you ſleeping under the Word, or in time
of Prayer? Will you ſo grieve thoſe
that you hope ſhall be imployed, in
carrying your Soul to Heaven? Bluſh
more that Angels ſee you nodding in
Duty, than that Men ſee you.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Tho' Angels ſhall be ſo careful of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93656:57"/>
you, to carry your ſeparated Soul to
Heaven, yet <hi>be you careful, that you now
carry nothing to them that is due to God;</hi>
neither your Prayers, nor any part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worſhip that properly belongs to
God.<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 8, 9.</note> Worſhipping of Angels is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to God, and diſpleaſing to them, and
they refuſe to accept it: Tho' you were
upon your dying Bed, you may not
pray to them to come and guard you,
but you may pray to God that he would
ſend them to defend you, and carry you
to Glory; as in another Caſe <hi>Manoah</hi>
did, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 8. Manoah <hi>intreated the
Lord and ſaid, O my Lord, let the Man of
God, which thou didſt ſend, come again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.—9. And God hearkened to the Voice
of</hi> Manoah, <hi>and the Angel of God came
again.—16. The Angel ſaid, If thou wilt
offer a Burnt Offering, thou muſt offer it
to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>This is great Encouragement to dying
Believers:</hi> When ſuch an one perceives
the approaching of Death, that he muſt
get up and ride upon that Pale Horſe
that will carry him into the other World,
he might ſay, <hi>Farewell,</hi> Dear Friends,
<hi>Farewell;</hi> I am going, my time is ended
my Courſe is finiſhed; I ſhall be no
more with you, and when my Soul is
departed, there is no more that you can
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93656:58"/>
do for it: Weep not, neither be ye grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
I have thoſe that will take care of
me, when ye cannot; God will take
Care of me, and Chriſt will take Care
of me, and the Holy Angels of God
will take Care of me: I have God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
for my Security, God's Power for
my Protection, God's Angels for my
Guard: <hi>The Angel of the Covenant</hi> will
charge his Angels with me; the <hi>Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
of the Covenant will ſend his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
for me: The <hi>Surety</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
hath undertaken, with God, for
me, and for me with God, and I ſhall
reap the benefit of his Suretiſhip, and
the Bleſſings of the Covenant for Ever,
when carried up into Heaven: Death
will carry me into Eternity; and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
will carry me into a bleſſed Eternity
of Life and Joy, with Chriſt in Glory.
The Horſemen of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are a coming, the
Chariot is making ready, and as Death
haſtens, ſo do they, and will certainly
be here as ſoon as Death, if not before.
Shall I be afraid of Death, or Devils,
or Hell, when Angels will meet me at
Death's Door, and carry me to Heaven's
Gates, and others let me in to take up
my Lodging in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom?</p>
               <p>This is Ground of ſupport to a Believer
on his dying Bed, when he muſt mount
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93656:58"/>
the Pale Horſe of Death, which will
carry him into another World, that God
will charge his Angels to attend, and to
be read to receive his ſeparated Soul,
and carry it into the State and Place of
Eternal Happineſs in the other World.</p>
               <p>This alſo might alleviate the Grief of
ſurviving Friends, which often loads and
burdens the Heart, becauſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of ſuch, that while they lived,
were their Comfort and Delight; when
they conſider the joyful Company of
the Holy Angels they have to convoy
them to their Eternal Bleſſed Home, their
joyful Entertainment there, their happy
Reſt, their holy Imployment, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
Joys in the immediate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of their Glorious God and Exalted
Redemer, and the Eternal Spirit, and
that all this ſhall be their Happineſs to
all Eternity.</p>
               <p>It is no blind Charity to conclude
that the Soul of <hi>this</hi> deceaſed Friend, is
ſafely arrived at Heaven, and hath his
Manſion there, when thoſe that knew
him beſt, and converſed with him moſt,
and had the longeſt Acquaintance to
obſerve his Converſation, <hi>can, and do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,</hi>
that his whole Life was very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary,
ſuitable to his Profeſſion, and
worthy of others Imitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:93656:59"/>
When I was at his Funeral, a grave,
ſolid, and judicious Chriſtian, ſaid to
me, I have known him from his Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his End, and think, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
migh be ſaid of an Upright Man,
might be ſaid concerning him.</p>
               <p>He was very diligent in Redeeming
his time, Improving it in the Duties of
his particular and general Calling, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and watchful that he might not
waſte nor miſpend the Hours of his Life,
for tho' he had a conſiderable Eſtate,
yet he was as laborious in his Station,
as if he had not Bread to eat, till he had
got it by his Hands; not from a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Deſire of Gain, which was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
in that the ſame Hands that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it, were as ready to give it, as the
Neceſſities of others called for it: For to
my Knowledge, he gave a conſiderable
Allowance, for many Years, towards
the Education of a poor Scholar, whom,
when he heard preach, before he died,
ſaid to me, he thought his Money well
beſtowed, and was a Comfort to him
that it had been ſo rightly placed, and
that he ſaw ſuch Fruits of what he had
therein done.</p>
               <p>He was more than ordinarily ready to
promote the Preaching of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
a People that, by reaſon of their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93656:59"/>
low Circumſtances, were not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it; one Inſtance I remember, when
a Friend of mine did but mention the
Caſe of ſuch a People in the Country,
tho' he did not ask him, yet before they
parted, I ſaw him give ſeveral Pounds
to be towards the Maintainance of a
Preacher for that Year.</p>
               <p>Another ſpecial Friend of mine, of
his intimate Acquaintance, told me ſince
his Death, that once he deſired ſome
Aſſiſtance from him, for the Relief of
a very fit Object of Charity, more than
ordinary, for which purpoſe he readily
(beyond his Expectation) gave many
Pounds. After ſome conſiderable time
intervening, the ſame Perſon, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
extraordinary Occaſion, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Requeſt for his Help, and he
chearfully gave him upon that Account,
as much as he did for the other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
my Friend told me, that ſuch a
<hi>Free-giver</hi> ſpoiled him for a <hi>Beggar</hi> for
others (as to him) for after that, he could
never prevail with himſelf to ask <hi>him</hi> any
more, who was ſo eaſily prevailed with
to give ſo liberally.</p>
               <p>He was an earneſt deſirer of the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the Souls of others, for I know
that he hath often bought many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of Books of ſeveral Subjects, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93656:60"/>
them to Poor Perſons and Families,
asking nothing but that they would take
them and diligently read them: Alſo if
any deſired him to tranſcribe out of his
Short Hand into Long, any Sermon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they were more than uſually
affected (tho' he was fully imployed, yet)
he would take time from his ſleep, and
write it very fair and give them, being
ready to promote the Intereſt of Souls,
both by his Purſe and Pains.</p>
               <p>He was a ſingular Pattern of Dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to Parents; being very tender and
careful of his very aged Mother, both
in reſpect to her Temporal and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
State, liberally aſſiſting her as to both
(for tho' ſhe was left a Widow in good
Worldly Circumſtances, yet in her Old
Age ſhe enjoyed not that Plenty as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore).
For Temporals, ſhe, by his Care
wanted nothing; in Spirituals he was
as forward to afford his Help, for being
Weak thro' Age, and difficult in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
could not attend (as formerly) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Publick Ordinances, to ſupply the
Want whereof, it was his conſtant Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
for many Years, every Lord's Day
in the Evening, to go to her Houſe, and
laying his Face near her Ear, repeated
the Sermons he had taken that Day, to
her, and the reſt in the Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:93656:60"/>
He was not ſhort in his Relation, as a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his Siſters, Two that by Providence were
brought from higher to lower Circumſtances in
their outward State, he made comfortable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
for, one of which being diſcompoſed in
her Head, and not capable of caring for her
ſelf, he (like a loving Brother) was exceeding
kind unto her, while he lived, and hath left them
what will be a good Stay and Support unto
them, now he is taken from his Mother and them.</p>
               <p>He never was a <hi>talkative</hi> Man, but the <hi>leſs
he ſaid, the more he did;</hi> not like many, whoſe
Tongues run faſter in ſpeaking Religiouſly,
than their Feet in walking Holily: His Works
did praiſe him more, to the Obſervers of what
he did, than his Words did commend him to
the Hearers of what he ſaid; tho' what he
ſaid was Savoury, and his Words were weighty,
rather than many; ſpeaking but little tho' to
good Purpoſe: And as he was ſparing in his
Words, when in Health, ſo he ſpake not much
when ſick and on his dying Bed: but told me,
he had good Hopes of his Spiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
State, and tho' he found Satan tempting
to ſhake his Reliance on Chriſt, yet there he
placed his only Truſt and Dependance for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
having conſented to him, and accepted
of him in all his Offices as offered in the
Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Concerning the laſt Sermon he heard, which
was about <hi>Love-ſickneſs to Christ,</hi> through the
abundant Senſe of Chriſt's Love to the Soul, he
ſaid, it was an excellent, comfortable Frame
of Spirit, in ſuch as have experience of it: and
this I thought he ſaid, from his own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93656:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as having found and felt how comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it was.</p>
               <p>His Head being affected with his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and much inclined to Sleep, yet asked me
to pray with him, ſaying, tho' I be drowſy,
yet will I not ſleep while you pray, but will
join in the Prayers with you; and when ſick,
kept waking in his Bed, during the time of
Prayer, when many in Health, in Family and
Congregation, are ſleeping when they ſhould
be praying: and tho' he was ſo heavy, yet
would not be ſatisfied, except the Duty were
performed, and ſtriving againſt his Sleep, that
he might ſtrive with God in Prayer, ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
his Soul was refreſhed, and was the
better for it.</p>
               <p>Within the ſpace of about Fifteen Days, he
was well and dead, when Sickneſs did ſeize him,
Death made haſte to remove him; but tho'
Death prevented him of longer Time, he had
prevented Death from hurrying him to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Death, by his timely ſpiritual Birth and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
unto God, by his ſound Repentance, and
unfeigned Faith in Chriſt, which manifeſted it
ſelf by the Fruits thereof, thro' the whole Courſe
of his Life, perſevering therein to the End, and
when God gave Commiſſion to Death to make
ſuch haſte to have his Body carried to the
Grave, he gave Commiſſion to his Angels to
make as much ſpeed to carry his Soul into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Boſom; where it is in perfect Reſt, and
Love, and Joy; and let us all prepare that our
Remove by Death, might be from Earth to
Heaven. <hi>Amen.</hi>
