            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Men, maids and boys, and fools &amp; Citizens wives,</l>
               <l>That with fine ſights often indulge your lives;</l>
               <l>Come ſee <hi>The famous Walking on the Water,</hi>

               <l>At <hi>Iſlington</hi> a fatal chance befell,</l>
               <l>Upon St. <hi>Peters</hi> Day, as this will tell;</l>
               <l>A Water-walker did attempt t'eſſay</l>
               <l>A ſerious Matter, but 'twas turn'd t' a Play.</l>
               <l>He did his Bills diſperſe, that he might get</l>
               <l>A multitude Trapan'd into his Net:</l>
               <l>Who when they came a Prodigy to ſee,</l>
               <l>Big with expecting what the ſame might be,</l>
               <l>That Mountains ſhould bring forth they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</l>
               <l>But ah, alas! through ſome fault or neglect,</l>
               <l>A Mouſe the Product was of th' expectation,</l>
               <l>Of this great Wonderful Perambulation;</l>
               <l>For when he did out of his Cell appear,</l>
               <l>Upon the Water like an Engeneer:</l>
               <l>And likely was to get Applauſe, when, ſee,</l>
               <l>Juſt as he us ſaluted, Down ſell he.</l>
               <l>Inſtead of walking then, alas! poor wretch!</l>
               <l>He e'en ſunk down, and fell upon his Breech.</l>
               <l>He ſtruggled to get up, but all in vain,</l>
               <l>For as he ſtrove to riſe, he fell again.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And when that we a ſecond Ambulation</l>
               <l>Did yet expect, he ſtai'd ſo in his ſtation.</l>
               <l>That all did wonder why he lay ſo long,</l>
               <l>'Till he at laſt did ruſh out in a Throng,</l>
               <l>Who then were like to pull him all in pieces,</l>
               <l>As men do tear of ſheep the wool in fleeces;</l>
               <l>To get their money back, becauſe they'd ſeen,</l>
               <l>Such walking, as the like had never been.</l>
               <l>But this I yet can for the Actor ſay,</l>
               <l>'Twas not till meant, though 'twas a fatal day;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For nor the weakneſs of the Engeneer,</l>
               <l>Nor yet the ſtrength of Wine, of Ale, or Beer</l>
               <l>Did ſink him, but I dare be bold to ſay,</l>
               <l>It was the croſneſs of St. <hi>Peters</hi> day.</l>
               <l>Doubtleſs he was preſumptuous in exceſs,</l>
               <l>That did thus dare, (although his Faith were leſs)</l>
               <l>To be the Great St. <hi>Peters</hi> Emulator,</l>
               <l>Thus on his day to walk upon the Water:</l>
               <l>Though all his Engins were the ſons of Art,</l>
               <l>And he himſelf in all points plaid his part,</l>
               <l>Nature has an obediential power,</l>
               <l>Time, 'its returns, a bad day, Critick hour:</l>
               <l>Wherein a Plot, if you will undertake,</l>
               <l>You may be ſure of it a Duck to make.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Bold Engeneer! me thinks you might have ſhrunk</l>
               <l>From Water on that day St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſunk,</l>
               <l>Or could you think your little arts had power,</l>
               <l>Beyond ſmall Faith, upon a frowning hour?</l>
               <l>Duck't like the Patron of that day, you were,</l>
               <l>Both of his fault and puniſhment the heir.</l>
               <l>But, (and 'tis pity) ſome may truly ſay,</l>
               <l>You for your Ducking got the better pay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The ſurface of the Water you did plow,</l>
               <l>And for your pains reapt twelve pences enough:</l>
               <l>But other things we all might well have lookt for,</l>
               <l>When in its yielding billows down you ſuckt were</l>
               <l>I wiſh that ſome may not too truly fear,</l>
               <l>A Proverb has preſerv'd our Engeneer.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This man has walkt on Water oft before,</l>
               <l>And will again, or elſe be ſeen no more.</l>
               <l>And this he'll promiſe, that without a Boon,</l>
               <l>Another day he will dance there alone.</l>
               <l>And for his ſlip amends that he may make,</l>
