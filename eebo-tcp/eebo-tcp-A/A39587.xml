         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have herein endeavoured for your Satisfaction, to let you ſee the Treachery and Deceit of the World, and to our woful Experience the Long Reign of the old Man Satan, who was the only chief Inſtrument of depriving our Fore-Father <hi>Adam</hi> of the great Privileges and Enjoyments he had in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and the Glory he had in his first State of Purity and Innocency, but Satan through his Envy and Malice, promiſed him Bribes, the which Bribes were, that if he had eaten the forbidden Fruit, he ſhould be capable of Good and Evil. Secondly, he tempted <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> to betray Chriſt, and ſell him for thirty pieces of ſilver. And dear Reader, by theſe and ſeveral other Circumſtances we ſee what Efficacy Bribery hath, and what Iniquity and Wickedneſs enſues from it.</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledge I am not in a Capacity to grace this Paper with painted Eloquence, or deciphered Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but notwithſtanding the purpoſe that I deſigned it to, I ſuppoſe you are as concerned to know it as I am; for it is moſt certain, that the Serpent lurketh about ſeeking whom to devour, which is a Caution to us to have a care whom we truſt, though indeed ſometimes we may miſtruſt honeſt Folks, and entertain Knaves,
<pb facs="tcp:52961:3"/>
as we find it often falls out ſo, but not to hinder your-coming to the reading of this my Endeavours for your ſatisfaction. Blame me not for wanting Elegancy, for Sincerity is better than Oratory. I hope you will receive it kindly of me, to trace my purpoſe, as well as I could, and excuſe my weakneſs and errors, in matter of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Orthography or Sence, for it may be my Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not be frustrated, but ſome that read this will be Charitable, and receive plain truth more deſirable and welcome, than falſe Philoſophy; for I am ſure of the two Compariſons, Truth will take place, as it is ſaid <hi>Omnia vincit Veritas.</hi> I will leave you to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration, and charitable Opinion of me, and take me as you pleaſe, but I ſhall remain a Friend for <hi>England,</hi> and ſo <hi>Farewell.</hi>

            <head>A SATISFACTORY RELATION OF Three Perſons, <hi>Who thought upon three reſpective, ſeveral Accounts, to perſwade the King, Parliament, Council, and Subjects, of theſe three Nations, no not adhibit, Credit, or Belief, to any or all of the Diſcoverers of the late Popiſh Plot, which by divine Providence, hath been Diſcovered, to the undeniable and ample view of the World.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AND thus, the above three mentioned Perſons, (whoſe names are, as followeth) (Captain <hi>Elie, Simpſon Tonge,</hi> and <hi>John Crawley:)</hi> laid about their three ſeveral Deſigns; The Firſt Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> whoſe Deſign, was, and is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate, the Popiſh Intereſt, and alſo his own Exaltation, and Fortune. Secondly <hi>Simpſon Tonge,</hi> whoſe deſign was, to be revenged of his Father, as I ſhall give an account of more at large, in the enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, <hi>John Crawly</hi> who through diſtreſs, and want, and alſo his deſire, and inclination to ſerve the Popiſh Party, was by that, and the Conſultation and Combination he had with the other two, perſwaded that he could ſerve the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and purchaſe for himſelf a better Intereſt of Livelyhood, than he had before, which as is manifeſtly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52961:4"/>
known, by his bare Garb, and ſpare Diet, he had no Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood at all.</p>
            <p>Having plainly laid down before you the Reaſons, and Deſigns, the above three mentioned Perſons, propoſed to themſelves, if they could by their audacious Subornation, diſanul the King's Evidences, puſh off the King, Councel, Parliament, and Countrey, of theſe three Nations, from believing the real being of any ſuch thing as an intended Plot by the Papiſts, kindled againſt his Majeſties Perſon, his Laws and Government, or Church-Settlement, and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England.</hi> But inſtead of that they would firſt aſſert, that the Popiſh Party in theſe three Kingdoms are the beſt Subjects, and what they are imputed with, of an inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſpiracy, or Plot, ſprung firſt from Inveteracy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and Hatred, and alſo an old Root of Antipathy, that the Papiſts aſſert the Proteſtants to harbour for them. Theſe I ſay are the ſtrongeſt Grounds, the foreſaid three Perſons, have for their firmeſt Foundations, to carry on ſuch Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, audacious and falſe Undertakings, to contradict, and invalidate the King's prudent and wiſe Underſtanding, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Great Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and the moſt Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Privy-Councel, who to any mans rational underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are Perſons of incomparable Prudence, Wiſdom, and Learning, as that they would not undervalue their ſaid ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral worthy Faculties and unparalell'd Underſtanding, and likewiſe their Chriſtian Principle, as to give Credit to any uncertain hearſayings, nor vain blaſts of falſe Informations, but their great Wiſdom leads them narrowly to ſearch and dive into the depth of all Cauſes, that come before them to be tryed. They are ſo careful, how to paſs their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that they try the very foundation, of the Kings Evidences, how? and in what meaſure, and in what years, and in what times of the year, the Evidences became acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the firſt, and the whole ſummary agitation of the Popiſh Plot.</p>
            <p>And if they find by the Evidences, Inſtances, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that they have truth on their ſide, by ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, Depoſitions, and Confeſſions, that they make unto ſeveral perſons, diſtinctly and diverſly, or in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52961:4"/>
the Lords before whom theſe examinations and Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are taken, do compare one Confeſſion to another, and proceed accordingly, and accordingly place their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. This through and ample ſearch the King, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Councel, and ſubordinate Magiſtrates, through all Cauſes that come to be tryed before them, ſo that thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is a great Preſumption, and a contumelious Incredulity, for any perſon or perſons whatſoever to go about to invalidate and contradict, what the ſaid Lords or Subordinate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates do upon well grounded and certain Inſtances, confirm and acknowledge to be truth. And therefore their Tryals in ſuch Cauſes, and in many inferiour Cauſes, in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relating to the Popiſh Plot, their approbation of it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as is above mentioned, ſo that no particular Cauſe is wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, but is tryed as the Gold in the Furnace, which implies that people of ſo great Wiſdom, as the Governour, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of theſe three Kingdoms are, who narrowly ſearch the truth of all things before they paſs it by as cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited or contradicted. So that we have more reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and receive for currant what they confirm, than what three falſe Suborners would fain blow up unto our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the contrary, whoſe Deſigns, Intents, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes are as above cited, and as I ſhall more amply give you an account of. Theſe ſaid three Suborned Witneſſes that falſely, and contumeliouſly, contradict the King's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, who paſſed through ſuch Purificatory of Tryals, as they have done.</p>
            <p>I ſay it is very hard if ſuch Enormities, committed againſt King and Government, ſhould paſs without Correction. Now I muſt turn to give you an account of the ſaid three Suborned Witneſſes, or Evidences, whoſe names <hi>are above</hi> cited. I am acquainted with two of them, but one whoſe name is <hi>Elie,</hi> is a ſtranger to me, but I find by a relative ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I have had of him, how he deſigned to carry on this Subornation, which is the laſt of many monſtrous, and horrible cheats he hath committed, controled and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this many years in <hi>England.</hi> But of this particular, you ſhall hear more at large in the enſuing part of this Treatiſe. And now I muſt come to hint of his two Confederates, who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52961:5"/>
are my Acquaintance, and of the ſaid two I do intend to treat, who thought to inveſt themſelves, with a pretended Coat of Loyalty, to his Sacred Majeſty of Great <hi>Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> But the ſaid Coat being but a ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand one, and bare-thread worn, and the Colour of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Black, and as the nature of the colour Black is to wear, or rot away, ſooner than any other Colour ſhall, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it is too much boyled in the dying. But I ſhall not inſiſt to give an accompt of a Trade that I have no more skill in, than the above three Gentlemen had in chooſing ſuch a rotten Garb, which wore out ſo ſoon, and tore ſo unexpectedly, that the rent appeared ſo ſtrangely, as that ſoon their Nakedneſs were eſpyed and diſcovered, which more plainly to let you underſtand it, their Knavery, and Subornation, was deſcryed: and as it is thought, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards may enſue, that their Iniquity ſhall not paſs uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; But now in the Interim, notwithſtanding their great dependency, upon the maineſt ſupporters of Subornation, as that we ſee, for all the Combination of the Pope and the Devil; their Iniquity ſhall be brought to light to their ſhame and Confuſion. So as that they will be glad, to make them Aprons of Figtree Leaves, to hide the iniquity and wickedneſs of their ſinful deviliſh and malicious undertakings, which to my underſtanding, I cannot term it better; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he or they be, that are led away by the wicked inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Satan, are hired or bribed to take falſe Oaths, and bind themſelves in Covenant with the Devil, irrevocably, and that in as much as they will ranſack their Conſciences, and make a ſhipwrack of them, as theſe three Suborners have done, though indeed I muſt confeſs they were put on, ſo to do, by the Counfounders of Chriſtianity, Religion, Godlineſs, Holineſs, and Piety, and all other Chriſtian Laws, and Governments, to uſe all means whatſoever with a general Indulgence, for ſo doing, for to Confound the King, the Church, Government, and Kingdoms of theſe three Nations, expecting that this late moſt Abominable and Horrible Plot, ſhould be placed as a perpetual ſtain, over the heads of Proteſtants. The propoſals of the which Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, being thus; That if the ſaid three Suborners, could
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52961:5"/>
or would, whether right or wrong, take their Oaths, that they knew ſuch Contracts, in the Writings, of the chiefeſt and ſtrongeſt Evidences the King hath, as that what they ſeveral times depoſed upon Oath, and manifeſtly proved in ſuch a through and Emphatical manner, as that all Perſons of whatſoever Degree, Dignity, or Quality, durſt not nor will ſcruple, (that is to ſay, ſuch as are endued with common Senſe, Reaſon, or Underſtanding) but the ſaid Evidences of the King, ſpoke nothing but real and manifeſt truth, in what they have declared or depoſed as to the proof of the Plot. But the Ancient antipathy and Malice of <hi>Rome,</hi> is ſtill bent and ever will be, during the Reign of the Romans to do all the miſchief to the Proteſtant Religion and Government, to the utmoſt of their power, and to this end they thought to make themſelves more drunk with the Cup of Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then to vomit it out upon the heads of Engliſh, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and Scottiſh Proteſtants; when they ſeeing that the Lord was pleaſed to break the Vail that covered and hid their untolerable wickedneſs, and let their ſhameful deeds be ſeen in and through the World. But they who much may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Magicians of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as often as <hi>Moſes</hi> through and by the power of God, turned the Rod to ſeveral vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant or lively Poſtures of twelve Creatures, ſo the Egyptian Magicians by the Power of the Devil, worked a formal reſemblance to that which the man of God, and by his power Acted, which thus implies, that as the Lord was pleaſed to diſcover to let the people of <hi>England,</hi> ſee the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous naked Sword of <hi>Rome,</hi> that was ready to cut their Throats: ſo the Popiſh party on the other hand, with their Magical Spells of Money, thought to raiſe ſuch perverſe, perjured Suborners, for to ſwear that the Plot was firſt contrived and hatched by the Proteſtant Party, upon the which Sound of the Magick Money Art, the above mentioned Captain <hi>Elie, Sympſon Tongue,</hi> and <hi>John Crawley,</hi> contrived together, and thought it a great prey, and cryed one to another, Come let us go to the Popiſh Party and ſwear three Oaths, That Doctor <hi>Tonge,</hi> Doctor <hi>Oats,</hi> Captain <hi>Bedloe, &amp;c.</hi> were the firſt Contrivers of the Popiſh Plot, and that they have ſo contrived it, as that they made the King averſe againſt his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52961:6"/>
Subjects, and expells ſome of them into forreign Countries, baniſht ſome of them that were in great Favour at Court, and deprived them of the privilege of bearing Office or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Magiſtracy under him within his Juriſdiction, or Dominions, I ſay, as to the ſaid Suborners, that their Hands were greaſed, and their Lips anoynted for to exclaim againſt the King's Evidences, in hopes they may procure more people to compact with them in Perjury, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornation, and they would ſhare with them in what moneys they could receive upon that account. I have given you thus far an account of the Subornation of theſe three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and now I will let you underſtand what three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they are, their Intents, Deſigns, and Purpoſes, as I have promiſed in the beginning of my foregoing lines. That Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> who was the Chiefeſt Ringleader of the other two, is frequently termed a great States-man, and a Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Contriver, which may very well be ſeen in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he took to manage his Buſineſs, when he went about to raiſe a Company of Suborned Witneſſes, to ſerve the Devil againſt his King, as I ſhall let you more clearly ſee, before I bring my notes of him to a period. I will inſiſt a little longer upon ſo worthy a Subject as he is, and though I am not perſonally acquainted with him, yet I am told ſome people compare him to a Kidnapper, and the reaſon why they compare him to ſo unbeſeeming a Compariſon, is this, becauſe the Kidnapper, when he is about to ſnap up people for his purpoſe, he is like the Fiſherman, who lays out ſeveral fair and inviting Baits, which tempts the poor innocent Fiſh, ſo that through the temptation thereof, he gives ſuch a ſnap at the Bait, thinking or little ſuſpecting to be prejudiced by that ſaib Bait, but poor Creature, there is a hook in the Bait, that as ſoon as ever the fiſh gives a ſnap, and a pull, the ſaid hook takes hold, in his Jaws, or Throat, ſo that the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man draws him to ſhore, and takes his hook out of him, and puts the fiſh into his Basket; theſe ſaid Reſemblances, of Kidnapping and Fiſhing, in my thinking become very well Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> and his Jeſuitical Baits of drawing, tempting, and leading poor people to Prejury and Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, expecting thereby, to propagate the Popiſh Intereſt,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52961:6"/>
advance his own fortune and to ſeduce ſuch as he takes, to temporal and ſpiritual miſerie. But he being not the only Subject of my Diſcourſe, I do intend to deſiſt ſpeaking any more here of him until he comes into my purpoſe in the next Clauſe. And now to come to the main of my preſent matter, and purpoſe, I have given you ſome ſmall account of Captain <hi>Elie</hi>'s Proceedings, who was the only Ringleader of this miſchievous Contrivance of Subornation, who alſo was the Captain of <hi>Sympſon Tonge,</hi> who is a man of a great eſteem of himſelf, and thinks himſelf to be a man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Knowledge, Capacity, and Worth, and for my part thus far I have to ſay of him, in thoſe my following lines, that if he had but money enough, as he expected that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Elie</hi> would procure for him, I am certain he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Ladies of Honour a Glaſs of the beſt Wine, a Doſe of Phyſick, and a good Allarm when they are drinking of the Wine, which he thought, or at leaſt expected he could have been always able to maintain, by his being one of the above mentioned hirelings, or Suborners of the black Coat: but poor man! he is ſadly diſappointed, and irrecoverably fruſtrated. For inſtead of their pretended carrying on the work of Subornation, and the wearing of the Black Coat, whereby he expected to be able to keep a Coach, and ſix Horſes, and likewiſe he expected to occaſion the King's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences to be trodden under foot, and the Parliament and Councel, to be counted ridiculous and fooliſh, and the Laws of the Nation to be unjuſt and unrighteous, which thus the ſaid Evidences propoſed to themſelves, that if they could get the King's Evidences Countermanded, and Counterpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and by the ſame get them invalidated; all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes and People in <hi>Europe,</hi> would cry ſhame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people of <hi>England</hi> and their Laws and Government, how unjuſtly they execute their Subjects, without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain foundation or well-grounded Reaſon for ſo doing. Nay it would be a perpetual blemiſh upon the head of <hi>England,</hi> until Doomſ-day: I ſay, this was the intended deſign, and purpoſe, of theſe Suborners, to ſee whether they could baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle the King out of his Judgment, contradict the Lords of both Parliament and Councel in their Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52961:7"/>
and ſo blemiſh the Laws of <hi>England</hi> for ever. But as I have promiſed to hint further of <hi>Sympſon Tonge,</hi> I muſt needs confeſs he had another reſerved aim in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his Subornation, as I ſhall let you ſee when it comes to my purpoſe, and in the interim I ſhall only hint his Torn black Coat, in the which he thought to wrap himſelf up from the Reproaches and Scandals that he purchaſed for himſelf, for his Confederacy, Combination, and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; with his ſo called Noble Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> and his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen <hi>John Crawley;</hi> having wrapt himſelf as aforeſaid, ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, narrowly, and roundly into the Cloak, that it tore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and the rent was ſo wide, and he being in company with his Ladies of Honour who diſcovered his Nakedneſs, and then cryed away with him, he is clap'd, he hath got no Money, let him come here no more, and they alſo cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in a Laughter and a Table-talk, you had better go to Madam <hi>Cellier</hi> who is a good Midwife, and hath skill in Chirurgery, who alſo if ſhe gets it her ſelf will convey it to another, by reaſon of her converſe with the people over whom you thought to ſpread the black Cloak, whom alſo for ſome time you fed with Fancy and Conceit of your great Works, when you expected to caſt over the blame of the Popiſh Plot, when your Father, Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> and the reſt of the King's Evidences, and thereby bear the popiſh Party ſpotleſs, and blameleſs, which indeed if you could do, I muſt acknowledge you would be a happy man, and they a happy people both as to the ſtate of their Bodies and Souls.</p>
            <p>For they have got ſo deep into the Mire of it, that they cannot ſo ſoon be rid of it, for if it had been as falſe as it is true, and that they were as Innocent as they were Guilty, I am certain wherever he be that could clear them, would make himſelf a happy man, and them a happy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as to the view of the World; But not before God, for it is ſaid in Scripture, <hi>Non demittitur peccatum, niſi restituatur oblatum;</hi> But not that I am about to Preach to you, nor to hinder ſuch a man as this man <hi>Sympſon Tonge</hi> is, who promiſed to bring truth to light, but inſtead of ſo doing he hath brought falſehood under the cover of his old Black Cloak, but as the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52961:7"/>
Lord will have it, he prevented his falſe Deſigns, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him and them into a rejection and diſdain in the eſteem of any Rational People, and thus he cheated himſelf and deprived himſelf of the privilege he might have obtained in the natural affection and love that he might have been ſtill partaker of, but let him ſee what it is for a man to forfeit certainty for uncertainty, and when he throughly, and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly looks into it, he may as well ſay to his two former Confederates Captain <hi>Elie</hi> and <hi>Crawley;</hi> as he ſaid to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men when they beheld his Nakedneſs, and diſcovered his <hi>Venus</hi> Diſeaſe, as he cryed, Alas they cheated me! But judge you, what it's to build a Tower of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence upon the words of a treacherous Villain, and therein to confide, as <hi>Sympſon Tonge</hi> truſted confidently in the fair promiſes and ſweet words of Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> when he firſt deluded him, and next, judge what it is to build a Paradice, with Kiſſes, Wine, and Money, in a womans Boſom, the which three materials, are as ſtedfaſt as he is treacherous: I will direct you, to learn the uncertainty of theſe two Compariſons, of him who moſt tryed to his woeful experience the event of ſuch matters, and the next thing it is how much this poor man hath to bemoan and bewail his wretched and deſperate Condition. I Inſtance you this ſimile, as much as it had been from his own mouth, what it is to begin to love Women ſo ſoon as he did, and that in ſuch a meaſure, as that he would run any hazard to enjoy it. And ſeeing that he could not enjoy it, not half to his laſcivious deſire, by reaſon that he had not money enough, his Means being but ſmall, whereupon he thought it his only and neareſt way to procure money and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his deſire, to play a Game at Sice-Ace, or Tick-tack, with the Pope and his Party: and I would wiſh with all my heart, that the Knave could win one thouſand pound of the Pope; but hang the Pope, he is a Serpent-like Dog, he is ſo craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſubtile, and covetous, as that in ſo ſhort a time as <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> had to do with him, it is impoſſible to pump ſo much money out of him; but I muſt needs confeſs, as I find <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was ever unlucky, if he were wiſe he might have cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Pope, for he is an old blind Cuckold; and cannot
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52961:8"/>
well ſee, nor ever did, nor ever ſhall as long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in his devilliſh Superſtition and Idolatry, but I muſt kick by the Pope a while and take another diſh of diſcourſe with <hi>Sympſon Tonge,</hi> which is this, that I muſt tell him as I find ſeveral well grounded, ſolid, and learned men, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly to agree upon this opinion, that there is a decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal lett, decreed for a man in his life time in this World, the which lots and decrees are manifold and ſundry-fold, and every man hath his proper decree, or lot, whatſoever it be good or bad he cannot avoid it, which is to ſay, by the very obſervation of the Firmaments, as is commonly obſerved by the Mathematicians, and Aſtrologians, as thus, if a man be born under a twopenny Planet, he will never be worth a Groat in his life time. I do not intend, to treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs upon your patience, with the circumſpective Obſervations that thoſe words would require to be traced in, for I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you would ſay, it had been too tedious ſo to do; and in another place, it is anciently obſerved by the afore old Arts-men, <hi>viz.</hi> Mathematicians, and Aſtrologians, that if a man be born to be hanged all the world cannot prevent it, or ſave him, and I doubt very much if Mr. <hi>Sympſon Tonge</hi> eſcapes either the one or the other, of the ſaid decrees, or lots; not that I truſt, or give credit to any ſuch Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by his own very Carriage, and by the dreadful view I have of his moſt monſtrous Enormities; And now ſeeing that I undertook to treat of one more of his other two Confederates in Knavery, and Subornation, I do intend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin where I left off; Having given you an account already of their Names, Conditions, and expected Commiſſions, their conditions you muſt of neceſſity conclude with me, that it muſt be ſome Great Orator, that is able to define their ſaid malicious, perverſe, and wicked Conditions, and I muſt leave it in the mean while to your own prudent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what condition ſuch Audacious, Contumelious, and perverſe Rogues can be endured with, who went about to contradict the Eminent and Great Wiſdom that the moſt of the Peers of <hi>England</hi> are endued with, who ſit both in Parliament and Concel. Nay furthermore, they went about to outface the Great and Dread Soveraign of the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52961:8"/>
who was by ſtrength of reaſon, and undeniable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences convinced and ſatisfied, that there was nothing ſurer, under the Godhead, than that there was a real Plot in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation againſt him by the popiſh Party, and as to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected Commiſſions, if the Black old worn Coat had endured a little longer; But it was too threadbare before they got it that they could do no good with it: but every one of them as to his reſpective Commiſſion, whereupon they relyed the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture welfare of their being, As for <hi>Elie</hi> he ſhould have been the ſecond General <hi>Monk,</hi> or the ſecond Chancellour <hi>Hyde;</hi> And as for <hi>Sympſon Tonge,</hi> he expected to be Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or of ſome other great Archiepiſcopacy, at the next vacancy; And as for <hi>John Crawley,</hi> he expected to be a great Officer, at leaſt a Captain of a Man of War, or a Captain of the King's Life-Guard. Whereof all their three ambitious Deſigns and wiſhed for deſires, were grievouſly diſappointed, and fruſtrated. Such diſappointment, had been moſt ſuitable to all ſuch perverſe Perjurers, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orners, (as I ſuppoſe,) the Event of the Progreſs will be no better than what I term it. Though at their firſt growth they may grow up with a viſible poſſibility of continuing in the ſame manner that they grow in, but it is very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably obſerved, that all ſorts of Grains, Trees, or Leaves, or any thing that grows, that ſooneſt, and unexpectedly yields a fragrant Bloſſom, but it is concluded all ſuch as yield their Bloſſoms before their natural time, they fade and wither away, ſo that there comes no fruit of their Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms; which I verily believe, will prove the ſame with theſe three upſtarted Imps, in whoſe proceedings they only glory themſelves, and upon their boughs they beheld very comfortable Bloſſoms, whereof they did much glory and rejoyce, but when it came to the time of Fruit, they yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none, but their Bloſſoms withered away before they came into any maturity; and they themſelves, remain like three wetherbeaten old Stumps, without either fruit, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or good ſucceſs in their undertakings, which is what we expected when firſt we heard of their proceedings. You may ſee, the event of Iniquity is commonly Deſtruction, and Ruine, incident to the Workers thereof; and I do not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52961:9"/>
queſtion, but it will be the event of theſe three diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Suborners, to fall ten degrees lower than ever they were, for they are not favoured neither on the one ſide nor on the other, but of all ſides they are dejected, rejected, undervalued, and diſdained, ſo that I can compare them to no better ſimilitude, than they are like three mad Dogs, who after falling mad, run away from their maſter, every body cries, kill them! they are mad! which is the ſame in courſe with Captain <hi>Elie, Simpſon Tonge,</hi> and <hi>John Craivley,</hi> three who thought themſelves merry men; I ſuppoſe they have no ſuch pleaſure in their mirth now, but that I dare ſay they would give it in exchange for mine. And I leave them to what they enjoy, and to that indeed that may lead them to repentance.</p>
            <p>Now having completed their ſeveral Styles, and Titles, their Aims, Deſigns, Intents, and Purpoſes, and having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo given an account what they expected to benefit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their kindling of their Subornation, which I am certain they could not ſo confidently propoſe to themſelves, without the Promiſes, Supportations, and Aſſiſtance, of ſome great People. But ſeeing we have not, (as yet,) any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grounds of Reaſon, to build our ſuſpicion upon any particular Perſons, to be concerned in the raiſing of ſuch Suborners, we will only thus conclude, and ſo reſt ſilent, until the Lord, (who hath ſeen and knows their Iniquity) may be pleaſed to diſcover them, and their miſchievous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and Deſigns; as he hath been graciouſly pleaſed with his powerful hand, to protect theſe Kingdoms, and to diſcover all Miſchiefs, and malicious Contrivances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivances, that were like to fall upon them by the Contracts of evil People; And for his Protection, Guidance, Shelter, and Direction, which he hath many a time been graciouſly pleaſed to ſhew theſe Nations, we deſire to render unto him, the Praiſes, the Glory, the Honour, and Renown, both now and for ever.</p>
            <p>I muſt hint once more at <hi>Sympſon Tonge,</hi> who as he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, is very well known to be one that loved beſt, and chieflyeſt preferred the love of ſtrange women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the love of his natural Parents, which is a Quality,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52961:9"/>
was very much diſcerned and beheld in him, ſince he came to the knowledge of good and Evil; Which is a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, manifeſt, and inſpectious Demonſtration, of the want of Grace in any Child, to prefer any worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure beyond the love of his Parents, the which want of natural love is diſcerned to inhabit in the breaſt of the ſaid <hi>Simpſon Tonge.</hi> Which his Father having throughly read, by his Carriage, and natural Inclination, and accordingly, by all the means poſſible he could, watcht how his ſaid Son ſpent his time, in what Company, and in what Exerciſe, he moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted: and the manner of ſpending his time, and what little Money he could ſcrape of his Father and Uncle, he ſpent it in the Company of Women, as far as it reach'd. But his Purſe falling ſhort, and weak, he could not thereby pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe any womens Company keeping, ſo that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he could no longer frequent their Society, but inſtead of ſo doing, he lighted on a company of ſcurrilous fellows, that would Drink, Sing, and Smoak with him, (for he himſelf is an indefatigable Smoaker,) there is no kind of Liquors that come amiſs in his Diſh whatſoever, the more he drinks the more he would, the longer he ſits the longer he would. So that Singing, Drinking and womens Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany keeping, (if he could be his own Carver) would be his delight all his life time. And if I write here more, as to the Deſcription of his Inclinations, than what you may be apt to believe, of theſe my Deſcriptions of this Gentleman, if you be ſo concerned, and that your fancy may lead you, to enquire, whether thoſe my Deſcriptions of him, and his worldly Delights and Pleaſures: you may then if you pleaſe, enquire of thoſe that are longer acquainted, and nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him, than I am. Who I am certain, if they lay by Impartiality, and declare of him, what their Conſcience leads them to, will confirm what I herein write, or declare of my knowledge of this man, to be real truth, in moſt or all the particulars of his Life and Converſation, that I have undertaken to give an account of. Nay I will ſay moreover, if they were examined and put to their Oath, if they were really led by their Conſcience, whether or not they know theſe things to be true that I write in this Paper,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52961:10"/>
and that if they do not forſwear themſelves, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what I ſay herein. It is very well known that he hath been cured of the Diſeaſe called the <hi>Venus</hi> Diſeaſe, or that which is found in <hi>Venus</hi> Garden, and his Father payed for his Cure ſeveral times, and alſo Chaſtiſed him with ſuch Fatherly Correction, for his ſeveral and manifold Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Drunkenneſs, and Whoredoms, every time that he could trace him in it. But he getting in favour with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Acquaintance, and Servants, as that the tenth part of his Enormities, and wicked Relapſes, were not brought to his Fathers knowledge, ſo that moſt of them paſſed without Correction; and when his Father (to his great Grief) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that his unhappy Son was ſo overpowered with the Works of Satan, and ſo filled and overwhelmed with ſuch Groſs, Horrible, and Abominable Enormities, and Relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he with many Sobs, and Sighs, determined to cloud his Countenance from him for ſome ſmall time, which he was forced to make uſe of ſuch Notions for his ſaid Sons Caſtigations ſeveral times, and that to the end that he might underſtand how much the Lord abhors Sin, and how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous it would be to his Father to ſee his Son run headlong in Apoſtacy againſt God, and in Diſobedience againſt his Father. And upon the other hand again, that he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what Peace, Pleaſure, and ſundry other advantagious Comforts and Conſolations it is, to the Soul and Body, to be in peace with God, and in the dutiful Obedience that Children owe to Parents, and whilſt they keep that peace with God, and that loving natural Obedience they owe to their Parents, the Lord will ſhield them from all or moſt other Temptations of the Devil, and that in ſuch Meaſure, as that the Devil ſhall never have power over ſuch obedient Children, as by their Diſobedience to God, and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, they purchaſe him to have over them. O alas! then how ſhall it be with that Child? who for the ſmall Lucre of a filthy Gain of Money, will not only be contented of a Revenge againſt his Father, would not be ſatisfied to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and diſpleaſe him many a time, but muſt needs uſe all the means he could to take away his Fathers Life, And that by taking falſe Oath, and complyed with others ſo to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52961:10"/>
do? which indeed, will go very near to be accompliſhed by him and his Confederates, if Perjuration and Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if likewiſe the Amity betwixt the Pope and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, would be taken any notice of by the Adminiſters of the Law of this Nation; But as we have reaſon to bleſs God, and pray for the well and long Rule and Reign of our King, and the continuance of our Good Laws, which I hope, may at long run, take to conſideration the monſtrous and unhumane Iniquity and Wickedneſs of theſe ſaid three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orners, and handle them as their great Tranſgreſſions ſhall require. Who went about to cloud the Nation with an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of innocent Bloodſhedding, which queſtionleſs would be done through the means of the ſaid Suborners, had it not been prevented by the divine Providence, and an hundred more clear Manifeſtations and truer Demonſtrations, than ever they (with all their Subornations) ſhall be able, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, and Efficaciouſly to contradict. Though indeed I muſt confeſs, that if the Caſe ſtood ſo ſted faſt on their ſide, as they are grounded in Lies, and Falſehood, it would do very well with them; They have related up and down the Town, amongſt their Whores, and Holes, or (at leaſt <hi>Simpſon Tonge</hi> hath) that the King received him with a great deal of Honour, Reſpect, and Credit, Embraced him in his Arms, placed him upon a Couch hard by him; which is but one of his Lies, (although a moſt falſe and incredible Story) it is to any Perſons that have competent Judgment, that the King would harbour with ſo great a Reception ſuch a ſhit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten School-Boy, who never attained to ſuch Knowledge, or Worth, as to be eſteemed a Favourite by our Great Monarch, as he moſt falſly and audaciouſly affirms he hath been. Which I ſtate here, as an inſtance unto you, that you may judge whether or no he that would tell ſuch an abominable and an unprofitable Lye for nothing, would tell a more Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous (though this is very Hainous) for his Expectation of being made Biſhop of the next vacant Biſhoprick. I infer this to this Effect, that if the Credit, Reputation, Honour, and Safety of theſe three Nations, upon ſuch a rotten Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as theſe three Perſons are, who will ſtick no more to Truth nor ſtumble no more at telling a Lye, then they will to kiſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52961:11"/>
their Whores, when their Luſts moſt burn them, or drink their Liquor when they are moſt deſirous to be Drunk, the which deſire (in them) is never wanting.</p>
            <p>Having ſhown this one inſtance, of the inſufficiency and unlawfulneſs of ſuch Evidences, to be taken in leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances and Conſequences than the welfare of theſe three Nations, I expect this Paper may come into ſome bodies hands whoſe good and knowing Inclination may lead them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue well of this my inference. As alſo, of another that I ſhall place after it, which is this, that I would deſire to know, whether or not it is lawful for a man, who takes upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be an Evidence in Matters of State, nay in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Caſe in whatſoever Evidences are required? when he or they undertakes to carry on and ſtand by as Evidences, for to maintain ſuch Caſes, as he propoſes or promiſes to do, and having ſo promiſed, afterwards to go with his purſe of Money to bribe people, as I ſhall hereafter prove, that the ſaid <hi>Sympſon Tonge</hi> and Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> have given fourty ſhillings in money to a Woman, who was Houſekeeper to Doctor <hi>Tonge;</hi> And afterwards they offered her three pounds more, upon Condition ſhe would declare and take upon Oath what they would have her do, as to the placing of the firſt Ofspring and beginning of the Popiſh Plott, upon the heads of Doctor <hi>Tonge,</hi> Doctor <hi>Oates, &amp;c.</hi> and if ſhe would yield to take the ſaid Oath, ſhe ſhould be preferred to any preferment whatſoever ſhe would deſire. From this Inſtance I infer, that ſeeing motions of Bribery and Ambition of Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is much made uſe of by the foreſaid Perſons, for to raiſe ſuborned Witneſſes, which I ſuppoſe when you take it into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, you will judge the Promoters of this ſaid Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould not nor muſt not be received as Evidences for the King, or any State-Matter, nay you muſt of neceſſity grant, that it is abominable to ſuffer any ſuch Bribe-hatchers to ſpeak in this behalf; for I am certain if it be ſo now in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that the Evidence of ſuch people is received as Material and Colloteral, it hath not been ſo in old times, and the Laws are as good now as ever they were, if Suborners could be kept at diſtance, which if not it is not ſafe for an honeſt man to live in his own Countrey. For he doth not know
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52961:11"/>
who to truſt to, whereas Bribes and pitiful ones, leads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Son falſly, and treacherouſly, to betray his Father, And all that in hopes and Ambition of a little Preferment. Which conſideration when you read this will ſhew you the unlawfulneſs of ſuch Perſons, who would not ſtumble to cut your Throats for their own Intereſt. I pray therefore, beware of Wolfs in Sheeps-Cloathing. For I am ſure, theſe three perſons of Subornation can be compared to no better thing.</p>
            <p>Now having ſhewn you theſe perſons Condition, that is to ſay, two of them with whom I was chiefeſt acquainted, how and in what manner they lived, only I left off giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an account of <hi>John Crawley,</hi> whoſe dependency of Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, depended moſt and chiefly upon the Benevolence of his Acquaintance here in Town, his Buſineſs here was upon pretence of learning the Law, and for ought I know, he may learn his belly full of it, and that in ſuch meaſure as that if you will give him rope enough he will hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: he is an Iriſhman by his Countrey, he is a man of a very looſe Life and Converſation, he is a great Whoremaſter, mighty debauch'd in all Exerciſes, a great Curſer, Swearer and Drinker: mighty forgetful of the natural Courſe of Temperance and Modeſty, I ſpeak nothing but what might be proved, therefore in as much as I have in ſhort ſhewn you, the Lives, Converſations, and the diſtreſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Condition, of theſe two of whom I promiſed in the foregoing part of this Relation to give you an account of; whoſe demerited diſtreſs, by reaſon of their Debauchery, and evil courſe of Life led them to be tempted by Captain <hi>Elie</hi>'s Moneys, which when you throughly weigh and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the rate they led their lives in, you will and muſt of neceſſity grant, that there is but little or no truſt to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Words or Oaths of ſuch debauch'd and lewd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, from whence I ſhall infer the unlawfulneſs of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; But I ſhall ceaſe of ſo doing, until I give a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account of Doctor <hi>Tonge</hi>'s Son: of whom I have to ſay that he or whoever, that goes about to betray his own Parents, which is contrary to the Precept and Commandment of God ſo to do, that I gueſs, Reaſon may guide any rational Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52961:12"/>
to place the leſs truſt or Confidence in him, for he who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be that would be ſo ſoon led away, and ſo eaſily perſwaded by the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe his dear and good Father, who is known to be a worthy and a reverend Man, and a good and loyal Subject, true and truſty to his King and Countrey, upon the which account he hath ſpent all his Eſtate, to defend, maintain and propagate the King, Church and Government Intereſt in theſe three Nations, to the utmoſt, and beyond his power, Capacity, and Ability; and when this moderate, learned and diſcreet man, could not with ſafe Conſcience, neither his Stock, nor his Eſtate was able to maintain the inordinate and riotous Deſires and Deſigns of his Son, but according to his Capacity, allowed him competently as he thought fit or neceſſary for him. But his Son being not therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, nor ſatisfied, as he was ever unſatiable; he betook him to a ſerious Conſideration, which way he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of his Father, for cutting ſhort his former and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Allowance of Maintenance and Subſiſtence. And thereupon after ſome premeditation and deliberation of time, he ruſhes forth into theſe Exclamations againſt his Father, and ſaid, come hang it (thought he) I will be thus reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, I will raiſe a meaſure of the duſt and Street<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweepings of <hi>Rome</hi> about his Ears and Eyes; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I ſhall ſtifle and blind him, and thereupon after having reſolutely determined to be thus revenged of his Father, and nothing wanting to his power to prejudice both his Father and the Countrey, but the next opportunity that may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that Effect. Having within a ſmall time afterwards met with an elderly man, whoſe name was Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> whoſe Son ſerved Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> and afterwards for ſome Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, that he had committed againſt Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> was ſentenced by courſe of Law to ſtand in the Pillory. This ſaid old <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Sympſon Tonge</hi> had entred into diſcourſe <hi>(Sympſon Tonge,</hi> who never was backward to prate and talk to every body, as well unacquainted as acquainted) the old man underſtanding by him, that he was inclined to caſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probious Aſperſions upon Doctor <hi>Tonge</hi> and Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> as he's ſeen by his diſturbed and diſcontented Mind, and by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52961:12"/>
the Relation he gave him of his Father and Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> and thereupon made anſwer unto him; if that you prove truſty to me, and the Truſt you ſay you will take in hand, I will put you in a way to be revenged upon your Father for his Cruelty and Hardheartedneſs unto you, and alſo to be revenged on Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> who was ſo Tyrannical towards my poor Son, who ſerved him for ſome time; If you will therefore draw up in Writing what you know of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Privacies and Secrets, and accordingly Countermand them, as I am certain you are able to do; being a Son to Doctor <hi>Tonge,</hi> and a Schollar, and do it Efficaciouſly and Materially, and having ſo done, or at leaſt drawn up the common Heads of what you intend to Evidence againſt Doctor <hi>Tonge,</hi> Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> Captain <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and the reſt of the Diſcoverers of the Plot. And I ſhall find a truſty and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Gentleman, unto whom wholly and totally you may impart the ſummary Subſtance of what you intend to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain againſt them, and the ſaid Gentleman will adviſe and direct you in the beſt way and manner, how to bring your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs emphatically about. He is a Gentleman that deſires the Propagation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> his name is Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Elie,</hi> he can bring you and your Writings to the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the King, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and ſeveral great Lords about <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and the Lords in the <hi>Tower:</hi> through whoſe Acquaintance and Knowledge, you will meet with the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or means, to be recompenſed ſome degrees beyond any that were the King's Evidences in the Diſcovery of this Plot, nay you ſhall be of greater Eſteem and more Famous, and your Name higher extoll'd than your Father was, or would be, if he had been Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and there are many of the Lords (that I told you) both at <hi>Whitehal</hi> and the <hi>Tower,</hi> that will recompenſe you to your hearts deſire and content; Upon the which welcomed and great terms, both theſe perſons gladly entred into a banquet of incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conceits and Expectations, they ſo fed themſelves with ſuch pleaſant hopes, of being revenged of their Enemies, and accompliſhing their hearts deſire, with great Treaſures of Silver and Gold, the which Treaſure they thought would ſuffice to maintain their Ambition, during the reſt of their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52961:13"/>
days, together with the Eſteem and Affection, they would daily receive, of the Favourites of <hi>Rome,</hi> which might have been enough to maintain their Pomp all their lifetime.</p>
            <p>And they having ſo thorowly diſcourſed the Buſineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, ſo that to the end they ſhould not delay no time nor let ſlip an opportunity, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to Captain <hi>Elie</hi>'s Chamber, where after ſome ſmall waiting there, he met with him, and he gave him a full and true account of what Doctor <hi>Tonge</hi> his Son unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him at his houſe, where alſo he waited to give Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Elie</hi> a full and ſummary account, of what he thought or expected to make out concerning the carriage of the Plot, by and between Doctor <hi>Tonge,</hi> Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the which Relation of Mr. <hi>Lanes</hi> to Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> Immediately Captain <hi>Elie</hi> repairs with all Expedition poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he could, unto this ſaid <hi>Lane</hi> his houſe, where he met with <hi>Sympſon Tonge,</hi> after having information in what Room he was, having alſo offered ſome Salutations the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, The Captain ſaid Sr. I preſume that you are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the man of the houſe (naming <hi>Lane)</hi> hath informed me of, he alſo told me that you had a deſire to ſpeak with me. Sr. ſaid <hi>Sympſon Tonge</hi> I have diſcourſed with the man of whom you now ſpeak. Sr. (ſaid Captain <hi>Elie)</hi> would you be pleaſed to tell me what may be your occaſion with me. Yes, (ſays he) if you will be pleaſed to tell me your name. Sr. (ſaid he) they call me by the name of Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> and then <hi>Sympſon Tonge</hi> (replying) you are the Gentleman that I deſire to ſee, and then having after ſome ſmall circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, entred throughly and deeply into one anothers acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and accordingly <hi>Sympſon Tonge</hi> diſcourſed with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Elie</hi> the total and whole ſubſtance of what he deſigned and intended to proceed againſt his Father, Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> and the reſt of the King's Evidences. The which Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and account of <hi>Sympſon Tonge,</hi> reliſhed and taſted with the Palate of Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> as ſweet as if every word had been overflowing with honey; whereupon he replied, Sr. I perceive your preſent Condition may be bare, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall ſuddenly procure you ſome relief of Money, which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52961:13"/>
I perceive you may have occaſion of at preſent. The which free offer of Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> pleaſed very well <hi>Sympſon Tonge.</hi> That being the progreſs of their firſt Diſcourſe, they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ſatisfactorily contented the one with the other, for their firſt meeting, and from that time forth they had more frequent reſort to one anothers Company. So that Captain <hi>Elie</hi> procured as he promiſed, a recruit of Money for <hi>Sympſon Tonge.</hi> Now having given you an account of the firſt Offspring of this Subornation betwixt theſe two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Perſons, who thought fit to find out a third Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, to hold up the Brandiron upon which ſtands their Brewing-pan; whereupon <hi>Sympſon Tonge</hi> met with an old Confederate of his, in whoſe Company oftentimes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed many kiſſes to his Ladies of Honour, as is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the foregoing part of this Treatiſe, the Which Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates name was <hi>John Crawley,</hi> who I told you was one of the three that wore the black Garb, with Captain <hi>Elie</hi> and <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Tonge,</hi> of whoſe Proceedings, Deſigns, Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, I have given you as large an Account as I thought fit to treſpaſs your patience with the reading or hearing of ſuch unworthy Tranſactions, heinous Offences, againſt God and Man, and treacherous relapſes of a Son againſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and my deſign in giving you the trouble of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe particulars herein mentioned, was to let you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that I do expect your Reaſon and Underſtanding will lead you to grant me undeniably, when you read and conſider the total courſe and whole paſſages of theſe three Suborners, and alſo when you underſtand to what intent and purpoſe they deſigned their Undertakings, in this their work of Subornation, that they ſhould not, nor ought not, be received, or accepted, but as they are, and as they may be properly called, Perjurers, If it may be read in their courſe of Life, which is all the inſtances we can ſhow for their Inſufficiency of being received as Witneſſes, in Matters of State, and all that I have to ſay, is to pray that the Lord may keep you from ſuch deluding Inſtruments, <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all that I determine to treat of, as to this my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, or relation of theſe three ſelf-deſigned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52961:14"/>
Perſons, as they are termed, and mentioned gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſeverally in the foregoing part of this my account of them, ſo that I judge it both mine, yours, and all other Chriſtians Duty, and not only our Duty, but we ſhould make it our Care and Buſineſs, to pray earneſtly and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to the Lord, That he may be graciouſly pleaſed to extend unto us, a handful of his Great Mercy, and with his accuſtomed Clemency, Conſideration and Pity, lodge us under the Shadow and Shelter of his Wings, and there that we may dwell under his Tuition, Direction, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, where we might be ſafely ſecure, from the Claws and Clutches of ſuch ambitious and hungry people, as theſe or any ſuch other ſelf-deſigned Perſons are, of whoſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, ſelf-Intereſt, and Want, I have already given what account I think to handle at preſent.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly let you ſee, how and in what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Lord is pleaſed to order the inordinare and unlawful Deſigns, Intents and Purpoſes, and how he thinks fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay them with the ſelf and ſame Allowance, as he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay <hi>Cain, Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> The which three Perſons were led as we read in the holy Scriptures, by their ambitious Pride, vain Glory, and unſatiable Deſires, and intended to purchaſe ſuch Intereſts, as would render them every one as his Inclination was, whether for lucre of Gain, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Pride, Envy and Malice: which you may read in <hi>Cain</hi>'s Hiſtory, of his deſtroying his Brother, as to one of thoſe three reſpective Particulars, that I herein inſtance. The next of <hi>Eſau,</hi> whoſe aim was to be his Fathers Heir, and to have his ample Succeſſion, in the enjoyment of the plenty of the Flocks, of his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and for the purchaſing the ſame, he thought to uſe all means poſſible, to accompliſh what he aimed at, which indeed, anſwered his Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in many or moſt Reſpects. And <hi>Judas</hi> of whoſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Deſign was the third and laſt Inſtance, of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Treatiſe, as I mention them, <hi>Cain, Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> The which three perſons were led, (as we read in our Recourſe of the holy Scriptures) by their Ambition, Pride and unſatiable Deſires, as it is moſt manifeſtly ſeen, if you look through their Conditions, The one of them intended to propagate ſuch
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52961:14"/>
an Intereſt, as would render him and his Succeſſors Famous and Eminent through moſt Generations. The ſecond, for the ſake of a Prerogative, which he expected to obtain, if he could but play his Cards, as he propoſed ſeveral times to himſelf ſo to do, but at laſt to his everlaſting woe failed him. And the third, for the ſake of a ſmall filthy Lucre, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Envy and Malice; and alſo every one of the ſaid three Apoſtates, having his particular Deſign, Intent and Purpoſe, in his Hainous and wicked Relapſe, and abominable Apoſtacy, thought to Conquer all Obſtacles, Interruptions, or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, that ſtood in his way, and hindred him of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his unlawful Wiſhes, and having ſo conquered them, he expected thereby to Crown himſelf in the Throne of his ambitious Aim or Uſurpation. The which indeed I may ſay, was the main of all their deſigned Intereſts, of them that combined with them in their ſaid Undertakings. You may be pleaſed to ſee and throughly view and conſider, in what height and meaſure of Eſtimation, Ambition is harboured in the Boſom of ſome or great many perſons of theſe times. And to let you ſee more plainly, to the end that you may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take notice of the ſeveral and ſundry Inconveniences, that ambitious, covetous and envious Perſons are made ſubject to, by reaſon that they leap before they ſee, ſo that by their unadviſed Undertakings, they fall into ſeveral Laborynths and Snares of Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that inſtead of being made partakers of what they aim at, they are fruſtrated and deprived of their Expectations, and they are alſo rebuked, reproved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached in the Opinion and Judgment of the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, ſolid and wiſe men; which I ſhall let you ſee is the Event and Fruit of theſe three mentioned Perſons, that I took in hand to ſpeak of, in this my account to you of them.</p>
            <p>And now you may ſee, the antient Root of Ambition and Malice, which ſprung, and proceeded from our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, in the former Ages, may be very well in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects compared to this preſent paſſage, that I preſume you are throughly acquainted with, of Captain <hi>Elie, Sympſon Tonge,</hi> and <hi>John Crawley,</hi> for every one of theſe three pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52961:15"/>
Perſons, had their particular Aims and Deſigns, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their particular Intereſts, but woe be to them, they are by divine Providence moſt ſhamefully and reproachfully diſappointed asyou ſhall read in the following lines.</p>
            <p>For as the Lord is not pleaſed to ſuffer ſuch Abominations as thoſe perſons propoſed to themſelves, to maintain and go through with, without Reprehenſions, Reproofs and Reproaches, and that in a ſcandalous and ridiculous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as indeed the Guilt and the Crime of their Undertakings doth require Puniſhment, which I do not queſtion, but they may receive it after their own meaſure; neither doth the Lord think fit, to ſee his Anointed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Great King of theſe three Nations, together with the Subjects and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Law, Aequity and Juſtice; to be perpetually ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and blemiſhed, by the Enemies of the Government of this Land. Who in general are incomprehenſible, but it is generally and aſſuredly grounded upon the Chickens, that are hatched in the Hutch of <hi>Rome,</hi> which you nor no other perſon can deny: if he be either a Cloſet-Reader, or a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, but that it is the daily ſtudy of the ſaid Chickens, and both their Male and Female-Dame, to caſt all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities and ſcandalous Reproaches, they poſſibly can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and forge, upon the Reputation of Proteſtants, as I could inſtance ſeveral ſatisfactory Inſtances and Examples, to the ſaid effect. But I deſigned to handle it in another Paper, that I intend to let you ſee more at large, what I have ſeen, heard, and underſtood, how and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and meaſure the Popiſh Party, under whoſe wings I have been hatched for all my lifetime until the beginning of <hi>July</hi> 1679, that I Renounced them by the Direction and Tuition of God, being led ſo to do as you ſhall read in my next opportunity. And to hint where I left off in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words of the Deſign of <hi>Elie, Crawley,</hi> and <hi>Tonge,</hi> to aſperſe the King, Countrey, Church and Government of theſe three Nations, which indeed there is many a Soul, that joynes with them in ſo doing, at leaſt in their wiſhes, and thoughts, they would willingly aſſiſt and back them, for they could do it without being ſeen in it, ſo that they are loath otherways to be Concerned, but in their Clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52961:15"/>
way, they ſtir up others to blow the fire, and they kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it themſelves, which is a thing eaſily proved, if it had been throughly and narrowly examined, but for my part, I do not intend to preſs my Evidences to that effect upon any man, though that I may ſafely ſay, and not only ſay, but firmly aver that I have performed the duty of an honeſt Subject, a zealous Chriſtian and a loving Country-man. And having ſo done as is manifeſtly ſeen that I am readier to ſerve than people are to receive me, which the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb being performed, which is called, Propriate Service is not accepted. But to hint a little more of my purpoſe, to let you ſee as a Confirmation to your own underſtandings, how this contrived Contradiction of the verity of a Plot, was contracted by the above Perſons, and I do not queſtion but they had many Aſſiſtants, in theſe their Undertakings of Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing and Diſgracing the King's Subjects, and Laws of theſe three Nations, as ſurely they would have been made privy to, by the Lurkers and Peepers, officious and buſie Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that lurk and peep from forth their Windows, liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waiting whether they could hear any ſuch Rumors or Reports, as the contradicting and diſcrediting of the Popiſh Plot, and upon the other hand expecting likewiſe, to caſt it over upon the heads of Proteſtants, in hopes to clear themſelves, and lay the Guilt upon them; theſe I ſay, and ſuch other Reports, as would reliſh beſt their Pallates with ſuch a ſavory taſte, as to ſay that There is no Plot, It is proved there is none, The Kings and Council are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced to the contrary of the being of any Plot in agitation at all, and that it is but a ſlam; and Captain <hi>Elie; Sympſon Tonge,</hi> and <hi>John Crawley</hi> maintained it ſo to be, and therefore he that ſaith there was a Plot in agitation ſhall not be the better thought of. Alas! I ſay, this is the long wiſhed and languiſhing Deſire of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and all Members thereunto belonging; That they may hear ſuch a general and unanimous Contradiction of the Plot, and indeed Reaſon will ſhew us, not to blame them in that reſpect; for it is no marvail, that the People ſhould defend their great Intereſt, and keep it as pure and blameleſs as poſſible they can, but I muſt ſay it is not for their Care of ſo doing, if they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52961:16"/>
it in an honeſt way, we blame them. But for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil accuſtomed practiſes, for conniving and contracting Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, Murder, Rebellion upon all whoſoever that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their Tenets, Governments or Laws; and after having ſo done, by their fiery Inſtruments of devilliſh Exploits, they do abſolve them, and diſpenſe with ſuch abominable Wickedneſs, as hath been Recorded of them in ſeveral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Which would be tedious to inſtance them or ſome of them in this and ſuch like little pieces of Paper, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Matter doth require to be more ſpaciouſly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led than I can well at preſent beſtow time upon. But I ſay we can expect no leſs of any people which are ſo manifeſtly proved to be Guilty and Criminal, but that they would with all their Endeavours hide their Guilts and Crimes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their beſt Wits, how to recall the Reputation by famed Honeſty and Innocence, which we ſee daily, that they, that is to ſay, the Roman Catholicks do practiſe and uſe all means whatſoever, to get themſelves into a renewed Favour, and procure them the title of harmleſs people, but I judge that what they can do to that purpoſe cannot yield them ſuch Reputation as they have loſt, by their ſeveral, ſundry, and manifold Connivances and Contrivances, for they are by ſeveral Authors Recorded in old Ages remarkably to be a people that continually harbour an Antipathy againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, which I would let you ſee by ſeveral Inſtances, but as I have excuſed my ſelf in the foregoing lines, that I muſt wait till another Opportunity, and expecting upon ſuch Conſiderations, (which I ſhall thus reaſon unto you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) and ſhall (in the Interim) recommend you to your own reading, in ſeveral approved Authors, which I queſtion not, but you may be furniſhed with them, and if you be not you may borrow of others, who are ſo concerned to be curious in keeping (for the reviving of their Memory) ſuch Books as may confirm the Truth of what I do tax Popery to be guilty of, in many Ages, Reigns, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments; though that the Roman Catholicks do unjuſtly aſſert, that the very firſt Ofspring of Proteſtants proceeded from <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, about one hundred and fifty years ago, Whereupon, Papiſts
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52961:16"/>
may take occaſion to contradict me, in claiming an Intereſt in the knowledge of their Error in many Ages. For they are a people that are apt to purchaſe all Demurrs whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that they can light of quoted in any Writings againſt them, for I know they ſay that Proteſtants are but new up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart Apoſtates, and that they can claim no Rights in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Record, much leſs they ſay in the Apoſtolical Church-Government; and the reaſon they produce for that falſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of theirs, is this, That the Primitive Records and the Apoſtolical Church-Governments were eſtabliſhed for many hundreds of years, before the Name or Government of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants was invented or publiſhed; yet we find we believe great many ſtedfaſt and well-grounded Authors, that Proteſtants were for ſome hundreds of years before that time that they take to be firſt diſſenting of Proteſtants from the Roman Catholick Church, which I ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to maintain to the Contrary on ſome other Occaſion. And well underſtanding that you may be as acquainted with the truth of it as I am, I take it as one of the Reaſons or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, (as above mentioned) for not further ſatisfying you with preambled Inſtances at preſent.</p>
            <p>The next Reaſon I have as to that matter of my ſilence, in letting you ſee more of the Tranſactions of the Popiſh Party is this, that I intend to make uſe of Opportunity; which ſhall be with as much Expedition as I can, to give you a larger account of their Malice againſt Proteſtants. And upon theſe Conſiderations I leave you to your thoughts of theſe Matters: And ſhall only tell you that the old Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Popery and Envy, is much revived now adays, and I am afraid in this City, Suburbs, Court and Kingdom, which I could wiſh with all my heart, that the ſaid City, and Country might not feel the burthen, Smart, Strength and multiplicity of the ſaid Party. I do alſo pray to the Lord, that my King as his Subjects could been purged from their long burning Sedition, that they caſt in between him and his Subjects; I could wiſh, that his Majeſty could be rid of the daily troubles, he, his Parliament and Councel, are daily toxicated with, by reaſon of the ſaid Parties mutinous and rebellious old Satanical Diſobedience, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumaciouſly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52961:17"/>
and contumeliouſly harbour and entertain for him, and his Gracious Government. And if that he could but be ſo clearly rid of them, as I could wiſh with all my Soul he were; I am certain he and all his Subjects, would be united together and they ſo tied to him in Loyalty as that the Splendor of their peaceable Union and Loyal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, would be reported and highly Commended all over the World. But in the mean while, a man cannot ſleep well in a bed full of Fleas. But God grant that his Majeſties Dominions may be rid of all Seditions and Inſurrections, and of the Authors of them, that we may ſee our King and his Subjects united together as firm and ſtedfaſt as any King and Subjects of the whole Univerſe. The which means of their amorous Union and Injunctions we aſcribe unto the Lord who is God and King over all, for to rectifie the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our preſent State of Affairs, as ſhall be moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his own glorious ſight and uſeful to my King and Country.</p>
            <p>Now I do intend to let you underſtand, ſomething of the Event of the proceedings of theſe three Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Elie, Sympſon Tonge,</hi> and <hi>John Crawley,</hi> which is this, that after they buſſled the Kings Majeſty, and his moſt Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Privy Councel, with their compoſed, but ill grounded, and falſe Contradictions of the realty of the Popiſh Plot, and their buſtling being ſo great, as the noiſe of their barkings was ſo both abominable and terrible, as their howlings oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſome other Helhounds to follow them, becauſe as it is ſaid Birds of a Feather flock together, thinking to rouſe up a Dear to Chaſe, but inſtead of ſo doing they were forced to Chace a Fox, and the Fox being as his nature is the ſubtleſt of moſt Beaſts, after having all the day made them follow him, at laſt when it grew late, and the Road over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with Darkneſs, therewithal the ſaid Fox under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding full well his time, and his place, he whips down into his Hole, and the darkneſs ſo overwhelming, the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the Hounds ſtrayed from both their Chace and Trace, ſo they were forced to retire moſt ſhamefully home to their ſeveral houſes. This ſimile I make, and thus apply the ſame, in compariſon of theſe three Hunters that thought to deceive
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52961:17"/>
ſeveral and eſpecially the tranſitory Pleaſures of this World which by ſome Critick Authors is compared to a Fox, which no man ever deceived, neither the Fox nor the World. For in the firſt place, though the Fox be taken by the force of many Hounds, yet it is very well known that he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of any man; and ſo the World, Though men for ſome ſeaſon Encompaſs, Enjoy, and take Pleaſure in it, yet it is viſibly ſeen, that it deceives more than deceive it, as I may refer my ſelf to the Experience of theſe three Gentle-huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of whoſe proceedings I gave you ſome account how they went about to chaſe themſelves out of their way, ſo that it was very difficult for them to find out the way again. Which I queſtion if ever they find it any more. And to hunt this Subject (called the World) which moſt people call their maineſt and greateſt Concerns, to covenant with it, and alſo to forfeit for a tranſitory being, a perpetual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is to be thought a great madneſs in them ſo to do, for when they aſſure themſelves of the conſtant continuance of it, they are then moſt like to be farther from it, as you may obſerve in ſeveral paſſages of this very time, to the woful experience of theſe three Gentlemen, who travelled hard for it, for I am afraid that they run a dangerous hazard in hopes to gain it, and ſo to purchaſe themſelves ſuch means in it, as to make themſelves merry with the Pleaſures and Comfort of it. But alas! they were ſadly miſtaken with its ſubtile promiſes, it gave them the ſlip at the laſt. This I ſay is the Event and Ofspring of all ſuch that covenant with the World, it goes into its own hold, after they chace it aslong as ever they can for their lives, and they are never the wiſer of all their ſpent labour about it. You may ask <hi>Sympſon Tonge</hi> if I ſpeak truth or not, who hath bought the Experience that I give you of the ſame Relation very dear, which I am certain if he were to buy it again at ſuch a Price or Rate as it is like to coſt him, I am confident he would Conſider be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would be at half the trouble or pains that he was at. He ſpent his Labour, his Reputation and Credit, and forfeited the comfortable and natural Affection of his Father, in hopes to exalt himſelf to a greater Fortune, which you may ſee how ſhort he came of what he aimed at. And I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52961:18"/>
ſuppoſe you will let me tell you, or at leaſt give me leave to ſpeak what I think of the matter, he would be throughly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and contented, not to have purchaſed to himſelf ſuch Diſcords and Diſcontentments, as he made himſelf partaker of and alſo ſubject to go through, of whoſe proceedings I have told you already. Yeſterday being examined before King and Council, and he having nothing to ſay for himſelf, but ſtanding as a block, without much either Grace or Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to anſwer what was imputed to his Charge, neither was he able to anſwer ſome particular Queſtions as were propounded to him by the King, whereupon at the Requeſt of the Lords, the King was pleaſed to Order Mr. Attorney General, to proſecute the Law againſt him, and Captain <hi>Elie,</hi> for whoſe proceedings I have no further to ſhew you; but I deſire that the Lord may endue me and others with more Grace than to employ my time upon ſo uncertain a Foundation, and upon a clearer Conſcience, than this Youth hath lived. This I ſay is all that I determine at preſent, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommending us all to the Tuition and Protection of the Divine Deity, as alſo the Government of our King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and next or laſtly, I Recommend all our Concerns un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gracious keeping of God, and ſo <hi>Farewel.</hi>
