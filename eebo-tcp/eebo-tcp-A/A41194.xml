         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Can give you no better proof of the Authority you have over me, than that I am ready to obey you in replying to your <hi>Questions</hi>; though I foresee that I shall thereby not only hazard my Safety, but be Judged by many to depart from the common Measures of Discretion: Seeing as I shall be sure to provoke the Gentleman whom we have had the Folly, as well as Disloyalty, to set over us, and to furnish with Legions; and also to exasperate his Partisans, who being his Copartners in guilt, are likewise Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with him in the common Robbery: So I can hardly Escape displeasing others, by endeavouring both to undeceive them in Matters wherein they have been misled, and to give them a View
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103637:2"/>
and Sense of their Slavery, while they continue fond of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, and proud of their Fetters and Chains. So that under all the Prospect which I am, both of Censure and of personal Danger, by this Undertaking, I have but very little hope of awaking and prevailing upon a Cheated, Impoverished, and Enslaved Kingdom, to recover its Wits, reassume its Loyalty, and to vindicate its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Rights. For who can make them see that wilfully shut their Eyes, and who take pleasure in being hood-winked, that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be led about blind? Or who can rouse those to value and look after Freedom, that place their Contentment in having their Ears bored and nailed to <hi>Kensington</hi> Gates? It is the greatest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy of this Age, though it hath been fertile of Wonders enough, That they who boasted of <hi>taking Lions</hi> by the <hi>Beard,</hi> can submit to be <hi>gnawn</hi> by <hi>Mice</hi> and <hi>Rats.</hi> And that they who could refuse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to <hi>Princes</hi> whom God had set over them, cloathed with his own Stile, and with his Divine Sanction upon their Authority, can dwindle into the Meaness, as well as degenerate into the Irreligion, of ado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Yet how little probability is there of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nation either to reverence themselves, or him whom they ought? When not only those of St. <hi>Stephen's Chapel,</hi> who should be the Conservators of our Property, Freedom and Rights, do value themselves upon being the Instruments of the Subjects-Bondage, and the Tools of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Tyranny: But when the Men in <hi>Gowns</hi> of both <hi>Professions</hi> do, the <hi>one</hi> make the <hi>Law</hi> of which they are appointed <hi>Guardians,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> whereof they were intended <hi>Dispensers,</hi> means of authorising his Arbitrariness and our Oppression, and of sanctifying the usurped and illegally exerted Power of him whom they have Consecrated to Rule, and of Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Servitude and Poverty of the People, over whom they have advanced him: But as I have learned to govern my self, by the Discoveries of Revelation and the Dictates of natural Light, and by the Rules of the Civil Constitution and Society under which and where I was born, and do live, and not by other Mens Opinion, or by little and mean Regards to my own Profit and Fame; so the only as well as the main Thing, which I am solicitous about, is, That I may discharge my Duty to God, my King, and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without looking unto, and much less without being uneasy and anxious conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

thankful unto God, and joyful in my self, to see my Country-men perswaded and gained to relieve themselves, and to save the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and their Posterity, by returning to their Fealty, and by claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and asserting the old <hi>English</hi> Constitution in all its Parts and Branches, and to all the Useful, Honourable, and Legitimate Ends and Purposes of it; yet should I have the Misfortune to see my self disappointed, and to find all my Loyal, Charitable, and Well meant Endeavours frustrated, through the Stupidness of some, and the Bigottry of others, as well as because too many of all Ranks are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partners with the Usurper in the Spoil and Plunder of the Nation, and in that several have their own Ambitions satisfied by him, whose haughty, boundless, and unnatural Aspirings they have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with a Scepter and a Crown, though at the Expence of their own Loyalty, Honour, Conscience, and Religion; yet I shall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be discouraged, dejected, nor murmur, much less be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from my Duty, but shall take up with the Peace, Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Pleasure, which the being conscious to my own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity will give me, of having done what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> became an honest Man, and a good Subject.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, though your two <hi>Queries</hi> came together, and be each of them of that Weight and Importance as to require a serious, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and well-digested Answer; yet you must not expect that I should reply to them both at once; seeing that would not only too much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fatigue me to give, and no leass Weary you to peruse, but would Discourage those who do most need the Instruction and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Papers of this kind, from Consulting them to receive it, by reason th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Bulkiness which such a Discourse must unavoidably grow up unto, would challenge more of their time, than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with their worldly Occasions, and the satisfying their Lusts, will allow them to spare. However, having in a manner prepared Answers to them both before I send you this to the <hi>first,</hi> you may reckon that the other will be dispatched speedily after it; and that what conerns the <hi>second</hi> will be ready to overtake this, and to be laid before you, by that time you have sufficiently entertained your self with what is now put into your hands.</p>
            <p>That I may immediately therefore address my self to the answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your <hi>first Question,</hi> namely, <hi>Whether the Preserving the Protestant Religion was the Inducement to the Prince of</hi> Orange<hi>'s Coming hither, and the End that was aimed at in the dethroning of the King, and driving
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103637:3"/>
him out of his Kingdoms?</hi> I must needs say, That the Prince's Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness and Zeal for the Protestant Religion, and his compassionate Care to secure it to us and our Posterity, when it was in imminent and immediate Danger of being extirpated, and which there was no other visible human Means to prevent, was then, and continues still to be made, the pretence of his invading these Dominions, and of all that afterwards followed, till upon this Specious and Godly <hi>Plea</hi> he had obtained to be seated upon the Throne, as well as of all that has succeeded and ensued since, both in the Beginning and in the Supporting of this destructive and impoverishing War; by which no benefit was ever intended to accrue to us, but which was entered upon, and hath been hitherto carried on, that others might be rendered Safe and Wealthy, at the Expence of our Blood and Treasure. However Religion hath been all along alledged as the Motive, and made the Argument to Justify whatsoever hath been done, and to extenuate and sweeten all that we have Lost and Suffered. This is the principal <hi>Plea</hi> which he bears himself upon for his own Vindication; and by which all those seek to warrant themselves, who either Invited or Attended him hither, or who at first Received and Joyned him at his Landing, and on his March to <hi>London,</hi> or that came in afterwards to Cooperate unto, Concur with, and Approve of what hath been done. This is that by which your <hi>Judges</hi> do decoy on the People tamely to pay their Taxes, and trapan and wheedle them to persevere in their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in their Harangues at <hi>Assizes,</hi> instead of entertaining them with those <hi>obsolete</hi> Things relative to Law, Righteousness and Equity, with which their Predecessors used at those times to furnish and adorn the Charges which they gave. Witness <hi>Treby</hi>'s Oration at <hi>Kingston</hi> the last Circuit, which wholy consisted of Romantick Praises of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for having so Christianly and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roically Stept in to save our Religion, when at the brink of being lost; and of Satyr and Invective against King <hi>James,</hi> for having designed to overthrow it; whereof, among other Things, he had the Impudence and Insolency to accuse him, without regard either to Truth or Decency. This is likewise that by which your merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and sycophant <hi>Divines,</hi> who have translated their <hi>Pulpets</hi> into <hi>Stages,</hi> and transformed themselves into <hi>Merry Andrews</hi> and <hi>Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons,</hi> would Legitimate the Rebellion, and, instead of a Sin, bind it as a Duty upon our Consciences; and cantingly blow us into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

under Slavery and Poverty. Witness instead of edifying Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to confirm our Faith in the great Articles of Religion, and to promote our Christian Obedience, the many luscious and fulsom <hi>Panegyricks</hi> which have been Preached and Printed within these Six last Years, and which are at that distance from Decorum as well as from Truth, that they would be the Scorn of the <hi>Theatre,</hi> and hissed at by the <hi>Pit.</hi> This they reckon so bright a Colour in their Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Drawing the Usurpers, that the <hi>dull Man</hi> selected to divert the Company at the Interment of the late <hi>Princess of Orange,</hi> and who could dispence with his Conscience in saying several Things of her above the Standard and Proportion of Truth, but had not Wit, nor elevation of Thought, to say any Thing that was Raptorous, Decorous and Fine, could not omit the making it one of the main <hi>Strokes</hi> in her <hi>Picture,</hi> and that which was to give the lovely and lively Air, and the ornamental Beauty to the whole; namely, <hi>That she was a wise and a good Queen, and an incomparable Wise, and one that had all the Duty in the World for other Relations, which after long and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Consideration she judged consistent with her Obligations to God and her Country.</hi> Which is as much as if Dr. <hi>Tenison</hi> had said, That if it had not been for the preserving the Protestant Religion, and the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> which were in danger to have been subverted, she would have been an <hi>obedient Daughter</hi> to the King; and would not have usurped his Throne, and drove him and the vertuous Queen, with the Royal and Innocent Infant her Brother, out of their Dominions, to be as Vagabonds in the World; had it not been for the Generosity of a Neighbouring Monarch, who has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, Entertained, and Succoured them in their Calamity, with a Deference, Respect, and Nobleness, becoming his own Greatness, and which hath carried in it a Recognition of their Grandeur and Sovereign Quality. So that I do grant unto you, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving our Religion hath been the great Pretence for all the Injuries have been done his Majesty, and the alledged Motives to all the disloyal, illegal, and immoral Things which have been perpetrated to compass and effect the late Revolution: And I add, That it is still made the <hi>Topick</hi> and <hi>Plea</hi> whereby to justify all the Villanies, Crimes and Barbarities, which have been practised since; and not only that whereby to palliate all our Losses and Misfortunes, but to be accounted for more than an equivalent of all the Distresses, Miseries and Mischiefs, which have ensued as the Effects and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:103637:4"/>But should it be admitted that this was not only a <hi>pretended</hi> but a <hi>real Motive</hi> to the Revolution, and to all that hath resulted from, and attended it; yet it hath not been hitherto made appear, that according to the Rules of Christianity, the Fundamentals of our Government, and the Statutes of the Realm, it is likewise a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>Justifiable</hi> one; and all that have written either of <hi>Ethicks</hi> or <hi>Politicks</hi> do tell us, and the Principles of Reason, as well as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries vouchsafed us by Revelation, do set it in the brightest Light, That neither the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the <hi>Inducement,</hi> nor the <hi>Piety</hi> of the <hi>End,</hi> will serve to legitimate an Action, unless there be both a proper Authority to License it, and a Goodness either Positive or Natural in what is to be done, when cloathed with all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. Otherwise Men might Lawfully rob Temples, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Banks and Exchequers, upon the Motive and Design of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging their Debts, and of paying their Creditors what they owe them: Nay they may vertuously murther their Parents, deflower Maids, and ravish their Sisters, upon the Inducement and in order to the End of getting into possession of Estates, which they may lavish away upon the Saviour of our Religion and Liberties, and towards the maintaining the Sacred War in which he is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued, and for raising up a new Generation of Soldiers to defend the <hi>Dutch Barier</hi> against <hi>France.</hi> Nor are there any Villanies na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or practised on the Earth, which these late and now common <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But neither our Statesmen, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, nor Divines, have thought sit to meddle with this, and much less to take upon them to demonstrate that by the Laws of God, and by those of the Kingdom, we are allowed to dethrone Princes, drive Kings from their Palaces into Exile, and to involve Nations into blood, if our established Religion be in danger of being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted and overthrown. Though without a clear and uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Proof of this, all they have said, or can say, about his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Designs in prejudice of our Religion, were there as much Truth in it as there is Rancour and Falshood, makes not what we have done to be Lawful; but only proclaims them to to be Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in Logick, Hypocrites in Religion, Debauchers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of Men, Panders to Villany, and the Flatterers of Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in their Rebellious Wickedness, who have had the Irreligion and Impudence to plead it. For though I can readily grant that most of the Scripture Expressions and Precepts concerning the Duty

and Obedience of Subjects to their Rulers, do no further concern us, than as they were either delivered and prescribed unto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And therefore and thence it is, That the same Texts of Scripture do bind and oblige some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to yield a more universal, unlimitted, and unreserved Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Rulers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> they can be construed and applied to require those of other Countries to perform. For those Places of the Holy Bible are designed to influence and operate upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in proportion to the different degrees of Prerogative and Sovereignty vested in Princes, and according to the respective measures of Liberty preserved unto Subjects, by the Rules and Laws of their several and various Constitutions. The Scripture was not given and designed to teach us Politicks, or to prescribe the Forms of Government, and the several Limitations of them, farther than that all Governments were to be for God, and the good of Mankind, and of Societies. But all Relative to Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Scripture, is to require and oblige Subjects, under the Penalty of eternal Wrath, to yield Obedience in proportion to the respective <hi>Terms</hi> upon which the Government is founded under which they live; and according to the several Laws by which it is to be upheld and exerted. And the same Divine and Revealed Commands which oblige us in <hi>England</hi> to submit to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and be obedient to the King, according to the Municipal and Statute Laws of the Kingdom, bind them at <hi>Venice</hi> to acquiesce in <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> and be in subjection to that Authority and Power, and to pay obedience to all the Laws of the Republick; if they be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with, and contradictory to the Laws of God. No Man will say, That the same Things were Lawful for the <hi>Persians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians</hi> to do against their Kings, which the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Protection and Authority of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> might have done against theirs; or which those of <hi>Arragon</hi> were heretofore empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to do at the Command, and under the Jurisdiction, of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Person chosen and appointed to be the <hi>Custos</hi> and <hi>Guardian</hi> of their Rights and Privileges, and who had Power by the Law and Constitution to controul and resist their Kings, in case of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103637:5"/>
and going about to overthrow them. Whereupon it is no Sin in the King of <hi>France</hi> to take upon him and assume the whole Legislation, without the assent and concurrence of the Three Estates; whereas it would be otherwise in a King of <hi>England,</hi> whilst he stands limitted, as he doth, by the Laws of the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Government, and restrained by his Coronation Oath. The <hi>French</hi> Monarch is guilty of no Offence in exacting Taxes of his Subjects, without a previous Gift and Grant of them by their Representatives: But I cannot say, that according to the present Form of our Government, the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> would be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, in the Sight and Esteem of the Supreme Sovereign, should he Levy Mony of his People without their own antecedent Consent in Parliament. So that I will affirm with the utmost Confidence, as knowing I do it upon the greatest Certainty, That every Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Intimation in the Bible, relative to the Subjection and Fealty we should pay to Sovereign Rulers, are intended to bind and oblige us in Conscience, and out of Fear of Divine Wrath, to be obedient to them <hi>actively,</hi> as far as is enacted and required by the Laws of our Country, if those Laws do command nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with and repugnant to the Laws of God; and to be <hi>passive</hi> in all Cases, save in those in which the Rules of the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and the Statutes of the Realms where we live give us Liberty, Right and Authority, to withstand and oppose them. And I will presume to add, with the fullest Assurance that Law and Reason can give me, That in no Circumstances of Danger into which our Religion and Civil Liberties could be brought, nor under any Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards we could fall into of losing and having them supprest, were we either permitted or empowered by the Fundamentals of our Government, the Rules of our Constitution, or by the Common or Statute Law of the Kingdom, to rebel against the King, or to dethrone or drive him away. Nor did the having the Protestant Religion established and secured unto us by Law; nor its being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated among our Franchises, and made a part of our Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to possess it peaceably, and practise it openly, authorize us to take Arms against the King, divest him of his Sovereignty, and banish him from his Dominions, though we had been furnished with the most clear and indisputable Evidence, that he was fully resolved to extirpate it. For though the Laws give us a Title to it as our Heritage, and a Right to claim the Exercise of it as our chiefest Blessing, and most valuable Privilege; yet no Law or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103637:5"/>
Contract, existent in the King's time, had provided that we might fly to Arms to prevent its being supprest, or for the securing the Continuance of it to us and our Posterity. Yea, instead of that, there were divers express Statutes then in being, by which it was made and declared to be <hi>Treason to take up Arms against him upon any Pretence whatsoever.</hi> So that had the preserving the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion been the real <hi>Motive</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of our raising War, and of dethroning the King, yet it was not a Lawful nor a Justifiable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement and Design for doing it: Nor can it be thought so by any who seriously consider, and look upon the Laws of the Land as the Standard and Measure of the Peoples Subjection and Obedience; and that whatsoever the Municipal and Statute Laws of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try restrain us from, or confine us unto, provided it interfere not with that which either the Laws of Nature or those of Revelation do indispensably require and exact, that thereunto we stand bound, limitted, and obliged by the Laws of God, and the Doctrines both of the Old and New Testaments; and this upon no less penalty than Damnation. Which let no Man upon the Testimony of a Flattering or Mercenary Priest, or the Authority and Verdict of a Prophane and Atheistical Statesman, think he will or can escape, without unfeigned Repentance evidenced in sincere and hearty Endeavours to restore the King. Nor are you to be surprised to hear this kind of Theology and Politicks from me, seing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Phrase, as no Man is forbid to grow wiser than he was, so I blush not, but glory to confess, and have deeply bewailed it, That I have been heretofore misled by false Notions, and have entertained <hi>Hypotheses</hi> about Government neither recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable to our Laws, nor to the Peace of Communities, but <hi>errando discimus non errare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the preserving the Protestant Religion could be no Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Justifiable Motive to the late Revolution, so <hi>there were no just and sufficient Grounds administered by the King, why any should have pretended that it was in danger of being Supplanted, and much less in any Jeopardy of being overthrown.</hi> And every wise Man was then, and is now much more sensible, That all those noisy and clamorous Suggestions, which were so industriously spread abroad, of Designs laid and carried on for the Extirpation of our Religion, were fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Knaves to impose upon Fools: And which were promoted and given out to blacken the King, and to mislead a credulous and unthinking People. The great End of it being to impose upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103637:6"/>
the Understandings, infect and pervert the Consciences of the Subjects, thereby to undermine the Throne, and shake the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by Slanders and Reproaches thrown upon his Majesty. For he was so far from entertaining a Thought of this nature and tendency, that he offered his Protestant Subjects all the legal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity they could desire, besides what they actually had by the then established and existent Laws, for the Preservation of their Religion, and for the Maintenance of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its lawful Jurisdiction and Authority. Nay at such a distance was he in his Intentions from any ill Design against our Religion, that he was willing even to the Diminution of his own Royalty and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur both to have granted a <hi>Stipulatory</hi> Law, which should have had the Force and Vertue of a <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or <hi>Constitutional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> and to have made it a Fundamental in the Government in all other Reigns. And to give farther Evidence of his alienation from, and abhorrency of that, with which he hath been so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and malitiously charged, he was ready to have gratified the peevish Humours, as well as to have extinguished and removed the vain Fears and needless Jealousies of his Subjects, by consenting to a Thing not very reconcilable to true Politicks, but directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with any Design he was capable of harbouring to the prejudice of our Religion; namely, That the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princess of Orange</hi> should have been named and admitted <hi>Guarantees</hi> of what should have been agreed and enacted for the Preservation of our Religion, on the Bottom and with the Provision only of Liberty of Conscience for Dissenters. And as there was not the least just Ground of suspecting his Majesty guilty of any secret Intentions of subverting our Religion; his open, avowed, and candid Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as well as his Publick and Royal Declarations, lying in direct Opposition to such a concealed Machination; so had it been pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for him to have so far departed from Kingly Wisdom and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and from true <hi>English</hi> Politicks, and to have renounced the Veracity, Compassion and Generosity, which are so natural unto and inseparable from him, as to have inwardly entertained, and latently persued, a Purpose and Project of that kind; yet it was so impracticable, and physically as well as morally impossible to be executed, that instead of serving to awaken Fears in any discreet and sensible Men, it could at most but have administered matter for Entertainment and Diversion; and provoked us to laugh at the Weakness and ridiculous Bigottry of those that had Suggested
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103637:6"/>
such Councels unto him. For surely we will not so scandalously reproach the Protestant Religion, nor so ignominiously detract from the Integrity, Zeal, Industry, and Learning of our Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties National Clergy, and of many of our Layick Protestants, as to imagine, and much less to grant, that those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion were able to have disputed our Religion out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or to have baffled us out of our Belief, and have withdrawn us from the Faith and Worship which we profess and practise, by Arguments from Scripture, Reason, or Tradition. And indeed had they been Qualified for, and in a Condition to have done it that way, I do know no Cause, unless we will disclaim both the being Men and the being Christians, why we should have taken it ill to be conquered at those Weapons, or been angry with them that should gain a Victory over us by such honourable and divine Means. But this they were so ill prepared and uncapable to effect, That all their Essays and Efforts of that kind, against our Religion, served only to render it the more triumphant, and to confirm us the better in it. And it had been the best Policy, which the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fellowship could have used, and I dare say will be thought so, if ever they should be furnished with such another Opportunity, to have confined themselves to the Service of their Altars, and to the discharge of the Devotional Functions of their respective Orders, and the performing the Ministrations incumbent upon them towards those within the <hi>Pale</hi> of their Church; or at most to have employed themselves about the Subjects of common Christianity, and of good Morals, and not to have disturbed us in the possession of our Religion, by <hi>Polemical</hi> Writings, Controversal Tracts, and by Oral Disputes. For those Methods were so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently subservient to the Truth and Glory of our Religion, and to the Reputation and Credit of our Divines, and of other learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of our Communion, that if they be wise they will never ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to tread any more in those Paths, unless they have a mind to embark in a Plot against themselves, and to lose that Esteem which we are willing to preserve for them, notwithstanding all our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in Religious Matters. For under all their Mistakes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some are of the highest Importance, yet we ought to own and respect them as Christians, and to pay them the deference that is due unto them, not only upon the score of the Condition and Quality of many of them, but upon the account both of their moral Accomplishments and of their natural and acquired Parts, in which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103637:7"/>
great Numbers among them are remarkably Eminent. And as there was not the least shadow of Probability, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks could have disputed us out of our Religion; so it is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> an Affront to the common reason of Manking, to believe that they could have <hi>overthrown it by Force and Violence.</hi> For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that many have had the Malice to say this, and some the Weakness to entertain it; yet, besides the Impracticableness of the Thing, the King had both the Wisdom and Goodness not only to disclaim it by Words, but to disprove it by <hi>signal Matters of Fact.</hi> And unless worldly Interest, Ambition, Passion, and Wrath, had so darkened and distorted our Understandings, as either to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish or pervert the use of our discursive Faculties, we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have allowed our selves to think, that the King would attempt to do that in a way of <hi>Force,</hi> which there were a hundred to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and oppose for every single Individual that can be supposed inclinable to have joyned in the Execution of it. Surely a very little Knowledge of the World, and a mean Acquaintance with History, would help to instruct some unthinking and half witted People, how difficult if not impracticable this has been found in other Nations where it hath been attempted. Nor have any that have set about it found it easy to be effected, even where they have had all the Advantage imaginable to execute it. And we may be speedily convinced, how unfeasable such a Design would have been in <hi>England,</hi> and consequently how far from being either undertaken or thought of by a wise Prince: If we consider the Difficulties which have attended it in <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Kingdoms, where all the Craft and Power of wise and mighty Princes, and all the Strength and Rage of the Body of the People inflamed by Bigottry have been united to compass it. Is it possible for the King's most malignant Enemies, who use to speak of him with the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralelled Undecency and brutal Rudeness, to conceive or believe that he could be so prodigiously Indiscreet and Weak, as to think of banishing or overthrowing the Protestant Religion, or of bringing in or setting up the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, by a Protestant and Antipapal Army? And other he had not, nor ever can be in a Condition to have in this Kingdom, if we speak of the Bulk of one, or of one that can be Numerous and Strong. And for a few <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks mingled here and there in Protestant Troops, or for two or three Regiments whereof the Generality were of the <hi>Romish</hi> Communion in an Army of those of the Reformed Profession, instead of their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103637:7"/>
giving us just terrour of a Design for subverting our Religion they only served to animate and provoke those vastly larger Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Protestant Officers and Soldiers, to assert their Religion with the more Courage and Avowedness, and to exemplify and adorn it better by their Lives. And it is but for those who were in <hi>England</hi> in 1687. and 1688. to recollect themselves and consult their Memories, and they must needs confess and declare, if they have not renounced all Friendship with Truth when they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Loyalty to his Majesty, That they never observed that Zeal in a <hi>Brittish</hi> Army for the Protestant Religion, nor that open Boldness in pleading for it, as when that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Prince was upon the Throne, and some of that Communion enrolled among them, and employed with them under the same Royal Standard. But what clearer and fuller Evidence could the King give in Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> that he had no Intentions to undermine and much less to subvert our Religion, than <hi>the Dispensation from Penal Laws, which he granted unto Protestant Dissenters, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which he stated them in the Exercise of.</hi> And through his giving it upon the only true Principle on which it could be done Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiably, namely, That it is the natural Right of every Man to chuse in what Religion, and in which way of Faith and Worship, he will venture his eternal State; he could not in Justice (abstracting from his Friendship) avoid granting Liberty likewise to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. I do know there are some People whose Malice to the King makes them not only take every Thing by the wrong <hi>handle,</hi> but which hath so perverted their Reasons, as to cause them to draw Conclusions directly contradictory to the Premisses from which they infer them; who endeavour to obtrude upon the Belief of such as are Weak and Credulous, That the King's giving Liberty was an Effect of his Enmity to our Religion, and done in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of a Design to destroy it. But the two <hi>Poles</hi> are not at greater distance from one another, than they are from Truth and good Sense; who think the King would have given Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and have set his heart upon the upholding and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, if at the same time he had given place unto, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the least thought of overthrowing and extirpating the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion. For that Wise, Generous, and Royal Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his, was so far from lying in the remotest Subserviency to such a Design, that nothing under Heaven can be imagined more effectually contributory to the preventing, resisting, and defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103637:8"/>
an Attempt of that kind. There are few but know what Connivance had been exercised to <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, and how Gently they had been treated, notwithstanding the many Laws they were obnoxious to, during the last Years of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Reign; while in the mean time vast Numbers of Protestants were harrassed, spoiled and imprisoned, and this not only by hounding out, but by enforcing those of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to fall upon the Dissenters, and to execute the Laws against them with great Severity. Now by the King's Noble, Christian, and Heroick Act, of granting Liberty, the Peevishness and Enmity of Protestants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one another was allayed and extinguished; and they were at ease as well as leasure to employ their common Care, and unite their mutual Strength, against those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, whom they esteemed Enemies to them both. And by being taken off from scratching, biting, and devouring one another, they began to mingle Councels, and to joyn their several Interests, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating and obstructing the Growth of a third Party that stands in terms of distance both in Opinion and Ecclesiastical Charity to the one as well as the other. For though the Liberty granted by the King to Protestant Dissenters did not incorporate them into the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but supposed the contrary, and provided against the afflictive Inconveniencies of it; and though it did not entitle them unto, and make them capable of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Emoluments of the Church, which his Majesty neither pretended nor challenged a Power to do; yet through his suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Execution of the penal Laws, which he was told he might do in virtue of that executive Power of Laws and of Administration of Government which was lodged in him by the Constitution, and inseparable from his Title, Right, and Sovereignty, there was not only a Cessation of Arms between those of the National Church and them, but a Coalescence in Friendship and Zeal for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Religion, though they cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

from being an Argument of his innocent and honourable Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards our Religion, into a <hi>Topick</hi> whereby to insinuate into the Belief of those of a narrow Compass of thought, that it was only in order first to supplant our Religion, and then to destroy it. And it argueth an Ingratitude, which our Language is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of Words to express the hainousness of, that any Protestant Dissenters should not only concur in such a Sentiment, but value themselves upon the Vivacity, Strength, and Penetration of their Judgment, that they could foresee and discover this to be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and End of it. But this may be catalogued among other of the thankful Returns which some of them have rendered the Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate and Good King, for his snatching them as Firebrands out of the burning, where he both found them, and might have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to have continued, till they had been consumed: And for gathering such Vipers (as those I am speaking about) off from the Dunghill, where the Laws had laid them, and placing them in his Bosom till they had recovered Life, Warmth, and Vigour, to sting him by those Censures and Reproaches which are as false as they are black and villanous. And I would ask those Persons, If the King cast out and drove away the Devil Persecution by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi> or in virtue of so hellish a Conspiracy against our Religion, by whom have the Gentleman at <hi>Kensington,</hi> and his Tools and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operators at <hi>Westminster,</hi> done the same? Is Liberty to Dissenters not only an innocent and harmless Thing, but eminently useful to the Strength, Glory, and Success of our Religion, under one that finds it his present Interest to call himself a Protestant, while in the mean time it is questionable what Religion he is of, if he be of any at all; and must the same Liberty, and to the same People, be a Plot upon and an Engine for the undermining and blowing it up, and for burying all those that profess it under the Ruins of it, when granted by a Catholick Monarch? Surely it would not unbecome some, nor be unworthy of their second Thoughts, to consider, That if the Prince, whom they have Abdicated for this and other good Offices, had not expressed the Bowels, and exerted the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to break the Chains, and to remove the heavy and insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Loads, which many peaceable and innocent People had long worn and groaned under, meerly for their Opinions and Practices in matters of pure Revelation, how probable it is, if not morally certain, that they would have been still in their old Circumstances
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103637:9"/>
and Conditions of Calamity and Suffering. Nor would either the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had the Inclination and Fortitude to relieve them; nor those Assemblies since the Revolution which we call Parliaments have had the Compassion and good Nature to have consented and concurred to the easing of them. For as the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of those stiled the Representatives of the Nation, retain still their antient peevishness and rancour to Dissenters; so he whom they have placed on the Royal Throne governs himself by no other Principle or Measures, but those of Ambition and Interest; nor would he for saving and obliging the Dissenters have ventured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Thing that might be disagreable to the Humour of the <hi>Two Houses,</hi> or which might have cooled or abated the Inclinations of the Commons to be lavish in their Grants of Money. Neither would those Sons of <hi>Sceva</hi> have taken upon them to dispossess the Kingdom of the devouring Spirit of Persecution, if they had not been sensible of the Glory which redounded to the King by the Example he had set them. Nor was it upon Motives of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Justice that Liberty to Protestant Dissenters came to be established by a Law, otherwise that Freedom would upon those very Inducements have been extended to others by the same Act: But it was from Fear that the retrenching that which through the Mercy of the King they had gotten into possession of, might have lost them the Affections, Service, and Assistance of the whole Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Party; and have made those People turn <hi>Jacobites</hi> upon the Foot of Interest, that have not Conscience, nor Principles of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Loyalty to be so.</p>
            <p>But besides this proof arising from <hi>Fact,</hi> by the King's suspending penal Laws in Matters of Religion, and his granting Liberty to Protestant Dissenters, which puts it in a Meridian Light, that he could not cherish any Thoughts or Intentions of overthrowing our Religion; he was pleased to exert his Goodness in a <hi>second Matter of Fact,</hi> and in a surprising Act of Grace, which carried convincing demonstrative Evidence along with it, that he harboured no such Design in prejudice of the Reformed Doctrine and Worship, as have been calumniously fastened upon him: The Generous, Princely, and Merciful Act which I mean, was <hi>his Receiving, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining, and Relieving the</hi> French <hi>Refugees</hi>; which as he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no legal Obligations of doing, so there were Discouragements enough lay before him to have hindered and prevented it. I know
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103637:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sir, that you cannot have forgotten with what Readiness he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them into his Kingdom; what welcome and compassionate Entertainment he gave them; and how he not only invited and required his Subjects to harbour and relieve them, but to what Measure and Degree he exercised and extended his own Royal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and Charity towards them. Nor was he satisfied with the bare taking them under the wing of his Protection, and making them Sharers in his own and his Peoples Bounty, but he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained divers of them into his Service, and admitted some of them into his Friendship and Confidence. So that whosoever will allow himself leave and time calmly to consider, either the King's own Religion in which he was both Sincere and Zealous, or the Terms of Amity he stood in with the King of <hi>France,</hi> which he had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reason nor Inclination to depart from, will not be able to avoid acknowledging (unless he can reconcile Contradictions) that his Majesty could have no other Inducement for the doing of it, but that he judged it an evil Thing, as well as an unwise, for any Prince to persecute and drive away his Subjects meerly for their differing in Religious Matters from what was legally Established, and Embraced, and Professed, by the Bulk and Generality of the People; and that he esteemed it a Duty which he owed to God, and to Mankind, to entertain and succour such as suffered for their Consciences in Things purely Divine. For as the King could not be insensible that it was not very Grateful to a great Number of his Protestant Subjects, to see so many indigent and necessitous Foreigners received into the Nation; who would not only by their Skill and Industry gain away much of the Manufacture, Traffick, and Employ from them; but who by their frugal and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Living would be able, and therefore sure, both to underwork and undersell them: So it could not escape his Majesty's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Belief that it would not be very pleasing and acceptable to the <hi>French</hi> King, to see those who carried their Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>entments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him along with them whithe soever they went, and who will be always meditating and cherishing Revenge, to be so tenderly Pitied, compassionately Received, and safely Covered and Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by a Prince that was not only his <hi>Allie,</hi> but a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick. Yet under that view, and with a cognizance of all this, did the merciful King admit, entertain, and treat them, with the same Royal Goodness and Generosity, as if they had been People of the <hi>Romish</hi> Communion drove out of some Protestant Country for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103637:10"/>
their Consciences, and Exiles here for the Religion which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self professed. Now can any that live not in an avowed enmity to Truth and good Sense, either be perswaded themselves, or hope to impose upon the Faith of others, That a Prince who had designed to root the Protestant Religion out of his Kingdoms, would do a Thing so inconsistent with and obstructive of it, as this was? And yet there are some, whose Malice against the King hath so distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Understandings, as that they will not only undertake to reconcile his forementioned Behaviour to the <hi>French Refugees,</hi> with the Conspiracy he was embarked in for extirpating our Religion, but will make use of his Kindness unto them as a <hi>Topick</hi> of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation whence and whereby to prove and confirm it. But we must beg those Men's Pardon, if we cannot hinder their insolent Flippency; yet to claim the Liberty of exposing and controuling their foolish and ridiculous, as well as false and slanderous Dictates. For can any thing lie in a directer Opposition to a Purpose of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting our Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than for a Prince who harbours such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to do all that lies within the Circle of his Wisdom and his Power to encrease and multiply the Numbers, whose Principles will oblige them to the use of all Lawful ways and means at least, if they use not worse, to oppose it; and whose Interest and Safety consists in hindering it. Surely the great Body of native Protestants were enough, if not by far too many, either to have been wormed out of our Religion by Fraud, or to have it wrested from us by Force, that there was no necessity for encreasing the Honour of the Conquest, or raising the Glory of the Triumph, to have added to our Number and Strength, by the Reception and Entertainment that was given to <hi>Foreign Protestants.</hi> Nor is it credible that if his Majesty had been embarked in such a Design as he hath been slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with, that he would have given Encouragement to those <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> which fled hither from <hi>France,</hi> to have planted and settled in all parts of his Dominions where they pleased, when he could not but know and believe, that their very Presence among us, and our daily Sight of them, would awaken our Jealousies of what some <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick might think Lawful to be done in prejudice of our Religion; and who would daily tell us what had been practised for the Extirpating it elsewhere. But the good King being conscious to himself that he had no sinister Intentions to the Legally esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Doctrine and Worship, he envied us no means that might quicken and provoke our Care for the Preservation of them. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103637:10"/>
though he regretted, and was infinitely sorry, that there was cause any where administred of publishing how poor People, professing the Reformed Religion, had not only been decoyed into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion by the little and mean Arts of <hi>Missioners</hi>; and and bribed and bought to be Converts to the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith, by those that managed a publick <hi>Treasure</hi> to that end, but had been dragooned into the Church by armed <hi>Troops</hi>; yet he was willing we should have such resident in our several Neighbourhoods, who might relate and confirm those Things unto us; and he hoped that by his receiving and countenancing such Persons in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as would daily entertain us with Accounts of this Nature, which we could not hear without Scandal and Indignation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we should have been satisfied and assured that it lay in an Antipathy to his Nature to imitate any such Examples. But no means how proper and convictive soever in themselves which the King could use, for laying and extinguishing our Jealousies and Fears of his harbouring Intentions against our Religion, could be of efficacy to operate upon us with any Success; after our having through Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Pride, and Wantonness, grown weary of Tranquility and Ease; and thereupon had imbibed Prepossessions and Prejudices against his Majesty's Person and Government; and suffered our selves to be wrought up and exasperated by a few <hi>Demagogues</hi> and <hi>Boute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feuxs,</hi> who were bribed by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and instigated by his promising them the Spoils of the Crown, Kingdom, and Church, to the highest ferment of blind, brutal, and godless Rage. Nor has the compassionate and merciful King been requited as he ought and deserved by the <hi>French Refugees,</hi> to whom he made his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms both an <hi>Asilum</hi> and a Sanctuary; and his own Treasure, and the Wealth of his People, a Fund of Succour and Subsistance, when they knew not where with safety to hide their Heads, nor how to get Bread to preserve them from Starving. But notwithstanding all the <hi>Hosannahs</hi> they gave him at first, they were many of them in a little time the forwardest to cry <hi>Crucify</hi> him. And contrary to all the Measures of Discretion and Prudence, as well as of Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Gratitude, they have been some of them the warmest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamers of the Rebellion, and have taken Arms in great Numbers for supporting the Usurper.</p>
            <p>But Sir, allow me to subjoin a <hi>third Matter of Fact,</hi> by which the King gave all the Evidence and Assurance to his People, that the most Incredulous and perversly Obstinate among them could have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103637:11"/>
desired or needed, to convince them in what opposition unto and remoteness it lay from his Thoughts to injure us in the Possession of our Religion, and much less to rob us of it; and that was by <hi>his refusing those Ships of War as well as Land Troops which were offered him by the</hi> French <hi>King, for withstanding the Invasion of the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>and for enabling him to suppress those that might sly to Arms, and rise in his own Dominions, to disturb his Reign, or to joyn with the unnatural Invader in case he Landed.</hi> For setting aside a few Things, which the Judges told him he might do according to Law, and some inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Triffles, wherein his treacherous Counsellors misled him, by telling him it was to renounce the Prerogative which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution had vested in him to decline asserting them; so conscious was he to himself of having neither done nor designed any Thing whereby his Protestant Subjects might be tempted to withdraw with any Shadow of Reason and Justice their Allegiance from him; that no allarms of Conspiracies against, or suspected Treacheries unto him at home; nor the fullest and most uncontroulable Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Ships being prepared, and Forces ready to embark upon them abroad, to make a Descent into his Dominions, and hostily to assault him, could prevail with him to accept those Succours which a Neighbouring Monarch offered him, as well in Friendship to himself as in Kindness to his Majesty. It ever hath, and always will be found true, That whosoever hath been Designing, though never so secretly, an Injury or Mischief to another, he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly Suspicious of the Person against whom he intended it; and will use all the Precautions he can, and lay hold upon every Mean that offereth, to put him whom he had contrived to wrong out of a Condition to avoid the Blow, and more especially out of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to revenge it. Ill Thoughts and Intentions in a Prince to his People, though they abide so artificially and industriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>led that none have detected them, do yet not only continually haunt the Projector as Informers that his Designs are discovered and understood, but are ever councelling him to close with all Methods which may obviate and prevent a Retaliation. But the King thought his Protestant Subjects had been as free from Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Designs against his Person, Crown, and Dignity, (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed most of them were) as he was from any usurping and tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ones against their Legal Rights, Liberties, and Religion; and that withheld and restrained him from accepting an Assistance in his Defence, when there was a plotted, formed, and maturated
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103637:11"/>
Conjunction between the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> abroad, and too many of several Perswasions, Communions, and Factions at home, to drive him out of his Kingdoms, if not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him. Which he stood not far out of the danger of, when the <hi>Sunday</hi> Night before the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> it was proposed and debated at <hi>Windsor</hi> to make him a <hi>Prisoner:</hi> But that being opposed by some Persons, whom it was not then thought convenient and safe to contradict and disoblige, It was thereupon resolved the Night following at <hi>Sion-house</hi> to require him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and at a very unseasonable Hour, to abandon and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from his Royal Palace. Which was so ordered upon prospect and hope that he would not have complied, and that thereby a Pretence would have been administred of sending him to the <hi>Tower,</hi> from whence his next Stage would have been to the <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Hill</hi>; there being but a few Steps between a King's Prison and his Grave. Nor would he in any likelihood have escaped the Snare that was thus artificially laid for him, nor have avoided the Danger that was lurking behind it, but that some of those entrusted with the Conveyance of the Message, delivered it with such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Tone, and accompanying Circumstances, as both awakened him to apprehensions of his Peril, and guided him to submit to what was so inhumanly and barbarously prescribed unto him. But to return to the Enforcement of the Argument I am upon, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the King could have no secret Intentions, nor have been carrying on any concealed Designs in order to overthrow our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in that he refused <hi>French</hi> Forces at a Season when they were both Generously offered, and he extreamly needed them; and when by all the Laws of God, and the Kingdom, he might have received and employed them for the withstanding a Foreign Army, commanded by an ambitious and unnatural Prince, which came to divest him of his Sovereign and Legal Rights. For if the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> might send, and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> bring Troops into <hi>England,</hi> let the Pretence be what it will; and the <hi>Brittish</hi> Subjects that Invited and gave Encouragement unto it be never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and of what Quality any think fit to have them; the King might with much more Justice and Right have desired and received <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> as well as <hi>French,</hi> to oppose and beat them out. Seeing both the Power of War, and the lawful Authority of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Kingdom, being lodged Sovereignly and Solely in his Majesty; and the ways of managing the one and the other being
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103637:12"/>
entirely entrusted with his Wisdom, save as he pleased to call for Advice, he might without any Violation of the Rules of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, have furnished himself with necessary Forces from whence he thought fit, for the defence of his Person and the Government; whereas none of his Subjects could raise Forces at home, or invite them from abroad, without rendering themselves guilty of the highest Disloyalty and Treason: Nor could the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Seven Provinces,</hi> being in League and declared Terms of Amity with his Majesty, send or authorise their Troops to come hither, without becoming obnoxious to the Crime and Charge of contemning and violating Publick Treaties, of breaking through all that is Sacred, and of trampling upon every Thing on which the Peace of Nations doth depend. And as for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himself, he being no Sovereign Prince, but the Servant of a late though wealthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, he possibly might have the Right as <hi>Statholder,</hi> into which he wound himself by Perjury and Murther, to exercise some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his own Country; or he might have the Privilege to set up for a Knight <hi>Errant</hi> to combat <hi>Wind-mills,</hi> and kill <hi>Dragons</hi>; but he had no Authority by the Laws of God, or Nations, to invade and attack a Rightful King in the quiet and peaceable Possessions of his own Dominions. And by assuming the Insolence, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him the Injustice to do it, he stands proclaimed by all the Revelations relative to Societies in the Bible, and by the whole Civil Law which is the Law of Nations, to be a Robber and an Usurper; and to have all the Blood that hath been shed in <hi>Europe</hi> by reason of, and as an effect and consequence of his Invasion, to be charged upon him and laid at his Door; and for which he will be made accountable at the great <hi>Tribunal.</hi> Nor can his Majesty's Authority and Right to have received and called <hi>French Troops</hi> be questioned by our Revolutioners and Abdicators themselves; seeing we allow and suffer the like, and much worse, in that <hi>Pageant</hi> King we have dressed up and erected. For notwithstanding of that vast Army of <hi>Brittish</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Troops, with which to the impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nation we continue to furnish him; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he is fulsomly represented in Pulpits, and with a flattering as well as a mean Cringingness addressed unto by Corporations, as the Saviour of our Liberties and Religion; yet he challengeth a Right, and we like a tame slavish People both connive at, and approve it; not only of keeping among us, contrary to his solemn Promise given in his <hi>Declaration</hi> dated at the <hi>Hague,</hi> several <hi>Dutch</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103637:12"/>
Forces, Horse as well as Foot, whom he claps and fasteneth upon the Nation, as a <hi>Badg</hi> that he esteems us no better than conquered Vassals; but if we may believe the <hi>Prints</hi> which come from abroad, he hath sent for <hi>Ten thousand</hi> more outlandish Souldiers to insult and triumph over us as his subdued Slaves. While in the mean time he sends our native Forces into <hi>Flanders</hi> to perish by Famine and Sword as Sacrifices to his Ambition; and to have the Infamy, which he calls Glory, of dying in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Quarrel. Nor do I wonder that he will not trust the defence of the Kingdom to our own Troops; seeing he cannot but be sensible with what Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness he hath Ruled over us, and how he hath Cheated, Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verished, and Ruined us; and that if we had but as much Sense, Reason, and Courage left us, as we have Provocation and Cause of Anger and Indignation given unto us, we would Revenge our selves upon him for the Wrongs he hath done the Kingdom, as well as for those he hath done the King. Whereas that injured Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch being fully assured in himself that he never designed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice us in our Liberties, Properties, or Religion; but that all he aimed at was to make us a free, rich, and glorious People, he cast himself entirely upon the Loyalty of his own Subjects for the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of his Person and Crown, at the time when he saw he was to have his Dominions invaded, and an Attempt to be made for turning him out of his Throne. All which Designs he might have easily defeated, had he but accepted the <hi>French Ships</hi> and <hi>Troops</hi> that were offered him: But to his Glory and our indelible Infamy, he chose rather to be forsaken and betrayed by his own People, than to distrust them; as knowing he had always lived in an Abhorrence of giving them just and real Cause to be false to him. And indeed the Misfortune and Distress which befel him, upon whatsoever Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives they were occasioned, yet they must be resolved into his own Uprightness and Integrity, as the contributing means; and that being an honest Man himself, he drew other Mens Pictures by his own <hi>Original:</hi> Whereas he had continued safe and happy, if he had drawn those of a great many People by the <hi>Reverse</hi> of his own. I know that the Earl of <hi>S</hi>— doth in a <hi>Letter from Holland to his Friend in London,</hi> printed <hi>March</hi> 1689. endeavour to rob the King of the Honour due unto him for having refused the <hi>French</hi> Assistance, and challengeth it to himself, by telling us, <hi>That he opposed to death the accepting of them, and that he was the principal means of hindering the receiving both the Ships and Men.</hi> But all this was then published

Nor hath he been either Shy in concealing of it, or gone without very liberal Rewards for it. For he told <hi>Ginckle,</hi> once at his own Table, That though it was his Honour to have subdued the King's Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to have wrested that Kingdom from his Majesty, yet the Glory belonged unto himself of having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the Provocations to the Revolution, and having laid the Foundations for deposing his Majesty from his Royal Dignity and Throne. And the inward Confidence he is admitted into with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the vast Sums he has obtained, and continues still to receive from him, are plain Evidences, as well as they are thankful Recompences, of the Councels which in favour of the Prince's Designs he gave unto his Master. But would any one that hath not lost all common Prudence and true Sense, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his Loyalty to his Rightful Prince, have published in the same <hi>Letter</hi> a Thing so visibly false, and so easy to be contradicted and exposed; namely, <hi>That when the first News came of the Prince's Designs, they were not looked upon as they proved, no Body foreseeing the Miracles he has done by his wonderful Prudence, Conduct, and Courage, in that the greatest Thing which has been undertaken these Thousand Years,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103637:13"/>
or perhaps ever, could not be effected without Vertues hardly to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, till seen nearer hand.</hi> Whereas it was obvious to vast Numbers then, as it is now to the whole Kingdom, That there was neither Prudence, Conduct, nor Courage, and much less Vertues hardly to be imagined, guiding and influencing the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, but that his whole Prosperity in his Undertaking is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in, and ascribed unto, the Disloyalty and Treachery of some of his Relations, bosom Friends, Councellors, Officers, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and into the Rebellious Principles of too many of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. For to omit speaking of the great Effects which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath so often and wonderfully given in <hi>Flanders,</hi> of his <hi>Prudence, Conduct, Courage, and other Vertues hardly to be imagined,</hi> it is but for us to recollect his Behaviour at and before <hi>Limerick</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he became the subject of the Derision and Contempt of all that were there, and by which he hath furnished us here with matter of Diversion ever since, when we have a Mind to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant; and we may from thence take the Measure and Extent with all the Dimensions of his political and military Excellencies. But the Passage I have quoted out of the <hi>Letter</hi> serves to confirm me, That it is an usual and righteous Judgment of God upon those that turn <hi>Knaves</hi> to give them over to become <hi>Fools</hi> also. And for <hi>the Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years, or the perhaps ever,</hi> that he mentions, wherein the like hath not been untertaken and executed, It is neither for the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> nor for the Credit of this Kingdom, but for the perpetual Dishonour and Infamy both of him and us, that we should have been guilty of so much Treachery and Villany, and he of such an unbounded Ambition, and unnatural Crimes, as there are no Examples of, nor Presidents for.</p>
            <p>And as the King harboured no Thoughts, nor drove on any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Designs, for the Extirpation of our Religion; so I will affirm that the preserving the Protestant Religion was so far from being the true and real Motive to the late Revolution, though so much pretended and so often alledged in Vindication of those who enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in it, that most of those that were the first Instigators unto, and who principally concurred and cooperated to the bringing it about, are not Persons disposed by their Judgments, nor prepared by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Grace to be concerned for any Religion, farther than as the seeming to own <hi>One</hi> ministers to their secular Ends. Now this, if clearly demonstrated, being as likely a means as any for unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the credulous and well-meaning Body of the People, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103637:14"/>
for taking them off from supporting the Usurpation, when they see upon what a Mistake they were wheedled to Joyn at first with the Conspirators against his Majesty's Person and Government; I will lay it before you in the best Light I can, without writing a Satyr upon States and Countries, or too much exposing the Atheism, Unbelief, and Immoralities, inconsistent with any Religion of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men, who are divers of them of great Rank, Quality, and Condition in the World. However it doth not detract from the worth of Religion, but rather shews it is some excellent Thing, that all Men will seek countenance from it to those Undertakings, for which they would fear to be otherwise the Objects of a keen and general hatred. To which allow me to add, That the being hurried into this Revolution upon the Pretence of saving our Religion, shews, that though most who stile themselves Protestants are People of very weak and shallow Understandings, and that their Zeal is much greater than their Knowledge; yet it likewise tells us, that many of them heartily love it, in that they think neither the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranquillity, nor their private Fortunes, too valuable to be parted with in order to preserve it. And this the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his mercenary Tools were sufficiently aware of, and therefore made that the Pretence both of the Invasion, and of the aggressive War, we made afterwards on <hi>France</hi>; as knowing it would bubble as out of our Lives as well as our Money, and be an Engine to open both our Veins and our Purses. Yet after what I have said, I will nevertheless add, That as it is no Credit, but a Disgrace to Religion, that some Men should pretend to have a Concern or Regard for it; it being a Reproach unto it, that they should wear its Livery, and a Disparagement to be favourably spoken of by them; whereas their Reviling it would be its Commendation, and their turning their Backs upon it would argue it Lovely: So it hath been always found true, and ever will, That the making Religion a Plea whereby to justify that which is Evil, does lessen its Power over the Consciences of Men, and hindereth its Success in conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Irreligious and Incredulous; and defeats it in its only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, which is the raising Glory to God, and the restoring the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image upon Men. Nor can I forbear to publish it as my avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Opinion, That no Success or Honour that can attend our Arms in this War, should we not only be so prosperous as to obtain a safe and honourable Peace to <hi>Europe,</hi> but to subdue and conquer <hi>France,</hi> will ever be able to countervail the Injury we have done the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103637:14"/>

Nor will all that Sea of Blood spilt in <hi>Europe,</hi> as the Effect and Consequence of it, wash away the Blots and Stains we have thereby brought upon the Reformed Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; but they will remain indelible, until we have returned to our Duty, reassumed our Loyalty, and have restored our exiled Prince; and until we have taken the Ignominy and Reproach upon our selves, that we have derived upon our Religion, and have by Words, Writing and Tears, vindicated and acquitted it, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given any Countenance to what hath been done, and have charged and lodged it upon our own Disloyalty, Pride, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness.

Can any Man think that <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Trenchard</hi> can be under the Influence of Religion in any Busi- or Undertaking, or can make it the Motive or End of what he does, who concerted with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> how to betray and ruin the King, and became engaged to him to use all means he could to do it; and this at the very time when he was suing for a Pardon, and who after the Grant and Receipt of one, came over, and made his Majesty all the Promises Words could express, of his serving him with Loyalty and Fidelity so long as he lived? But as there is no necessity now of telling which of these Promises he has performed, whether those made at the <hi>Hague,</hi> or those given at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> that being sufficiently declared by a long and ample <hi>Series</hi> of Actions; so I think it will be easily granted, that this Man could act under no Impression of Religion, nor upon the Motive or to the End of saving or serving it, who could come under two such opposite and contradictory Obligations at the same time, as the yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an unchangeable Fealty and Obedience to the King, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to betray and divest him of his Royal Power were. Or is it possible we should believe that my Lord <hi>L</hi>— and the honourable <hi>Speech-maker</hi> and <hi>Haranguer</hi> of the <hi>Mob</hi> at <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Lyn,</hi> could embark in promoting the late Change, out of any Concernment for the Protestant Religion, or in order to protect it, who though they profess to be Protestants when they are Well and in Health; yet who at every time when they are Sick, or when they have apprehensions of Dying, do constantly send for <hi>Romish</hi> Priests, to administer unto them all the helps, and give them the assistances appointed by that Church for Men in their last Hours? I am loath
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103637:16"/>
to multiply many Instances in confirmation of what I have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the chief Leaders and Actors in the Conspiracy for dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the King are so well known, that I need not do it. Even they whose Character should oblige us to believe that the preserving the Protestant Religion was the chief if not the only Motive upon which they acted, in the late great Turn that was made in this Kingdom, were as far from having it in their Eye or Aim, as any other were. Nor will any that know the Men allow, that either <hi>Jack Boots,</hi> or <hi>Cambrick Sleeves,</hi> embarked in dethroning and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving away the King, out of any Regard unto or Concernedness for the Reformed Doctrine and Worship; but that they did it out of Pique and Revenge, and upon the Motives of Ambition and Covetousness, in the <hi>one</hi> to get a Bishoprick, and in the <hi>other</hi> to preserve one. For not to speak of the <hi>Rings</hi> and <hi>Seals,</hi> which the Doctor (through an Hypocrisy peculiar to himself that wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Cambrick, Holland, Scots</hi> Cloath Sleeves instead of <hi>Lawn</hi>) boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of as Pledges of the Kindnesses of Ladies for the Services he has done them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can that Man live in the practical Belief, or be under the awe of a Deity, and much less act upon any sincere Motives of serving Religion, but meerly to serve himself upon it, who when he was dipt in all the Councels and Conspiracies for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing and compassing the Revolution, could yet at the same time, in his <hi>Letters</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Middleton,</hi> not only make solemn Protestations of his Loyalty to the King, but have recourse for Proof and Evidence of it to the <hi>Sermons</hi> full of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Fealty</hi> to the King, which he had preached at the <hi>Hague</hi> as well as at <hi>London.</hi> And as those <hi>Letters</hi> are in print to remain Records and Registers of his Irreligion and Hypocrisy; so I am mistaken in the Rules of <hi>Phisiognomy,</hi> if the Punishment that waits for him, and which he hath so much deserved, and whereof he hath had advertisment in <hi>Dreams,</hi> be not legibly written in his Forehead.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103637:16"/>
by it upon their Principles, and such an open deflouring of the Chastity, which their Church had hitherto preserved in point of Allegiance to Lawful and Rightful Monarchs, that were it not that great Multitudes of that Communion both preserved their own Innocency, and have loudly condemned the Crime of their <hi>quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> Brethren and Fellow-members<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their whole Church would for ever lye under the same Blot and Infamy, which those very Men, namely, your <hi>Tillotsons, Burnets,</hi> and <hi>Sherlocks,</hi> &amp;c. have used here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore to cast and fasten upon others. And as for those called <hi>Whigs,</hi> which were the warmest Promoters of the Revolution, and are supposed more than others to have acted in it upon the Motive of Securing our Religion; I will make bold to say of many of them, and that both with Truth and Justice, That they have no Religion but their Interest, nor sacrifice to any Deity but themselves. The <hi>Whig</hi> Party is, generally speaking, a compound of the Atheistical of all Opinions and Perswasions whatsoever; and they can be of any Religion, because they are really of none. They will take the Sacrament in the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be qualified to get or hold a Place, and then will herd with the Phanaticks ever after, that they may be esteemed <hi>Partizans</hi> for our Sovereign Lord the People. Upon the whole, whosoever will speak his Knowledge or his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, cannot avoid confessing that the Promoting the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Abdicating the King, the Crowning the Invader, and the Lavishing away Lives and Fortunes to support the Usurpation and Rebellion, were not entered upon out of Fear of losing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise our Religion, nor continued and persevered in upon Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of being serviceable to its Safety, Success, and Glory; but that some wanted <hi>White Staves</hi>; to which they thought they might pretend on the foot of merit; and that others had fallen under <hi>Fines,</hi> which though they were forgiven the Payment of, yet they resented, and sought to revenge their being laid upon them; and that all were desirous to Fish in troubled Waters, in which though but a few were to catch <hi>Ducal Titles,</hi> or <hi>Blew Ribbons,</hi> and <hi>Garters,</hi> yet Something would come as a Share to many upon the Shipwreck of the Government, and out of the Spoil of the Crown, Kingdom, and Church. The truest Character I can bestow upon them, is that which <hi>Livy</hi> gives those that Set up for and Joyned the <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri,</hi> namely, That they did persue, <hi>licentiam suam, non libertatem Patriae:</hi> And indeed the unparalelled Treachery that accompanied the Revolution, in most of those that were actively engaged in it,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103637:17"/>
does put it beyond all rational Contradiction, that it was so far from being undertaken or persued upon Motives of Religion, that they could neither have Religion, Vertue, nor true Honour, who were capable of being guilty of so much Falshood and Infidelity, as well as of Disloyalty. Is it possible or to be imagined, in any consistency with common Sense, That those Persons could come into the Design of the Revolution under any Views of Religion, or promote the late Change upon Motives or Prospects of serving it, who not only abandoned and betrayed the King, with his <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> in their Pockets, and while they were eating his Bread; but who could beg Money of him to form their Equipages to serve him, and which he Innocently, Liberally, and Generously gave them, in the midst of his Streights and Exigencies of Money for his Personal use? And yet all that they craved it for, and applied it to, was to get into a Condition to fight against him, and to drive him out of his Kingdoms. But we need no more to proclaim the distance and estrangedness that most of the <hi>Revolutioners</hi> and <hi>Abdicators</hi> live in, both as to the Protestant Religion, and any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Love to their Country; and how little they were swayed in what they did by any Regards or Concernments for the good of either; but that since their getting into Offices, Places and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as the Recompence of their Disloyalty, Treachery, and Rebellion to the King, they have committed more Rapines and Robberies upon the Nation, more audaciously sold the Kingdom for Pensions and Bribes, and have more impudently Cousened, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded, and Oppressed their Fellow Subjects, than the worst of Men heretofore have attempted or allowed themselves to do; and which Highway-men and <hi>Banditti</hi> would not have the Immodesty and Injustice to perpetrate. For Pick-pockets, Shop-lifters, or such as take a Purse upon the Road, are both vertuous and harmless Persons in comparison of those that eat the Flesh, and drink the Blood, and gnaw the very Bones of poor Souldiers, by defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of their pay; of whom to use <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s Phrase, I may say, <hi>Quinis in diem assibus corpus &amp; anima estimantur</hi>; or of those that rob Hospitals, in withholding from Widows and Fatherless Children the Arrears due to their Husbands and Fathers that perished in their Service; and I am loath to add that plunder the Subject, by the Authority and in the Virtue of the Great Seal, and exerci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

for it. Nor are these Aspersions unjustly thrown upon the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Revolution, and the Zealots of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Things whereof they are accused at Random, without Proof or Evidence; but they are the Effects and Testimonies of Love unto, and Care for preserving the Protestant Religion, which the Gentlemen of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s <hi>Chapel</hi> find one another, and those guilty of, that were the chief Assistants in the Revolution, and continue the main Pillars of the Usurpation. For when a certain Sort of People quarrel, and fall out, many hidden Truths and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed Crimes come to be discovered; and I wish it may have a Tendency to every Man's recovering his Right, that is a true Owner. Nor are these Things to be thought Strange in those em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by this Government, seeing they were the very worst Men of the Nation that contributed most to the Revolution, in whom that of <hi>Tacitus</hi> was verified, <hi>In turbas &amp; discordias pessimo cuique plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rima vis.</hi> And the publick Liberty was only made a Pretence for their persuing their own Interests, at the Expence and to the Ruin of their Country: For as the same Author observes, <hi>Libertatis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulum obtendi ab iis, qui privatim degeneres, in publicum exitiosi, nihil spei, nisi per discordias habent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did those <hi>abroad</hi> that co-operated to the Revolution, and lent their Ships and Troops to effect it, act any more upon Motives that respected the Protestant Religion, than we here did; but purely upon Principles and Inducements of Interest and State. For it is no Slander to say that the <hi>Deputies</hi> of the <hi>Seven Provinces,</hi> who sit governing at the <hi>Hague,</hi> never enter into War or Peace upon any other Instigation, or Views and Ends, save those of a secular Concernment. Nor would it move or impress them to see all the Inhabitants of these three Kingdoms turn <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> farther than as it may affect their Trade, and disturb their Civil Tranquillity; and so little do they act under an Influence, or with a Respect to the Christian Religion, and much less with Regard to the Protestant, that in order to drive the <hi>Portugueze</hi> out of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> where they had a large and beneficial Commerce, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grose the Trade of it to themselves, they not only suggested to the Natives, and particularly to the Ministers at Court, and by them to the Emperour, That the Christian Religion involved Treason in it against his Crown, Person, and Estate; and thereby raised a Persecution which ended in the Extirpation of Christianity out of those Dominions, and in the Massacre of several Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103637:18"/>
Souls; but they both permitted, and by a solemn Act of State authorised their Subjects that traded thither, to disclaim being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and only to own themselves <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who knew no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but Profit, nor had other Ends or Aims save to gain and heap up Wealth. And besides many other Instances which might be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed of their abandoning all Care and Concernment for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion in other Nations, when the doing so is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable to their Safety and worldly Advantage; it may not be amiss to put you in remembrance of their furnishing <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. with Ships to subdue <hi>Rochel,</hi> when it was the chief Cautionary Town, as well as the strongest and most opulent, which the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France</hi> had to entitle them to a quiet and peaceable Enjoyment of their Religion. Nor is it unseasonable to ask, That if they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked to assist in the dethroning of the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> out of zeal for preserving the Protestant Religion to these Nations, how comes it then that they have so little interposed with their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the <hi>Emperour,</hi> for some Lenity and Favour to his Protestant Subjects in <hi>Hungary?</hi> And that they have not dealt with their other Allie the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for abolishing the <hi>Inquisition?</hi> And that he would not continue to make <hi>Bonfires</hi> of his Subjects, whensoever any of them turn Protestants? Nay their entering into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, for subduing and deposing his Majesty, was so far from being done from Motives relative to the Honour and Safety of the Protestant Religion, that it was laid and forwarded by the greatest Falshood and Treachery that ever either a Crowned Head or a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick was guilty of. For what can be more inconsistent with good Morals, namely, with Truth and Justice, or less reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to the Principles of Christianity, than not only to attack a King upon his Throne with whom they were in <hi>League,</hi> without giving him Warning, or seeking for Reparation of Injuries if he had done them any, and without desiring an Adjustment of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and Misunderstandings where there were such; but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade his Kingdoms with a Naval and Land Strength, after the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnest Protestations made to the <hi>King</hi> himself by <hi>Cittars</hi> their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador here, and the greatest Assurances given immediately by the <hi>States General</hi> to the <hi>Marquess d'Albeville</hi> his Majesty's <hi>Envoy</hi> there, That they had no Design against him, and that their Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were not in order to disquiet him on his Throne, or disturb the Peace of his Kingdoms; but that they were for a purpose meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relative to themselves, and in which his Majesty was no ways
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103637:18"/>
interested. So that after so fraudulent and perjurious an Act, the Commencement of the War being in Violation and Contempt of actual and subsisting Treaties; I do challenge any Man to believe, without doing violence to his Mind, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> are in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Belief of any Religion, and much less that they co-operated to the Revolution out of care to preserve the Reformed Doctrine and Worship to these Three Nations. Alas! It was upon other Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they concurred to involve these Nations in War and Blood, which we might easily have discovered, but would not. For they no sooner observed the King's putting an end to Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Dominions, and thereby doing that which might have reconciled his People to one another, and should have united them all to him; nor sooner found that he had too much Honour and Courage, and withall bore more Love and Tenderness to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to suffer them either to be wormed, or insulted out of their Trade: And had likewise perceived that as he was an admirable <hi>Oeconomist</hi> of the publick Treasure, so he was a great Encourager of all over whom God had set him, to Industry and Vertue; but that they grew immediately thereupon apprehensive, that we would become more Strong and Opulent than would be for their Interest, or prove consistent with the Tricks and Rapines they had been accustomed to practise in ways of Commerce.

I am not ignorant how he hath been represented and painted forth, by your Temporizing, Mercenary, and Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Divines, as the Saviour of our Religion and Liberties; and that the godly Saint, and the heavenly divine Man, would not have violated all the Tyes and Bonds of Nature, and trampled upon the Precepts of the Decalogue, and the Sanctions of the Bible, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inducements of Zeal for God, and his holy Religion; which by Examples taken from <hi>Phineas</hi> and <hi>Ehud</hi> transform Murther into Sacrifices; and by Presidents derived from the <hi>Israelites</hi> borrowing the Ear-rings of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> consecrate and hallow Rapines and Robberies. The Panegyricks upon him on this Account of your <hi>Tillotsons, Tenisons, Patricks,</hi> and <hi>Burnets,</hi> &amp;c. are more Frontless and Fulsom, than what your <hi>Shadwels, Settles,</hi> or any of your <hi>Grubstreet Poets,</hi> who claim a Dispensation of Lying for Bread, would have the Impudence to justify themselves in, when they write to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the Applauses of the gaping Mob, and much less when they purpose to gain the Clappings of those in the <hi>Pit</hi> and <hi>Boxes.</hi> But after I have borrowed for a while these Gentlemens <hi>Pencils,</hi> and only dipt them in Colours more natural, and better adapted to the Figure and Complexion of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; I will challenge all Mankind, who have not abjured Truth and common Honesty, to believe any longer or continue to avouch, That his coming into <hi>England</hi> was out of any other Respect to our Religion, save making it the Cloak and stalking Horse to his towring and ambitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.

I need not tell you with what alienation from Gratitude, contempt of Justice, scornful regardlesness of a Deity, as well as disgrace of all Religion, he first came abroad, and set up in the World, when he thrust himself into the <hi>Statholdership</hi> of his own Country by Perjury and Murther of Two of the best Patriots of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Republick; of one of which, namely <hi>John de Witt,</hi> the late Pensionary <hi>Fagel</hi> was heard and known to say, after he had examined all his Papers, and searched into the whole of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct during his Ministry, That the great, if not only, Fault he was guilty of, was his ardent Love unto, and his steady and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken Service of his Country. Nor shall I do more than briefly refresh your Memory, how being of no Religion he can personate any, when it lies in a Subserviency to his Interest; and that he would with the same Readiness, and exteriour Shews of Zeal, have acted the part of a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, to have obtained a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty over any Kingdom of the Papal Communion, as he hath done that of a Protestant to get into the Throne of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and to be admitted unto a Domination over these Nations. For his having been oftener than once at <hi>Mass,</hi> and that not as a Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator out of Curiosity, but as communicating in that Worship and Devotion, is known to so many Persons of several Qualities as well as of different Religions, that it will not be gainsaid by any who are acquainted with Passages and Transactions some Years ago in <hi>Flanders</hi>: And should any be so ignorant of matters of Fact at a distance from their own Doors, or live in enmity to all Truths disagreable to their Humours and Interests, so as to deny it, there are those both at <hi>Brussels</hi> and <hi>Antwerp</hi> who can testify it, and have not been heretofore shy to do it. It was K. <hi>Charles</hi>'s having no Children, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s having no <hi>Male</hi> ones that lived, and his own Marriage with the said Duke's <hi>Eldest Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and therefore coming into some probable and nearer Prospects of arriving sooner or later at the Sovereignty over these Kingdoms, that made him put on the Vizard and Mask of a Zealot for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion; having before lived in all the Coldness and Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency in that matter that was consistent with his keeping the <hi>Posts</hi> he held in <hi>Holland.</hi> I am loath to subjoyn how impossible it is that that Man should be of any Religion, and much less act upon real and sincere Motives, for the good of the <hi>Protestant,</hi> who can and doth indulge himself in the Practice of such Abominations as

are repugnant to the Light of Nature, and to the <hi>Ethicks</hi> of Pagans, as well as to the Doctrines and Precepts of the Bible, and which are made Capital by the Laws of all Nations. Nor can I do it, unless I would offend the Eyes and Ears of modest Persons, and give occasion to the infecting and defiling the Imaginations of Men and Women, by mentioning such Crimes in Paper. For as they are such heinous and provoking Abominations, as have brought Fire from Heaven upon whole Citys and Societies; so they are of that strangeness to our <hi>Climate,</hi> and so little heard of, and much less practiced under our <hi>Meridian</hi>; that our Law took no knowledge of them till the 25 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. when they were made <hi>Felony</hi> without benefit of Clergy. They are <hi>Ultramontane</hi> Crimes lately transplanted into our Soyl, and in which to the Credit of our Country they have not much throve nor grown. But I do reckon it unbecoming both you and my self to enlarge upon this; nor is it necessary to descend to proofs of it in a City, and about a Court, where your <hi>Kapples</hi> are known, and where it is sprung up into a Proverb, <hi>In hunc modum fiunt Comites Anglicani.</hi> It is enough to tell you, That it is the Entertainment of Societies of People of the best Fashion, where the rallying upon it has a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times made the modest, fair, and tender Sex to Blush; and hath filled the masculine and virile with Contempt and Hatred of themselves, for enduring a <hi>Catamite</hi> to rule over them.

To which it may not be amiss to add, the Antipathy which that Man must unavoidably live in to all Religion, who after his <hi>Declaration</hi> prepared and printed at the <hi>Hague,</hi> for wheedling the credulous People of <hi>England</hi> into a Belief, that he came to save them from Popery and Tyranny; and in which he makes the <hi>Supposititiousness</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> or at least the <hi>Questionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of his <hi>Legitimacy,</hi> one of the mighty Grounds of his Quarrel with the King, and the chiefest Provocation upon which he was about to invade his Kingdoms; yet that even then, and until a few days before he actually Embarked on that Design, he had the <hi>Royal Babe</hi> prayed for in his own Chapel, by that Distinguishing and Princely Title. And as I will never henceforth think it strange, that he should allow himself to hoodwink, impose upon, and mislead Nations, who durst with that open Boldness mock and deride the Omniscient, Almighty, and Righteous God, both to his Face, and in his own instituted Worship and Service; so it satisfied me, and may do all others, that one who could be guilty of so much publick Atheism as well as Hypocrisy, as that was which I have now mentioned, can have no other Designs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning either the Protestant or any Religion, but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a Stale for the better compassing his own Ends. And suffer me upon this occasion to entertain you with a Passage of <hi>Benting</hi> (who is the Earl said to be made on the new Foot of merit that I have mentioned) to a certain Gentleman in a private Conversation between them. For the Gentleman having asked him, why they did not discover and make appear the Illegitimacy and Supposititiousness of the Prince of <hi>Wales?</hi> Seeing as the Belief of it had served more to draw the Nation into the Interest of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> than any thing else; so a Legal and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary proof of it, would inseparably link most Men to him, and preserve them in a perpetual Alienation from King <hi>James: Benting</hi> told him, by way of Reply, That they neither questioned the <hi>Legitimacy</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> nor were concerned about it; for that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was now got into the Throne, and was resolved to keep it so long as he lived, and cared not who ascended it when he was gone. Nor did his Letter to the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Fleet,</hi> for debauching them from their Duty, and by which he courted them to revolt from the King, savour of, or stand in consistency with any Religion, but proclaims him both
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103637:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
highly Impious and Atheistical; it being not only to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance breach of Trust and Disloyalty, but to advise and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize Perjury. And whosoever tempts others to forswear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, have been accounted by all Nations as Despisers of a Deity, Supplanters of the only Ground of all human Commerce and Conversation, and the Subverters of the Foundation upon which all Societies are established. And his inviting those to desert and forsake his Majesty, who not only eat his Bread, and received his Pay, but who stood bound to him both by their Allegiance, and Oath of Fealty, as they were his Subjects, and by a military Oath as they were Souldiers enrolled under his Banners; shews his own Irreligion that advised it, as well as theirs that hearkened unto him. And may be it will sooner or later return upon him, wherein not only God will be Righteous, but those that forsake the Standards of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Justifiable; provided they do it from a just and penitent Sense of their Crime, in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Lawful and Righteous Oath they were under to the King, from the Sanction and Obligation whereof no human Power can ever acquit them; and also from a Conviction of the Unlawfulness of that Oath which they have taken to the Usurper. I might add, That the pretending to have come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Safety, Honour, and Interest of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, will appear the most shameful <hi>Banter</hi> that ever was put upon the Understandings of a whole Nation; if we consider the Treaty at <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> and with whom the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Invasion that was to be made upon the King. For they must have forfeited common Sense, as well as moral Honesty, who can be prevailed upon to allow, that the many <hi>Catholick</hi> Princes who approved of that Undertaking, could design any good to the Protestant Religion, or believe that any Advantage would accrue unto it by that Attempt. It is to Buffoon us, and treat us in Ridicule, to endeavour to impose upon our Belief, That the late Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> who together with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was the original Contriver of a Descent upon <hi>England</hi>; or that the <hi>Emperour, King of Spain, Elector of Bavaria,</hi> &amp;c. who concurred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and countenanced it; or that old <hi>Odiscalchi,</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>XI.</hi> who winked and connived at it, though against both a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Monarch, and the first of the <hi>Romish</hi> Communion that hath sat upon the Thrones of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> for above these hundred

Years; could do it in Kindness to the Protestant Religion, or foresee that it was undertaken by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> upon any Motive relating to the Safety of it. No, they very well knew that there was nothing of Religion in this Case; but they were willing to make use of the Ambition of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to seek their own Revenge against <hi>France,</hi> and to raise a War of <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>State</hi> upon his haughty Aspirings after a Crown, and on our being bubbled into it through a foolish Credulity that it was entered upon in behalf of our Religion. Nor is it unworthy of Remark, That the last Duke of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who was both one of the wisest and bravest Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> and one of the sincerest and most zealous for the Protection, Glory, and Advancement of the Reformed Religion, would neither embark in a Design against the King of <hi>England,</hi> nor suffer the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to enter actually upon it, so long as he lived. Which made his Death to be received and entertained at the <hi>Hague</hi> as a happy and seasonable Providence, in that his Son who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded would not have the Prudence to avoid being ensnared unto it; being withall under the Influence of those mighty Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations he stands entitled unto, as he is the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Cousin German, and thereupon Rightful Heir to all his Personal and Hereditary Estates. And to put it beyond all reasonable Contradiction that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> did only Sham, Abuse, and Banter Mankind, in pretending to come hither upon Motives of Favour and Kindness to our Religion, than that the only Two Protestant crowned Heads in the World, did neither antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently concur unto it, nor have they to this day engaged in the War against <hi>France,</hi> which was the immediate and natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence and Effect of that Undertaking. But to advance a little farther; Does not the whole Tenor of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s publick Government, as well as his personal and private Conduct, lie in a direct Contradiction to his being under the Impressions of any Religion, and much more to his being under the Efficacy of what we call the Protestant? I am not at leisure to give you the full History of his Usurpation, which some are pleased to stile his Reign; but there are those who will do it to purpose in due time, it being necessary that the vertuous Memory of the <hi>Hero,</hi> and of our Folly, should be recorded for the Instruction of Posterity. All therefore I shall do at present is to bestow a few
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103637:22"/>
               <hi>Strictures</hi> upon his Administration, there being no more needful to my purpose. Let me then ask, Whether he hath done any Thing for bettering our Laws, and enlarging our Liberties, which were some of the main Things he came hither for? Or hath he not on the contrary more avowedly superseded and departed from our known Laws, and put more <hi>Negatives</hi> on publick <hi>Bills</hi> prepared by both Houses for the Royal Assent, than any of the Kings that went lately before him did? Has he performed any one Thing he undertook, and which was expected from him, that he could avoid the doing of? Hath he kept one Promise he ever made, that he has been in a Condition to evade? Has he proved true to any one Friend that trusted and served him, save as they have been Slaves to his Will, and Tools of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrariness? Hath he from the time he came in to this day, been known to discern or reward Merit? All his Policy is Trick; and his pretended Kindness, Fraud and Deceit. Instead of encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our Wealth, he hath utterly Impoverished us; and that not so much through Necessity, as Choice resulting from Hatred. In the Place of making us more Opulent than we were, he hath brought us into contemptible Poverty. Whereas we hoped he would have protected us from the Enemies he created us; he hath upon Design, as well as from Laziness, given us up to them as a Sacrifice. And whereas it would have become him, had he either been a good Man or a just King, to have discouraged and prevented Bribes, especially when Persons only sought and sued for their Right: The <hi>Privy Purse</hi> hath been the Receptacle of most of the scandalous Bribes that have been given; for it is thither that what we call our House of Commons has traced them. But that which is Base and Criminal, beyond what any Language can express, unless it be <hi>Dutch,</hi> is his purchasing so many <hi>Members</hi> of both Houses to sell their Country. This being a direct Subversion of the Constitution, if any Thing could make a Lawful King forfeit his Right, this would stand fairest to do it. For the Sovereign having no other Ground of claim to any Power or Prerogative, save what he hath from the <hi>Constitution</hi> which hath settled and vested them in him, That Prince who goes about to overthrow this, does all he can to cancel his own Right, and to cut the Bough on which he stands. And yet we who have had the Folly and Madness to abdicate a Legal King for

some few little Mistakes in the Administration, have not the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Courage to call an Usurper to account, for trampling upon all the Fundamentals of the <hi>English</hi> Government. The King's <hi>Closetting</hi> some Peers and Gentlemen, which was only to address their Reason and Understanding to consent to a Matter which the Crown had in all Ages been in possession of, until about Twenty Years ago, and which was never thought hurtful unto, and much less inconsistent with, the Safety of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion till of late, filled the whole Nation with Complaints and Clamours of his Majesty's Designing to alter the Government, and run the People into that brutal Fury, which produced the woful Effects that soon after followed: Whereas we sit still, and with a stupid Tameness endure the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to steal away all our Rights from us, by his <hi>Bribing</hi> those to betray and give them up, who were chosen by their Country to be the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of them. And he who dares not in a way of Fortitude and Bravery fight us out of them, is endeavouring to strip us of them by an Assassination. Surely if he that poysons an individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be out of the purl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And if the Murtherer of the meanest Subject be obnoxious to capital Punishment; what should he be made liable unto that murthereth a Parliament? Who, that he may the better Rob and Plunder the Nation, gives others a Share in the Spoil.

He had soon learned, and as soon practiced, the pouring a little Water into a dry Pump, to make it suck below and give forth above, whatsoever Quantity he needed, or was pleased to call for: Witness his parting with the <hi>Chimney Tax</hi> from the Crown, for which he hath made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal on the Kingdom in divers methods of raising Money that have been more dishonourable as well as more grievous to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that was.

For he published with an Openness, that they all became acquainted with it, That <hi>he was more troubled with the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly</hi> Scots <hi>than he was with all Mankind besides:</hi> Nor is to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, but that after he has impoverished the <hi>English,</hi> which through squeezing Five or Six millions yearly out of them, as he is in a fair way of doing, he will have the same Compliment in reserve for them, with the addition of Sots and Fools to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Only I cannot avoid saying, That if the <hi>Scots</hi> have not Honour and Courage to resent it, and to make him feel the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his haughty Folly, and of their just Indignation; all the World will think that they deserve a worse Character than that of <hi>Beggarly Scots,</hi> and will account them a Rascally and Dastard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People.

Expression of the same <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Now unless these Things, and more of that kind which it were easy to mention, are to be accounted Arguments, and held for Evidences of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> acting upon Motives of love unto, and care for the Protestant Religion, in the invading his Uncle's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and usurping his Crown, there are none else discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the whole course of his Administration; and they must be either more sottish than the <hi>Soldanians</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> or more irreligious than the <hi>Cannibals</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conclude from the foregoing Practices, and from such other as stand in affinity with them, That he has any Religion at all, or that he acts for any End, but the satisfying his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or upon any Motives save Pride and Haughtiness. To which let me add, in the last Place, That if his Errand hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been to take care of the Protestant Religion, he might have done it effectually without driving his Majesty out of his Dominions: Seeing there was not that Security that could have been wished or desired in order thereunto, but what the King was ready to have consented unto; and that more from his own Choice and Goodness, than from the Influence of the Condition he was in. And as all Things of which his Enemies accused him, and whereof they took Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, into which he had been misled, were rectified and redressed by Acts of his own Wisdom and Grace, before ever the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> came out of <hi>Holland</hi>; so he had ordered the Issuing out <hi>Writs</hi> for calling a Parliament, in which the Nation might in the Ancient and Legal way have made what Provisions they had pleased for the preserving and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing our Religion and Liberties. Nor is there that Man in <hi>England</hi> who retains the least Measure of Reason and good Sense, let his Malice to the King be never so furious and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, but he must acknowledge, That if the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had come hither upon any other Design, save that of dethroning the King, and usurping his Crown, he might have easily compassed all the Ends published in his <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; either by way of a private Treaty with the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or by the Method of a Parliament, freely and indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

chosen, and permitted to sit without an armed Power and military Force upon them. And as this would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to the Honour of the Prince, and gained him the Admiration of his Enemies, and the Praises and Benedictions of his Friends; so it would both have prevented a great deal of Distress, Calamity, and Bloodshed in <hi>Europe,</hi> and have left these Kingdoms more safe and opulent than they now are, and without that heap of Guilt and Infamy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them under which they are brought. But instead of treading in those paths of Truth to Mankind, Reputation to himself, and Justice as well as Kindness to these Nations, it is known with what Neglect and Scorn he received the Proposals carried from his Majesty to him by the <hi>Marquess of Hallifax,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Nottingham,</hi> and my <hi>Lord Godolphin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
