            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE City of London.</head>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. THE City of <hi>London</hi> is a Body Politick by Preſcription, and many Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Confirmed by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and many Acts of Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it hath many Powers and Privileges, which belong to the Freemen only of the Body, Excluſive to all others.</item>
                  <item>2. The chief and higheſt Privilege of the ſaid City, or Body Corporate, and of all the Freemen thereof, is a Power to make Bye-Laws for their own better Government and Advantage; and whilſt the Freemen exceeded not the numbers that could meet and conſult together, they were Aſſembled, and made ſuch Laws for themſelves as they thought fit.</item>
                  <item>3. When the Freemen were too numerous to Conſult in one Aſſembly, after various ways practiſed to have themſelves repreſented in Councils about their good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It was at laſt agreed, (ſome Hundreds of Years ſince) That a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Freemen ſhould be Yearly Choſen at the Wardmotes, to repreſent in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil the whole Body of the Commonalty of the City, and to act and conſent for them in making their Bye-Laws, and ordering all the greateſt concerns of the City; and thoſe Freemen ſo Choſen by all the reſpective Wards, have had, and ſtill have the name of the <hi>Common-Council of the City,</hi> who, together with the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, make up the Court of the greateſt Authority, under the name of the <hi>Mayor, Citizens, and Commonalty of the City of</hi> LONDON.</item>
                  <item>4. There are many Inhabitants within the ſeveral Wards, who are not Freemen of the City, or Members of the ſaid Body, who are nevertheleſs Bound (as all Reſidents are) to come to the reſpective Wardmotes, wherein the ſaid Members for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council</hi> are yearly Choſen; and all thoſe Inhabitants, though not Free of the City, if they pay Scot and bear Lot, have always had Voices in the Choice of the <hi>Conſtables, Queſt-men</hi> and <hi>Scavengers</hi> for their Ward, and may be Choſen to thoſe Offices which concerns equally all the Inhabitants in the reſpective Wards, as they are Inhabitants of thoſe Precincts, though no Members of the Body Politick of the City.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But the ſaid Inhabitants that are not of the Body of the City, do now claim to have Voices in the Election of the Freemen, that are to repreſent the whole Body Corporate of the City in <hi>Common-Council,</hi> becauſe they are Choſen at the Ward-mote, to which ſuch Inhabitants are ſummoned, though they do not pretend that they are capable to be Choſen; and upon the like ground the ſaid Inhabitants alſo claim to have Voices in the Election of the <hi>Aldermen</hi> of the ſaid City, or Body Corporate.</p>
            <p>
               <label>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 1.</label> Whether by the Charters Incorporating the City, the Inhabitants within the Wards, not being Members or Free-men of the City, have any Right to give their Voices in the Election of the <hi>Aldermen</hi> or <hi>Common-Council-men</hi> of the ſame?</p>
            <p>
               <label>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 2.</label> Whether the Permiſſion of ſuch Inhabitants as are not Free of the City, and by Negligence, Connivance, or otherwiſe, to have given their Voices in ſome ſuch Election at the Ward-motes, do give them any Right or juſt Claim to the Privilege of Freemen in the Choice of the <hi>Aldermen</hi> and <hi>Common-Council-men</hi> of the Body Corporate of the City?</p>
