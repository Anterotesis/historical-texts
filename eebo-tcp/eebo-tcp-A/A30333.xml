            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe World has been so often deceived in many pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, who make a Trade of changing their Religion, that it is no wonder if Men are not easily perswaded of the sincerity of those who come over from one Religion to another; since it is certain the prepossession of Education and Custom is so strong, that such as turn to a New Religion, must either be led to it by a clear Conviction, which will shew it self in other signal Effects, or are guilty of great levity and fickleness of Mind, that disposes them too easily to change for changes sake; or do it upon a baser account, of working upon the Compassions of those, who being very Religious themselves, are apt to deal their Charity liberally to such as seem to follow the steps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who being called to it, forsook his Kindred and Country to serve the true and living God.</p>
            <p>But here is a Convert that is indeed a Disciple of the Cross, and has, in all the steps she made towards her Change, been oft in danger of her Life, and has suffered much from her Mother and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: Whose Persecutions ceased not after she had taken sanctuary in this Country, where she might reasonably have thought, that either
<pb facs="tcp:47933:3"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> durst not presume to have pursued her any longer; or if they would have attempted it, could not have found Instruments to have served their wicked Designs. But even here, as they found out cursed Tools to have spirited her away; so when they failed, they betook themselves to all the Arts of Villany, in which they are so well practised: and hoping that nothing could resist their Wealth, of which they resolved to be prodigal upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, they carried their Designs so far, that she was neglected by some, and hardly used by others, from whom a greater Zeal to the Christian Religion ought to have been expected.</p>
            <p>When she seemed thus abandoned by many Christians, the <hi>Jews</hi> then hoped to have prevailed on her weakness and fears, and her Mother writ tenderly to her, to perswade her to return home again: But God left her not wholly destitute, for as he directed her to lodg in a House, where she met with all the care and tenderness she could have expected from her nearest Relations; so she was found out by that eminent and learned Convert <hi>Charles du Veil,</hi> Doctor of Divinity; who being born and bred a <hi>Jew,</hi> was first converted to the Christian Religion in <hi>France</hi>; but both he, and his most learned Brother, seeing and detesting the Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> forsook the great Advantages they had, and might have expected there, and came hither, and joined themselves to our Church. This Dr. <hi>Du Veil,</hi> remembring that word of our Saviour to St. <hi>Peter, When thou art converted, strengthen the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> made it his Business both to instruct and comfort her, and to procure the charitable Supplies and Assistances of others to her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47933:3"/>He applied himself chiefly to the Right Reverend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> as the Churchman most concerned in it, since this Convert had taken shelter in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> of which he was then Vicar: and he followed her Concerns with that Zeal that the Occasion required. And the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> being informed by him of the whole Business, has taken it into his care, with that sincere and hearty Affection which becomes a Christian, and so great a Magistrate; and is contriving the most effectual means pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, not only to do her right against her Oppressors, but also to have her possessed of a fair Estate that belongs to her in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The hazard of losing which Estate, together with both Liberty and Life, she run with chearfulness, that she might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Christian Religion. The particular account of so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a Conversion, and those things which happened upon it, I hope will be no unacceptable entertainment to the Reader; and therefore having gathered the Passages and Steps of it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon very good Authority, I now offer them to the World.</p>

            <head>THE Conversion &amp; Persecution OF ELIZABETH VERBOON.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ELizabeth Verboon</hi> carries her Christen'd Name from the Baptismal Font, and her Surname from her Husband Mr. <hi>Michael Verboon,</hi> but her Name for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was <hi>Eve Cohan</hi>: Her Father was <hi>Abraham Cohan,</hi> a Man of great Wealth and Credit, not only among the Jews in <hi>Holland,</hi> but among the <hi>Dutch:</hi> So that as <hi>Michael Levi,</hi> the Sollicitor for the Jews, informed the Lord Mayor, he was chief Governor of the Dutch Plantations in <hi>Brasile;</hi> and was then believed worth 100000 <hi>l. Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> but lost a great deal of it when the <hi>Portugueses</hi> beat the Dutch out of <hi>Brasile;</hi> yet, he said, that to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg he died worth 20000 <hi>l.</hi> or upward: He died about ten Years agoe, when this his Daughter was not twelve Years Old; who has lived ever since under her Mothers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47933:5"/>
care: Her Name was <hi>Rebekah,</hi> alias <hi>Elizabeth</hi>: She was Daughter to one <hi>Pallacius,</hi> who as this Convert had been told, was sent Ambassador from the States, and was one of the Professors in the University of <hi>Leyden. Levi</hi> knew this better than she did, and told the Lord Mayor that he was sent Ambassador, both to the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and to the King of <hi>Poland</hi>; what he professed in <hi>Leyden</hi> we do not yet know: It may be supposed, from his Negotiations, that he was a Civilian. He was a Jew in his heart, but gave himself out for a Christian: So that his Daughter, and other Children, as we are informed, were all Baptized.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Eve Cohan</hi> lived with her Mother at <hi>Delft,</hi> where one Mr. <hi>Shol,</hi> that teaches Musick, being imployed to teach her, used frequently to discourse with her of the Christian Religion: and carried her sometimes to Church, on pretence to hear the Organs play; where she staid, not only while the Psalms were singing, but all the while, both of the Sermon and Prayers: And a New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being secretly conveyed to her, she took great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in reading in it. She says, That which first made Impression on her was, that their Nation was now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed over the World, no more under the Conduct of any Prophet: Nor had they any of those visible Marks of the Favour and Protection of God, which their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors enjoyed in those Ages in which the Books of the Old Testament were written. So that they seemed cast off by God, and under these Curses threatned by <hi>Moses</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47933:5"/>
and the Prophets: and yet they kept the Laws of <hi>Moses</hi> better than ever, and were more careful than their Fathers had been to abstain from Idolatry. When she read the Account of our Saviour's Passion, she felt her self mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with that passage of <hi>Iudas</hi>'s confessing that he had betrayed Innocent Blood; and his being so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the horror of it, that he went and hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>This did first open her eyes, about two Years agoe, and from that time she was ever since disposed to become a Christian. But it coming some way to her Mothers knowledg, as she discharged the Musick-master, so she treated her very severely, and shut her up as a Prisoner near six months: and when gentler Severities were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, she threatned to poison her if she changed her Religion. So that once, for eight days together, she durst eat nothing that they gave her, till she saw others taste of it before her. She was oft beaten by her Mother, and not suffered to come to the Door, or look out at those Windows that opened to the Street, lest being in a Christian Country, she might have discovered her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to such as would have assisted her in bringing them to perfection. But that which confirmed her in the belief of Christianity, was, what she read of the Resurrection of our Saviour, of which he had given assurance to his Followers before his Sufferings; this did so effectually convince her, that He was her onely Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that she called often on him for his assistance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47933:6"/>
and direction, and resolved to dedicate her self to his Service.</p>
            <p>While she was under those Apprehensions and Fears, he that is now her Husband, Mr. <hi>Michael Verboon,</hi> then served her Eldest Brother, <hi>Iacob Cohan;</hi> he is descended of honest Parents, though but of a mean condition: He had been entertained by one of the Admiralty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> as his Servant for three Years. After that he served the Heer <hi>Waerkendam</hi> (one of the States General, who was sent Ambassador into <hi>Denmark</hi>) other three Years; and when he left his Service, he had a Certificate of his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Service, signed by his Lady, himself being then from home, bearing date the third day of <hi>May,</hi> 1679. From thence he went to serve <hi>Iacob Cohan,</hi> and staid with him nine months, and had from him a Certificate of his faithful Service, two days after he left him.</p>
            <p>There has been very great enquiry made concerning him in <hi>Holland,</hi> and all People there give a good Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him. He being in the same House with her, addressed himself to her as a Suitor for Marriage, which she for some months rejected, but at last gave him some encouragement, though no promise nor assurance; and indeed intended then no more, but to make use of his kindness to her, so far as to be conveyed, by his means, into some place of safety, where she might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger profess her self a Christian. Upon this he left her Brother's Service, and resolved to go for some time into <hi>France,</hi> and went on his way as far as <hi>Brussels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47933:6"/>She was daily in fear of her Life, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her Mother had said to her, that Mr. <hi>Honslaier,</hi> a Minister at <hi>Delft,</hi> had been with her to demand her from her, because he understood she had an inclination to turn Christian. This we have learnt from <hi>Holland</hi> was not true, but only pretended by her Mother: and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable was said by her, that she might by that Artifice draw from her Daughter the discovery of a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence she suspected might be between the Minister and her. These things made her desirous to be out of their hands; so having contrived the way of her escape, she got out of her Mothers House in the end of <hi>May;</hi> and knowing by a Letter that Mr. <hi>Verboon</hi> wrote to her, that he was still at <hi>Brussels,</hi> she went thither. But being more concerned to preserve her Life, and to save her Soul, then careful how to live, she did not so much as carry away the Jewels that were in her own possession: so far was she from robbing her Mother, or giving the rest of the Family any ground to lay those Actions on her, by which they hoped to have ruined her: though a parcel of very fair Jewels, that were her Mothers, lay so open to her very Eye, that she could easily have carried them away if she had designed it.</p>
            <p>When she saw that the Christians at <hi>Brussels</hi> worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Images, and hearing that the Christians in <hi>France</hi> were generally guilty of the same Idolatry; she resolved rather to come into <hi>England,</hi> and be Baptized in a Christian Church, that was not defiled with such Abominations:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47933:7"/>
and Mr. <hi>Verboon</hi> having been bred a Protestant, and make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her understand the difference between the two Churches, she chose to join her self to a Protestant Church. So they went to <hi>Newport,</hi> and from thence came to <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Iuly,</hi> and took Lodgings in Mr. <hi>Peter Lavignes</hi> House, a French Taylor in <hi>Bedford-bury.</hi> She carried her self there very decently and vertuously; the People of the House knew that she went oft to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Mr. <hi>Verboon</hi> and she lived like Brother and Sister to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; sometimes they went to the Dutch Church in <hi>London.</hi> The mean while she went to the Countess of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> to desire her to help her to a Service; but that good Lady knew not how to recommend her, till she had a farther account of her from other hands.</p>
            <p>On the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly, Moses Cohan,</hi> her youngest Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Samuel Vandersee</hi> her Cousen German, to whom, as it is said, her Mother intended to have married her, found her out, and took Lodgings in the same House. This made Mr. <hi>Verboon</hi> more pressing to have her marry him, fearing they might, either by force or persuasion, prevail with her to return.</p>
            <p>So on the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> they went out to <hi>Knightsbridg,</hi> with two Witnesses, and were married there, according to the form of the Church of <hi>England. Levi</hi> was not ashamed to say, before the Lord Mayor, that she was within six weeks of her time; yet she having been now ten weeks married<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> appears not to have been with Child till after her Marriage, of which she has since miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47933:7"/>
by fright, as shall be told afterwards. And her Husband with a solemn Oath declared to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Lloyd,</hi> that she kept him at a due distance ever till they were married.</p>
            <p>Her Brother brought her a Letter from her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which she charges her with no dishonest or unhandsome thing, but with many fair Offers and Promises, persuades her to abandon <hi>Verboon,</hi> and return home again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vandersee</hi> did, by many impious Blasphemies against the Person of our Blessed Saviour, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to divert her from her Resolution of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Christian.</p>
            <p>But seeng all these ways were ineffectual, they resolved to betake themselves to more desperate and mischievous ones. And for this end they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with <hi>Michael Levi,</hi> the formerly mentioned Sollicitor for the Jews; who laid the Train artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially enough to have spirited her away. He came often to the House where they were lodged, and dealt with Mistris <hi>Lavigney</hi> to help him to speak with Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi>; he offered her a Present, and made her many promises of large Rewards, both of Gold and Silver, if she would perswade her to go back to her Mother: But as Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi> could not see him, so Mistris <hi>Lavigney</hi> worthily rejected all his Offers, though he came four times to her,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47933:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hoping, by such Importunities and Bribes, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her at last. They intended first to have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested Mr. <hi>Verboon,</hi> hoping if he were once put out of the way, they might deal with his Wife more effectually: but when the Bailiffs were brought about the House, he was, by his Landladies care, conveyed out at the Window. It is plain, they have no just ground of any Action against him, for two days after he left her Brother's House, he had a discharge of his Service under his Hand and Seal, bearing date the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1680.</p>
            <p>When those two Jews had been five weeks in the same House with her, and perceived all the ways of Persuasion and Bribery were insuccessful, they then betook themselves to other Courses, in which they hoped they should succeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Levi</hi> found out two fit Tools for their purpose, one <hi>Holland</hi> a <hi>Middlesex</hi> Bailiff, and one <hi>Hammond</hi> a Serjeant, belonging to the Poultry-Counter; the former of these came sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the House where they lodged, as a Porter, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Jewish Meat to <hi>Cohan</hi> and <hi>Vandersee</hi>; by these means he was not suspected, and so found an opportunity to execute a Warrant upon Master <hi>Verboon,</hi> under the name of <hi>Eve Cohan,</hi> on the first of <hi>September,</hi> for forty pound, at the Suit of her Mother. There was Bail presently offered, by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47933:8"/>
the procurement of the Landlord and his Wife: The Bailiff seemed willing to accept it, but <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> had learned his Lesson better; and pretended he must needs carry her to the Under-Sheriffs Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> and so hurried her into a Coach, into which <hi>Hammond</hi> went with him: but Mistris <hi>Lavigne</hi> thrust her self also in with them to see what should be done with Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi>: and those who offered to bail her, followed them to the Sheriffs Office.</p>
            <p>All the while that this was doing, <hi>Levi,</hi> the principal Contriver, was standing at some distance, to see the issue of the Plot he had so skilfully laid, and carried himself, as if he had known nothing of it, but asked one, for what was that disturbance? the Woman he spake to, perceiving he was a Jew, treated him with the Indignation that such a Provocation seemed almost to justify; and he fearing some violent effects of it, ran away. But <hi>Holland</hi> the Bailiff, instead of carrying his Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Sheriffs Office, where those that went to be Bail, staied some hours in vain expecting them, ordered the Coachman to drive within the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>London,</hi> and then discharged her of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest he had her under, and immediately <hi>Hammond</hi> took out his Mace, and arrested her for 2000 <hi>l.</hi> at her Mothers Suit, and so carried her into <hi>London.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:47933:9"/>
It was in vain to tell them, that she being married, and under Covert-barr, was liable to no Arrest for Debts; for though the Certificate of the Marriage was shewed them, they who had other Instructions from <hi>Levi,</hi> resolved to finish the Project he had laid: which, as <hi>Hammond</hi> then declared, was for carrying her away into <hi>Holland.</hi> And <hi>Levi</hi> confessed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, before the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> that he had employed <hi>Hammond</hi> to Arrest her. When the Coachman had driven to the Rose Tavern near the <hi>Poultry</hi> Counter, <hi>Hammond</hi> had a mind to make Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris <hi>Verboon</hi> to go up two pair of Stairs; but she was in such a fright, and trembled so, that she sat down in the first Floor; and there Mistris <hi>Lavigne</hi> began to open the Business to some Company that was in the Rome: but <hi>Hammond,</hi> in a great rage, called the Drawer, and made him drag her out of the Room; and then going up one pair of Stairs higher, he went about to persuade her to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and go home in quiet, for, said he, Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi> should not go to Prison, but lodg in his House, where she should be well used: and told her, that <hi>Levi</hi> had emploied him in this Business, who never undertook any Affair in which he did not succeed.</p>
            <p>But finding she still persisted in her resolution of assisting of Mistris <hi>Verboon,</hi> and of bringing some
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47933:9"/>
to Bail her, he threatned her that she should never be paid what was owing her, and that she and her Husband both, should come into great trouble and danger, by medling further in it; but if she would make no more noise, she should not only be paid, but well rewarded.</p>
            <p>All these had no effect on her, so a Person she had sent for coming to them, he forced <hi>Hammond</hi> to carry her to the Counter; for they knew well the design of carrying her to the Serjeants-House, was only that she might be conveyed away more secretly.</p>
            <p>She being lodged in the Prison, Master <hi>Lavigne</hi> fearing that the Jews might have taken her out of Prison, set some to keep constant watch before the Counter Gate; and after two days entred an Action of 500 <hi>l.</hi> against her, that so she might not come out without his knowledg; and lest the Jews should have brought some to have bailed her out, that so they might get her into their Power; he continued his Watch there [employing some, on whom he knew their Bribes would have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence] several Nights before the Counter Gate. There was need of all this Caution, when the Jews were so cruelly set on the poor Womans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and had found out such fit Instruments
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47933:10"/>
for their ends. She knew what she was to expect if she fell in their hands, for <hi>Vandersee</hi> had told her, That if she proved with Child in their hands, she should see it when delivered of it, but never more: but she had reason to look for further Effects of their enraged Cruelty, if they had her once in their Power. And that those, whose Ancestors in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, had with so bloody a Malice crucified our Blessed Saviour, would have spared no invention of Mischief, to execute their Revenge on one, that was now resolved to believe in Him.</p>
            <p>But so zealous was <hi>Hammond</hi> to serve the Jews in this Plot, that seeing Mistris <hi>Lavigne</hi> was like to raise a great stir about it, and that neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, nor Threatnings, nor Violence, could work on her; for he found the calling of her <hi>Witch, Bawd,</hi> and such other base Names, and the beating her, and pulling her by the Hair of the Head, could not deliver him from her Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities; he thereupon contrived another way to frighten her, or to have her torn in pieces by the People.</p>
            <p>It is probable that <hi>Levi</hi> contrived this also, for both he and the other Jews came oft and drank with <hi>Hammond</hi> at the Rose Tavern: but whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever contrived it, this way <hi>Hammond</hi> took; The
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47933:10"/>
next time he saw her, he cried out, <hi>A Papist Bitch, a harbourer of Iesuits;</hi> though it is notoriously known, that both she and her Husband have been always good Protestants: with this Out-cry he brought many together; who if her Sister had not been there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and brought some Friends to rescue her out of their Hands, had very probably done her much mischief.</p>
            <p>But the poor Prisoner, who now seemed in a forlorn state, was not forsaken of him, to whose Service she was resolved to dedicate her self. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris <hi>Lavigne</hi> had brought Dr. <hi>du Veil</hi> to her while she lay at her House, as the fittest Person to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct her, having been himself of that Religion. He waited on her every day during her Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and comforted her much in her Afflictions: for these were the Pledges of her being to Reign with Christ, since she now suffered for him. He took care also of providing such Supplies as her Necessities called for.</p>
            <p>And above all the rest of the good Offices he did her, he acquainted the Lord Bishop of St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph</hi> with the Matter, in whose Parish this Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was lodged, when she was so violently and fraudulently carried out of it; He had been out of Town when she was taken, but coming to it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47933:11"/>
the next day, he set about it with all that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and zeal which the occasion required.</p>
            <p>But now the Jews finding their Prisoner was under such a Protection, betook themselves to more Artificial Methods; and knowing that there was no ground, neither for the Action of 40 nor of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> let these fall the next Court day, and brought two new Actions, one of 500 <hi>l.</hi> at the Suit of <hi>Vandersee,</hi> and the other of 200 <hi>l.</hi> for Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Provision at her Mothers Suit; and they entertained my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Scroggs</hi> his Son to be their Counsel.</p>
            <p>A Reverend Divine had informed my Lord Chief Justice of the Affair, who ordered a hearing of the Business before himself at his House, on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi>: where because Bishop <hi>Lloyd</hi> could not then attend, he sent Mr. <hi>Tissar</hi> to appear for Mistris <hi>Verboon.</hi> When they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Vandersee,</hi> with <hi>Hammond,</hi> being on the one side, were called up Stairs, for what end is not known: but after a little stay they came down, and soon after my Lord Chief Justice came out, and said, he was in haste, and must go to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and so could not hear it: but he very mildly said, <q>He saw the thing was a Trick, and that <hi>Hammond</hi> had been abused; but he bad him go from him, to the Judg of the Sheriffs Court, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47933:11"/>
tell him, he perceived it was a Cheat.</q> This was all could be obtained for him. So the poor Christian Complainants went away, as much cast down, as the Jews were lifted up with this great Success.</p>
            <p>On the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> the Trial for <hi>Vander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see</hi>'s pretended Debt was brought into the Sheriffs Court, where Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi>'s Attorney, Mr. <hi>Cross</hi> of <hi>Woodstreet,</hi> though he knew of her Marriage, yet pleaded <hi>non Assumpsit.</hi> So the Witnesses were ordered to be summoned to the next Court Day; which was the 9<hi>th,</hi> and then the Trial was put off till <hi>Saturday.</hi> Then the Jews had obtained a <hi>Leve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> for removing it to the Lord Mayor's Court, for a further delay: but the Lord Mayor being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed rightly of the Matter, by that worthy Gentleman Mr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> the Common Serjeant, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently signed a <hi>Remandetur,</hi> by which the Business was turned back to the Sheriffs Court; for the Jews had such a good acceptance with the Lord Chief Justice, that they hoped now to have wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the poor Prisoner out with Vexatious Suits and Delays.</p>
            <p>The Common Serjeant did also most worthily Bail her, on the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September:</hi> So being at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, she resolved to delay her Profession of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47933:12"/>
Christian Religion no longer, having been now as it were initiated into it by the Cross which she had born so long.</p>
            <p>Yet the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> resolved to delay it till he got a return to a Letter he wrote to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the English Congregation at the <hi>Hague,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring him and Mr. <hi>Swanswick</hi> (a Learned Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate there, with whom he had made an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when he waited on her Highness the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Orange</hi> into <hi>Holland)</hi> to inform themselves of as many Particulars as they could learn concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi> and her Husband: and having received a long and full Answer from the Minister to whom he wrot, he perceived it had been known in <hi>Delft,</hi> by the means of the Musick-master, that this Convert was enclined to be a Christian; that she had been sometimes at Church to hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; that she used often to read the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and that her Mother had treated her barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously; but the Ministers had not demanded her, as her Mother had said to her.</p>
            <p>So that was a piece of the Mothers Craft, to fish out of her Daughter what Correspondence there might have been between them and her: and for Mr. <hi>Verboon,</hi> they had a good Character given of him by all that knew him; only the angry Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accused him of some ill things; but the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47933:12"/>
of his Service two days after he left the House, shews these were all Calumnies. And in a word, the Bishop found that every thing that Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi> had told him, proved to be true: So having used this Caution, which the many Cheats of pretended Converts had made more necessary, he resolved to Baptise her into the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and left the particular care of instructing her on Dr. <hi>du Veil,</hi> who had of his own accord travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led much in it, and had followed all her Concerns with a very tender Care and assiduous Zeal.</p>
            <p>But though she was bailed out of Prison, yet she was not delivered from the Persecutions of her Family. They knew well she had stollen nothing from her Mother, and that she owed her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, her Mother ows her her Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which by <hi>Levy</hi>'s own account, will rise to above 2500 <hi>l.</hi> And he also said, That her Mother had offered her to him with 3000 <hi>l.</hi> Portion in present, and more after her ovvn Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vandersee,</hi> when he was before my Lord Chief Justice, pretended, that all he did was on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Account, and that Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted so much to her in Mony. But novv in the Sheriffs Court, <hi>Vandersee</hi> sued for a Debt pretended
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47933:13"/>
to be due to himself. Her Marriage was proved in Court, by the Oath of the Minister, the Clark, and two Witnesses; but all that went for nothing, the Attorney having made another Plea. But then for the pretended Debt, no Evidence was brought, but her Brother <hi>Moses;</hi> and he could speak no English, but as <hi>Smith</hi> his Interpreter swore: he said, upon his Oath, that he saw <hi>Vandersee</hi> lend her four Duccatoons at Mr. <hi>Lavigne</hi>'s House, which comes to about two and twenty Shillings English Mony: So now all the Actions of 40, 2000, 500<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 200 <hi>l.</hi> upon which they had so long vexed and imprisoned her, dwindled into this small Debt; which the Jews knew, if it had been due, they could have had it any time for the asking. But so <hi>impartially</hi> did the Jury proceed in this Verdict, that upon this single Evidence, and he manifestly a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Conspiracy, and swearing on an English Bible, which they count a prophane Book, and on the back side of it too, which Dr. <hi>du Veil</hi> told them was no Oath by the Jews Doctrine; yet upon this Evidence they cast Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi>; so that after all other Rigours, Costs of the Suit were to come on her, according to our Law; which the Judg of the Court set at 40 <hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:47933:13"/>From all this it is apparent, that the whole Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was a Conspiracy of the Jews, of which <hi>Levi</hi> vvas the chief Contriver, and <hi>Hammond</hi> the main Instrument, though the Lord Chief Justice was so favourable to him, as to say, He was abused in that matter, and drawn into it. Both of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed their Joy, not vvithout some transport, vvhen the Jury gave their Verdict. <hi>Levi</hi> said, He would give 500 <hi>l.</hi> on condition she had not been bailed: <hi>Hammond</hi> said to those vvho had depended much on the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s Assistance, <hi>Where is your Lord now?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Verboon</hi> vvas advised to Arrest <hi>Vandersee</hi> for the false Imprisonment of his Wife; and on the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> he Arrested him in an Action of 200 <hi>l.</hi> vvhich vvas not out of reason; but very modest for one that had suffered so many Arrests for such great Sums, and all for nothing: but <hi>Levi</hi> soon bailed him; and so prevalent vvere the Arts and Presents of the Jews, that it vvas entred in the Books but 20 <hi>l.</hi> So that vvhether they are Plantiffs or Complainants, they are resolved to shew their skill; and perhaps have a secret Pleasure to let the World see how much their Practices can vvork on those vvho are called Christians; even in a Matter vvherein the honour of Jesus Christ is so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47933:14"/>But the Malice of the <hi>Iews</hi> stopt not her, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi> vvas by her Marriage covered from all their Suits, they resolved on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvay, vvhich looks like a Design to destroy her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Levi</hi> had said before my Lord Mayor, that she vvas vvithin two months of her time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not but believe she vvas vvith Child, and very capable of being frighted into Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
            <p>But it vvas a sure effect of their Revenge on her Husband, against vvhom <hi>Vandersee</hi> had expressed so much malice, that he hath often said he vvas resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to kill him, though he should be hanged for it. So on the second of <hi>October,</hi> Mr. <hi>Verboon</hi> vvas Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested in an Action of 200 <hi>l.</hi> and it appears that the Bailiffs vvere again instructed to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves vvith more than ordinary rudeness: one of them vvas <hi>Benedict Helm</hi>; there vvere others vvhose Names are not known. They came at Dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, vvhen they might expect to find them at Dinner together: they seized upon him at Table, and dragged him forth vvith their utmost violence; vvhich vvhen Mistris <hi>Lavigne</hi> saw, and vvithal took notice of a Coach at the Door, she immediately reflected on the Trick that they had put on them before: and therefore ran to him, and clasped her
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47933:14"/>
Arms about his Waste, to keep him from being thrust into the Coach. The Bailiffs, to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on her, beat and bruised her Head, Brest, and Body, vvith the greatest fury; of vvhich the marks appear yet on her: Her Head vvas broke in three places, and she vvas thereby, as the Chyrurgeon has certified under his hand, in great hazard of her Life: yet she clogged them so, that they could not get their Prisoner into the Coach; and the People beginning to come about them, they were fain to thrust him into an Alehouse near at hand: from whence she presently sent an Advertisement to the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph.</hi> Upon his coming, and offering the Bailiffs Bail, they saw it in vain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing farther, and so accepted the Bail. But though Mrs. <hi>Lavigne</hi> was forced to keep her Bed some time, by the Wounds and Bruises she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet this had a more fatal effect on poor Mistris <hi>Verboon</hi>; who when she saw the Bailiffs draging her Husband, fell presently in a swoon; and being then young with Child, was so disordered by the fright, that she has not yet recovered it; but on the 9<hi>th</hi> day after she miscarried. The Midwife, and others that were with her, are ready to declare upon Oath, that the Conception had been some days dead, and wasted within her; and that it was not above eight or nine weeks old, though she had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47933:15"/>
been eleven weeks married. So false was that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which <hi>Levi</hi> cast on her before the Lord Mayor, that she was within two months of her time. How far the Law will charge this on the Bailiffs, or on the Jews that set them on to it, I do not know; but sure I am, they are in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree guilty of Murder before God. When all these Effects of the Malice and Industry of the Jews had appeared so evidently, the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> who had before acquainted the Lord Mayor with the Business, having received the Answer formerly mentioned from <hi>Holland,</hi> did then, with more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, desire his assistance in this Affair, in which the Honour of the Christian Religion, and of the English Nation, was so much concerned.</p>
            <p>The Lord Mayor did thereupon send for <hi>Levi,</hi> to hear what he could say for the defence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and of his Countrymen: who made some pretended excuses for himself, as if he had not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Matter at all; but he did not deny that he believed the Design of the Jews was to force Mrs. <hi>Verboon</hi> to go back to her Mother, who he acknowledged was a severe and cruel Woman. By his own Story, the Lord Mayor perceived clearly what a malicious Contrivance this whole prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mrs. <hi>Verboon</hi> and her Husband had been; and told <hi>Levi,</hi> very roundly, that they should soon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47933:15"/>
see what a thing they had done, who finding shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Christian Country, and being so obnoxious to the Law as they all were, durst offer such an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the Religion, and to the Nation, as thus to endeavour to Spirit away one, to whose charge they could lay nothing, but her turning Christian. This he assured him should be carried so far, as to reach their whole Congregation. There was no way to redeem them from trouble, but for them to bring over her Portion from her Mother, and to satisfy her to the full for the Costs and Trouble to which they had put her: And if they did not do that, he assured him, he would carry the Matter as far as the Law would allow him against their whole Sect: and though his time was near an end, yet he knew his Successour would pursue it with the same vigour, with which he was resolved to begin. He gave also order to some to bring him an Extract of the Laws in force against the Jews. And for <hi>Hammond,</hi> no doubt he will be made an Example for his impious Conspiracy with the Enemies of Christ, against one for turning to him, which was the only root of all the malice they bore her.</p>
            <p>This Matter being thus put in a fair way, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop resolved to receive her into the Christian Church by Baptism. He gave the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Sir <hi>Lionel Ienkins,</hi> one of his Majesty's
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47933:16"/>
principal Secretaries of State, an account of all the steps of this Affair; who as he has expressed in his whole Life a true &amp; sincere love to the Christian Religion; to which he has been an Ornament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by the gravity and strictness of his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in all those high Employments in which he has behaved himself with so much Honour; So he received the Bishop's Information of this Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Persecution, with that sense which might have been expected from so good and so great a Man. He offered, not only all the assistance which he could give her in his Office, or at the Council-Board, when the Matter should be brought thither; but concerned himself so particularly in it, as to be her Susceptor in Baptism; and those two most Religious and Devout Ladies, the Countesses of <hi>Thanet</hi> and <hi>Clarendon</hi> very readily took upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be her Godmothers. So on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> after Evening Prayers, she was Baptized in St. <hi>Martins</hi> Church in the Fields. She has since said, that she felt an unusual Joy in her Mind, when she was initiated to Christianity, having now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vvhat she had long purposed and vvished to do: and though she saw a Jew in the Church, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and laughing at her in the very time, this did not a vvhit disorder her But as it may be supposed, her inward and vehement desire of <hi>Baptism</hi> might
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47933:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have supported her till that was over; so the Night after it, those Frights and Disorders she had been put in formerly, chiefly that last vvhen her Husband vvas Arrested, brought pains on her, vvhich ended in an Abortion, as vvas formerly told.</p>
            <p>This Recital was thought necessary, to let the Nation see what a sort of People these Jews are, whom we harbour so kindly among us; who, as they yet lie under the guilt of that Innocent Blood, which their Fathers wished might rest on them and their Children: so continue not only in their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Infidelity, but do still thirst after the Blood of such of their Nation as believe in Him whom their Fathers Crucified; and whom they in derision cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led often to this Convert that <hi>hanged Man.</hi> He was indeed hanged on a Tree by the Jews of his Time, but they themselves knew then that He rose from the Dead, and so triumphed over all that Hell or hellish Men had contrived: and tho they hired the Souldiers, that first saw Him rising out of the Grave, to suppress so dreadful a Truth, as his Resurrection must needs have been to them, yet it broke out with such undeniable Evidence, that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
