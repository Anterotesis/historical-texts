            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SEeing the Providence of God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth theſe plain Diſcourſes, I ſhall hope
(upon Experience of his dealing in the like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
with me) that he hath ſome work for them
to do in the World. Who knows but they were
intended for the ſaving of thy Soul, by opening
thine Eyes, and awaking thee from thy Sin, who
art now in reading of them! Be it known to thee
it is the certain Truth of God, and of high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
to thy Soul that they treat of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
require thy moſt ſober Conſideration. Thou
haſt in them (how weakly ſoever managed by
me) an Advantage put into thy Hand from God,
to help thee in the greateſt Work in the World,
even to prepare for the great approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not to ſlight Chriſt and his Goſpel.
In the Name of God, I require thee caſt not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
this Advantage: Turn not away thine Ears
or Heart from this warning that is ſent to thee
from the living God! Seeing all the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep thee from Judgment, let not all the
World be able to keep thee from a ſpeedy and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preparation for it. Do it preſently, leſt God
come before thou art ready. Do it ſeriouſly, leſt
the Tempter over-reach thee, and thou ſhouldſt

you go, conſider what you read, and pray to the
Lord to help it to thy Heart, and to aſſiſt thee
in the Practice, that it may not riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2 Cor. 5. 10, 11.</bibl>
               <q>For we muſt all appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, that every
one may receive the things done in his Body,
according to that he hath done, whether it be

            <p>IT is not unlikely that ſome of thoſe Wits that are
taken more with things new than with things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
will marvel that I chooſe ſo common a
Subject, and tell me that they all know this alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
But I do it purpoſely upon theſe following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.
1. Becauſe I well know it is theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Truths that are the great and neceſſary things which
Mens everlaſting Happineſs or Miſery doth moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon. You may be ignorant of many Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eriour Points, without the Danger of your
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouls, but ſo you cannot of theſe Fundamentals.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Becauſe it's apparent by the Lives of Men, that few
know theſe common Truths ſavingly, that think they
know them. 3. Becauſe there are ſeveral Degrees of
knowing the ſame Truths, and the beſt are imperfect in
Degree; the principal Growth in Knowledg that we
ſhould look after, is not to know <hi>more</hi> Matters than: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:63044:4"/>
knew before, but to know <hi>that better</hi> and with a clearer
Light and firmer Apprehenſion, which we da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kly and
ſlightly knew before. You may more ſafely be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>any</hi> Knowledg at all of many lower Truths, than
without <hi>ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arther Degree</hi> of the Knowledg of thoſe
which you already know. 4. Beſides, it is known by
ſad Experience, that many periſh who know the Truth,
for want of the Conſideration of it, and making uſe
of what they know, and ſo their Knowledg doth but
condemn them. We have as much need therefore to
teach and help you to get theſe Truths which you
know, into your Hearts and Lives, as to tell you more.
5. And indeed, it is the Impreſſion of theſe great and
Maſter-Truths, wherein the Vitals and Eſſentials of
God's Image upon the Soul of Man doth conſiſt: and
it is theſe Truths that are the very Inſtruments of the
great Works that are to be done upon the Heart by the
Spirit and our ſelves. In the right uſe of theſe it is
that the principal Part of the Skill and holy Wiſdom
of a Chriſtian doth conſiſt; and in the diligent and
conſtant Uſe of theſe lieth the Life and Trade of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.
There is nothing amiſs in Mens Hearts or
Lives, but is for want of ſound Knowing and Believing,
or well uſing theſe Fundamentals. 6. And moreover,
methinks in this Choice of my Subject, I may expect
this Advantage with the Hearers, that I may ſpare that
Labour that elſe would be neceſſary for the Proof of
my Doctrine: and that I may alſo have eaſier Acceſs
to your Hearts, and have a ſuller Stroak at them, and
with leſs Reſiſtance. If I came to tell you of any thing
not Common, I know not how far I might expect Belief
from you. You might ſay, <hi>Theſe things are uncertain to
us, or all Men are not of this Mind.</hi> But when every
Hearer confeſſeth the Truth of my Doctrine, and no
Man can deny it, without denying Chriſtianity it ſelf;
I hope I may expect that your Hearts ſhould the ſooner
receive the Impreſſion of this Doctrine, and the ſooner
yield to the Duties it directs you to, and the eaſier
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63044:4"/>
let go the Sins which from ſo certain a Truth ſhall be
diſcovered.</p>
            <p>The Words of my Text, are the Reaſon which the
Apoſtle giveth both of his perſwading other Men to the
Fear of God, and his Care to approve to God his
own Heart and Life. They contain the Aſſertion and
Deſcription of the Great Judgment, and one Uſe which
he makes of it. It aſſureth us that judged we <hi>muſt be,</hi>
and <hi>who</hi> muſt be ſo judged, and <hi>by whom,</hi> and <hi>about
what,</hi> and <hi>on what Terms,</hi> and <hi>to what End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning of the Words, ſo far as is neceſſary,
I ſhall give you briefly. <hi>We all,</hi> both we Apoſtles that
preach the Goſpel, and you that hear it, <hi>muſt,</hi> willing
or unwilling, there is no avoiding it, <hi>appear,</hi> ſtand forth,
or make your appearance, and there have your Hearts
and Ways laid open, and appear as well as we. <hi>Before
the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> i. e. before the Redeemer of
the World, to be judged by him as our Rightful Lord.
<hi>That every one,</hi> even of all Mankind, which are, were, or
ſhall be, without Exception; <hi>may receive,</hi> that is, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his Sentence, adjudging him to his due; and then
may receive the Execution of the Sentence, and may go
from the Bar with that Reward or Puniſhment that is his
due according to the Law by which he is judged. <hi>The
things done in his Body,</hi> that is, the due Reward of the
Works done in his Body; or as ſome Copies read it,
<hi>The things proper to the Body,</hi> i. e. due to the Man, even
Body as well as Soul, <hi>according to what he hath done, whether
it be Good or Bad;</hi> i. e. this is the Cauſe to be tried and
judged, whether Men have done well or ill, whilſt
they were in the Fleſh, and what is due to them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Deeds. <hi>Knowing therefore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certain therefore that theſe Things are ſo, and that
ſuch a terrible Judgment of Chriſt will come, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
Men to become Chriſtians and live as ſuch, that
they may then ſpeed well, when others ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
or as others, <hi>Knowing the Fear of the Lord,</hi> that is,
the true Religion, <hi>we perſwade Men.</hi>

               </gap>heſe particular Heads we contain the whole Doctrine of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his Judgment, and in this more familiar Method ſhall

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>andle it.</p>
            <p>I. For the firſt Judgment, as taken <hi>largely,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
all the ſorementioned Particulars; as taken
more <hi>ſtrictly</hi> for the Act of the Judg, it is <hi>the Trial of a
controverted Caſe.</hi> In our Caſe note theſe things following.</p>
            <p>1. God's Judgment is not intended for any Diſcovery
to himſelf of what he knows not already, he knows al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
that all Men are, and what they have done, and
what is their Due: But it is to diſcover to others and
to Men themſelves the ground of his Sentence, that
ſo his Judgment may attain its End, for the glorifying
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his Grace on the Righteous, and for the convincing the
Wicked of their Sin and Deſert, and to ſhew to all the
World the Righteouſneſs of the Judg, and of his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and Execution. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4, 26. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>2. It is not a Controverſy therefore undecided
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in the Mind of God, that is there to be decided; but
only one that is undecided, as to the Knowledg and
Mind of Creatures.</p>
            <p>3. Yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not this Judgment <hi>a bare Declaration,</hi> but
<hi>a Deciſion,</hi> and ſo <hi>a Declaration</hi> thereupon: the Cauſe
will be then put out of Controverſy, and all farther
Expectation of Deciſion be at an End; and with the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
there will be no more Accuſation, and with the
Condemned no more Hope for ever.</p>
            <p>II. For the ſecond Thing, who ſhall be the Judg;
I anſwer, The Judg is <hi>God himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63044:6"/>
1. Principally, God as Creator.</p>
            <p>2. As alſo, God as Redeemer; the humane Nature
of Jeſus Chriſt having a derived ſubordinate Power. God
loſt not his Right to his Creature either by Man's Fall,
or the Redemption by Chriſt, but by the latter hath
a new farther Right: but it is in and by Chriſt that God
judgeth: For as <hi>meer Creator of innocent Man,</hi> God
judgeth none, but hath committed all Judgment to the
Son, who hath procured this Right by the redeeming
of fallen Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. But as the Son only doth
it in the neareſt Senſe, ſo the Father as Creator doth it
remotely and principally.</p>
            <p>1. In that the Power of the Son is derived from the
Father, and ſo ſtandeth in Subordination to him as
Fountain or Efficient.</p>
            <p>2. In that the Judgment of the Son (as alſo his
whole Mediatorſhip) is to bring Men to God their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
as their ultimate End, and recover them to him
from whom they are faln; and ſo as a Means to that
End, the Judgment of the Son is ſubordinate to the
Father.</p>
            <p>From hence you may ſee theſe following Truths wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
your Conſideration.</p>
            <p>1. That all Men are God's Creatures, and none are
the Workmanſhip of themſelves or any other; or elſe
the Creator ſhould not judg them on that Right.</p>
            <p>2. That Chriſt died for All, and is the Redeemer of
the World, and a Sacrifice for All, or elſe he ſhould
not judg them on that Right. For he will not judg
Wicked Men as he will do the Devils, as the <hi>meer
Enemies</hi> of his Redeemed Ones, but as being themſelves
his Subjects in the World, and being bought by him,
and therefore become his own, who ought to
have glorified him that bought them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15.
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9.
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>3. Hence it appeareth that all Men were under ſome
Law of Grace, and did partake of ſome of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63044:6"/>
Mercy. Tho the Goſpel came not to all, yet all

            </p>
            <p>4. If God will be the Judg, then none can expect
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y any Shifts or Indirect Means to eſcape at that Day.
For how ſhould it be?</p>
            <p>1. It is not poſſible that any ſhould keep out of
<hi>Sight,</hi> or hide their Sin and the Evil of their Actions,
and ſo delude the Judg: God will not be mocked now,
nor deceived then, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7. they groſly deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that imagine any ſuch thing: God muſt be Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>cient
and All-ſeeing, or he cannot be God. Should you

               </gap>ide your Cauſe from Men and from Devils, and be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it your ſelves, yet cannot you hide it from God.
Never did there a Thought paſs thy Heart, or a Word
paſs thy Mouth, which God was not acquainted with:
and as he knows them, ſo doth he obſerve them. He
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s not as imperſect Man, taken up with other Buſineſs,
ſo that he cannot mind <hi>All.</hi> As eaſy is it with him t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
obſerve every Thought, or Word, or Action of thine,
as if he had but <hi>that one</hi> in the World to obſerve; and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s eaſy to obſerve each particular Sinner, as if he had
not another Creature to look after in the World. He is
a Fool indeed that thinks now that God takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 12. and 9. 9. or that thinketh
then to eſcape in the Croud: He that found out one Gueſt
that had not on a Wedding-Garment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 12. will
then find out every unholy Soul, and give him ſo ſad a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation
as ſhall make him ſpeechleſs. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 11. <hi>For he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63044:7"/>
knoweth vain Man; be ſeech Wickedneſs alſo,</hi> and <hi>will be
not conſider it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is not poſſible that any ſhould eſcape at that
Day by any Tricks of Wit and falſe Reaſoning in their
own Defence. God knoweth a ſound Anſwer from an
unſound, and a Truth from a Lie. Righteouſneſs may be
perverted here on Earth, by out-witting the Judg; but
ſo will it not be then. To hope any of this, is to hope
that God will not be God. It is in vain then for the
<hi>unholy</hi> Man to ſay he is <hi>holy;</hi> or for any Sinner to deny,
or excuſe, or extenuate his Sin; to bring forth the
Counterfeit of any Grace, and plead with God any
Shells of hypocritical Performances, and to think to
prove a Title to Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by any thing ſhort of God's
Condition: all theſe will be vain Attempts.</p>
            <p>3. And as impoſſible will it prove by Fraud or Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
by Perſwaſion or Bribery, or by any other Means,
to pervert Juſtice by turning the Mind of God who
is the Judg: Fraud and Flattery, Bribery and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
may do much with weak Men, but with God
they will do nothing. Were he changeable and partial,
he were not God.</p>
            <p>4. If God be Judg, you may ſee the Cavils of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
are fooliſh, when they ask, <hi>How long will God
be in trying and judging ſo many Perſons, and taking an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſo many Words, and Thoughts, and Deeds? Sure it
will be a long Time, and a difficult Work.</hi> As if God were
as Man that knoweth not things till he ſeek out their
Evidence by particular Signs. Let theſe Foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if they have any Underſtanding, that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
God can ſhew to every Man at once, all the
Thoughts, and Words, and Actions that ever he hath
been guilty of. And in the twink of an Eye, even at
one view, can make all the World to ſee their Ways and
their Deſervings, cauſing their Conſciences and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to preſent them all before them in ſuch a ſort, as
ſhall be equivalent to a verbal Debate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21, 22.
he will ſet them in Order before them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:63044:7"/>
5. If Jeſus Chriſt be the Judg, then what a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
muſt it needs be to his Members, that he ſhall be
Judg that loved them to the Death, and whom they
loved above their Lives, and he who was their Rock of
Hope and Strength, and the Deſire and Delight of their
Souls!</p>
            <p>6. And if Jeſus Chriſt muſt be the Judg, what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
will it bring to the Faces of his Enemies, and
of all that ſet light by him in the Day of their Viſitation?
to ſee Mercy turned againſt them, and he that died for
them now ready to condemn them, and that Blood
and Grace which did aggravate their Sin, to be pleaded
againſt them to the Increaſe of their Miſery: How ſad
will this be?</p>
            <p>7. If the God of Love, and Grace, and Truth, be
Judg, then no Man need to fear any Wrong. No Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety
of the Accuser, nor Darkneſs of Evidence; no
Prejudice or Partiality, or whatſoever elſe may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
can there appear to the Wrong of your Cauſe.
Get a good Cauſe and fear nothing: and if your Cauſe
be bad, nothing can deliver you.</p>
            <p>III. For the third Point, <hi>Who are they that muſt be
judged?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All the rational Creatures in this lower World.
And it ſeems Angels alſo, either <hi>all</hi> or <hi>ſome:</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Caſe is more darkly made known to us, and
leſs concerns us, we will paſs it by. Every Man that
hath been made or born on Earth (except Chriſt, who
is God and Man, and is the Judg) muſt be judged. If
any fooliſh Infidels ſhall ſay, <hi>Where ſhall ſo great a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſtand?</hi> I anſwer him, That he knoweth not the things
Inviſible; either the Nature of Spirits and ſpiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
nor what Place containeth them, or <hi>how;</hi> but
eaſily he may know that he that gave them all a Being,
can ſuſtain them all, and have room for them all,
and can at once diſcloſe the Thoughts of all, as I ſaid
before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:63044:8"/>
The firſt in Order to be judged are the Saints,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. and then with Chriſt they ſhall judg the
reſt of the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3. not in an equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Commiſſion with Chriſt, but as the preſent
Approvers of his righteous Judgment. The Princes
of the Earth ſhall ſtand then before Chriſt even as the
Peaſants, and the Honourable as the Baſe; the Rich
and the Poor ſhall meet together, and the Lord ſhall
judg them all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 2. No Men ſhall be excuſed
from ſtanding at that Bar, and giving up their Account,
and receiving their Doom. Learned and unlearned,
young and old, godly and ungodly, all muſt ſtand there.
I know ſome have vainly imagined that the Righteous
ſhall not have any of their Sins mentioned, but their
Graces and Duties only; but they conſider not that
things will not then be tranſacted by Words as we do
now, but by clear Diſcoveries by the infinite Light;
and that if God ſhould not diſcover to them their Sins,
he would not diſcover the Riches of his Grace in
the Pardon of all theſe Sins: even then they muſt
be humbled in themſelves that they may be glorified,
and for ever cry, Not unto us Lord, but unto thy
Name be the Glory.</p>
            <p>IV. For the fourth Particular, <hi>Who will be the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Satan is called in Scripture the Accuſer of
the Prethren, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 10. and we find in <hi>Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1.
and other Places, that now he doth practiſe it even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: and therefore we judg it probable that he
will do ſo then. But we would determine of nothing
that Scripture hath not clearly determined.</p>
            <p>2. Conſcience will be an Accuſer, though eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the Wicked, yet in ſome ſenſe of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us,
for it will tell the Truth to all; and therefore ſo
far as Men are faulty, it will tell them of their Faults.
The Wicked it will accuſe of unpardoned Sin, and of
Sin unrepented of; the Godly only of Sin repented of and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63044:8"/>
pardoned. It will be a Glaſs wherein every Man: may
ſee the Face of his Heart and former Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.
15.</p>
            <p>3. The Judg himſelf will be the principal Accuſer;
for it is he that is wronged, and he that proſecutes the
Cauſe, and will do Juſtice on the Wicked. God judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
even the Righteous themſelves to be Sinners, or
elſe they could not be pardoned Sinners. But he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Wicked to be impenitent, unbelieving, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
Sinners. Remember what I ſaid before,
that it is not a verbal Accuſation, but an opening of the
Truth of the Cauſe to the view of our ſelves and others,
that God will then perform.</p>
            <p>Nor can any think it unworthy of God to be Mens
Accuſer by ſuch a Diſcloſure, it being no Diſhonour to
the pureſt Light to reveal a Dunghil, or to the greateſt
Prince to accuſe a Traitor. Nor is it unmeet that God
ſhould be both Accuſer and Judg, ſeeing he is both abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Lord, and perfectly Juſt, and ſo far beyond all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition
of Injuſtice. His Law alſo doth virtually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 45. but of this by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>V. For the fifth Particular, <hi>How will the Sinners be
called to the Bar?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God will not ſtand to ſend them a Citation,
nor require them to make their voluntary Appearance:
but willing or unwilling he will bring them in.</p>
            <p>1. Before each Man's particular Judgment, he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Death to call away his Soul, a ſurly Serjeant that
will have no Nay: How dear ſoever this World may
be to Men, and how loth ſoever they are to depart,
away they muſt, and come before the Lord that made
them; Death will not be bribed. Every Man that was
ſet in the Vineyard in the Morning of their Lives, muſt
be called out at Evening to receive according to what
he hath done: then muſt the naked Soul alone appear
before its Judg, and be accountable for all that was done
in the Body, and be ſent before till the final Judgment
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63044:9"/>
to remain in Happineſs or Miſery, till the Body be raiſed
again and joined to it.</p>
            <p>In this Appearance of the Soul before God, it.
ſeemeth by Scripture, that there is ſome Miniſtry of
Angels; for <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22. it is ſaid that the Angels
carried <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that is, his Soul, into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.
What local Motion there is, or Situation of
Souls, is no fit Matter for the Enquiry of Mortals; and
what it is in this that the Angels will do, we cannot
clearly underſtand as yet; but moſt certain it is, that
as ſoon as ever the Soul is out of the Body, it comes
to its account before the God of Spirits.</p>
            <p>2. At the end of the World the Bodies of all Men
ſhall be raiſed from the Earth, and joined again to their
Souls, and the Soul and Body ſhall be judged to their
endleſs State; and this is the great and general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
where all Men ſhall at once appear. The ſame
Power of God that made Men of nothing, will as eaſily
then new-make them by a Reſurrection, by which he
will add much more Perfection, even to the Wicked in
their Naturals, which will make them capable of the
greater Miſery; even they ſhall have immortal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
Bodies, which may be the Subjects of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Wo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53. <hi>John</hi> 5. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>Of this Reſurrection and our Appearance at Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Angels will be ſomeway the Miniſters: as
they ſhall come with Chriſt to Judgment, ſo they ſhall
ſound his Trumpet, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 16. and they ſhall gather
the Wicked out of God's Kingdom, and they ſhall
gather the Tares to burn them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 39, 40,
41. in the End of the World the Angels ſhall come
forth and ſever the Wicked from among the Juſt,
and ſhall caſt them into the Furnace of Fire, <hi>Matth.</hi>
17. 49, 50.</p>
            <p>VI. For the ſixth Particular, <hi>What Law is it that Men
ſhall be judged by?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63044:9"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which was given them to live by: God's
Law is but <hi>the Sign of his Will to teach us what ſhall be due
from us and to us:</hi> before we fell he gave us ſuch a Law
as was ſutable to our Perfection; when we had ſinned
and turned from him, as we ceaſed not to be his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
nor he to be our Lord, ſo he deſtroyed not his
Law, nor diſcharged or abſolved us from the Duty of
our Obedience. But becauſe we ſtood condemned by
that Law, and could not be juſtified by it, having once
tranſgreſſed it, he was pleaſed to make a <hi>Law of Grace,</hi>
even <hi>a new, a remedying Law,</hi> by which we might be
ſaved from the deſerved Puniſhment of the Old. So
we ſhall be tried at Judgment upon <hi>both</hi> theſe Laws,
but ultimately upon the laſt. The firſt Law commanded
perfect Obedience, and threatned Death to us if ever
we diſobeyed; the ſecond Law finding us under the
Guilt of Sin againſt the firſt, doth command us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and believe in Chriſt, and ſo return to God by him,
and promiſeth us pardon of all our Sins upon that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and alſo if we perſevere, everlaſting Glory. So
that in Judgment though it muſt be firſt evinced that
we are Sinners, and have deſerved Death according to
the Law of pure Nature; yet that is not the Upſhot of
the Judgment. For the Enquiry will be next, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we have accepted the Remedy, and ſo obeyed the
Law of Grace, and performed its Condition for Pardon
and Salvation, and upon this our Life or Death will
depend. It is both theſe Laws that condemn the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
but it is only the Law of Grace that juſtifieth the
Righteous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But how ſhall Heathens be judged by the Law of
Grace, that never did receive it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The expreſs Goſpel ſome of them had not,
and therefore ſhall not directly be judged by it; but
much of the Redeemer's Mercy they did enjoy, which
ſhould have led them to repent and ſeek out after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
from their Miſery, and to come nearer Chriſt;
and for the neglect and abuſe of this they ſhall be judged,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63044:10"/>
and not meerly for ſinning againſt the Law that was given
us in pure Innocency: ſo that Chriſt as Redeemer ſhall
judg them as well as others; though they had but one
Talent, yet muſt they give an account of that to the
Redeemer from whom they received it. But if any
be unſatisfied in this, let them remember that as God
hath left the State of ſuch more dark to us, and the
Terms on which he will judg them; ſo doth it much
more concern us to look to the Terms of our own
Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But how ſhall Inſants be judged by the Goſpel, that
were uncapable of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For ought I find in Scripture, they ſtand or fall
with their Parents, and on the ſame Terms; but I leave
each to their own Thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VII. For the ſeventh Head,</hi> What will be the Cauſe
of the Day to be enqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed after? what the Accuſation, and
what the Defence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This may be gathered from what was laſt ſaid,
The great Cauſe of the Day will be to enquire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
who ſhall die and who ſhall live, who ought
to go to Heaven, and who to Hell for ever, according
to the Law by which they muſt then be judged.</p>
            <p>1. As there is a twofold Law by which they muſt
be judged, ſo will there then be a twofold Accuſation.
The firſt will be that they were <hi>Sinners,</hi> and ſo having
violated the Law of God, they deſerve everlaſting
Death according to that Law: If no Defence could be
made, this one Accuſation would condemn all the World;
for it is moſt certain that all are Sinners, and as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that all Sin deſerveth Death. The only Defence
againſt this Accuſation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieth in this Plea; confeſſing the
Charge, we muſt plead that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for
Sins, and upon that Conſideration God hath forgiven
us; and therefore being forgiven, we ought not to be
puniſhed: To prove this we muſt ſhew the Pardon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God's Hand in the Goſpel. But becauſe this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63044:10"/>
doning Act of the Goſpel doth forgive none but thoſe
that repent and believe, and ſo return to God, and
to ſincere Obedience for the time to come; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the next Accuſation will be, that <hi>we did not perform
theſe Conditions of Forgiveneſs; and therefore being Vnbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Impenitent and Rebels againſt the Redeemer, we have
no right to Pardon, but by the Sentence of the Goſpel are
liable to a greater Puniſhment for this Contempt of Chriſt
and Grace.</hi> This Accuſation is either <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe:</hi>
where it is <hi>true,</hi> God and Conſcience, who ſpeak the
Truth, may well be ſaid to be the Accuſers: Where it
is <hi>falſe,</hi> it can be only the Work of Satan the malicious
Adverſary, who, as we may ſee in <hi>Job</hi>'s Caſe, will not
ſtick to bring a falſe Accuſation.</p>
            <p>If any think that the Accuſer will not do ſo vain a
Work, at leaſt they may ſee that <hi>potentially</hi> this is the
Accuſation that lieth againſt us, and which we muſt be
juſtified againſt. For all <hi>Juſtification</hi> implieth an <hi>actual</hi>
or <hi>potential Accuſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that is truly accuſed of final Impenitency, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
or Rebellion, hath no other Defence to make,
but muſt needs be condemned.</p>
            <p>He that is falſly accuſed of ſuch Non-performance of
the Condition of Grace, muſt deny the Accuſation,
and plead his own perſonal Righteouſneſs as againſt
that Accuſation, and produce that Faith, Repentance
and ſincere Obedience and Perſeverance, by which he
fulfilled that Condition, and ſo is <hi>Evangilically Righteous</hi>
in himſelf, and therefore hath part in the Blood of
Chriſt, which is inſtead of a <hi>Legal Righteouſneſs</hi> to him
in all things elſe, as having procured him a Pardon of
all his Sins, and a Right to everlaſting Glory.</p>
            <p>And thus we muſt then be juſtified by Chriſt's Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
only againſt the Accuſation of being <hi>Sinners in
general,</hi> and of deſerving God's Wrath for the Breach
of the Law of Works; but we muſt be juſtified by
our Faith, Repentance and ſincere Obedience it ſelf,
againſt the Accuſation of being <hi>Impenitent, Vnbelievers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63044:11"/>
and Rebels againſt Chriſt,</hi> and having not performed
the Condition of the Promiſe, and ſo having no part
in Chriſt and his Benefits.</p>
            <p>So that in ſum you ſee that the Cauſe of the Day
will be to enquire, whether being all known Sinners,
we have accepted of Chriſt upon his Terms, and ſo
have Right in him and his Benefits or not? whether
they have forſaken this vain World for him, and loved
him ſo faithfully, that they have manifeſted it, in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with theſe things at his Command? And this is
the meaning of <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. where the Enquiry is made
to be, whether they have ſed and viſited him in his
Members or not? that is, whether they have ſo far loved
him as their Redeemer, and God by him, as that they
have manifeſted this to his Members according to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
though it coſt them the Hazard or Loſs
of all; ſeeing Danger, and Labour, and Coſt are fitter
to expreſs Love by than empty Compliments and bare
Profeſſions.</p>
            <p>Whether it be particularly enquired after, or only
taken for granted that Men are <hi>Sinners,</hi> and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Death according to the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> and that
Chriſt hath ſatisfied by his Death, is all one as to the
matter in hand, ſeeing God's Enquiry is but the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
and Conviction of us. But the laſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
which muſt decide the Controverſy will be,
whether we have performed the Condition of the
Goſpel?</p>
            <p>I have the rather alſo ſaid all this, to ſhew you in what
ſenſe theſe Words are taken in the Text, that <hi>every Man
ſhall be judged according to what he hath done in the Fleſh, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be good or bad.</hi> Though every Man be judged <hi>worthy</hi>
of Death for ſinning, yet every Man ſhall not be judged
<hi>to die</hi> for it, and no Man ſhall be judged <hi>worthy</hi> of Life
<hi>for</hi> his good Works: It is therefore according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
as the Rule of Judgment, that this is meant. They
that have repented and believed, and returned to <hi>true,</hi>
though <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience, ſhall be judged to everlaſting
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63044:11"/>
Life, <hi>according</hi> to theſe Works; not becauſe theſe Works
<hi>deſerve</hi> it, but becauſe the <hi>free Gift in the Goſpel</hi> through
the Blood of Chriſt, doth make theſe things the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
of our poſſeſſing it. They that have lived and
died Impenitent, Unbelievers and Rebels againſt Chriſt,
ſhall be judged to everlaſting Puniſhment, <hi>becauſe</hi> they
have <hi>deſerved</hi> it both by their Sin in <hi>general</hi> againſt the
the Law, and by theſe Sins in <hi>ſpecial</hi> againſt the Goſpel.
This is called <hi>the Merit of the Cauſe,</hi> that is, what is a
Man's <hi>Due</hi> according to the true meaning of the Law,
though the Due may be by free Gift. And thus you ſee
what will be the Cauſe of the Day, and the Matter to be
enquired after and decided as to our Life or Death.</p>
            <p>VIII. The next Point in our Method is, to ſhew you,
<hi>What will be the Evidence of the Cauſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a fivefold Evidence among Men.
1. When the Fact is notorious. 2. The Knowledg of an
unſuſpected competent Judg. 3. The Parties Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
4. Witneſs. 5. Inſtruments and viſible Effects of the
Action. All theſe Evidences will be at hand, and any
one of them ſufficient for the Conviction of the guilty
Perſon at that Day.</p>
            <p>1. As the Sins of <hi>all Men,</hi> ſo the <hi>Impenitency</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>
of the <hi>Wicked</hi> was notorious, or at leaſt will be
then. For though ſome play the Hypocrites, and
hide the Matter from the World and themſelves, yet
God ſhall open their Hearts and former Lives to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and to the view of all the World. He ſhall
ſet their Sins in Order before them, ſo that it ſhall be
utterly in vain to deny or excuſe them. If any Man
will then think to make their Cauſe as good to God as
they can now do to us, that are not able to ſee their
Hearts, they will be foully miſtaken. Now they can
ſay they have as good Hearts as the beſt: then God
will bring them out in the Light, and ſhew them to
themſelves and all the World, whether they were good
or bad. Now they will face us down that they do truly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63044:12"/>
repent, and they obey God as well as they can; but
God that knoweth the Deceivers will then undeceive
them. We cannot now make Men acquainted with
their own unſanctified Hearts, nor convince them that
have not true Faith, Repentance or Obedience, but God
will convince them of it; they can find Shifts and falſe
Anſwers to put off a <hi>Miniſter</hi> with, but <hi>God</hi> will not
ſo be ſhifted off. Let <hi>us</hi> preach as plainly to them as
we can, and do all that ever we are able to acquaint
them with the Impenitency and Unholineſs of their own
Heart, and the Neceſſity of a new Heart and Life, yet
we cannot do it, but they will believe whether we will
or not, that the old Heart will ſerve the turn. But how
eaſily will <hi>God</hi> make them know the contrary? <hi>We</hi>
plead with them in the dark, for though we have the
Candle of the Goſpel in our hands when we come to
ſhew them their Corruption, yet they ſhut their Eyes
and are wilfully blind; but <hi>God</hi> will open their Eyes
whether they will or not, not by <hi>holy Illumination,</hi> but
by <hi>forced Conviction;</hi> and then he will plead with them
as in the open Light. <hi>See here thy own unholy Soul; canſt
thou now ſay thou didſt love me above all? canſt thou deny
but thou didſt love this World before me, and ſerve thy Fleſh
and Luſts, though I told thee if thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idſt ſo thou ſhouldſt
die? Look upon thy own Heart now, and ſee whether it be
an holy or an unholy Heart, a ſpiritual or a fleſhly Heart, a
heavenly or an earthly Heart. Look now upon all the Courſe
of thy Life, and ſee whether thou didſt live to me, or to
the World and thy Fleſh.</hi> O how eaſily will God convince
Men then of the very Sins of their Thoughts, and in
their ſecret Cloſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, when they thought that no Witneſs
could have diſcloſed them! Therefore it's ſaid that the
Books ſhall be opened, and the Dead judged out of the
Books, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 10.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Evidence will be <hi>the Knowledg of the Judg.</hi>
If the <hi>Sinner</hi> would not be <hi>convinced,</hi> yet it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that the <hi>Judg</hi> knoweth the Cauſe; God needeth no
farther Witneſs, he ſaw thee committing Adultery in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63044:12"/>
ſecret, Lying, Stealing, Forſwearing in ſecret. If thou
do not know thine own Heart to be unholy, 'tis enough
that God knoweth it. If you have the Face to ſay,
<hi>Lord, when did we ſee thee hungry?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 44.
yet God will make good the Charge againſt thee, and
there needeth no more Teſtimony than his own. Can
fooliſh Sinners think to lie hid or eſcape at that Day,
that will now ſin <hi>wilfully before their Judg?</hi> that know
every Day that their <hi>Judg</hi> is <hi>looking</hi> on them, while
they forget him, and give up themſelves to the World,
and yet go on even under his Eye, as if to his Face they
dared him to puniſh them?</p>
            <p>3. The third Evidence will be, <hi>the Sinners Confeſſion</hi>
God will force their own Conſciences to witneſs againſt
them, and their own Tongues to confeſs the Accuſation.
If they do at firſt excuſe it, he will leave them ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
yea and condemning themſelves before they have
done.</p>
            <p>O what a difference between their Language now and
then! <hi>Now</hi> we cannot tell them of their Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
but they either tell us of our own Faults, or
bid us look to our ſelves, or deny or excuſe their
Fault, or make light of it: but <hi>then</hi> their own Tongues
ſhall confeſs them, and cry out of the wilful Folly that
they committed, and lay a heavier Charge upon them
than we can now do. <hi>Now</hi> if we tell them that we
are afraid they are unregenerate, and leſt their Hearts
are not truly ſet upon God, they will tell us they hope
to be ſaved with ſuch Hearts as they have: But <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en,</hi>
O how they will confeſs the Folly and Falſeneſs of their
own Hearts! You may ſee a little of their Caſe even
in deſpairing Sinners on Earth, how far they are from
denying or excuſing their Sins. <hi>Judas</hi> cries out, <hi>I
have ſinned in betraying innocent Blood,</hi> Mat. 27. 4. out of
their own Mouth ſhall they be judged. That very
Tongue that now excuſeth their Sin, will in their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be their great Accuſer. For God will have it ſo
to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:63044:13"/>
4. The fourth Evidence will be the <hi>Witneſs of others.</hi>
O how many thouſand Witneſſes might there be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
were there need, to convince the guilty Soul at
that Day!</p>
            <p>1. All the Miniſters of Chriſt that ever preached to
them, or warned them, will be ſufficient Witneſſes
againſt them; <hi>we muſt needs</hi> teſtify that we preached to
them the Truth of the Goſpel, and they would not
believe it. We preached to them the Goodneſs of God,
yet they ſet not their Hearts upon him; we ſhewed
them their Sin, and they were not humbled: we told
them of the danger of an unregenerate State, and they
did not regard us: we acquainted them with the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Neceſſity of Holineſs, but they made light of all:
we let them know the Deceitfulneſs of their Hearts,
and the need of a cloſe and faithful Examination, but
they would not beſtow an Hour in ſuch a Work, nor
ſcarce once be afraid of being miſtaken and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying.
We let them know the Vanity of this World,
and yet they would not forſake it, no not for Chriſt and
the Hopes of Glory: we told them of the everlaſting
Felicity they might attain, but they would not ſet
themſelves to ſeek it.</p>
            <p>What we ſhall think of it <hi>then</hi> the Lord knows, but
ſurely it ſeemeth now to us a matter of very ſad Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that we muſt be brought in as Witneſſes againſt
the Souls of our Neighbours and Friends in the Fleſh.
Thoſe whom we now unfeignedly love, and would do
any thing that we were able to do for their good,
whoſe Welfare is dearer to us than all worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Alas, that we muſt be forced to teſtify to their
Faces for their Condemnation! Ah Lord, with what
a Heart muſt a poor Miniſter ſtudy, when he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this, that all the Words that he is ſtudying muſt be
brought in for a Witneſs againſt many of his Hearers!
with what an Heart muſt a Miniſter preach when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth
that all the Words that he is ſpeaking muſt
condemn many, if not moſt of his Hearers? Do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63044:13"/>
this ſad Fruit of our Labours? No, we may ſay
with the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 16. <hi>I have not deſired the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Day thou knoweſt:</hi> No, if we deſired it, we would
not do ſo much to prevent it, we would not ſtudy,
and preach, and pray, and intreat Men, that if it were
poſſible we might not be put on ſuch a Task. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it ſhould make every honeſt Miniſter ſtudy hard,
and pray hard, and intreat hard, and ſtoop low to Men,
and be earneſt with Men in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, that
if it may be they may not be the Condemners of their
Peoples Souls. But if Men will not hear, and there be no
remedy, who can help it? Chriſt himſelf came not into
the World to condemn Men, but to ſave them, and yet
he will condemn thoſe that will not yield to his ſaving
Work: God takes no Pleaſure in the Death of a Sinner,
but rather that he repent and return and live, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
18. 23, 32. and yet he will rejoice over thoſe to do
them hurt, and deſtroy them that will not return, <hi>Deut.</hi>
28. 63. And if we muſt be put on ſuch a Work, he
will make us like-minded. The Holy Ghoſt tells us
that the Saints ſhall judg the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3.
and if they muſt judg, they will judg as God judgeth;
you cannot blame us for it, Sinners: we now warn you
of it before-hand, and if you will not prevent it,
blame not us but your ſelves. Alas, we are not our
own Maſters! As we now ſpeak not to you in our
own Names, ſo then we may not do what we liſt our
ſelves, or if we might, our Wills will be as God's Will.
God will make us judg you and witneſs againſt you.
Can we abſolve you when the righteous God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
you? when God is againſt you, whoſe ſide would
you have us be of? we muſt be either againſt <hi>God</hi> or
<hi>you;</hi> and can you think that we ſhould be for any one
againſt our Maker and Redeemer? we muſt either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Sentence of Jeſus Chriſt or condemn you:
and is not there more reaſon to condemn you than him?
Can we have any Mercy on you, when he that made
you will not ſave you, and he that formed you will
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63044:14"/>
ſhew you no Mercy? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 11. yea when he that died for
you will condemn you, ſhall we be more merciful than
God? But alas! if we ſhould be ſo fooliſh and unjuſt, what
good would it do you? If we would be Falſe-witneſſes
and partial Judges, it would not ſave you; we are not
juſtified if we abſolve our ſelves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. how unable
then ſhall we be againſt God's Sentence to juſtify you?
If all the World ſhould ſay you were holy and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
when God knows you were unholy and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
it will do you no good. You pray every Day that
<hi>his Will</hi> may be done, and it will be done: It will be
done <hi>upon</hi> you, becauſe it was not done <hi>by</hi> you. What
would you have <hi>us</hi> ſay, if God ask us, <hi>Did you tell this
Sinner of the need of Chriſt, of the Glory of the World to
come, and the Vanity of this?</hi> Should we lie and ſay we
did not? What ſhould we ſay if he ask us, <hi>Did not you
tell them the Miſery of their natural State, and what would
become of them if they were not made new?</hi> Would you
have us lie to God, and ſay we did not? Why if we
<hi>did not,</hi> your Blood will be required at our hands,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 6. and 3. 18. and would you have us bring
your Blood upon our own Heads by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie? yea, and
to do you no good, when we know that Lies will not
prevail with God? No, no, Sinners; we muſt unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
teſtify to the Confuſion of your Faces; if God ask
us, we muſt bear Witneſs againſt you and ſay, <hi>Lord,
we did what we could according to our weak Abilities to
reclaim them: indeed our own Thoughts of everlaſting Things
were ſo low, and our Hearts ſo dull, that we muſt confeſs
we did not follow them ſo cloſe, nor ſpeak ſo earneſtly as we
ſhould have done: we did not cry ſo loud, or lift up our Voice
as a Trumpet to awaken them</hi> (Iſa. 58. 1.) <hi>we confeſs we
did not ſpeak to them with ſuch melting Compaſſion, and with
ſuch Streams of Tears beſeech them to regard, as a Matter
of ſuch great Concernment ſhould have been ſpoken with; we
did not fall on our Knees to them, and ſo earneſtly beg of them
for the Lord's ſake, to have Mercy upon their own Souls as we
ſhould have done. But yet we told them the Meſſage of God,

their Sin and Miſery, but we could not: fain we would have
drawn them to the Admiration of Chriſt, but they made light
of it,</hi> Mat. 22. 5. <hi>we would fain have brought them to the
Contempt of this vain World, and to ſet their Mind on the

come to Judgment, and that this World would deceive them
and leave them in the Duſt: we told them that the time was
at hand when nothing but Chriſt would do them good, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Favour of God would be ſufficient for their
Happineſs, but we could never get them to lay it to heart.
Many a time did we intreat them to think ſoberly of this
Life and the Life to come, and to compare them together with
the Faith of Chriſtians and the Reaſon of Men, but they
would not do it: many a time did we intreat them but to
take now and then an Hour in ſecret to conſider</hi> who <hi>made
them, and</hi> for what <hi>he had made them, and why they were
ſent into this World, and what their Buſineſs here is, and</hi>
whither <hi>they are going, and bow it will go with them at
their latter End: but we could never get moſt of them to ſpend
one Hour in ſerious Thoughts of theſe weighty Matters. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

not, whether their Souls were brought back to God by San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification;
but they would not try: we did beſeech them to
make ſure Work, and not leave ſuch a Matter as everlaſting
Joy or Torment to a bold and mad Adventure, but we could
not prevail. We intreated them to lay all other Buſineſſes aſide
a little while in the World, and to enquire by the Direction
of the Word of God, what would become of them in the
World to come, and judg themſelves before God came to judg
them, ſeeing they had the Law and Rule of Judgment before

3. Another Witneſs that will teſtify againſt the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
at that Day, will be their ſinful Companions,
thoſe that drew them into Sin, or were drawn by them,
or joined with them in it. O little do poor Drunkards
think, when they ſit merrily in an Ale-houſe, that one
of them muſt bear witneſs againſt another, and condemn
one another! If they thought of this, methinks it
ſhould make them have leſs Delight in that Company:
thoſe that now join with you in Wickedneſs, ſhall then
be forced to witneſs, [I confeſs, Lord, I did hear him
ſweat and curſe, I heard him deride thoſe that feared
the Lord, and make a Jeſt of a holy Life: I ſaw him
in the Ale-houſe when he ſhould be hearing the Word
of God, or reading, or calling upon God, and prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for this Day: I joined with him in fleſhly Delights,
in abuſing thy Creature and our own Bodies.] Sinners,
look your Companions in the Face the next time you
are with them, and remember this that I now ſay; that
thoſe Men ſhall give in Evidence againſt you, that now
are your Aſſociates in all your Mirth. Little thinketh
the Fornicator and luſtful Wanton, that their ſinful
Mates muſt then bear Witneſs of that which they
thought the Dark had concealed, and tell their Shame
before all the World. But this muſt be the Fruit of
Sin. It's meet that they who encouraged one another
in Sin, ſhould condemn one another for it. And mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
not at it, for they ſhall be forced to it whether
they will or no; Light will not then be hid: They may
think to have ſome caſe to their Conſciences, by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and condemning others. When <hi>Adam</hi> is queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Sin, he preſently accuſeth the Woman, <hi>Gen.</hi>
3. 12. when <hi>Judas</hi> his Conſcience was awakned, he
runs to the Phariſees with the Money that drew him to
it, and they caſt it back in his own Face, <hi>See thou to il,
what is that to us? Mat.</hi> 27. 4, 5, 6. O the cold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
that Sinners will have at that Day, and the little
I leaſure that they will find in remembring their evil
Ways! <hi>Now</hi> when a Foruicator or a Worldling, or a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63044:16"/>
merry voluptuous Man is grown old, and cannot act all
his Sin again, he takes Pleaſure in remembring and
telling others of his former Folly; what he once was,
and what he did, and the merry Hours that he had:
but <hi>then</hi> when Sinners are come to themſelves a little
more, they will remember and tell one another of
theſe things with another Heart. O that they did
but know now how theſe things will then affect
them!</p>
            <p>4. Another Witneſs that will then riſe up againſt
them, will be the very Devils that tempted them: They
that did purpoſely draw them to Sin, that they might
draw them to Torment for Sin: They can witneſs that
you hearkned to their Temptations, when you would
not hearken to God's Exhortations: They can witneſs
that you obeyed them in working Iniquity. But becauſe
you may think the Accuſer's Teſtimony is not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
I will not ſtand on this. Though it is not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
where God knoweth it to be true.</p>
            <p>5. The very Angels of God alſo may be Witneſſes
againſt the Wicked; therefore are we adviſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
not to ſin before them, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10.
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21. I charge thee before the Elect Angels,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> They can teſtify that they would have been
miniſtring Spirits for their good, when the Wicked
rather choſe to be Slaves to the Spirit of Maliciouſneſs.
The holy Angels of God do many a time ſtand by you
when you are ſinning: They ſee you when you ſee
not them; they are imployed by God in ſome ſort
for your good, as well as we. And as it is the Grief of
Miniſters that their Labours ſucceed not, ſo may we
ſuppoſe that according to their State and Nature it is
<hi>theirs.</hi> For they that rejoice in Heaven at the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of one Sinner, may be ſaid to ſorrow, or to
loſe thoſe Joys when you refuſe to be converted.
Theſe noble Spirits, theſe holy and glorious Attendants
of Chriſt that ſhall wait upon him to Judgment, will
be Witneſſes againſt rebellious Sinners to their Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63044:17"/>
Sirs, you have all in you naturally a Fear of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and inviſible Powers: Fear them aright, leſt heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the deceiving Spirits, and refuſing the Help of
the Angels of God, and wilfully ſinning before their
Faces, you ſhould cauſe them at that Day, to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of your Souls, to ſtand forth as Witneſſes againſt
you to your Condemnation.</p>
            <p>6. Conſcience it ſelf will be a moſt effectual Witneſs
againſt the Wicked at that Day. I before told you it
will be a Diſcerner, and force them to a Confeſſion:
But a farther Office it hath, even to <hi>witneſs</hi> againſt
them. If none elſe in the World had known of their
ſecret Sins, Conſcience will ſay, I was acquainted with
them.</p>
            <p>7. The Spirit of Chriſt can witneſs againſt the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
that he oft moved them to repent and return,
and they rejected his Motions; that he ſpoke to their
Hearts in ſecret, and oft ſet in with the Miniſter, and
often minded them of their Caſe, and perſwaded
them to God; but they reſiſted, quenched and grieved
the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. As the Spirit witneſſeth with the
Spirits of the Righteous that they are the Children of
God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. ſo doth he witneſs with the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Wicked that they were Children of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and therefore are juſtly Children of Wrath. This
Spirit will not alway ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it will prove their Enemy, and riſe up againſt
them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 10. If you will needs <hi>grieve</hi>
it now, it will <hi>grieve you</hi> then. Were it not a Spirit of
<hi>Grace,</hi> and were it not free Mercy that it came to offer
you, the Repulſe would not have been ſo condemning,
nor the Witneſs of this Spirit ſo heavy at the laſt.
But it was the Spirit of Jeſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that came with recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace, which you reſiſted: And though the Wages
of every Sin is Death, yet you will find that it will coſt
you ſomewhat more to reject this Salvation, than to
break the Creator's Law of Works. Kindneſs, <hi>ſuch</hi>
Kindneſs will not be rejected at eaſy Rates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:63044:17"/>
Many a good Motion is now made by the Spirit
to the Heart of a Sinner, which he doth not ſo much as
once obſerve; and therefore doth not now remember
them. But <hi>then</hi> they ſhall be brought to his Remembrance
with a witneſs. Many a thouſand ſecret Motions to
Repentance, to Faith, to a holy Life, will be <hi>then</hi> ſet
before the Eyes of the poor, unpardoned, trembling
Sinner, which he had quite forgotten: And the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

prevail againſt the ſtrongeſt Arguments that I uſed:
Though I ſhewed Reaſons, undeniable Reaſons, from
thy Creator, from thy Redeemer, from Nature, from
Grace, from Heaven and from Hell; yet all would not
ſo much as <hi>ſtop</hi> thee, much leſs <hi>turn</hi> thee, but thou
<hi>wouldeſt</hi> go on; thou <hi>wouldeſt</hi> follow thy Fleſh, and now
let it pay thee the Wages of thy Folly; thou <hi>wouldeſt</hi>
be thy own Guide, and take thine own Courſe, and
now take what thou getteſt by it.]</p>
            <p>Poor Sinners, I beſeech you in the Fear of God, the
next time you have any ſuch Motions from the Spirit of
God, to repent, and believe, and break off your Sins,
and the Occaſions of them: conſider then what a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is ſet before you, and how it will confound you at
the Day of Judgment, to have all theſe Motions brought
in againſt you, and that the Spirit of Grace it ſelf
ſhould be your Condemner! Alas, that Men ſhould
chooſe their own Deſtruction, and wilfully chooſe it!
and that the Foreknowledg of theſe things ſhould not
move them to relent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:63044:18"/>
So much concerning the Witneſs that will be brought
in againſt the Sinner.</p>
            <p>5. The fifth Evidence that will be given againſt the
Sinner will be, <hi>The Inſtruments and Effects.</hi> You know
among Men, if a Man be found murdered by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and you are found ſtanding by with a bloody
Sword in your Hand; eſpecially if there were a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Diſſenſion between you, it will be an Evidence
that will prove a <hi>ſtrong Preſumption</hi> that you were the
Murderer; but if the Fact be certain by other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
then many ſuch things may be brought for ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of the Fault.</p>
            <p>So a twofold Evidence will be brought againſt the
Sinner from theſe things. One to prove him guilty of
the Fact, the other to aggravate the Fault, and prove
that his Sin was very great.</p>
            <p>For the former. 1. The very Creatures which Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
abuſed to ſin, may be brought in againſt them to
their Conviction and Condemnation. For though theſe
Creatures ſhall be conſumed with the laſt deſtroying
Fire, which ſhall conſume all the World; yet ſhall they
have a Being in the Memory of the Sinner, (an <hi>eſſe Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum;</hi>)
the very Wine or Ale, or other Liquor which
was abuſed to Drunkenneſs, may witneſs againſt
the Drunkard. The ſweet Morſels by which the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
did pleaſe his Appetite, and all the good Creatures
of God which he luxuriouſly devoured, may witneſs
againſt him, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 19, 25. He that fared delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
every Day in this Life, was told by <hi>Abraham</hi> when
he was dead, and his Soul in Hell, [Remember that
thou in thy Life-time receivedſt thy good things, and
likewiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> evil things: but now he is comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and thou art tormented.] Though their ſweet Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
and Cups are paſt and gone, yet muſt they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
at Judgment and in Hell. [Remember Son]
ſaith <hi>Abraham;</hi> Yea, and <hi>remember</hi> he muſt whether he
will or no; long was the Glutton in ſinning, and many
a pleaſant bit did he taſte: and ſo many Evidences of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63044:18"/>
his Sin will lie againſt him, and the Sweetneſs will then
be turned into Gall.</p>
            <p>The very Clothing and Ornaments by which proud
Perſons did manifeſt their Pride, will be ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
againſt them; as his being clothed with Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and fine Linen, is mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 19.</p>
            <p>The very Lands, and Goods, and Houſes of Worldlings
will be an Evidence againſt them: Their Gold and
Silver, which the Covetous do now prefer before the
everlaſting Riches with Chriſt, will be an Evidence
againſt them: <hi>James</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Go to now, ye rich
Men, weep and howl for your Miſeries that ſhall come upon
you. Your Riches are corrupted, and your Garments Moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taten;
your Gold and your Silver is cankered, and the Ruſt
of them ſhall be a</hi> Witneſs <hi>againſt you, and ſhall eat your Fleſh
as it were Fire; ye have heaped Treaſure together for the
laſt Days. Behold, the Hire of the Labourers, which have
reaped down your Fields, which is of you kept back by
Fraud, crieth; and the Cries of them which have reaped,
are entred into the Ears of the Lord of Sabbath. Ye have
lived in Pleaſure on the Earth, and been wanton; ye have
nouriſhed your Hearts as in a Day of Slaughter.</hi> O that
Worldlings would well conſider this one Text; and
therein obſerve whether a Life of Earthly Pleaſure and
fulneſs of worldly Glory and Gallantry, be as deſirable
as they imagine, and to what Time and Purpoſe they
now lay up their Treaſures; and how they muſt hear of
theſe things hereafter; and what effect the review of
their jovial Days will have upon their miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Souls.</p>
            <p>2. The very Circumſtances of Time, Place, and
the like, may evidence againſt his Condemnation. The
Drunkard ſhall remember in ſuch an Ale-houſe, I was
ſo oft drunk, and in ſuch a Tavern I waſted my time.
The Adulterer and Fornicator ſhall remember the very
Time, the Place, the Room, the Bed, where they
committed Wickedneſs. The Thief and Deceiver will
remember the Time, Place, and the Perſons they wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63044:19"/>
and the things which they robbed or deceived them
of. The Worldling will remember the Buſineſs which
he preferred before the Service of God; the worldly
Matters which had more of his Heart than his Maker
and Redeemer had; the Work which he was doing
when he ſhould have been praying or reading, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing
his Family, or thinking ſoberly of his latter
End. A thouſand of theſe will then come into his
Mind, and be as ſo many Evidences againſt him to his
Condemnation.</p>
            <p>3. The very Effects alſo of Mens Sins will be an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
againſt them. The Wife and Children of a
Drunkard are impoveriſhed by his Sin; his Family and
the Neighbourhood is diſquieted by him. Theſe will
be ſo many Evidences againſt him. So will the Abuſe
of his own Reaſon, the enticing of others to the ſame
Sin, and hardning them by his Example.</p>
            <p>One covetous unmerciful Landlord doth keep an
hundred, or many hundred Perſons or Families in ſo
great Neceſſities, and Care and Labour, that they are
tempted by it to overpaſs the Service of God, as having
ſcarce time for it, or any Room for it in their troubled
Thoughts; all theſe miſerable Families and Perſons,
and all the Souls that are undone by this Temptation,
will be ſo many Evidences againſt ſuch Oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>Yea, the Poor whom they have neglected to relieve
when they might; the Sick whom they have neglected
to viſit when they might, will all witneſs then againſt
the Unmerciful, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>The many ignorant, worldly, careleſs Sinners, that
have periſhed under an idle and unfaithful Miniſter, will
be ſo many Witneſſes againſt him to his Condemnation!
They may then cry out againſt him to his Face, [I was
ignorant, Lord, and he never did ſo much as teach me,
catechiſe me, nor tell me of theſe things; I was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
and minded the World, and he let me go on quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and was as careleſs as I, had never plainly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
warned me, to waken me from my Security.] And
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63044:19"/>
ſo their Blood will be required at his hands, though
themſelves alſo ſhall periſh in their Sins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>2. And as theſe Evidences will convince Men of Sin,
ſo there are many more which will convince them of the
<hi>greatneſs</hi> of their Sin. And theſe are ſo many, that it
would too much lengthen my Diſcourſe to ſtand on
them. A few I ſhall briefly touch.</p>
            <p>1. They very Mercy of God in <hi>creating</hi> Men, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and continuing their <hi>Being</hi> to them, will be an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for the Aggravation of their Sin againſt him.
What, will you abuſe him by whom it is that you are
Men? will you ſpeak to his Diſhonour that giveth you
your Speech? will you live to his Diſhonour who giveth
you your Lives? will you wrong him by his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
and neglect him without whom you cannot
ſubſiſt?</p>
            <p>2. The Redemption of Men by the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, will be an Evidence to the exceeding Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Sins. You ſinned againſt the Lord that
bought you, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. When the Feaſt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
and all things were ready, you made light of it,
and found Excuſes and would not come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 4, 5,
6. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 17, 18. Muſt Chriſt redeem you by ſo
dear a Price from Sin and Miſery, and yet will you
continue the Servants of Sin, and prefer your Slavery
before your Freedom, and chooſe to be Satan's Drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
rather than to be the Servants of God? The Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and Sufferings that Chriſt underwent for you, will
then prove the Increaſe of your own Sorrows. As a
neglected Redeemer it is that he will condemn you.
And then you would be glad that it were but true
Doctrine, that Chriſt never died for you, that you
might not be condemned for refuſing a Redeemer, and
ſinning againſt him that ſhed his Blood for you. How
deeply will his Wounds then wound your Conſciences!
You will then remember that to this end he both died,
roſe and revived, that he might be Lord both of the
Dead and the Living: And that he therefore died for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63044:20"/>
all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live to
themſelves, but to him that died for them and roſe
again; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19,
20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18. You will then underſtand that
you were not your own, but were bought with a Price;
and therefore ſhould have glorified him that bought you
with your Bodies and Spirits, becauſe they were his,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. This one Aggravation of your Sin
will make you doubly and remedileſly miſerable, that
you trod under foot the Son of God, and counted the
Blood of the Covenant, wherewith you were ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
an unholy thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27, 28, 29. and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
to your ſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him
to open Shame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>3. Moreover, all the perſonal Mercies which they
received, will be ſo many Evidences for the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Ungodly. The very Earth that bore
them, and yielded them its Fruits, while they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are unfruitful to God. The Air which they
breathed in, the Food which nouriſh'd them, the
Clothes which cover'd them, the Houſes which they
dwelt in, the Beaſts that laboured for them, and all
the Creatures that died for their Uſe: All theſe may
riſe up againſt them to their Condemnation. And the
Judg may thus expoſtulate with them, [Did all theſe
Mercies deſerve no more Thanks? Should you not
have ſerved him that ſo liberally maintained you? God
thought not all theſe too good for you, and did you
think your Hearts and Services too good for him? He
ſerved yours with the weary Labours of your fellow-Creatures;
and ſhould you have grudged to bear
his eaſy Yoak? They were your Slaves and Drudges,
and you refuſed to be his free Servants and his Sons:
They ſuffered Death to feed your Bodies, and you would
not ſuffer the ſhort Forbearance of a little forbidden
fleſhly Pleaſure, for the ſake of him that made you
and redeemed you.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:63044:20"/>
O how many thouſand Mercies of God will then be
reviewed by thoſe that neglected them, to the Horror
of their Souls, when they ſhall be upbraided by the
Judg with their baſe Requital! All the Deliverances
from Sickneſs and from Danger; all the Honours, and
Privileges, and other Commodities which ſo much
contented them, will then be God's Evidences to ſhame
them and confound them. On this Suppoſition doth
the Apoſtle reprove ſuch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou
the Riches of his Goodneſs, and Forbearance, and Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering,
not knowing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth thee
to Repentance? But after thy hardneſs and impenitent Heart,
treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath,
and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God, who will
render to every Man according to his Deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Moreover, all the Means which God uſed for
the Recovery of Sinners in the Day of their Viſitation,
will riſe up againſt impenitent Souls in Judgment, to
their Condemnation. You can hear Sermons careleſly
and ſleepily now: but O that you would conſider how
the Review of them will then awake you! You now
make light of the Warnings of God and Man, and of
all the wholeſom Advice that is given you, but God will
not then make light of your Contempt. O what cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Queſtions will they be to the Hearts of the Ungodly,
when all the means that were uſed for their Good, are
brought to their Remembrance on one ſide, and the
Temprations that drew them to Sin on the other Side,
and the Lord ſhall plead his Cauſe with their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and ſay, [Was I ſo hard a Maſter, or was my
Work ſo unreaſonable, or was my Wages ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that no Perſwaſions could draw you into my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?
Was Satan ſo good a Maſter, or was his Work
ſo honeſt and profitable, or was his Wages ſo deſirable,
that you would be ſo eaſily perſwaded to do as he would
have you? Was there more perſwading Reaſon in his
Allurements and Deceits, than in all my holy Words,
and all the powerful Sermons that you heard, or all the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63044:87"/>
faithful Admonitions you received; or all the good
Examples of the Righteous, or in all the Works of
God which you beheld? Was not a Reaſon fetch'd from
the Love of God, from the Evil of Sin, the Blood of
Chriſt, the Judgment to come, the Glory promiſed,
the Torments threatned, as forcible with you, and as
good in your Eyes to draw you to Holineſs, as a Reaſon
from a little fleſhly Delight or worldly Gain, to draw
you to be unholy?]</p>
            <p>In the Name of God, Sinners, I intreat you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
your ſelves in time, how you will ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
ſuch Queſtions as theſe. You ſhould have ſeen
God in every Creature that you beheld, and have read
your Duty in all his Works; what can you look upon
above you, or below you, or round about you, which
might not have ſhewed you ſo much of the Wiſdom,
and Goodneſs, and Greatneſs of your Maker, as ſhould
have convinced you that it was your Duty to be devoted
to his Will? and yet you have his written Word that
ſpeaks plainer than all theſe; and will you deſpiſe them
all? will you not ſee ſo great a Light? will you not hear
ſo loud and conſtant Calls? ſhall God and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſpeak in vain? And can you think that you ſhall
not hear of this again, and pay for it one Day? you have
the Bible and other good Books by you; why do you
not read them? You have Miniſters at hand; why do
you not go to them, and earneſtly ask them, <hi>Sirs, What
muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> and intreat them to teach you
the Way to Life: You have ſome Neighbours that fear
God; why do you not go to them, and take their good
Advice, and imitate them in the Fear of God, and in a
holy Diligence for your Souls? Now is the time for you
to beſtir your ſelves; Life and Death are before you.
You have Gales of Grace to further your Voyage:
There are more for you than againſt you. God will
help you: his Spirit will help you: his Miniſters will
help you: every good Chriſtian will help you: the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
themſelves will help you, if you will reſolvedly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63044:87"/>
ſet your ſelves to the Work; and yet will you not
ſtir? Patience is waiting on you: Mercies are enticing
you: Scourges are driving you: Judgment ſtayeth for
you: The Lights of God ſtand burning by you to
direct you: And yet will you not ſtir, but lie in

            <p>Having already ſhewed you what the Defence muſt
be, that muſt be ſufficient to our Juſtification;</p>
            <p>If any firſt demand, Whether the Evidence of their

will ſet him upon a vain Defence. For <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23.
Chriſt telleth us, that [Many will ſay to me in that Day,

which had received the one Talent came and ſaid, Lord,
I knew thou art an hard Man, reaping where thou haſt
not ſown, and gathering where thou haſt not ſtrawed;
and I was afraid, and went and hid thy Talent in the

            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:63044:88"/>
It is clear then, that Excuſes they will be ready to
make, and their full Conviction will be in order after
theſe Excuſes, (at leaſt as in their Minds, if not in
Words) but what the particular Excuſes will be, we
may partly know by theſe Scriptures which recite them,
and partly by hearing what the Ungodly do now ſay
for themſelves. And becauſe it is for their preſent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
that I now make mention of them, that they may
ſee the Vanity of all ſuch Excuſes, I will mention them as
I now meet with them in the Mouths of Sinners in our
ordinary Diſcourſe: and theſe Excuſes are of ſeveral
ſorts; ſome by which they would juſtify their Eſtate;
ſome Excuſes of particular Actions; and that either in
whole, or in part; ſome by which they would put by
the Penalty, though they confeſs the Sin; ſome by
which they lay the blame on other Men; and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſome of them very briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt Excuſe.</hi> I am not guilty of theſe things
which I am accuſed of. I did love God above all, and my
Neighbour as my ſelf. I did uſe the World but for Neceſſity,
but God had my Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The All-ſeeing Judg doth know the contrary,
and he will make thy Conſcience know it: Look back,
Man, upon thy Heart and Life: How ſeldom and
how neglectfully didſt thou think of God? how cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
didſt thou worſhip him, or make any mention of
him? how careleſly didſt thou ſerve him, and think
much of all that thou didſt therein? Thou rather
thoughteſt that his Service was making more ado than
needs, and didſt grudg at thoſe that were more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
than thy ſelf; but for the World, how heartily and
how conſtantly didſt thou ſeek and ſerve it? and yet
wouldſt thou now perſwade the Judg that thou didſt

will open thine Eyes then, and ſhew thee a thouſand
groſs Sins, which thou now forgetteſt or makeſt light

would have given you, <hi>John</hi> 6. 27. That if you be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
with Chriſt, you muſt ſeek thoſe things which are
above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God,
and not the things that are on Earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3.
Yea your very Converſation ſhould be in Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>What ſay you? Did not God tell you all this and
much more; and plainly tell it you? Turn to your
Bibles and ſee the Words, and let them witneſs againſt
you.</p>
            <p>2. And could you think with any Reaſon, that your
Souls being ſo much more precious than your Bodies,
you ſhould yet do ſo much more for your Bodies than
your Souls? could you think all the Labour of your
Lives little enough for a frail Body that muſt lie ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Dirt; and that your Immortal Souls ſhould
be no more regarded? Could you think with any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that your Souls ſhould do ſo much for a Life of
a few Years continuance, and do no more for a Life
that ſhall have no end?</p>
            <p>3. And whereas you talk of <hi>truſting God with your
Souls,</hi> you did not truſt him: You did but on that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
careleſly diſregard them. If you truſt God,
ſhew any Word of Promiſe that ever he gave you to
truſt upon, that ever an impenitent, carnal, careleſs
Perſon ſhall be ſaved: No; he hath told you enough
to the contrary. And could you think that it was the
Will of God that you ſhould mind your Bodies more
than your Souls, and this Life more than that to come?
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63044:89"/>
Why, he hath bid you ſtrive, and run, and fight, and
labour, and care, and ſeek, and uſe Violence, and
all Diligence for the ſafety of your Souls, and for the
Life to come: But where hath he bid you do ſo for
your Bodies? No, he knew that you were prone to do
too much for them; and therefore he hath bid you
[Care not, and labour not] that is, Do it as if you did
it not: and let your Care and Labour for earthly
Things be none in compariſon of that for heavenly
Things. You know God can as well maintain your
Lives without your Care and Labour, as ſave your Souls
without it: And yet you ſee he will not, he doth not:
You muſt plough, and ſow, and reap, and threſh, for
all God's Love and Care of you, and not ſay, I will
let all alone and truſt God. And muſt you not much
more uſe diligence in much greater Things? If you
will truſt God, you muſt truſt him in his own Way, and
in the uſe of his own Means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth Excuſe.</hi> I was never brought up to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I cannot ſo much as read: nor did my Parents ever
teach me any of theſe things, but only ſet me about my worldly
Buſineſs, and provide Food and Raiment for me: but never
once told me that I had a Soul to ſave or loſe, and an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Life to provide and prepare for, and therefore I could
not come to the Knowledg of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The greater is their Sin who thus neglected
you. But this is no ſufficient Excuſe for you. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is not prepared for the Learned only; nor will
Chriſt ask you at Judgment whether you are good
Scholars or not, no nor ſo much as whether you could
write or read. But conſider well, Was not God's
Word ſo plainly written, that the Unlearned might
underſtand it? Did he not put it into the moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Stile, though he knew it would be offenſive to
the proud Scholars of the World, of purpoſe that he
might fit it to the Capacities of the Ignorant? And if
you could not read, yet tell me, could not you have
learned to read at 20 or 30 Years of Age, if you had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63044:90"/>
been but willing to beſtow now and then an Hour to
that end? Or at leaſt, did you not live near ſome that
could read? and could you not have procured them
to read to you, or to help you? and did you not hear
theſe things read to you in the Congregation by the
Miniſter, or might have done if you would? and if
your Parents did neglect you in your Youth, yet
when you came to a fuller uſe of Reaſon, and heard of
the Matters of Salvation from God's Word, did it not
concern you to have looked to your ſelves, and to have
redeemed that time which you loſt in your Youth, by
doubling your Diligence when you came to riper
Years? The Apoſtles gathered Churches among Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
that never heard of Chriſt before; and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many thouſand Souls that were never once told of
a Saviour, or the Way to Salvation, till they had paſt
a great part of their Lives. If you loitered till the
latter part of the Day, it behoved you then to have
beſtirred your ſelves the more; and not to ſay,
Through the Fault of my Parents, I loſt the beginning
of my Life, and therefore I will loſe all; they taught me
not then, and therefore I will not learn now: Have you
not ſeen ſome of your Neighbours who were as ill edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
as your ſelves, attain to much Knowledg after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by their Induſtry? and why might not you have
done ſo, if you had been as induſtrious as they? May
not God and Conſcience witneſs, that it was becauſe
you cared not for Knowledg, and would not be at pains
to get it, that you knew no more? Speak truth, Man,
in the Preſence of thy Judg; was thy Heart and Mind
ſet upon it? Didſt thou pray daily for it to God? Didſt
thou uſe all the means thou couldſt to get it? Didſt thou
attend diligently on the Word in publick, and think of
what thou heardſt when thou cameſt home? Didſt thou
go to the Miniſter, or to others that could teach
thee, and intreat them to tell thee the Way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?
Or didſt thou not rather careleſly neglect
theſe Matters, and hear a Sermon as a common tale,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63044:90"/>


even when the Miniſter was ſpeaking of Heaven or of
Hell? It was not then thine unavoidable Ignorance, but
thy Negligence.</p>
            <p>Yea further, anſwer as in the Preſence of God; Didſt
tou obey ſo far as thou <hi>didſt know?</hi> Or didſt thou
not rather ſin againſt that Knowledg which thou hadſt?
Thou kneweſt that the Soul was better than the Body,
and everlaſting Life more to be regarded than this
tranſitory Life; but didſt thou regard it accordingly?
Thou ſure kneweſt that God was better than the
World, and Heaven than Earth: at leaſt thou waſt told
of it, but didſt thou accordingly value him, and love
him more? Thou kneweſt ſure that there was no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
without Faith, and Repentance, and newneſs
of Life, and yet they were neglected. In a word, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a thouſand Sins which were committed, and Duties
that were omitted againſt thy own Knowledg and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
will marr this Excuſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fifth Excuſe.</hi> I lived not under a powerful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

Miniſter was, with a little pains? Yea, did not
the very plain Word that you heard read, tell you of
theſe things? and might you not have had a Bible your
ſelves, and found them there?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſixth Excuſe.</hi> I was a Servant, and had no time
from my Labour to mind theſe matters; I lived with an hard
Maſter that required all his own Work of me, but would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me no time for the Service of God. <hi>Or elſe,</hi> I was a
poor Man, and had a great Charge to look after, and with
my hard Labour had much ado to live, ſo that I had no time
for heavenly things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Who ſhould be firſt ſerved, God or
Man? What ſhould be firſt ſought after, Heaven
or Earth? Did not Chriſt tell thee, <hi>One thing is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary?
Luke</hi> 10. 41, 42. Was it not as needful to ſee
that you eſcape Damnation, and get ſafe to Heaven
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63044:91"/>
when this Life is ended, as to ſee that you had Food
and Raiment for your ſelves and yours?</p>
            <p>2. Did you ſpend no time in Recreation, nor Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
nor vain talking? why might not that at leaſt have
been ſpent about heavenly things?</p>
            <p>3. Could you have taken no time from your reſt, or
eating, or at other Intermiſſions? Man's Body will not
endure ſo great Labours as have no Intermiſſion. And
why then might not Godlineſs have been your Eaſe and
Recreation?</p>
            <p>4. Or might you not have minded theſe things ever
when you were about your Labour, if you had but a
Heart to them?</p>
            <p>5. At leaſt you might have ſpent the Lord's own
Day in hearing, reading and pondering of theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
when you were forced to forbear your worldly
Labours, even by the wholeſom Law of the Land.
Theſe therefore are all but vain Excuſes; and God will

Were not Miniſters as earneſt with you even
Week to repent and amend? What did Men entice

with the Promiſe of endleſs unconceivable Felicity!
And if this were a ſmaller Matter in your Eyes than
the other, then you have had your choice; be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

you had the good things which you choſe, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

aſhamed of him before Men, he would be aſhamed of
you before his Father and the Angels of Heaven?
<hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38. He ſuffered more than Scorns for you:
and could not you ſuffer a Scorn for him and your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
ſeeing you choſe rather to endure everlaſting
Torment, than a little deriſion from ignorant Men,
take that which you made choice of. And ſeeing ſo
ſmall a Matter would drive you from Heaven, and part
God and you, as a Mock, as the Wind of a Man's Mouth,
no wonder if you be commanded to Depart from him
into everlaſting Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The tenth Excuſe.</hi> I had ungodly Perſons to my Parents,

Seeing therefore you have choſen rather to
ſuffer from God for ever for your Sin, than to ſuffer
ſmall Matters for well-doing for a Moment, you muſt
ever bear your own Choice. Chriſt told you before-and,
that if you could not forſake all the World and
your own Lives for him, you could not be his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37, 38, 39. And ſeeing you thought

               <hi>The eleventh Excuſe.</hi> I ſaw ſo many follow their
pleaſure and their worldly Buſineſs, and never look after theſe
higher things, and ſo few go the other way, that I thought
ſure God would not damn ſo great a Part of the World, and
therefore I ventured to do as the moſt did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God will make good his Word upon many or

For his Will he hath told it you in his Word. For his

that the Gate was ſtrait, and the Way to Heaven was
narrow, and few did find it; and the Gate to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was wide, and the Way was broad, and many did
enter in at it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 13, 14. And if you would not
believe him, you muſt bear what your Unbelief hath
brought you to. What if you had twenty Children,
or Servants, or Friends, and the greater part of them
ſhould prove falſe to you and ſeek your Deſtruction,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63044:93"/>
or prove diſobedient, and turn to your Enemy? would
you think it a good Excuſe if the reſt ſhould do the
like becauſe of their Example? will you therefore
wrong God becauſe you ſee others wrong him? would
you ſpit in the Face of your own Father if you ſaw

2. So much as is of Neceſſity to Salvation, is as plain
as you could deſire. Yet if you be judged by theſe,
you will be condemned: For you did not obey that
which was moſt plain. What Darkneſs is in ſuch Words
as theſe, <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all periſh,</hi> Luke 13.
3, 5. <hi>Love not the World, nor the things in the World: if

            <p>3. If there had been nothing that ſeemed difficult
to you, would you not have deſpiſed its ſimplicity,
and have thought your ſelves wiſe enough at the firſt
Reading, and needed no more?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourteenth Excuſe.</hi> There were ſo many ſeeming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Contradictions were in your fancy, that
did not underſtand the Word which you read. Muſt
the raw unexperienced Learner deſpiſe his Book or
Teacher, as oft as in his Ignorance he thinks he meets
with Contradictions? Did you think God was no wiſer
than you, and underſtood not himſelf, becauſe you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
him not? Nor could reconcile his own Words,
becauſe you could not reconcile them? You would
needs be a Judg of the Law, inſtead of obeying it, and
ſpeak evil of it rather than do it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p>2. And thoſe things which you called improbable in
the Word, were the Wonders of God, of purpoſe
to confirm it. If it had not been confirmed by Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
you would have thought it unproved; and yet
now it is ſo confirmed, you will not believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
becauſe the Witneſs ſeems incredible. And that
is, becauſe they are Matters above the Power of Man:
as if they were therefore above the Power of God!
You ſhall at laſt have your Eyes ſo far opened, as to ſee

               <hi>The fifteenth Excuſe.</hi> It ſeemed ſo unlikely a thing
to me, that the merciful God ſhould damn moſt of the

that his Word ſhould be falſe?</p>
            <p>2. Should it not have ſeemed as unlikely that the
Governour of the World ſhould be unjuſt, and ſuffer his
Law to be unexecuted, and the worſt to ſpeed as well as
the beſt, and to ſuffer vile ſinful Duſt to deſpiſe his
Mercy, and abuſe his Patience, and turn all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
againſt him without due Puniſhment?</p>
            <p>3. Did you not feel Pain and Miſery begin in this
Life?</p>
            <p>4. You ſaw Toads and Serpents which had never ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
And you would rather live in any tolerable Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
than be a Toad. And is it not Reaſon that it
ſhould go worſe with contemptuous Sinners, than with
thoſe Creatures that never ſinned?</p>
            <p>5. Could you expect that thoſe ſhould come to
Heaven, that would not believe there was ſuch a

you imagine, if you would not believe <hi>Moſes</hi> and
the Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, neither would
you have believed though one had riſen from the dead:
For God's Word is more credible than a dead Man's:
and Chriſt did riſe from the dead to atteſt it. Bleſſed

Were you afraid of being a loſer by it? Could not

that is, the accepting thankfully, and minding, and

one to blame for the loſs of it but your ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The eighteenth Excuſe.</hi> It was God that made me of
a ſenſual Nature: He gave me an Appetite to Meat, and
Drink, and Eaſe, and Luſt: he gave me that Fleſh which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uled me; how then can he condemn me, for living according
to the Nature which he gave me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He gave that Appetite to be exerciſed mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
under the Rule of Reaſon, for the Preſervation
and Propagation of Mankind: But did he not alſo give
you Reaſon to govern that Appetite? and the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Will to guide that Reaſon? He gave you
your Fleſh to be a Servant, and not a Maſter. Your
Beaſt hath fleſhly Appetite without Reaſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63044:96"/>
God hath put him under you, who have Reaſon
that you ſhould rule him. Will you let your Beaſt
do what he liſt, and madly run upon whom he liſt,
and ſay, you do but let him live according to his Nature
which God hath given him? Why God that gave him
ſuch a Nature, did intend him to be ruled by a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Nature, even by the Reaſon which he gave to
you: and ſo he did alſo by your Fleſh and ſenſual
Appetite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The nineteenth Excuſe.</hi> But I lived among ſo many
Baits which enticed this Fleſh, that I could not reſiſt them.
My Meat was a Snare to me, my Drink a Snare, my Clothes,
my Houſe, my Land a Snare, every Beauty that I ſaw was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Snare: and the better all theſe were, the ſtronger was my
Snare. If God would not have had my Heart enſnared and
drawn from him, he ſhould not have put ſo many Baits in my
way. Yea and they were ſo <hi>near</hi> to me, and <hi>daily</hi> with me,
that though I was reſolved to forbear them before, yet whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
they were brought to my hand, I could not forbear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is this the Thanks that God hath for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?
He ſent you all theſe as Favours from his own
hand: he wrote his own Name upon them, that in
them you might ſee his Power, and Wiſdom, and
Goodneſs, and ſo be led up to the Conſideration of
him, that you might fall in love with himſelf, who was
the Fountain, the Life, the End of all. And do you
overlook God in the Creature, and live as without him
in the World, and dote upon that which ſhould have
drawn you to himſelf, and then lay the Blame on
God? If he ſend a Sutor to ſpeak to you in his Name,
and write you a Love-Letter with his own Hand, will
you fall in love with the Meſſengers or the Letter, and
neglect the Sender, and then blame him that wrote his
Letter on ſo fair a Paper, or in ſo neat a Hand, or that
ſent it by ſuch a comely Meſſenger? Certainly, theſe
Excuſes are too groſs, to take with the wiſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
God, or to ſeem ſufficient to a well informed
Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:63044:96"/>
2. And whereas you ſpeak of the Power of theſe
Objects, was there not much more in God, in Chriſt,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the promiſed Glory, to have drawn your Heart ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Way? Why then did not theſe take as much with
you as the other? You could not chooſe forſooth, but be
enticed with ſuch Baits as were fitted to your ſenſual
Appetite, and ſuch things as a Dog, or a Swine may
enjoy as well as a Man: but you could <hi>chooſe,</hi> when
Chriſt and Glory were offered you: yea you did <hi>chooſe</hi>
to refuſe the Offer, and tread them under Feet by
your neglect. When Satan ſet your Cups, and your
Harlots, and your Profits before you on one ſide; did
not God ſet his Favour and everlaſting Happineſs on
the other ſide? And was it wiſe or equal Dealing, to
prefer your Luſts before that Glory?</p>
            <p>3. Moreover, it was not in the Power of any of
thoſe Baits to force your Will, or to neceſſitate you to
chooſe them. They could be but <hi>Baits</hi> to entice you,
and it was ſtill in your own Choice, whether you
would yield to the Enticement, and chooſe them or not.
Shall every Man be falſe to God that hath any Bait to
entice him from him? will you excuſe your Child or
Friend, if he would be falſe to you, upon as great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements
as theſe? If a Cup of Drink, or a Whore,
or a little Gain, could draw him more than all your

            <p>And whereas you ſpeak of the <hi>nearneſs</hi> and <hi>continuance</hi>
of theſe Allurements, I would fain know, was not
God as <hi>near</hi> you, <hi>continually</hi> near you, to draw you

and Blood cannot. Did he not ſtand by you when
you were in your Cups and luſtful Pleaſures? Did
he not tell you of the Danger, and offer you far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things, if you would obey him and deſpiſe thoſe
Baits? But you would hearken to none of this; you
ſhould have remembred that he ſtood over you, and
was looking on you, and you ſhould have ſaid as <hi>Joſeph,</hi>

Reaſon near you, and Conſcience near you, as well as
the Bait was near you. And therefore this is a vain
Excuſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The twentieth Excuſe.</hi> It was God that let looſe the
Devil to tempt me; and he was too ſubtile for me to deal
with; and therefore what wonder if I ſinned and were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He did nor let looſe the Devil to <hi>conſtrain</hi>
you to Sin. He could but <hi>entice,</hi> and you might chooſe
whether you would yield. The Devil could neither
make you ſin againſt your Will, nor yet neceſſitate
you to be willing.</p>
            <p>2. You were a ſure Friend to Chriſt that while,
that would forſake him as oft as you were tempted by
the Devil. Is that a Friend or a Servant worthy to be
regarded, that will diſobey you, or betray you as oft as
he is tempted to it?</p>
            <p>3. Will you excuſe your Servant if he leave your
Work undone, and follow Cards, or Dice, or the Ale-houſe,
and ſay I was tempted to it by one that was cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninger
than I? Shall every Murderer or Thief eſcape
hanging, becauſe the Devil was too cunning for him in
his Temptations? Would you have the Jury or the
Judg to take this for a good Excuſe?</p>
            <p>4. And why did you not hearken to God that enticed
you the other way? You forget what Helps he afforded
you to diſcover the Wiles of Satan, and to vanquiſh
the Temptation? He <hi>told</hi> you it was an Enemy that
tempted you: and would you hearken to an Enemy?
He <hi>told</hi> you it was a Dream, a Shadow, a painted Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
a guilded Carcaſs, a lying Promiſe, and deceitful
Vanity by which you were tempted; and yet would
you regard it before your God? He told you that it
was your God, your Saviour, your Hope, your everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Happineſs that the Tempter would beguile you of:
And yet would you be beguiled? He told you, and

               <hi>The one and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> But I hope you will
not ſay that all Men have <hi>Free Will!</hi> And if my Will were
not free, how could I chooſe but ſin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Your Will was not free from God's Rule and
Government. 2. Nor was it free from its natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Good in general; for either of theſe were
more properly Slavery. 3. Nor was it free from the
Influence of a dark Underſtanding. 4. Nor free from
its own contracted vitious Inclination. 5. Nor freed
from the Temptations of the Fleſh, the World, and
the Devil.</p>
            <p>But it was, 1. Free from any natural Determination
to Evil, or to any thing that was doubtful. 2. And free
from the Coaction or Violence of any. 3. And free
from an irreſiſtible Determination of any exteriour
Cauſe, at leaſt ordinarily. So that naturally, as Men,
you have the Power or Faculty of determining your
own Wills, and by your Wills of ruling your inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Faculties in a great meaſure; yea, of ruling the
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſes and the Phantaſy it ſelf, which doth ſo much to
diſpoſe of our Underſtanding. And if your Wills,
which are naturally free, are yet ſo habitually vitious,
that they encline you to do evil, that is not an Excuſe,
but an Aggravation of your Sin. But of this more
under the next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:63044:98"/>
               <hi>The two and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> But I have not Power
of my ſelf to do any thing that is good: what can the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
do? without Chriſt we can do nothing. It is God that
muſt give me Ability, or I can have none: and if he had given
it me, I had not been an Vnbeliever or Impenitent. I can no
more believe of my ſelf, than I can fulfil the Law of my
ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe are the vain Cavils of learned
Folly, which God will eaſily anſwer in a Word. The
Word [Power] is taken in ſeveral Senſes. Sometime,
and moſt commonly and fitly, for a Faculty or a Strength
by which a Man <hi>can</hi> do his Duty if he <hi>will.</hi> This phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Power you have, and the worſt of Sinners have
while they are Men on Earth. Were they actually wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
they might acceptably perform ſincere Obedience;
and were they diſpoſitively willing, they might actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
believe and will. And thus the Ungodly have Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to believe.</p>
            <p>Sometime the word [Power] is taken for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or Leave, for legal or civil Power. And thus you
have all not only Power or Liberty to believe, but alſo
a Command which makes it your Duty, and a Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
adjoined, which will condemn you if you do
not.</p>
            <p>Sometime the Word [Power] is taken ethically,
and leſs properly, for a Diſpoſition, Inclination, Habit,
or Freedom from the contrary Habit or Diſpoſition.
And in this Senſe it's true, that none but the effectually
called have a Power to believe. But then obſerve,
1. That this is but a Moral, leſs proper, and not a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
proper Impotency: And therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> chuſeth
rather to ſay that all Men have <hi>power</hi> to believe, but all
have not a <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf; becauſe we uſe to
difference <hi>Power</hi> from <hi>Willingneſs;</hi> and <hi>Willingneſs</hi> actuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>Power</hi> which we had before. And therefore our
Divines chooſe rather to call Grace a Habit when they
ſpeak exactly, than a Power; and Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> derides
the Arminians for talking of a <hi>Power</hi> ſubjected in a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63044:98"/>
               <hi>Power.</hi> 2. Note that this Impotency is but the ſame
thing with your Unwillingneſs and wilful Blindneſs in
another Word. 3. Note that this Impotency is long of
your ſelves as to the Original, and much more as to the
not curing and removing of it. Hath God given you
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o means towards the Cure of this Diſability, which
you have neglected? 4. Note that this Impotency is
not a juſt Excuſe, but an Aggravation of your Sin. If
you were <hi>willing</hi> to be the Servant of Chriſt, and yet
were not able either becauſe he would not accept you,
or becauſe of a want of natural Faculties, or becauſe of
ſome other natural Difficulty which the <hi>willingeſt</hi> Mind
could not overcome, this were ſome Excuſe: But to
be habitually wilful in refuſing Grace, is worſe than
to be meerly actually unwilling. If a Man have ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
himſelf to Murder, Drunkenneſs, Stealing or
the like Wickedneſs, ſo far that he cannot leave it,
will you therefore forgive him, or will any Judg or Jury
hold him excuſed? Or rather think him the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for Mercy? 5. Note alſo that the want of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Habit, no nor the Preſence of the contrary
Habit, do not efficiently determine the Will to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Acts, much leſs take away its natural Freedom.
6. And that till Habits attain an utter Predominancy,
(at leaſt) there is a Power remaining in the Will
to reſiſt them, and uſe Means againſt them. Though
eventually the perverſe Inclination may hinder the uſe
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The three and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> I have heard from
learned Men, that God doth determine all Actions, natural and
free, as the firſt efficient phyſical immediate Cauſe: or elſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could act. And then it was not long of me that I choſe
forbidden Objects, but of him that irreſiſtibly moved me thereto,
and whoſe Inſtrument I was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a trick of that Wiſdom which is
Fooliſhneſs with God, and to be deceived by vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:63044:99"/>
1. The very Principle it ſelf is moſt likely to be falſe,
and thoſe that tell you this do err. Much more, I
think, may be ſaid againſt it than for it.</p>
            <p>2. I am ſure it is either falſe, or irreconcileable with
God's Holineſs, and Man's Liberty and Culpability; ſo
that its a mad thing to deceive your ſelves with ſuch
philoſophical Uncertainties, when the Truth which
you oppoſe by it is infallibly certain. That God is not
the Author of Sin, but Man himſelf, who is juſtly
condemned for it, is undoubtedly true: and would
you obſcure ſo clear a Truth, by ſearching into Points
beyond humane Reach if not unſound, as you conclude
them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The four and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> But at leaſt, thoſe
learned Divines among us that doubt of this, do yet ſay that
the Will is neceſſarily and infallibly determined by the practical
Vnderſtanding, and that is as much unreſiſtibly neceſſitated
by Objects: and therefore whatever act was done by my Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
or Will, was this neceſſitated, and I could not help
it. They ſay, Liberty is but the Acting of the Faculty agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to its Nature: And it was God as Creator that gave
<hi>Adam</hi> his Faculties, and God by providential Diſpoſe, that
preſented all Objects to him, by which his Vnderſtanding, and
ſo his Will were unavoidably neceſſitated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is of the ſame Nature with the former;
uncertain, if not certainly falſe. Were this true,
for ought we can ſee, it would lay all the Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
of this World on God, as the unreſiſtible neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
Cauſe; which becauſe we know infallibly to be
falſe, we have no reaſon to take ſuch Principles to be
true which infer it. The Underſtanding doth not by
a neceſſary Efficiency determine the Will, but morally;
or rather, is regularly a Condition or neceſſary Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
without which it may not determine it ſelf.
Yea the Will by commanding the Senſe and Phantaſy,
doth much to determine the Underſtanding. As the
Eye is not neceſſary to my <hi>going,</hi> but to my <hi>going right,</hi>
ſo is not the Underſtanding's Guidance neceſſary to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63044:99"/>
my <hi>willing,</hi> (there the ſimple Apprehenſion may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice)
but to my <hi>right willing.</hi> There are other ways
of determining the Will. Or if the Underſtanding did
determine the Will efficiently and neceſſarily, it is not
every act of the Underſtanding that muſt do it. If it
be ſo, when it ſaith, This <hi>muſt</hi> be done, and ſaith it
importunately; yet not when it only ſaith, This may
be done, or you may venture on it, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
part which it hath in Sin.</p>
            <p>I am not pleaſed that theſe curious Objections fall
in the Way, nor do I delight to put them into vulgar
Heads; but finding many young Scholars and others that
have converſed with them, aſſaulted with theſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
I thought meet to give a Touch, and but a
Touch, to take them out of their Way: As Mr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
hath done more fully in the Preface to his <hi>Hidden
Manna,</hi> on this laſt point, to which I refer you. I
only add this.</p>
            <p>The Will of Man in its very Dominion doth bear
God's Image. It is a ſelf-determining Power, though
it be <hi>biaſſed</hi> by <hi>Habits,</hi> and <hi>needs</hi> a <hi>Guide.</hi> As the Heart
and Vital Spirits by which it acteth, are to the reſt of
the Body, ſo is it to the Soul. The Light of Nature
hath taught all the World to carry the Guilt of every
Crime to the <hi>Will</hi> of Man, and there to leave it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this all Laws and Judgments are grounded. From Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and intellectual Weakneſs, Men commonly fetch
Excuſes for their Faults; but from the Will they are ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated.
If we think it ſtrange that Man's Will ſhould
be the firſt Cauſe, ſo much as of a ſinful <hi>Mode,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
all occurring Objections: it may ſuffice that we are
certain the Holy Majeſty is not the Author of Sin; and
he is able to make all this as plain as the Sun, and eaſily
anſwer all theſe vain Excuſes, though we ſhould be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And if we be much ignorant of the Frame and
Motions of our own Souls, and eſpecially of that high
ſelf-determining Principle, free-Will, the great Spring
of our Actions, and the curious Engine by which God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63044:100"/>
doth <hi>ſapientially</hi> govern the World, it is no wonder, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that the Soul can know it ſelf but by Reflection,
and God gave us a Soul to <hi>uſe,</hi> rather than to know it
ſelf; and to know its Qualities and Operations, rather
than its Eſſence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The five and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> No Man can be ſaved,
nor avoid any Sin, nor believe in Chriſt, but thoſe whom God
hath predeſtinated thereto. I was under an irreverſible Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
before I was born: and therefore I do nothing but what
I was predeſtinated to do; and if God decreed not to ſave me,
how could I help it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God's Judgments are more plain, but his
Decrees or ſecret Purpoſes are myſterious: And to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Certainties, by having recourſe to Points obſcure, is
no part of Chriſtian Wiſdom. God told you your
Duty in his Word, and on what Terms you muſt be
judged to Life or Death; hither ſhould you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
for Direction, and not to the unſearchable My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of his <hi>Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. God decreeth not to condemn any but for Sin. Sin,
I ſay, is the Cauſe of that Condemnation, though not
of his Decree.</p>
            <p>3. God's Decrees are Acts Immanent in himſelf,
and make no change on you, and therefore do not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate
you to ſin, any more than his Fore-knowledg
doth. For both cauſe only a neceſſity of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
which is Logical, as the Divines on both ſides
do confeſs. And therefore this no more cauſed you to
ſin, than if there had been no ſuch Decree. And it's a
Doubt whether that Decree be not negative; a willing
Suſpending of the Divine Will, as to evil; or at moſt
a Purpoſe to permit it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſix and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> If it be no more, yet
doth it make my Perdition unavoidable; for even God's Fore
knowledg doth ſo; for if he foreknow it, all the World cannot
hinder it from coming to paſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Muſt God either be ignorant of what you
will do, or elſe be the Cauſe of it? If you foreknow
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63044:100"/>
that the Sun will riſe to morrow, that doth not cauſe it
to riſe. If you foreknow that one Man will murder
another, you are not the Cauſe of it by foreknowing
it. So is it here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſeven and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> God might have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
my Sin and Damnation if he would.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And will you wilfully ſin, and think to eſcape
becauſe God doth not hinder you? The Prince that
makes a Law againſt Murder, could lock you up, and
keep you from being a Murderer. But are you excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
if he do not? We are certain that God could have
hindered all the Sin and Death, and Confuſion, and
Miſery that is in the Word: and we are as certain that
he doth not hinder it (but by forbidding it, and giving
Men means againſt it:) and we are certain that he is
Juſt, and Good, and Wiſe in all, and not bound to
hinder it: And what his Reaſons are, you may better
know hereafter: In the mean time, you had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
have looked to your own Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The eight and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> How could I be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
if Chriſt did not die for me? He died but for his Elect;
and none could be ſaved without his Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He <hi>did</hi> die for you, and for more than his
Elect, though he abſolutely purpoſed only their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Your Sins crucified him, and your Debt lay
upon him; and he ſo far ranſomed you, that nothing
but your wilful Refuſal of the Benefits could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The nine and twentieth Excuſe.</hi> It was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin
that brought me into this Depravedneſs of <hi>Will,</hi> which I can
neither cure, nor could prevent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If <hi>Adam</hi> caſt away his Holineſs, he could
no more convey that to us which he caſt away, than a
Nobleman that is a Traitor, can convey his loſt Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
or Honours to his Son.</p>
            <p>2. You periſh not only for your Original Sin, but for
rejecting the recovering Mercy of the Redeemer: you
might have had Chriſt and Life in him for the accepting.</p>

               </gap>
without his Gift I could not have it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God will juſtly require more than he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;
that is, the improvement of his Gifts, as <hi>Mat.</hi>
25. ſhews. He gave <hi>Adam</hi> but a <hi>Power</hi> to perſevert,
and not <hi>actual Perſeverance:</hi> Yet did he juſtly puniſh
him for want of the Act; even for not uſing by his
own Wll the Power which he had given him.</p>
            <p>2. It is long of your ſelf if God did not give you
Grace to believe: It was becauſe you wilfully refuſed
ſome preparatory Grace. Chriſt found you at a great
diſtance from him, and he gave you Grace ſufficient
to have brought you <hi>nearer</hi> to him than you were; you
had Grace ſufficient to have made you better than you
were, and reſtrained many Sins, and brought you to the
means, when you turned your back on them: tho this
were not <hi>ſufficient</hi> to cauſe you to <hi>believe,</hi> it was <hi>ſufficient</hi>
to have brought you <hi>nearer</hi> to <hi>believing;</hi> and through
your own wilfulneſs, became <hi>not effectual;</hi> even as <hi>Adam</hi>
had <hi>ſufficient</hi> Grace to have ſtood, which was <hi>not effectual.</hi>
So that you had not only Chriſt offered to you, if you
would but accept him; but you had daily and precious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Helps and Means, to have cured your Wills, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

and he hath told you how far it ſhall extend.</p>
            <p>4. He is infinitely merciful, but it is to the Heirs of
Mercy, not to the final Rejecters of his Mercy.</p>
            <p>5. Hath not God been merciful to thee in bearing
with thee ſo long, and offering thee Grace in the Blood
of Chriſt, till thou didſt wilfully reject it? Thou wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

had he not been ſo merciful, thou wouldſt not have

            <p>The five and thirtieth Excuſe. <hi>I would not ſo torment
mine Enemy my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No reaſon you ſhould. Is it all one to wrong
you, and to wrong the God of Heaven? God is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Judg of his own Wrongs.</p>
            <p>The ſixth and thirtieth Excuſe. <hi>All Men are Sinners;
and I was but a Sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All were not impenitent, unbelieving, rebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Sinners, and therefore all are not unpardoned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Sinners. All did not live after the Fleſh, and
refuſe to the laſt to be converted as you did. God will
teach you better to difference between Sinners and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſeven and thirtieth Excuſe.</hi> But if Chriſt
have ſatisfied for my Sins, and died for me, then how
can I juſtly ſuffer for the ſame Sins? will God puniſh one Sin
twice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt ſuffered for Man in the Chriſt
of Man; but not in your Perſon, nor you in him. It
was not you that provided the Price, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
Chriſt was not Man's Delegate in ſatisfying, and
therefore received not his Inſtructions from us, nor did
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63044:101"/>
on our Terms, but his own. It was not the <hi>ſame
thing</hi> which the Law threatned, that Chriſt underwent:
for that was the Damnation of the Sinner himſelf, and
not the Suffering of another for him; it cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be yours but on Chriſt's own Terms. He died
for thy Sin, but with this intent, that for all that if thou
refuſe him, thou ſhalt die thy ſelf. It is therefore no
wrong to thee to die, for it was not thou that diedſt
before, and Chriſt will take it for no wrong to him:
for <hi>he</hi> will judg thee to that Death. It is for refuſing
a Chriſt that died for thee, that thou muſt periſh for
ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The eight and thirtieth Excuſe.</hi> But I did not refuſe
Chriſt. I believed and truſted in him to the laſt; and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of my Sins, though I ſometime was overtaken with
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Had this been true, thy Sin would not have
condemned thee. But there is no mocking God. He
will ſhew thee then thy naked Heart, and convince
thouſands that thought they believed and repented, that
indeed they did not. By thy Works alſo will this be
diſcovered, that is, by the main bent and ſcope of thy
Life, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. throughout, and <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The nine and thirtieth Excuſe.</hi> I did many good
Works; and I hope God will ſet thoſe againſt my evil
Works:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thy good Works were thy Sins, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they were not good, being not done in ſincerity of
Heart for God. The beſt Man's Works have ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
which nothing can cleanſe but the Blood of
Chriſt, which thou haſt made light of, and therefore
haſt no part in. If all thy Life had been ſpent in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Works except one day, they would not make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the Sins of that Day. For they are but part
of thy Duty. Wo to him that hath no better a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
at Judgment, than his own good Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fortieth Excuſe.</hi> I lived in Poverty and Miſery on
Earth, and therefore I hope I have had my Suffering here,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63044:102"/>
and ſhall not ſuffer in this World and another too.</p>
            <p>1. By that Rule all poor Men and Murderers, and
Thieves that are tormented and hanged, ſhould be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But as Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of this Life
and that to come, ſo Impenitency and Wickedneſs hath
the Threatning of this Life and that to come.</p>
            <p>2. The Devils and the damned have ſuffered much
more than you already; and yet they are never the
nearer a Deliverance. When thou haſt ſuffered
ten thouſand Years, thy Pain will be never the nearer
an end. How then can a little Miſery on Earth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it? Alas, poor Soul, theſe are but the Foretaſts and
Beginnings of thy Sorrow. Nothing but Pardon
through the Blood of Chriſt could have prevented thy
Condemnation; and that thou rejectedſt by Infidelity
and Impenitency. <hi>His</hi> Sufferings would have ſaved thee,
if thou hadſt not refuſed him; but all thy own Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
will yield thee no Relief.</p>
            <p>So much for the anſwering of the <hi>vain Excuſes</hi> which
poor Sinners are ready to make for themſelves; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I have been ſo large, as that this part I confeſs is
diſproportionable to the reſt: but it was for theſe two
Reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. That poor careleſs Souls might ſee the Vanity of
ſuch Defences; and conſider if ſuch a Worm as I can
eaſily confute them, how eaſily and how terribly will
they be all anſwered by their Judg?</p>
            <p>2. I did it the rather, that godly Chriſtians might
the better underſtand how to deal with theſe vain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
when they meet with them: which will be daily
if they deal with Men in this ſad Condition.</p>
            <p>X. We have done with that part of the Judgment
which conſiſteth in the Exploration or Trial of the
Cauſe: we now come to that which is the Concluſion
and Conſummation of all; and that is, to ſhew you
<hi>what the Sentence will be, and on whom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:63044:102"/>
And for this, we muſt go ſtrait to the Word of God
for our Light, it being impoſſible for any Man to have
any particular Knowledg of it, if Chriſt had not there
revealed it unto us. Indeed almoſt all the World do
acknowledg a Life after this, where it ſhall go well with
the Good, and ill with the bad. But who ſhall be
then accounted <hi>righteous,</hi> and who <hi>unrighteous,</hi> and on
what Terms and Grounds, by whom they ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and to what Condition, they know not.</p>
            <p>The Sentence in Judgment will be, 1. Either on
thoſe that never had Means to know Chriſt. 2. Or
on thoſe that had.</p>
            <p>1. For the former, as it leſs concerneth us to enquire
of their Caſe, ſo it is more obſcurely revealed to us in
the Scripture. It is certain that they ſhall be judged
according to their Uſe of the Means which they had,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. and the Talents which
they received, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. But that it ever falleth out that
he that hath but the one Talent of natural Helps, doth
improve it to Salvation; or that ever they who knew
not Chriſt, are juſtified and ſaved without that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
(being at Age and Uſe of Reaſon) I find not in
the Scriptures. I find indeed that [as many as have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without Law, ſhall alſo periſh without Law: and as
many as have ſinned <hi>in</hi> the Law, ſhall be judged <hi>by</hi> the
Law <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12. but not that any are juſtified by
the Works of Nature, ſuch as are here ſaid to be <hi>without</hi>
Law.] I find alſo, that [They have the Work of the
Law written in their Hearts, their Conſcience alſo bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
witneſs, and their Thoughts the mean while accuſing,
or elſe excuſing one another, in the Day <hi>when</hi> God ſhall
jude the Secrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to
the Goſpel] <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15, 16. And I believe it is a <hi>juſt
Excuſe,</hi> and not an <hi>unjuſt</hi> which is here meant. But it
will be but an <hi>Excuſe</hi> ſo far as they were guiltleſs: and
that will be but <hi>in tanto,</hi> and not <hi>in toto,</hi> in part only;
and ſo not a full Juſtification. A Heathen's Conſcience
may excuſe him from thoſe Sins which he was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63044:103"/>
never guilty of; but not from all. But no more of
them.</p>
            <p>2. The Caſe of thoſe that have had the Goſpel, is
more plainly opened to us in God's Word. Their
<hi>Sentence</hi> is opened in many Places of Scripture, but
moſt fully in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. whence we will now collect
it.</p>
            <p>There we find that Jeſus Chriſt the Redeemer, as
King of the World, ſhall ſit in Judgment on all Men at
the laſt; and ſhall ſeparate them one from another,
as a Shepherd divideth the Sheep from the Goats,
and ſo ſhall paſs the final Sentence. This Sentence is
twofold, according to the different Condition of them
that are judged. To them on the right Hand, there
is a Sentence of Juſtification, and Adjudication to
everlaſting Glory: To them on the left Hand, there
is a Sentence of Condemnation to everlaſting Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Sentence on each of theſe containeth both the
State which they are judged to, and the Reaſon or
Cauſe of the Judgment to that State. For as God will
not judg any to Life or Death without juſt Cauſe, ſo he
will publiſh this Cauſe in his Sentence, as it is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Judges to do. If you ſay, <hi>Chriſt will not uſe a
Voice;</hi> let it ſatisfy, that though we know not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
yet if he do it but by mental Diſcovery, as he
ſhews Men <hi>what</hi> ſhall everlaſtingly befal them, ſo he will
ſhew them <hi>why</hi> it ſhall ſo befal them.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Sentence</hi> on them on the <hi>right</hi> Hand, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
1. Their Juſtification and Adjudication to <hi>Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and that both as generally denominated, and as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
determined and deſcribed. 2. And the
Cauſe of this Judgment.</p>
            <p>1. In general they ſhall be pronounced <hi>Bleſſed.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
would have had them curſed and miſerable: the
Law did curſe them to Miſery; many a fearful Though
hath poſſeſſed their own Breaſts, leſt they ſhould
prove at laſt accurſed and miſerable: but now they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63044:103"/>
hear the contrary from their Judg. All the Promiſes
in the Goſpel could not perfectly overcome thoſe their
Fears; all the comfortable Words of the Miniſters
of the Goſpel could not perfectly ſubdue them; all the
tender Mercies of God in Chriſt did not perfectly ſubdue
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but now they are vanquiſhed all for ever. He
that once had heard his Redeemer in Judgment call him
<hi>bleſſed,</hi> will never fear being <hi>curſed</hi> more. For he that
Chriſt bleſſeth, ſhall be <hi>bleſſed</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>The Deſcription of their Bleſſedneſs followeth,
<hi>Come inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World.</hi> And alſo they are called <hi>Bleſſed
of the Father.</hi> Here is the Fountain of their Bleſſedneſs,
the Father; and the State of their Bleſſedneſs in being
the Father's: for I ſuppoſe they are called <hi>the Bleſſed of
are Father,</hi> both becauſe the Father bleſſeth them, that
is, makes them Happy, and becauſe theſe bleſſed Ones
are the Father's <hi>own.</hi> And ſo Chriſt will publiſh it to
the World in Judgment, that he came to glorify the
Father, and will proclaim him the principal Efficient,
and ultimate End of his Work of Redemption, and the
Bleſſedneſs of his Saints; and that himſelf is (as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator)
but the <hi>Way</hi> to the Father. It is the Father that
<hi>prepared</hi> the Kingdom for them, and <hi>from the Foundation of
the World</hi> prepared it; both for [them] as <hi>choſen ones,</hi>
and for them as <hi>future Believers and righteous Ones.</hi> It is
called a Kingdom, partly in reſpect to God the King, in
whoſe Glory we ſhall partake in our Places; and
partly metapherically, from the Dignity of our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For ſo it is that our ſelves are ſaid to be made
Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. and 5. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. and not that
we are properly Kings; for then we muſt have Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
who muſt be governed by us.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee their Bleſſedneſs in the Fountain, End
and State of Dignity. As to the receptive Act on
their Part, it is expreſſed by two Words; one ſignifying
their firſt Entrance on it, <hi>Come:</hi> the other their <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
Inherit:</hi> That is, poſſeſs it as given by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63044:104"/>
and Redeemed by the Son, and hold it in this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
for ever.</p>
            <p>The true Believer was convinced in this Life, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there was no true Bleſſedneſs, but this Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God in the Kingdom of Heaven. The Lord
revealed this to his Heart by his Word and Spirit.
And therefore he contemned the ſeeming Happineſs on
Earth, and laid up for himſelf a Treaſure in Heaven,
and made him Friends with the Mammon of Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and ventured all his Hope in this Veſſel.
And now he findeth the Wiſdom of that Choice in a
rich Return. God made him ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> a Merchant as to
ſell all for this Pearl of greateſt Price: and therefore
now he ſhall find the Gain. As there is no other true
Happineſs but God in Glory; ſo is there nothing more
<hi>ſutable</hi> and <hi>welcome</hi> to the true Believer. O how wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
will the Face of that God be, whom he <hi>loved,
ſought, longed</hi> and <hi>waited</hi> for! How welcome will
that Kingdom be which he lived in <hi>hope</hi> of, which he
parted with all for, and ſuffered for in the Fleſh! How
glad will he be to ſee the bleſſed Face of his Redeemer,
who by his manifold Grace hath brought him unto this
I leave the believing Soul to think of it, and to make
it the daily matter of his delightful Meditation;
what an unconceivable Joy in one Moment, will this
Sentence of Chriſt will fill his Soul with? Undoubtedly
it is now quite paſt our Comprehenſion; though our
imperfect Forethoughts of it may well make our Lives a
continual Feaſt.</p>
            <p>Were it but our Juſtification from the Accuſations of
Satan, who would have us condemned either as <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
in general, or as impenitent, unbelieving Rebels,
againſt him that redeemed us, in <hi>ſpecial,</hi> it would lift
up the Heads of the Saints in that Day: After all the
Fears of our own Hearts, and the ſlanderous Accuſations
of Satan and the World, That we were either impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Infidels or Hypocrites, Chriſt will then juſtify us
and pronounce us <hi>righteous.</hi> So much for the <hi>Condition
to which</hi> they are judged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:63044:104"/>
2. The Reaſon or Cauſe of this Juſtification of the
Saints, is given us both, 1. In a general Denomination,
and 2. In a particular Deſcription. 1. In general,
it is becauſe they were <hi>righteous,</hi> as is evident, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.
6. <hi>The Righteous ſhall go into Life everlaſting.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is the Buſineſs of every juſt Judg to juſtify the
Righteous, and condemn the Unrighteous. And ſhall
not the Judg of all the Earth judg righteouſly? <hi>Gen.</hi>
18. 25. God makes Men righteous before he judges
them ſo: and judgeth them righteous <hi>becauſe</hi> they are
ſo. He that abominateth that Man who ſaith to the
Righteous, Thou art wicked; or to the Wicked,
Thou art righteous; who juſtifieth the Wicked and
condemneth the Righteous, will certainly never do ſo
himſelf.</p>
            <p>Indeed he will juſtify them that are Sinners, but not
againſt the Accuſation <hi>that they are Sinners,</hi> but againſt
the Accuſation, that <hi>they are guilty of Puniſhment for
Sin:</hi> but that is, becauſe he firſt made them juſt; and
ſo juſtifiable, by pardoning their Sin, through the Blood
of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And it's true alſo, that he will juſtify thoſe that
<hi>were wicked;</hi> but not thoſe that <hi>are wicked:</hi> but Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
findeth them as Death leaveth them, and he will
not take them for wicked, that are ſanctified and
cleanſed of their former Wickedneſs. So that Chriſt
will firſt pardon them before he juſtify them againſt the
Charge of being Sinners in general; and he will firſt
give Men Faith, Repentance and new Obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will juſtify them againſt the Charge of being
Impenitent, Infidels or Hypocrites, and conſequently
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpardoned, and doubly guilty of Damnation. This
twofold Righteouſneſs he will firſt <hi>give</hi> Men, and ſo
conſtiture them juſt, before he will <hi>declare</hi> it, and <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>
them juſt.</p>
            <p>2. The Reaſon of the Sentence, particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
is from their Faith and Love to Chriſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in their Obedience, Self-denial, and forſaking
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63044:105"/>
all for him. <hi>For I was hungry and ye fed me; I was thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and ye gave me daink; I was a Stranger and ye took
me in; naked and ye clothed me: I was ſick and ye viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me: I was in Priſon and ye came to me. Verily I ſay
unto you, inaſmuch as ye have done it to one of the leaſt of
theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me,</hi> Mat. 25. 35 to
41. Here is, 1. The cauſal Conjuction <hi>for.</hi> 2. And
the Cauſe or Reaſon it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Concerning both which, obſerve. 1. How it is
that Man's Obedience and Self-denial is the Reaſon and
Cauſe of his Juſtification. 2. Why it is that God
will have the Reaſon or Cauſe thus declared in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, obſerve that it's one thing to give a
Reaſon of the Sentence, and another thing to expreſs
the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Benefit given</hi> us by the Promiſe, and
<hi>judged</hi> to us by the <hi>Sentence.</hi> Man's Obedience was no
proper Cauſe why God did in this Life <hi>give</hi> Pardon of
Sin to us, or a Right to Glory, much leſs of his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt to die for us. And therefore as to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive
Juſtification at our Converſion, we muſt not
<hi>ſay</hi> or <hi>think</hi> that God doth juſtify us, for, or <hi>becauſe</hi> of
any Works of our Obedience, legal or evangelical.
But when God hath ſo juſtified us, when he comes to
give a Reaſon of his Sentence in Judgment, he may
and will fetch that Reaſon partly from our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or our Performance of the Conditions of the
new Covenant. For as in this Life, we had a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
conſiſting in free Pardon of all Sin through the
Blood of Chriſt, and a Righteouſneſs conſiſting in our
perſonal Performance of the Conditions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
which giveth that Pardon and continueth it to us;
ſo at Judgment we ſhall accordingly be juſtified. And
as our evangelical perſonal Righteouſneſs, commonly
called <hi>inherent,</hi> was at firſt only in our Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Diſpoſition to obey, but afterward in our
actual ſincere Obedience, in which Senſe we are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutively
juſtified or made righteous here by our Works,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63044:105"/>
in <hi>James</hi> his ſenſe, <hi>James</hi> 2. 24. ſo accordingly a double
Reaſon will be aſſigned of our ſentential Juſtification;
one from our Pardon by Chriſt's Blood and Merits,
which will prove our Right to Impunity and to Glory;
the other from our own Faith and holy Obedience,
which will prove our Right to that Pardon through
Chriſt, and to the free Gift of a Right to Glory: and
To this laſt is to be pleaded in Subordination to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
For Chriſt is become the Author of eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to all them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that will be ſaved, muſt have a <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſave him
as the Author, and an <hi>Obedience</hi> to that Chriſt as the
Condition of that Salvation; and conſequently both
muſt be declared in the Judgment.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why the Judg doth mention our good
Works rather than our believing, may be becauſe
thoſe holy ſelf-denying Expreſſions of Faith and Love
to Chriſt do contain or certainly imply Faith in them,
as the Life of the Tree is in the Fruit: but Faith doth
contain our Works of Obedience but only as their
Cauſe. The Works alſo are a Part of the perſonal
Righteouſneſs which is to be enquired after, that is,
we ſhall not be judged righteous, meerly becauſe we
have believed, but alſo becauſe we have added to our
Faith Vertue, and have improved our Talents, and
have loved Chriſt to the hazard of all for his ſake.
For it is not only or principally for the Goodneſs of the
Work conſidered in it ſelf, or the Good that is done by
it to the Poor; but it is as thoſe Works did expreſs our
Faith and Love to Chriſt by doing him the moſt coſtly
and hazardous Service; that by Faith we could ſee
Chriſt in a poor Beggar or a Priſoner, and could love
Chriſt in <hi>theſe</hi> better than our worldly Goods or Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which we muſt part with, or hazard by the Works
that are here mentioned.</p>
            <p>2. The Reaſons why Chriſt will ſo publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the perſonal Righteouſneſs of Men, to be the
Reaſon or Cauſe of his juſtifying Sentence, is becauſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63044:106"/>
it is the Buſineſs of that Day, not only to glorify God's
meer Love and Mercy, but eminently to glorify his
remunerative Juſtice; and not only to expreſs his
Love to the Elect, as ſuch, but to expreſs his Love to
them as <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>obedient,</hi> and ſuch as have denied
all for Chriſt, and loved God above all; and to ſhew
his Juſtice to Men, and Faithfulneſs in fulfilling all his
Promiſes, and alſo his Holineſs, in the high Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Holineſs of his People. I ſhall expreſs
this in the Words of a Learned Divine (Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi>
againſt Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> pag. 40.) <hi>Was there no more in God's
Intention when he elected ſome, than the Manifeſtation of the
Riches of his glorious Grace? Did not God purpoſe alſo to
manifeſt the Glory of his remunerative Juſtice? Is it no
undeniable that God will beſtow Salvation on all his Elect,
(of ripe Years) by way of Reward, and Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
which God the righteous Judg will give?</hi> 2 Tim.
4. 2 Theſſ. 1. <hi>It is great pity this is not conſidered, as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
it is not, eſpecially for the momentous Conſequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in my Judgment.</hi> So far he.</p>
            <p>So much of the Sentence of Juſtification which
ſhall be paſſed by Chriſt at Judgment upon the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
            <p>2. We are next to conſider of the Sentence of
Condemnation which ſhall then by Chriſt be paſſed on
the Unrighteous. Which is delivered to us by Chriſt,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. in the ſame Order as the former.</p>
            <p>The Sentence containeth, 1. The Condemnation it
ſelf. 2. The Reaſon or Cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>The Condemnation expreſſeth the Miſery which
they are judged to. 1. Generally in the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Curſed.</hi> 2. Particularly by Deſcription of their
curſed State.</p>
            <p>To be <hi>curſed,</hi> is to be a People deſtinated and adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to utter Unhappineſs, to all kind of Miſery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remedy.</p>
            <p>2. Their <hi>curſed</hi> Condition is deſcribed in the next
Words, <hi>Depart from me into everlaſting Fire prepared for the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and his Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:63044:106"/>
1. <hi>Depart:</hi> From whom? from the God that made
them in his Image; from the Redeemer that bought
them by the Price of his Blood, and offered to ſave
them freely, for all their Unworthineſs, and many a
time intreated them to accept his Offer, that their
Souls might live: From the Holy Ghoſt, the Sanctifier
and Comforter of the Faithful, who ſtrove with their
Hearts, till they quenched and expelled him. O ſad
<hi>Departing!</hi> who would not then chooſe rather to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi>
from all the Friends he had in the World, and from
any thing imaginable; from his Life, from himſelf, if
it were poſſible, than from Chriſt? <hi>Depart:</hi> from what?
why from the Preſence of the Judg, from all farther
Hopes of Salvation for ever, from all poſſibility of
ever being ſaved, and living in the joyful Inheritance
of the Righteous. <hi>Depart:</hi> Not from God's Eſſential
Preſence, for that will be with them to their everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Miſery, but from the Preſence of his Grace in
that Meaſure as they enjoyed it. <hi>Depart:</hi> Not from
your fleſhly Pleaſures, and Honours, and Profits of the
World; theſe were all gone and paſt already: and
there was no farther need to bid them <hi>depart</hi> from
theſe: Houſes and Lands were gone. Mirth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
were gone. Their ſweet Morſels and Cups
were gone. All the Honour that Men could give
them was gone before they were ſet at Chriſt's Bar
to be judged. But from all Expectations of ever
enjoying theſe again, or ever <hi>taſting</hi> their former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;
from theſe they muſt depart: not from their
<hi>Sin,</hi> for that will go with them; but the Liberty of
committing that part of it which was ſweet to them,
as Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, Idleneſs, and
all Voluptuouſneſs; from theſe they muſt <hi>depart.</hi> But
this is conſequential; it is Chriſt and the Poſſibility of
Salvation, that they are ſentenced to <hi>depart</hi> from.</p>
            <p>But <hi>whither</hi> muſt they <hi>depart?</hi> 1. Into Fire. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>that</hi> Fire which was prepared for the Devil and his
Angels. 3. Into everlaſting Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:63044:107"/>
1. Not into a <hi>purifying,</hi> but a <hi>tormenting</hi> Fire. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
elementary or not; whether properly or meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically
called <hi>Fire,</hi> let us not vainly trouble our
ſelves to enquire. It is enough to know, that as Fire
is one of the moſt grievous Tormentors of the Fleſh,
ſo grievous will be thoſe infernal Torments to the whole
Man, Soul and Body; ſuch as is moſt fitly repreſented
to us under the Notion of <hi>Fire,</hi> and of <hi>Burning.</hi> It is
eaſy for a ſecure unbelieving Soul to read and hear
of it; but Wo and ten thouſand Woes to them that
muſt endure it! In this Life they had their good things,
when it went harder as to the Fleſh with better Men;
but now they are tormented, when the Godly are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
as <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 25.</p>
            <p>2. But why is it called <hi>a Fire prepared for the Devil and
his Angels?</hi> 1. What is this Devil that hath Angels?
2. Who are his Angels? 3. When was it prepared for
them? 4. Wat it not alſo prepared for wicked Men?
To theſe in order.</p>
            <p>1. It ſeems by many Paſſages in Scripture, that there
is an Order among Spirits both good and bad; and
that there is one Devil that is the Prince over the
reſt.</p>
            <p>2. It ſeems therefore that it's the reſt of the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that are called <hi>his Angels.</hi> And ſome think that the
Wicked who ſerved him in this Life, ſhall be numbred
with his Angels in the Life to come. Indeed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
calls him <hi>the God of this World,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. as is
ordinarily judged by Expoſitors; and <hi>the Prince of the
Power of the Air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2. 2. And he calleth falſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
Teachers <hi>the Miniſters of Satan,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 15.
But that wicked Men are here meant as part of his
Angels, is not clear.</p>
            <p>3. If it be the Preparation of God's Purpoſe that is
here meant, then it was from Eternity: but if it be
any Commination of God as Ruler of the Angels, then
was this Fire prepared for them conditionally, from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63044:107"/>
the beginning of that Commination, and was <hi>due</hi> to
them at their Fall.</p>
            <p>4. It ſeems that the Reaſon why here is no mention
of preparing Hell-fire for the Wicked, but only for
the Devils, is not becauſe indeed it <hi>was not</hi> prepared
alſo for the Wicked; but to note that it is the Torment
which was <hi>firſt</hi> prepared for, or aſſigned to the Devils,
thereby ſhewing the greatneſs of the Miſery of the
Wicked, that the Devil and his Angels muſt be their
Companions: Though ſome think, as is ſaid before,
that the Reaſon why wicked Men are not mentioned
tere, is, becauſe they are part of the Angels of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and ſo included. And ſome think it is purpoſely to
manifeſt God's general Love to Mankind, that prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not Hell <hi>for them,</hi> but they caſt themſelves into the
Hell prepared for the Devils. But the firſt ſeems to be
the true ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And how apparently Righteous are the Judgments of
the Lord! that thoſe Men who would here entertain
the Devil into their Hearts and daily Familiarity,
ſhould be then entertained by him into <hi>his</hi> Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and there remain for ever in his Society!
Though few entertained him into viſible Familiarity
with their Bodies as Witches do, who ſo make him
their <hi>Familiar:</hi> yet all wicked Men do entertain him
into more full and conſtant Familiarity with their Souls
than theſe Witches do with their Bodies; how <hi>familiar</hi>
is he in Thoughts, to fill them with Vanity, Luſt or
Revenge! How <hi>familiar</hi> is he in their Hearts, to fill them
with Covertouſneſs, Malice, Pride, or the like Evils!
and to baniſh all Thoughts of returning to God, and to
quench every Motion that tendeth to their Recovery!
How <hi>familiar</hi> is he with them, even when they ſeem to
be worſhipping God in the publick Aſſemblies, ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word out of their Hearts, filling them with
vain and wandring Thoughts, blinding their Minds that
they cannot underſtand the plaineſt words that we are
able to ſpeak to them, and filling them with a proud
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63044:108"/>
Rebellion againſt the Direction of their Teachers, and
an obſtinate Refuſal to be ruled by them, be the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
never ſo neceſſary to their own Salvation? How <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar</hi>
are theſe evil Spirits in their Houſes, filling them
with Ignorance, Worldlineſs and Ungodlineſs, and
turning out God's Service, ſo that they do not pray
together once in a Day, or perhaps at all! How <hi>famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly</hi>
doth Satan uſe their Tongues, in Curſing, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Lying, Ribaldry, Backbiting or Slandring! And is
it not juſt with God to make theſe Fiends their <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars</hi>
in Torment, with whom they entertained ſuch <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity</hi>
in Sin? As Chriſt with all the bleſſed Angels
and Saints will make but one Kingdom or Family, and
ſhall live altogether in perpetual Delights; ſo the Devil
and all his helliſh Angels and wicked Men ſhall make
but one Houſhold, and ſhall live altogether in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Miſery. O poor Sinners, you are not troubled now
at his Preſence and Power in your Hearts! but will
you not then be troubled at his Preſence and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power? As long as you do not <hi>ſee</hi> him, let him do
what he will with you, it grieves you little or nothing
at all; but what will you ſay when you <hi>muſt ſee</hi> him,
and abide with him for ever? O Sirs, his Name is
<hi>eaſily</hi> heard, but his Company will be terrible to the
ſtouteſt Heart alive. He ſheweth you a ſmiling Face
when he tempteth you, but he hath a grimmer Face
to ſhew you, when Temptations have conquered you,
and Torments muſt ſucceed. As thoſe that write of
Witches, ſay, he appeareth at firſt to them in ſome
comely tempting Shape, till he have them faſt tied to
him; and then he beats them, and affrights them,
and ſeldom appears to them but in ſome ugly Hew.
Believe it, poor Sinners, you do not hear or ſee the
worſt of him, when you are merry about your ſinful
Pleaſures, and rejoicing in your Hopes of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
or Preferments of the World: he hath another
kind of Voice which you muſt hear, and another
Face to ſhew you, that will make you know a little
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63044:108"/>
better whom you had to do with! You would be
afraid now to meet him in the Dark: what will you be
to live with him in everlaſting Darkneſs? Then you will
know who it was that you entertained and obeyed, and
plaid with in your Sins.</p>
            <p>3. And as the Text tells us, that it is a <hi>Fire prepared
for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> So it telleth us, that it is
<hi>an everlaſting Fire.</hi> It had a Beginning, but it ſhall
have no End. If theſe Wretches would have choſen
the Service of God, they would have met with no Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
or Trouble, but what would have had a ſpeedy
End. Poverty and Injuries would have had an End:
Scorns and Abuſes would have had an End: Faſting,
Humiliation, Sorrow for Sin, watching and fighting
againſt our ſpiritual Enemies, would all have had an
End. But to avoid theſe, they choſe that Eaſe, that
Pleaſure, which hath brought them to that Torment
which <hi>never</hi> will have end. I have ſaid ſo much of
theſe things already in my Book called <hi>the Saints Reſt,</hi>
that I will now ſay but this much. It is one of the
Wonders of the World, how Men that do believe,
or think they do believe this Word of Chriſt to be
true, that <hi>the Wicked ſhall go into everlaſting Fire,</hi> can
yet venture on Sin ſo boldly, and live in it ſo fearleſly,
or ſleep quietly till they are out of this unſpeakable
Danger! Only the commonneſs of it, and the known
Wickedneſs of Man's Heart, doth make this leſs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.
And were there nothing elſe to convince us
that Sinners are mad and dead as to ſpiritual Things,
this were enough; that ever the greateſt Pleaſures
or Profits of the World, or the moſt enticing Baits
that the Devil can offer them, ſhould once prevail with
them to forget theſe endleſs things, and draw them to
reject an everlaſting Glory, and caſt themſelves deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
into <hi>everlaſting Fire:</hi> Yea, and all this under
daily Warnings and Inſtructions; and when it's told
them beforehand by the God of Truth himſelf! For
the Lord's ſake, Sirs, and for your Souls ſakes, if you
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63044:109"/>
care not what Miniſters ſay, or what ſuch as I ſay, yet
will you ſoberly read now and then this 25<hi>th</hi> Chapter
of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and regard what is told you by him that
muſt be your Judg! and now and then bethink your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſoberly, whether theſe are Matters for wiſe Men
to make light of; and what it is to be <hi>everlaſtingly in
Heaven, or in Hell-fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We have ſeen what is the Penalty contained in
the Sentence againſt the Ungodly: The next thing
that the Text directs us to, is the Cauſe or Reaſon of
the Sentence, <hi>ver.</hi> 42. <hi>For I was hungry, and ye gave me
no Meat,</hi> &amp;c. The Reaſon is not given expreſly, either
for their Sin againſt the Law of Works, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were Sinners, and not perfectly <hi>innocent</hi>
nor yet from their Unbelief, which is the great Sin
againſt the Law of Grace: But it is given from
their not expreſſing their Faith and Love to Chriſt
in Works of Mercy and Self-denial. And why is this
ſo?</p>
            <p>1. We muſt not ſuppoſe that theſe Words of Chriſt
do expreſs the <hi>whole</hi> judicial Proceſs in every Point;
but the chief Parts. It is ſuppoſed that all Men are
convicted of being Sinners againſt the perfect Law of
the Creator, and that they are guilty of Death for
that Sin; and that there is no way but by Chriſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Deliverance. But becauſe all this muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the Righteous themſelves, as well as by the
Wicked; therefore Chriſt doth not mention this,
but that only which is the turning Point or Cauſe in
the Judgment. For it is not all Sinners that ſhall
be finally condemned, but all impenitent, unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sinners, who have rebelled finally againſt their
Redeemer.</p>
            <p>2. And the Reaſon why Faith itſelf is not expreſſed
is, 1. Becauſe it is clearly implied, and ſo is Love to
Chriſt as Redeemer; in that they ſhould have relieved
<hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in his Members: That is, as it's expreſſed,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 42. they ſhould have received a Prophet in the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63044:109"/>
Name of a Prophet, and a Diſciple in the Name of
a Diſciple; all ſhould be done for Chriſt's ſake, which
could not be, unleſs they believed in him, and loved him.
2. Alſo becauſe that the bare Act of Believing is not all
that Chriſt requireth to a Man's final Juſtification and
Salvation; but holy ſelf-denying Obedience muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And therefore this is given as the Reaſon of their
Condemnation that they did not ſo obey.</p>
            <p>We muſt obſerve alſo, that Chriſt here putteth the
ſpecial for the general; that is, one way of ſelf-denying
Obedience and Expreſſion of Love, inſtead of ſuch
Obedience in general: For all Men have not Ability to
relieve thoſe in miſery, being perhaps ſome of them
poor themſelves. But all have that Love and Self-denial,
which will ſome way expreſs it ſelf. And
all have Hearts and a Diſpoſition to do thus, if they
had Ability; without ſuch a Diſpoſition none can be
ſaved.</p>
            <p>It is the fond Conceit of ſome, that if they have any
Love to the Godly, or wiſh them well, it is enough to prove
them happy. But Chriſt here purpoſely lets us know that
whoever doth not love him at ſo high a rate, as that he
can part with his Subſtance or any thing in the World,
to thoſe Uſes which he ſhall require them, even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his Servants in want and Sufferings for the Maſter's
ſake, that Man is none of Chriſt's Diſciple, nor will be
owned by him at the laſt.</p>
            <p>XI. The next Point that we come to, is to ſhew you
the <hi>Properties</hi> of this Sentence at Judgment.</p>
            <p>When Man had broken the Law of his Creator at
the firſt, he was liable to the Sentence of Death, and
God preſently ſat in Judgment on him, and ſentenced
him to ſome part of the Puniſhment which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
but upon the Interpoſition of the Son, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the reſt, reſolved on a Way that might tend to
his Recovery; and Death is due yet to every Sinner for
every Sin which he commits, till a Pardon do acquit
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63044:110"/>
him. But this Sentence which will paſs on Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
at the laſt Judgment, doth much differ from that
which was paſſed on the firſt Sin, or which is due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of Works alone. For,</p>
            <p>1. As to the Penalty, called the Pain of Loſs, the
firſt Judgment did deprive Man of the Favour of his
Creator, but the ſecond will deprive him of the Favour
both of the Creator and Redeemer: the firſt Judgment
deprived him of the Benefits of Innocency; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
deprives him of the Benefits of Redemption,
the loſs of his hopes and poſſibility of Pardon, of
the Spirit, of Juſtification and Adoption, and of the
Benefits which conditionally were promiſed and offered
him; theſe are the Puniſhments of the laſt Judgment,
which the Law of Works did never threaten to the firſt
Man, or to any, as it ſtood alone.</p>
            <p>Alſo the loſs of Glory as recovered, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Penalty of the violated Law of Grace, which
is more than the firſt loſs. As if a Man ſhould loſe his
Purſe the ſecond time, when another hath once found it
for him; or rather as if a Traitor redeemed by another,
and having his Life and Honours offered him, if he
will thankfully accept it and come in, ſhould by his
Refuſal and Obſtinacy, loſe this recovered Life, which
is offered him; which is an Addition to his former
Penalty.</p>
            <p>Beſides that the higher Degree of Glory will be loſt
which Chriſt would beſtow on him, more than was loſt
at firſt. The very Work of the Saints in Heaven, will
to praiſe and glorify him that redeemed them, and the
Father in him; which would not have been the Work
of Man, if he had been innocent.</p>
            <p>2. As to the Pain of Senſe, the laſt Judgment by
the Redeemer will ſentence them to a far ſorer Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than would have befaln them, if no Saviour had
been offered them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. The Conſcience of
<hi>Adam</hi> if he had not been redeemed, would never have
tormented him for rejecting a Redeemer, nor for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63044:110"/>
or abuſing his gracious Offers, and his Mercies;
nor for the forfeiting of a recovered Happineſs; nor
for refuſing of the eaſy Terms of the Goſpel, which
would have given him Chriſt and Salvation for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting;
nor for neglecting any Means that tended to
Recovery: no nor for refuſing Repentance unto Life,
nor for diſobeying a Redeemer that bought him by his
Blood. As all theſe are the Penalties of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's
Law and Judgment, ſo is it a ſorer Penalty than
Conſcience would have inflicted meerly for not being
perfectly innocent: and they will be far ſoarer Gripings
and Gnawings of the never-dying Worm for the abuſe
of theſe Talents, than if we had been never truſted
with any after our firſt Forfeiture. Yea and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
will accordingly proportion his Puniſhments. So
that you ſee that privatively and poſitively, or as to
their Loſs and their Feeling, the Redeemer will paſs
on them a heavier Doom than the Creator did, or
would have done according to the firſt Law to perfect
Man.</p>
            <p>3. Another Property of the Judgment of Chriſt is,
that <hi>it will be final, peremptory, and excluding all farther
Hopes or Poſſibilities of a Remedy.</hi> So was not the firſt
Judgment of the Creator upon faln Man. Though
the Law of pure Nature knew no Remedy, nor gave
Man any Hope of a Redeemer, yet did it not <hi>exclude</hi>
a Remedy, nor put in any Bar againſt one; but God
was free to recover his Creature if he pleaſed. But in
the Law of Grace he hath reſolved, that there ſhall
be no more Sacrifice for Sin, but a fearful looking for
of Judgment and Fire which ſhall devour the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27. and that the Fire ſhall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
the Worm ſhall not die, and the Fire ſhall not
be quenched, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>ult. Mat.</hi> 13. 42, 50. <hi>John</hi> 5.
27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 12. and <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.
43, 44, 45, 46, 48. He that now breaketh that pure
Law that requireth perfect Innocency, (as we have all
done) may fly to the Promiſe of Grace in Chriſt, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63044:111"/>
appeal to the Law of Liberty or Deliverance to be
judged by that. But he that falls under the Penalty
of that Law which ſhould have ſaved him, as all final
Unbelievers and impenitent ungodly Perſons do, hath
no other to appeal to. Chriſt would have been a
Sanctuary and Refuge to thee from the Law of Works,
hadſt thou but come into him: But who ſhall be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
to thee from the Wrath of Chriſt? The Goſpel
would have freed thee from the Curſe of the Law of
Works, if thou hadſt but believed and obeyed it: But
what ſhall free thee from the Condemnation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?
Had there no Accuſation lain againſt thee, but
that thou waſt in general a Sinner; that is, that thou
waſt not perfectly innocent, Chriſt would have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Charge by his Blood. But ſeeing thou art alſo
guilty of thoſe ſpecial Sins which he never ſhed his
Blood for, who ſhall deliver thee from that Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
When Chriſt gave himſelf a Ranſom for Sinners,
it was with this Reſolution both in the Father and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that none ſhould ever be pardoned, juſtified or
ſaved by that Ranſom, that did not in the time of
this Life ſincerely return to God by Faith in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and live in ſincere obedience to him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering
herein. So that he plainly <hi>excepted</hi> final In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
Impenitency and Rebellion from Pardon: He
never died for the final Non-performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the New Covenant. So that his Judgment for
theſe will be peremptory and remedileſs. If you ſay,
Why cannot God find out a Remedy for this Sin, as well
as he did for the firſt? I ſay, God cannot lie, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2.
He muſt be true and faithful, as neceſſarily as he muſt
be God, becauſe of the abſolute Perfection of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and he hath ſaid and reſolved, that there ſhall be
no more Remedy.</p>
            <p>Many other Properties of God's Judgment general
there are, as that Righteouſneſs, Impartiality, Inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and the like, which becauſe I would not make
my Diſcourſe too long, I will paſs over, contenting my
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63044:111"/>
ſelf with the mention of theſe which are proper to
the Judgment of the Redeemer according to his own
Laws in ſpecial.</p>
            <p>XII. The twelfth and laſt thing which I promiſed
to unfold, is, <hi>The Execution of this Judgment.</hi> Here
I ſhould ſhew you both the Certainty of the Execution,
and by whom it will be, and how: but having done
all this already in the third Part of the foreſaid
<hi>Book of Reſt,</hi> I ſhall now only give this brief Touch of
it.</p>
            <p>No ſooner is the dreadful Sentence paſt, <hi>Go ye curſed
into everlaſting Fire,</hi> but away they muſt be gone: There
is no delay, much leſs any Reprieve to be expected;
and yet much leſs is there any hope of an Eſcape. If
the Judg once ſay, <hi>Take him Jailor;</hi> and if Chriſt ſay,
<hi>Take him Devils, you that ruled and deceived him, now torment
him:</hi> all the World cannot reſcue one ſuch Soul. It will
be in vain to look about for help. Alas, there is none
but Chriſt can help you; and he will not, becauſe you
refuſed his help: Nay, we may ſay, <hi>He cannot;</hi> not
for want of Power, but becauſe he is True and Juſt,
and therefore will make good that Word which you
believed not. It is in vain then to cry to Hills to fall on
you, and the Mountains to cover you from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of him that ſitteth on the Throne. It will be in
vain now to repent, and wiſh you had not ſlighted
your Salvation, nor ſold it for a little Pleaſure to your
Fleſh. It will be then in vain to cry, <hi>Lord, Lord, open
to us; O ſpare us; O pity us; O do not caſt us into
theſe hideous Flames! Do not turn us among Devils! Do
not torment thy redeemed ones in this Fire!</hi> All this will be
then too late.</p>
            <p>Poor Sinner, whoever thou art that readeſt or heareſt
theſe Lines, I beſeech thee in Compaſſion to thy Soul,
conſider how fearful the Caſe of that Man will be,
that is newly doomed to the <hi>Everlaſting Fire,</hi> and is
haled to the Execution without Remedy! And what
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63044:112"/>
mad Men are thoſe that now do no more to prevent ſuch
a Miſery, when they might do it on ſuch eaſy Terms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and now have ſo fair an Opportunity in their hands.</p>
            <p>The time was when Repentance might have done
thee good: but <hi>then</hi> all thy Repentings be in vain.
<hi>Now</hi> while the Day of thy Viſitation laſteth, hadſt thou
but a Heart to pray and cry for Mercy, in Faith and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
through Chriſt, thou mighteſt be heard. But
then Praying and Crying will do no good, ſhouldſt thou
roar out in the Extremity of thy Horror and Amazement,
and beſeech the Lord Jeſus but to forgive thee one Sin,
or to ſend thee on Earth once more, and to try the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
once again in the Fleſh, whether thou wouldſt not love
him, and lead a holy Life, it would be all in vain
Nay, ſhouldſt thou beg but one Hour before you were
caſt into thoſe Flames, it would not be heard; it would
do thee no good. How earneſtly did a deceaſed Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. 24. beg of <hi>Abraham</hi> for one Drop of
Water from the Tip of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Finger to cool his
Tongue, becauſe he was tormented in the Flame:
And what the better was he? He was ſent to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that he had his good things in this Life; and that
<hi>Remembrance</hi> would torment him more. And do not
wonder or think much at this, that Chriſt will not
then be entreated by the Ungodly. You ſhall then have
a <hi>Remember</hi> too from Chriſt or Conſcience. He may
ſoon ſtop thy Mouth, and leave thee ſpeechleſs, and
ſay, <hi>Remember Man, that I did one Day ſend thee a Meſſage
of Peace, and thou wouldſt not hear it. I once did ſtoop to
beſeech thee to return, and thou wouldſt not hear. I beſought
thee by the tender Mercies of God; I beſought thee by all the
Love that I had ſhewed theſe, by my holy Life, by my curſed
Death, by the Riches of my Grace, by the Offers of my Glory;
and I could not get thee t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for ſake the World, to deny the Fleſh,
to leave one beloved Sin for all this. I beſought thee over
and over again: I ſent many a Miniſter to thee in my Name:
I waited on thee many a Day, and Year, and all would not
do: thou wouldſt not conſider, return and live: and

                  </gap>ow it is too late, thy Sentence is paſt, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

22, 23.</p>
            <p>Ah Sirs, what a Caſe then is the poor deſperate
Sinner left in! How can I write this, or how can you
that read or hear it, without trembling, once think of
the Condition that ſuch forlorn Wretches will be in!
When they look above them, and ſee the God that hath
forſaken them, becauſe they forſook him firſt; when
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey look about them, and ſee the Saints on one hand
whom they deſpiſed, now ſentenced unto Glory; and
the Wicked on the other hand whom they accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
and imitated, now judged with them to everlaſting
Miſery: when they look below them, and ſee the Flames
that they muſt abide in, even for evermore: and when
the Devils begin to hale them to the Execution: O poor
Souls! Now what would they give for a Chriſt, for a
Promiſe, for a time of Repentance, for a Sermon
of Mercy, which once they ſlept under, or made no
account of! How is the Caſe altered now with them!
Who would think that theſe are the ſame Men that made
light of all this on Earth, that ſo ſtoutly ſcorned the
Reproofs of the Word, that would be worldly, and
fleſhly, and drunk, and proud, let Preachers ſay what
they would; and perhaps hated thoſe that did give
them warning. Now they are of another Mind; but
all too late. O were there any Place for Reſiſtance,
now would they draw back, and lay hold of any thing,
before they would be dragged away into thoſe Flames!
But there is no reſiſting; Satan's Temptations might
have been reſiſted, but his Executions cannot: God's
Judgments might have been prevented by Faith and
Prayer, Repentance and a holy Life; but they cannot
be reſiſted when they are not prevented. Glad would
the miſerable Sinner be, if he might but turn to <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
and ceaſe to <hi>be;</hi> or that he might be any thing
rather than a reaſonable Creature: but theſe Wiſhes
are all in vain. <hi>There is one Time, and one Way of a

Sinner's Deliverance; if he fail in that one, he periſhth
for ever:</hi> all the World cannot help him after that
2 Cor. 6. 2. <hi>I have heard thee in a time accepted: and

then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they
ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me: for that they
hated Knowledg, and did not chooſe the Fear of the Lord;
they would none of my Counſels: they deſpiſed all my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs;

followeth this World as eagerly as if he had no
greater Matters to mind; that never once trembled at
the Thoughts of this great Day, nor once asked
his own Soul in good Sadneſs, <hi>My Soul, How doſt
thou think then to eſcape?</hi> I ſay, doth this Man believe
that he is going to this Judgment? Well Sirs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you believe it or not, you will find it true:
and believe it you muſt before you can be ſafe. For
if you do not believe it, you will never make ready.
Let me therefore perſwade you in the Fear of God to
conſider, that it is a Matter of undoubted Truth.</p>
               <p>1. Conſider that it is the expreſs Word of the God
of Truth, revealed in Scripture as plainly as you can
deſire. So that you cannot be unbelieving without
denying God's Word, or giving him the Lie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.
38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 49, 50. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. throughout,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 16. and 1. 32. <hi>John</hi> 5. 28, 29.
<hi>The Hour is coming in which all that are in the Graves ſhall
hear his Voice, and ſhall come forth: they that have done good,
unto the Reſurrection of Life; and they that have done evil,
unto the Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi> Heb. 9. 27. <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to all Men once to die, and after this the Judgment.</hi>
Rom. 14. 9, 12. <hi>So then every one of us ſhall give account
of himſelf to God.</hi> Rev. 20. 12. <hi>And I ſaw the dead
ſmall and great ſtand before God: and the Books were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life;
and the Dead were judged out of thoſe things which were
written in the Books according to their Works.</hi> Mat. 12. 36,
37. <hi>But I ſay unto you that every idle Word that Men ſhall
ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof at the Day of Judgment
For by thy Words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy Words thou
ſhalt be condemned.</hi> Many more moſt expreſs Texts of
Scripture do put the Truth of this Judgment out of
all queſtion to all that believe the Scripture, and will
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63044:114"/>
underſtand it. There is no place left for a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
in the Point: It is made as ſure to us as the
Word of the living God can make it: And he that
will queſtion that, what will he believe? What ſay
you Sirs! Dare you doubt of this which the God
of Heaven hath ſo poſitively affirmed? I hope you dare
not.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider, it is a Maſter-part of your Faith, if
you are Chriſtians, and a fundamental Article of your
Creed, that Chriſt ſhall come again to judg the quick
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd the dead. So that you muſt believe it or renounce
your Chriſtianity, and then you renounce Chriſt and
all the Hopes of Mercy that you have in him. It's
impoſſible that you ſhould ſoundly believe in Chriſt, and
not believe his Judgment and Life everlaſting: becauſe
as he came to bring Life and Immortality to Light in the
Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. ſo it was the End of his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Death and Reſurrection, to bring you thither;
and it's part of his Honour and Office which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
with his Blood, to be the Lord and Judg of all
the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. If therefore you
believe not heartily this Judgment, deal plainly and
openly, and ſay you are Infidels, and caſt away the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
Vizor of Chriſtianity, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> us know you,
and take you as you are.</p>
               <p>3. Conſider that it is a Truth that is known by the
very Light of Nature, that there ſhall be a Happineſs
for the Righteous, and a Miſery for the Wicked after
this Life: which is evident,</p>
               <p>1. In that we have undeniable natural Reaſon for it.
(1.) God is the Righteous Governour of the World,
and therefore muſt make a difference among his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jcts,
according to the Nature of their Ways: which
ane ſee is not done here, where the Wicked proſper, and
we Good are afflicted; therefore it muſt be hereafter.
(2.) We ſee there is a Neceſſity that God ſhould make
Promiſes and Threatnings of everlaſting Happineſs or
Miſery, for the right Governing of the World: for we
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63044:115"/>
certainly perceive that no lower things will keep Men
from deſtroying all humane Society, and living worſe than
brute Beaſts; and if there be a Neceſſity of making
ſuch Threats and Promiſes, then there is certainly a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of fulfilling them. For God needeth no Lie or
Means of deceiving, to rule the World.</p>
               <p>2. And as we ſee it by Reaſon, ſo by certain Expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that this is diſcernable by the Light of Nature
for all the World, or almoſt all do believe it. Ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thoſe Nations where the Goſpel never came, and have
nothing but what they have by Nature, even the moſt

your common Reaſon and Humanity, as well as your
Chriſtianity. Let me therefore perſwade you al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Fear of God to confirm your Souls in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of this, as if you had heard Chriſt or an Angel
from Heaven ſay to you, <hi>O Man, thou art haſting to
Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. My next Queſtion is, <hi>Whether you do ever ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
conſider of this great Day?</hi> Sirs, do you uſe when
you are alone to think with your ſelves, how certain and
how dreadful it will be, how faſt it is coming on, and
what you ſhall do, and what Anſwer you mean to make
at that Day? Are your Minds taken up with theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations?
Tell me, is it ſo or not?</p>
               <p>Alas Sirs! Is this a Matter to be forgotten? Is not
that Man even worſe than mad, that is going to God's
Judgment, and never thinks of it? when if they were to
be tried for their Lives at the next Aſſize, they would
think of it, and think again, and caſt 100 times which
way to eſcape. Methinks you ſhould rather forget to
go to Bed at Night, or to eat your Meat, or do your
Work, than forget ſo great a Matter as this.</p>
               <p>Truly I have often in my ſerious Thoughts been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to wonder that Men can think of almoſt any thing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63044:115"/>
elſe, when they have ſo great a thing to think of. What,
forget that which you muſt remember for ever! forget
that which ſhould force Remembrance, yea and doth
force it with ſome, whether they will or not! A poor
deſpairing Soul cannot forget it: He thinks which way
ever he goes he is ready to be judged. O therefore
Beloved, fix theſe Thoughts as deep in your Hearts as
Thoughts can go. O be like that holy Man, that
thought which way ever he went, he heard the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
ſound, and the Voice of the Angel calling to the
World, <hi>Ariſe ye Dead, and come to Judgment.</hi> You have
warning of it from God and Man, to cauſe you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it; do not then forget it. It will be a cold

Excuſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. My next Queſtion to you is, <hi>How are you
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffected with the Conſideration of this Day?</hi> Barely to think
of it will not ſerve: to think of ſuch a Day as this
with a dull and ſenſleſs Heart, is a Sign of fearful Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity.
Did the Knees of King <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> knock toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with trembling, when he ſaw the Hand-writing on
the Wall? <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 6. How then ſhould thy Heart be
afffected that ſeeth the Hand-writing of God as a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to his Bar?</p>
               <p>When I began to preach of theſe things long ago,
confeſs the Matters ſeemed to me ſo terrible, that I
was afraid that People would have run out of their Wits
with Fear; but a little Experience ſhewed me, that
many are like a Dog that is bred up in a Forge or
Furnace, that being uſed to it, can ſleep though the
Hmmers are beating, and the Fire and hot Iron flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about him, when another that had never ſeen it,
would be amazed at the ſight. When Men have heard
us 7 Years together, yea 20 Years, to talk of a Day
of Judgment, and they <hi>ſee</hi> it not, nor <hi>feel</hi> any hurt, they
think it is but talk, and begin to make nothing of it.

ſeen no Death coming?</p>
               <p>Three or Four things there be that ſhould bring any
Matter to the Heart. 1. If it be a Matter or exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Weight. 2. If it concern not others only, but our
ſelves. 3. If it be certain. 4. If near.</p>
               <p>All theſe things are here to be ſound, and therefore
how ſhould your Hearts be moved at the Conſideration
of this great Day!</p>
               <p>1. What Matter can be mentioned with the Tongue
of Man of greater moment? For the poor Creture to
ſtand before his Maker and Redeemer, to be judged to
everlaſting Joy or Torment? Alas! all the Matters of
this World are Plays, and Toys, and Dreams to this;
Matters of Profit or Diſprofit are nothing to it, Matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of Credit or Diſcredit are unworthy to be named with
it; Matters of temporal Life or Death are nothing to
it. We may ſee the poor brute Beaſts go every Day
to the Slaughter, and we make no great matter of it,
though their Life be as dear to them as ours to us. To
be judged to an <hi>everlaſting</hi> Death or Torment, this is
the great Danger that one would think ſhould ſhake the
ſtouteſt Heart to conſider it, and awake the dulleſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to prevent it.</p>
               <p>2. It's a Matter the concerneth every one of your<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſelves,
and every Man or Woman that ever lived upon
the Earth, or ever ſhall do; I am not ſpeaking to you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the Affairs of ſome far Country that are nothing to you
but only to marvel at; which you never ſaw, not
ever ſhall do: no, it is thy own ſelf, Man or Woman
that heareſt me this Day, that ſhalt as ſurely appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63044:116"/>
the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, as the Lord liveth,
and as he is true and faithful; and that is as ſure as
thou liveſt on this Earth, or as the Heaven is over thee.
That Man that heareth all this with the moſt careleſs
blockiſh Heart, ſhall be awakened and ſtand with the
reſt at that Day; that Man that never thought of it,
but ſpent his time in worldly Matters, ſhall leave all
and there appear; that Man that will not believe theſe
things to be true, but make a Jeſt ofthem, ſhall ſee
and feel that he would not believe, and <hi>he</hi> alſo ſhall
be there; the <hi>Godly</hi> that waited in Hope for that Day,
as the Day of their full Deliverance and Coronation,
they ſhall be there; thoſe that have lain in the Duſt
theſe 5000 Years ſhall riſe again, and all ſtand there.
Hearer, whoever thou art, believe it, thou maiſt better
think to live without Meat, to ſee without Light, to
eſcape Death, and abide for ever on Earth, than to
keep away from that Appearance. Willing or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thou <hi>ſhalt</hi> be there. And ſhould not a Matter then
that ſo concerneth <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> go near thy Heart, and awake
thee from thy Security?</p>
               <p>3. That it is a Matter of unqueſtionable Certainty,
I have partly ſhewed you already, and more would do if
I were preaching to known Infidels. If the careleſs
World had any juſt Reaſon to think it were uncertain,
their Careleſneſs were more excuſable. Methinks a
Man ſhould be affected withthat which he is certain ſhall
come to paſs, in a manner as if it were now in doing,
1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Ye</hi> perfectly <hi>know that the Day of the Lord ſo
cometh,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>4. This day is not only <hi>certain,</hi> but it is <hi>near;</hi> and
therefore ſhould affect you the more. I confeſs, if it
were never ſo far off, yet ſeeing it will come at laſt, it
ſhould be carefully regarded: But when the Judg is at
the Door, <hi>James</hi> 5. 9. and we are almoſt at the Bar,
and it is ſo ſhort a time to this Aſſize, what Soul that
is not dead will be ſecure?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:63044:52"/>
Alas Sirs! what is a little time when it is gone? how
quickly ſhall you and I be all in another World, and
our Souls receive their particular Judgment, and ſo
wait till the Body be raiſed and judged to the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
It is not 100 Years in all likelihood, till ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
Soul of us ſhall be in Heaven or Hell: and it's like,
not half or a quarter of that time, but it will be ſo
with the greater part of us; and what is a Year or
two or 100? how ſpeedily is it come? how many a
Soul that is now in Heaven or Hell, within 100 Years
dwelt in the Places that you now dwell in, and ſat in
the Seats you now <hi>ſit</hi> in? And now their time is paſt,
what is it? Alas, how quickly will it be ſo with us!
You know not when you go to Bed, but you may be
judged by the next Morning; or when you riſe, but
you may be judged before Night: but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you know that ſhortly it will be; and ſhould not
this then be laid to Heart? Yea the general Judgment
will not be long: For certainly we live in the End of
the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. My next Queſtion is, <hi>Whether are you ready
for his dreadful Judgment when it comes, or not?</hi> Seeing
it your <hi>ſelves</hi> then muſt be tried, I think it concerns
you to ſee that you be prepared. How often hath Chriſt
warned us in the Goſpel, that we be <hi>always ready,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we know not the day or Hour of his coming?
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 44, 42. and 25. 13 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 6. and told
us hos ſad a time it will be to thoſe that are unready,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 11, 12. Did Men but well know what a
Meeting and Greeting there will be between Chriſt and
an unready Soul, it would ſure ſtartle them, and make
them look about them. What ſay you, beloved Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
are you <hi>ready</hi> for Judgment, or are you not? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
a Man that knoweth he ſhall be judged, ſhould
ask himſelf the queſtion every day of his Life; am
I ready to give up my Account to God? Do not you uſe
to ask this of your own Hearts? unleſs you be careleſs

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But who be they that are ready? how ſhall I know
whether I be ready or not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a twofold Readineſs. 1. When you
are in a <hi>ſafe</hi> Cafe. 2. When you are in a <hi>comfortable</hi>
Cafe, in regard of that Day. The latter is very <hi>desirae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
but the friſt is of <hi>abſolute Neceſſity:</hi> this therefore is
it that you muſt principally enquire after.</p>
               <p>In general, all thoſe, and only thoſe are ready for
Judgment, who ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, and not
condemned when Judgment cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es; they that have a
good Cauſe in a Goſpel-ſenſe. It may be known before
hand who theſe are; for Chriſt judgeth, as I told you,
by his Law. And therefore find out whom it is that the
Law of Grace doth juſtify or condemn, and you may
certainly know whom the Judg will juſtify or conemn;
for he judgeth righteouſly.</p>
               <p>If you further ask me who theſe are; remember
that I told you before that every Man that is perſonally
righteous by fulfilling the Conditions of Salvation in
the Goſpel, ſhall be ſaved; and he that is foun un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
as having not fulfilled them, ſhall periſh at
that Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Who are thoſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will tell you them in a few Words, leſt you
ſhould forget, becauſe it is a Matter that your Salvation
or Damnation dependeth upon.</p>
               <p>1. The Soul that unfeignedly repenteth of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſinful Courſe, and turneth from it in Heart and
Life, and loveth the Way of godlineſs which he hated,
and hateth the Way of Sin which he loved, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
throughly a new Creature, being born again and
ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, ſhall be juſtified:
but all others ſhall certainly be condemned.</p>
               <p>Good News to repenting converted Sinners: but
ſad to impenitent, and him that knows not what this
means.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:63044:53"/>
2. That Soul that feeling his Miſery under Sin, and
the Power of Satan, and the Wrath of God, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for Man's
Reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>auration and Salvation, and thankfully accepteth
him as his only Saviour and Lord, on the Terms that
he is offered in the Goſpel, and to thoſe Ends, event to
juſtify him, and ſanctify and guide him, and bring him
at laſt to everlaſting Glory; that Soul ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
at Judgment: and he that doth not, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or in ſhort, in Scripture-phraſe,</hi> He that believeth
ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be condemmd,
<hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16.</p>
               <p>3. The Soul that hath had ſo much Knowledg of the
Goodneſs of God, and his Love to Man in Creation,
Redemption, and the following Mercies, and hath had
ſo much Conviction of the Vanity of all Creatures, as
thereupon to love God more than <hi>all</hi> things below, so
that <hi>he</hi> haththe chiefest room in the Hearts, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before all Creatures ordinarily in a time of trial;
that Soul ſhall be juſtified at Judgment, and all others
ſhall be condemned.</p>
               <p>4. That Soul that is ſo apprehenſive of the abſolute
Soveraignty of God as Creator and Redeemer, and of
the Righteouſneſs of his Law and the Goodneſs of his
holy Way, as that he is firmly reſolved to obey him
before all others, and doth accordingly give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ſtudy his Will, of purpoſe that he may obey
it, and doth walk in theſe holy Ways, and hath ſo far
mortified the Fleſh, and ſubdued the World and
the Devil, that the Authority and Word of God
can do more with him than any other, and doth ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
prevail againſt all the Perwaſion and Intereſt of
the Fleſh, ſo that the main Scope and Bent of the
Heart and Life is ſtill for God; and when he ſinneth
he riſeth again by true Repentance; I ſay, that Soul,
and the only, ſhall be juſtified in Judgment, and be

5. That Soul that hath ſuch believing Thoughts of
the life to come, that he taketh the promiſed Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for his Portion, and is reſolved to venture all elſe
upon it, and in hope of this Glory, doth ſet light
comparatively by all things in this World, and waiteth
for it as the End of the Life, chooſing any ſuffering that
God ſhall call him to, rather than to loſe his hopes of
the Felicity, and tus perſervereth to the End: I ſay,
that Soul, and none but that ſhall be juſtified in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and

               <p>In theſe five Marks I have told, you truly and briefly,
who ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, and who ſhall be
condemned at the Day of Judgment. And if you
would have them all in five Words, they are but the
Deſcription of theſe five Graces, Repentance, Faith,
Love, Obedience, Hope.</p>

               <p>And thus I have told you from God's Word, how you
may know whether you are ready for Judgment, which
is the fourth thing that I would adviſe you to enquire
after.</p>
               <p>O Sirs, what ſhift do you make to keep your Souls
from continual Terrors, as long as you remain unready
for Judgment? How do you keep the Thoughts of
it out of your Mind, that they do not break your
Sleep, and meet you in your Buſineſs, and haunt you
every way you go, while Judgment is ſo near, and
you are ſo unready? But I ſhall proceed to my next
Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 5. And in the laſt place, to thoſe of you that are
not yet ready, nor in a Condition wherein you may
be ſafe at that Day; my Queſtion is, <hi>How are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlved
to prepare for Judgmet for the time to come?</hi> Will you
do no more than you have done hitherto? Or will you
now ſet your selves with all your Might, to prepare for
ſo great a Day? methinks you ſhould be now paſt all
Demurs, Delays, or farther Doubtings about ſuch a
Buſineſs; aud by the Conſideration of what I have ſaid
already, you ſhould be fully reſolved to loſe no more
time, but preſently awake, and ſet upon the Work.
Methinks you ſhould all ſay, We will do any thing that
the Lord ſhall direct us to do, rather then we will be
unready for this final Doom. O that there were but ſuch
Hearts in you, that you were truly <hi>willing</hi> to follow the
gracious Guidance of the Lord, and to uſe but thoſe
ſweet and reaſonable Means which he hath preſcribed
you in his Word, that you may be ready for that Day!
Alas, it is no hard matter for me to tell you, or my ſelf,
what it is that we muſt do if we will be happy; and it
is no very hard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> matter to <hi>do</hi> it ſo far as we are truly
<hi>willing;</hi> but the Difficulty is to be <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>throughly
willing</hi> to this Work. If I ſhall tell you what you
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63044:55"/>
muſt do for Preparation, ſhall I not loſe my Labour?
Will you reſolve and promiſe in the Strength of Grace,
that you will faithfully and ſpeedily endeavour to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
it, whoever ſhall gainſay it? Upon hope of this,
I will ſet you down ſome brief Directions, which you
muſt follow, if ever you will with Comfort look the
Lord Jeſus in the Face at the Hour of Death, or in the
Day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>The firſt Direction is this, <hi>See that your Souls be ſincrely
eſtabliſhed in the Belief of this Judgment and everlaſting Life:</hi>
For if you do not ſoundly believe it, you will not seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
prepare for it. If you have the Judgment and
Belief of an Infidel, you cannot have the Heart or the
Life of a Chriſtian. Unbelief ſhuts out the moſt of
the World from Heaven: ſee that it do not ſo by you.
If you ſay you cannot believe what you would: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
Feed not your Unbelief by Wilfulneſs or Unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs;
uſe God's Means to overcome it, and ſhut
not your Eyes againſt the Light, and then try the Iſſue,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Direction. <hi>Labour diligently to have a
ſound Vnderſtanding of the Nature of the Laws and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God.</hi> On what Terms it is that he dealeth with
Mankind: and on what Terms he will judg them to
Life or Death: and what the Reward and Puniſhment is.
For if you know not the Law by which you muſt be
judged, you cannot know how to prepare for the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Study the Scripture therefore, and mark who
they be the God promiſeth to ſave, and who they be
that he threatneth to condemn. For according to that
Word will the Judgment paſs.</p>
               <p>The third Direction. <hi>See that you take it as the very
Buſineſs of your Lives, to make ready for that Day.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that you have no other Buſineſs in the World,
but what doth neceſſarily depend on this. What elſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63044:55"/>
have you to do, but to provide for everlaſting, and to
uſe Means to ſuſtain your own Bodies and others, of
purpoſe for this Work, till it be happily done? Live
therefore as Men that make this the main Scope and
Care of their Lives; and let all things elſe come in
but on the by. Remember every Morning when you
awake, that you must ſpend that Day in Preparation
for your Account, and that God doth give it you for
that end. When you go to Bed, examine your Hearts,
what you have done that Day in the Preparation for
your laſt Day: And take that time as loſt which doth
nothing to this end.</p>
               <p>The fourth Direction. <hi>Vſe frequently to think of the
Certainty, Nearneſs and Dreadfulneſs of that Day, to keep
Life in your Affections and Endeavours, leſt by Inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
your Souls grow ſtupid and negligent.</hi> Otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is out of the ſight, the Heart will be apt to grow
hardned and secure. And do not think of it ſlightly,
as a common thing, but purpoſely ſet your ſelves to
think of it, that it may rouze you up to ſuch Affections
and Endeavours as in ſome meaſure are anſwerable to
the Nature of the thing.</p>
               <p>The fifth Direction. <hi>Labour to have a lively Feeling on
thy Heart, of the Evil and Weight of that Sin which thou art
guilty of, and of the Miſery into which it hath brought thee,
and would further bring thee if thou be not delivered, and ſo
to feel the Need of a Deliverer.</hi> This muſt prepare thee
to partake of Chriſt now; and if thou partake
not of him now, thou canſt not be ſaved by him
then. It is theſe Souls that now make <hi>light</hi> of their
Sin and <hi>Miſery,</hi> that muſt then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> them ſo <hi>heavy,</hi>
as to be preſſed by them into the internal Flames.
And thoſe that <hi>now</hi> feel little need of a Saviour, they
ſhall <hi>then</hi> have none to ſave them, when they feel their
Need.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:63044:56"/>
The ſixth Direction. <hi>Vnderſtand and believe the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of that Ranſom and Satisfaction to Juſtice, which
Chriſt hath made for thy Sins and for the World, and how
freely and univerſally it is offered in the Goſpel.</hi> Thy Sin
is not uncurable or unpardonable, nor thy Miſery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs;
God hath provided a Remedy in his Son
Chriſt, and brought it ſo near thy Hands, that nothing
but thy neglecting, or wilful refuſing it, can deprive
thee of the Benefit. Settle thy Soul in this Belief.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Direction. <hi>Vnderſtand and believe, that
for all Chriſt's Satisfaction, there is an abſolute Neceſſity of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound Faith and Repentance to be in thy own ſelf, before thou
canſt be a Member of him, or be pardoned, adopted or juſtified
by his Blood.</hi> He died not for final Infidelity and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency,
as predominant in any-Soul. As the Law of
his Father which occaſioned his Suffering, required
perfect Obedience or Suffering: So his own Law, which
he hath made for the Conveyance of his Benefits, doth
require yet true Faith and Repentance of Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
before they ſhall be pardoned by him; and
ſincere Obedience and Perſeverance, before they ſhall
be glorified.</p>
               <p>The eight Direction. <hi>Reſt not therefore in an unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unſanctified State; that is, till this Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
be wrought on thy own Soul, and thou be truly broken off
from thy former ſinſul Courſe, and from all things in this World;
and art dedicated, devoted and reſigned unto God.</hi> Seeing
this Change <hi>muſt</hi> be made, and theſe Graces <hi>muſt</hi> be
had, or thou muſt certainly periſh: in the Fear of God,
ſee that thou give no eaſe to thy Mind till thou art thus
changed. Be content with nothing till this be done.
Delay not another Day. How canſt thou live merrily,
or ſleep quietly in ſuch a Condition, as if thou ſhouldſt
die in it, thou ſhouldſt periſh for ever? Eſpecially when
thou art every Hour uncertain whether thou ſhalt ſee
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63044:56"/>
another Hour, and not be preſently ſnatch'd away by
Death. Methinks while thou art in ſo ſad a Caſe,
which way ever thou art going, or whatever thou art
doing, it ſhould ſtill come into thy Thoughts, <hi>O what
if I ſhould die before I be regenerate, and have part in
Chriſt!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth Direction. <hi>Let it be the daily Care of thy
Soul, to mortify thy fleſhly Deſires, and overcome this World;
and live as in a continual Conflict with Satan, which will not
be ended till thy Life do end.</hi> If any thing deſtroy thee
by drawing away thy Heart from God, it will be thy
carnal Self, thy fleſhly Deſires, and the Allurements
of this World, which is the Matter that they feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This therefore muſt be the earneſt. Work of thy
Life to ſubdue this Fleſh, and ſet light by this World,
and reſiſt the Devil, that by theſe would deſtroy thee.
It is the common Caſe of miſerable Hypocrites, that
at firſt they liſt themſelves under Chriſt as for a Fight,
but they preſently forget their State and Work; and
when they are once in their own Conceit regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
they think themſelves ſo ſafe, that there is
no farther Danger; and thereupon they do lay down
their Arms, and take that which they miſcall their
Chriſtian Liberty, and indulge and pleaſe that Fleſh
whch they promiſed to mortify, and cloſe with the
World which they promiſed to contemn, and ſo give
up themſelves to the Devil, whom they promiſed to
fight againſt. If once you apprehend that all your
Religion lieth in meer Believing, that all ſhall go well
with you, and that the Bitterneſs of Death is paſt, and
in a forbearance of ſome diſgraceful Sins, and being
much in the Exerciſe of your Gifts, and in external
Ways of Duty, and giving God a cheap and plauſible
Obedience in thoſe things only which the Fleſh can
ſpare; you are then faln into that deceitful Hypocriſy,
which will as ſurely condemn you, as open Profaneneſs,
if you get not out of it. You muſt live as in a Fight,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63044:57"/>
or you cannot overcome. You <hi>muſt</hi> live looſe from
all things in <hi>this World,</hi> if you will be ready for
<hi>another.</hi> You <hi>muſt</hi> not live after the Fleſh, but mortify
it by the Spirit, if you would not die, but live for
ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. Theſe things are not indifferent,
but of flat Neceſſity.</p>
               <p>The tenth Direction. <hi>Do all your Works as Men that
muſt be judged for them.</hi> It is not enough (at leaſt in
point of Duty and Comfort) that you judg this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
in general to be the main Buſineſs of your
Lives, but you ſhould alſo order your <hi>particular Actions</hi>
by theſe Thoughts, and meaſure them by their <hi>Reſpects</hi>
to this approaching Day. Before you venture on them,
enquire whether they will bear weight in Judgment,
and be ſweet or bitter when they are brought to Trial;
both for Matter and Manner, this muſt be obſerved.
O that you would remember this when Temptations are
upon you, when you are tempted to give up your Minds
to the World, and drown your ſelves in earthly Cares:
Will you bethink you ſoberly whether you would hear
of this at Judgment, and whether the World will be
then as ſweet as now, and whether this be the beſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for your Trial? When you are tempted to be
drunk, or to ſpend your precious time in Ale-houſes,
or vain unprofitable Company, or at Cards or Dice, or
any ſinful or needleſs Sports; bethink you then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this will be comfortable at the reckoning? and
whether time be no more worth to one that is ſo near
Eternity, and muſt make ſo ſtrict an Account of his
Hours? and whether there be not many better Works
before you, in which you might ſpend your time to
your greater Advantage, and to your greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
when it comes to a review? When you are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Wantonneſs, Fernication, or any other fleſhly
Intemperance, bethink you ſoberly, with what Face
theſe Actions will appear at Judgment, and whether
they will be <hi>then</hi> pleaſant or diſpleaſant to you. So
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63044:57"/>
when you are tempted to neglect the daily Worſhipping
of God in your Families, and the catechiſing and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your Children or Servants, eſpecially on the
Lord's Day, bethink your ſelves then, what account
you will give of this to Chriſt, when he that entruſted
you with the Care of your Children and Servants,
ſhall call you to a reckoning for the Performance of
that Truſt?</p>
               <p>The like muſt be remembred in the very manner of
our Duties. How diligently ſhould a Miniſter ſtudy;
how earneſtly ſhould he perſwade; how unweariedly
ſhould he bear all Oppoſitions and ungrateful Returns;
and how carefully ſhould he watch over each particular
Soul of his Charge (as far as is poſſible) when he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that he muſt ſhortly be accountable for all in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
and how importunate ſhould we all be with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for their Converſion, when we conſider that we our
ſelves alſo muſt ſhortly be judged? Can a Man be cold
and dead in Prayer, that hath any true Apprehenſion of
that Judgment upon his Mind, where he muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
for all his Prayers and Performances? O re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
and ſeriouſly remember, when you ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Miniſter to hear the Word, and when you
are on your Knees to God in Prayer, in what a manner
that ſame Perſon, even your ſelves, muſt ſhortly ſtand at
the Bar of the dreadful God! Did theſe Thoughts get
throughly to Mens Hearts, they would awaken them
out of their ſleepy Devotions, and acquaint them that
it is a ſerious Buſineſs to be a Chriſtian. How careful
ſhould we be of our Thoughts and Words, if we believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
remembred that we muſt be accountable for them
all! How carefully ſhould we conſider what we do with
our Riches, and with all that God giveth us? and how
much more largely ſhould we expend it for his Service
in Works of Piety and Charity, if we believingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that we muſt be judged according to what
we have done, and give account of every Talent that
we receive? Certainly the believing Conſideration of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63044:58"/>
Judgment, might make us all better Chriſtians than we
are, and keep our Lives in a more innocent and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Frame.</p>
               <p>The eleventh Direction. <hi>As you will certainly renew
your Failings in this Life, ſo be ſure that you daily renew your
Repentance, and fly daily to Chriſt for a renewed Pardon,
that no Sin may leave its ſting in your Souls.</hi> It is not your
<hi>firſt</hi> Pardon that will ſerve the turn for your <hi>latter</hi> Sins.
Not that you muſt <hi>purpoſe</hi> to <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>purpoſe</hi> to <hi>repent</hi> when
you have done, as a Remedy: for that is an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and wicked <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of Repenting, which is made a
Means to maintain us in our Sins; but Sin muſt be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as far as we can; and Repentance and Faith in the
Blood of Chriſt muſt remedy that which we could not
avoid. The Righteouſneſs of Pardon in Chriſt's Blood
is uſeful to us only ſo far as we are Sinners, and cometh
in where our imperfect inherent Righteouſneſs doth
come ſhort; but muſt not be purpoſely choſen before
Innocency: I mean, we muſt rather chooſe as far as we
can, to obey and be innocent, than to ſin and be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
if we were ſure of Pardon.</p>
               <p>The twelfth Direction. In this vigilant, obedient,
penitent Courſe, with Confidence upon God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
reſt upon the Promiſe of Acceptance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
through the Merits and Interceſſion of him
that redeemed you: Look up in hope to the Glory that
is before you, and believe that God will make good his
Word, and the patient Expectation of the Righteous
ſhall not be in vain. Chearfully hold on in the Work
that you have begun: and as you ſerve a better Maſter
than you did before your Change, ſo ſerve him with
more Willingneſs, Gladneſs and Delight. Do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
hard Thoughts of him, or of his Service, but
rejoice in your unſpeakable Happineſs of being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into his Family and Favour through Chriſt. Do
not ſerve him in drooping Dejection and Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63044:58"/>
but with Love, and Ioy, and filial Fear. Keep
in the Communion of his Saints, where he is chearfully
and faithfully praiſed and honoured, and where is
the greateſt viſible Similitude of Heaven upon Earth;
eſpecially in the Celebration of the Sacrament of Chriſt's
Supper, where he ſeals up a renewed Pardon in his
Blood, and where unanimouſly we keep the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his Death until he come. Do not caſt your
ſelves out of the Communion of the Saints, from whom
to be caſt out by juſt Cenſure and Excluſion, is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Emblem and Fore-runner of the Judgment to come,
where the Ungodly ſhall be caſt out of the Preſence of
Chriſt and his Saints for ever.</p>
               <p>I have now finiſhed the Directions, which I tender
to you for your Preparation for the Day of the Lord;
and withal my whole Diſcourſe on this weighty Point.
What Effect all this ſhall have upon your Hearts,
the Lord knows; it is not in my Power to determine.
If you are ſo far blinded and hardned by Sin and Satan,
as to make light of all this, or coldly to commend the
Doctrine, while you go on to the End in your carnal
worldly Condition as before; I can ſay no more, but
tell thee again that Judgment is near, when thou wilt
bitterly bewail all this too late. And among all the reſt
of the Evidence that comes in againſt thee, this Book
will be one which ſhall teſtify to thy Face before An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men, that thou waſt told of that Day, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to prepare.</p>
               <p>But if the Lord ſhall ſhew thee ſo much Mercy as to
open thy Eyes, and break in upon thy Heart, and
by ſober Conſideration turn it to himſelf, and cauſe
thee faithfully to take the Warning that hath been
give thee, and to obey theſe Directions, I dare aſſure
thee from the Word of the Lord, that this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which will be ſo dreadful to the Ungodly, and
the Beginning of their endleſs Terrour and Miſery,
will be as joyful to thee, and the Beginning of thy Glory.
The Saviour that thou haſt believed in and ſincerely
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63044:59"/>
obeyed, will not condemn thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
1. <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. It is part of his Buſineſs to juſtify thee
before the World, and to glorify his Merits, his Kingly
Power, his Holineſs, and his rewarding Juſtice in thy
Abſolution and Salvation. He will account it a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
thing to recompenſe Tribulation to thy Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers,
and Reſt to thy ſelf; when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be
revealed from Heaven with his Mighty Angels, in flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not God,

            <head>The Danger of ſlighting Chriſt
and his Goſpel.</head>
            <epigraph>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE bleſſed Son of God, that thought not enough
to die for the World, but himſelf alſo be
the Preacher of Grace and Salvation, doth
comprize in this Parable the Sum of his Goſpel. By
the King that is here ſaid to make the Marriage, is
meant God the Father that ſent his Son into the
World to cleanſe them from their Sins, and eſpouſe
them to himſelf. By his Son for whom the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is made, is meant the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the
eternal Son of God, who took to his God-head
the Nature of Man, that he might be capable of
being their Redeemer when they had loſt themſelves
in Sin. By the Marriage is meant the Conjunction of
Chriſt to the Soul of Sinners, when he giveth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to them to be their Saviour, and they give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to him as his redeemed Ones, to be ſaved and ruled
by him; the Perfection of which Marriage will be at the
Day of Judgment, when the Conjunction between the
whole Church and Chriſt ſhall be ſolemnized. The Word
here tranſlated <hi>Marriage,</hi> rather ſignifieth the <hi>Marriage-Feaſt;</hi>
and the meaning is, that the World is invited by the
Goſpel to come in and partake of Chriſt and Salvation,
which comprehendeth both Pardon, Juſtification and
Right to Salvation, and all other Privileges of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63044:60"/>
of Chriſt. The <hi>Invitation</hi> is God's Offer of Chriſt
and Salvation in the Goſpel; the Servants that invite
them are the Preachers of the Goſpel, who are ſent
forth by God to that end; the Preparation for the
Feaſt there mentioned, is the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt,
and the enacting of a Law of Grace, and opening <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Way for revolting Sinners to return to God. There is
a mention of ſending ſecond Meſſengers, becauſe Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
uſeth not to take the firſt Denial, but to exerciſe his
Patience till Sinners are obſtinate. The firſt Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
are the Jews; upon their obſtinate Refuſal they
are ſentenced to Puniſhment; and the Gentiles are
invited, and not only invited, but by powerful Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Miracles, and effectual Grace compelled, that
is, infallibly prevailed with to come in. The Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them is ſo great, that the Houſe is filled with
the Gueſts; many come ſincerely, not only looking
at the Pleaſure of the Feaſt, that is, at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of Sin, and Deliverance from the Wrath of God,
but alſo at the Honour of the Marriage, that is, of the
Redeemer, and their Profeſſion by giving up themſelves
to an holy Converſation: but ſome come in only for the
Feaſt, that is, Juſtification by Chriſt, having not the
Wedding-garment of ſound Reſolution for Obedience
in their Life, and looking only at themſelves in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and not to the Glory of their Redeemer: and
theſe are ſentenced to everlaſting Miſery, and ſpeed as
ill as thoſe that came not in at all; ſeeing a Faith that
will not work, is but like that of the Devil; and they
that look to be pardoned and ſaved by it, are miſtaken,
as <hi>James</hi> ſheweth, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
            <p>The Words of my Text contain a Narration of the
ill Entertainment that the Goſpel findeth with many to
whom it is ſent, even after a firſt and ſecond Invitation
They make light of it, and are taken up with other
things. Though it be the Jews that were firſt guilty
they have too many followers among us Gentiles to this
Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:63044:60"/>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> For all the wonderful Love and Mercy that God hath
manifeſted in giving his Son to be the Redeemer of the World, and
which the Son hath manifeſted in redeeming them by his Blood;
for all his full Preparation, by being a ſufficient Sacrifice for the
Sins of all; for all his perſonal Excellencies, and that full and
glorious Salvation that he hath procured; and for all his free
Offers of theſe, and frequent and earneſt Invitation of Sinners:
yet many do make light of all this, and prefer their worldly
Enjoyments before it. The ordinary Entertainment of all is
by Contempt.</p>
            <p>Not that all do ſo, or that all continue to do ſo who
were once guilty of it: for God hath his Choſen whom
he will compel to come in. But till the Spirit of Grace
overpower the dead and obſtinate Hearts of Men, they
hear the Goſpel as a common Story, and the great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
contained in it go not to the Heart.</p>
            <p>The Method in which I ſhall handle this Doctrine is
this.</p>
            <p>1. I ſhall ſhew you what it is that Men make light
of.</p>
            <p>2. What this Sin of making light of it is.</p>
            <p>3. The Cauſe of the Sin.</p>
            <p>4. The Uſe of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>1. The thing that carnal Hearers make light of, is,
1. The Doctrine of the Goſpel it ſelf, which they hear
regardleſly. 2. The Benefits offered them therein:
which are, 1. Chriſt himſelf. 2. The Benefits which
he giveth.</p>
            <p>Concerning Chriſt himſelf, the Goſpel, 1. Declareth
his Perſon and Nature, and the great things that he hath
done and ſuffered for Man; his redeeming him from the
Wrath of God by his Blood, and procuring a Grant of
Salvation with himſelf. Furthermore, the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
maketh an Offer of Chriſt to Sinners, that if they
will accept him on his eaſy and reaſonable Terms, he
will be their Saviour, the Phyſician of their Souls, their
Husband and their Head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:63044:61"/>
2. The Benefits that he offereth them, are theſe.
1. That with theſe bleſſed Relations to him, himſelf,
and Intereſt in him, they ſhall have the Pardon of all
their Sins paſt, and be ſaved from God's Wrath, and
be ſet in a ſure way of obtaining a Pardon for all the
Sins that they ſhall commit hereafter, ſo they do but
obey ſincerely, and turn not again unto the Rebellion of
their Unregeneracy. 2. They ſhall have the Spirit to
become their Guide and Sanctifier, and to dwell i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
their Souls, and help them againſt their Enemies
and conform them more and more to his Image, and
heal their Diſeaſes, and bring them back to God.
3. They ſhall have Right to everlaſting Glory when
this Life is ended, and ſhall be raiſed up thereto at the
laſt; beſides many excellent Privileges in the Way,
in Means, Preſervation and Proviſion, and the Foretaſte
of what they ſhall enjoy hereafter: all theſe Benefits
the Goſpel offereth to them that will have Chriſt on his
reaſonable Terms. The Sum of all is in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 11,
12. <hi>This is the Record that God hath given us eternal Life,
and this Life is in his Son: He that hath the Son hath Life,
and he that hath not the Son hath not Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>What this Sin of making light of the Goſpel is?</hi> 1. To
make light of the Goſpel, is to take no great heed
to what is ſpoken, as if it were not a certain Truth, or
elſe were a Matter that little concerned them, or as if
God had not written theſe things for them. 2. When
the Goſpel doth not <hi>affect</hi> Men, or go to their <hi>Hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
but though they ſeem to attend to what is ſaid, yet
Men are not <hi>awakened</hi> by it from their Security, nor
doth it work in any meaſure ſuch holy Paſſion in their
Souls, as Matters of ſuch everlaſting Conſequence
ſhould do; this is making light of the Goſpel of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
When we tell Men what Chriſt hath done and
ſuffered for their Souls, and it ſcarce moveth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
We tell them of keen and cutting Truths, but nothing
will pierce them; we can make them hear, but we
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63044:61"/>
cannot make them feel; our Words take up in the
Porch of their Ears and Fancies, but will not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the inward Parts; as if we ſpake to Men that had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Hearts or Feeling; this is a making light of Chriſt
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd Salvation. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 26, 27. Hearing ye ſhall hear,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd ſhall not underſtand; ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and ſhall
not perceive: For the Heart of this People is waxen
groſs, and their Ears are dull of hearing, their Eyes
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re cloſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When Men have no high Eſtimation of Chriſt and
Salvation, but whatſoever they may ſay with their
Tongues, or dreamingly and ſpeculatively believe, yet
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n their ſerious and practical Thoughts, they have a
higher Eſtimation of the Matters of this World, than

               </gap>hey have of Chriſt and the Salvation that he hath
purchaſed; this is a making light of him. When Men

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccount the Doctrine of Chriſt to be but a Matter of
Words and Names, as <hi>Gallio, Acts</hi> 18. 4. or as <hi>Feſtus,
Acts</hi> 25. 19. a ſuperſtitious Matter about one Jeſus who
was dead, and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith is alive: or ask the Preachers
of the Goſpel as the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 17. 18. <hi>What will

                     <desc>••</desc>

            <p>4. When Men are informed of the Truths of the
Goſpel, and on what Terms Chriſt and his Benefits may
be had, and how it is the Will of God that they ſhould

Chriſt and everlaſting Life. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21, 22. <hi>Luke</hi>
18. 23. you may find Examples of ſuch as I here
deſcribe.</p>
            <p>5. When Men will promiſe fair, and profeſs their
Willingneſs to have Chriſt on his Terms, and to forſake
all for him; but yet <hi>do ſtick</hi> to the World and their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Courſes; and when it comes to <hi>Practice,</hi> will not
be removed by all that Chriſt hath done and ſaid: this
is making light of Chriſt and Salvation. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

compared with 43. 2.</p>
            <p>III. The Cauſes of this Sin are the next thing to be
enquired after. It may ſeem a Wonder that ever Men
that have the uſe of their Reaſon, ſhould be ſo ſottiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
to make light of Matters of ſuch Conſequence. But
the Cauſe is;</p>
            <p>1. Some Men underſtand not the very Senſe of the
Words of the Goſpel when they hear it, and how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
they be taken with that which they underſtand not?
Though we ſpeak to them in plain Engliſh, and ſtudy to
ſpeak it as plain as we can; yet People have ſo eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves from God, and the Matters of their
own Happineſs, that they know not what we ſay; as if
we ſpoke in another Language, and as if they were

            <p>2. Some that do underſtand the <hi>Words</hi> that we ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet becauſe they are carnal, underſtand not the <hi>Matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
for the natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. They are earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

3. A carnal Mind apprehendeth not a <hi>Sutableneſs</hi> in
theſe ſpiritual and heavenly things to his Mind, and
therefore he ſets light by them, and hath no mind of
them. When you tell him of everlaſting Glory, he

               </gap>rue that Men may have Chriſt <hi>when they will;</hi> that is,
when they are willing to have him on his Terms: but
he that hath promiſed thee Chriſt, if thou be willing,
hath not promiſed to make thee willing; and if thou
art not willing <hi>now,</hi> how canſt thou think thou ſhalt be
willing hereafter? If thou canſt make thine own Heart
willing, why is it not done now? Can you do it better
when Sin hath more hardned it, and God may have
given thee over to thy felf? O Sinners, you might do
much, though you are not able of your ſelves to come
in, if you would now ſubject your ſelves to the working
of the Spirit, and ſet in while the Gales of Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue!
But did you know what a hard and impoſſible
thing it is to be ſo much as willing to have Chriſt and
Grace, when the Heart is given over to it ſelf, and the
Spirit hath withdrawn its former Invitations, you would
not be ſo confident of your own Strength to believe
and repent; nor would you make light of Chriſt upon
ſuch fooliſh Confidence. If indeed it be ſo eaſy a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as you imagine for a Sinner to believe and repent at
any time; how comes it to paſs that it is done by ſo
few, but moſt of the World do periſh in their Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
when they have all the Helps and Means that we
can afford them? It is true, the thing is very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and eaſy in it ſelf to a pure Nature; but while Man
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63044:131"/>
is blind and dead, theſe things are in a ſort impoſſible
to him, which are never ſo eaſy to others. It is the
eaſieſt and ſweeteſt Life in the World to a gracious Soul
to live in the Love of God, and the delightful Thoughts
of the Life to come, where all their Hope and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
lieth: But to worldly carnal Hearts it is as eaſy to

               </gap>
they think it ſo eaſy a Matter to repent and believe,
and ſo to have Chriſt and Right to Salvation, then have
they no excuſe for neglecting this which they thought so
eaſy. O wretched impenitent Soul! what mean you to

eaſy that you could do it at any time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. We come now to the Application. And
hence you may be informed of the Blindneſs and Folly of
all carnal Men: how <hi>contemptible</hi> are their Judgments that
think Chriſt and Salvation <hi>contemptible:</hi> and how littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Reaſon there is why any ſhould be moved by them, or
diſcouraged by any of their Scorns or Contradictions.</p>
            <p>How ſhall we ſooner know a Man to be a Fool, than
if he knows no difference between Dung and Gold? Is
there ſuch a thing as <hi>madneſs</hi> in the Word, if that Man
be not mad, that ſets light by Chriſt and his own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
while he daily toils for the Dung of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And yet what pity is it to ſee that a Company of poor
ignorant Souls will be aſhamed of Godlineſs, if ſuch
Men as theſe do but deride them! Or will think hardly
of a holy Life, if ſuch as theſe do ſpeak againſt it!
Hearers, if you ſee any <hi>ſet light</hi> by Chriſt and Salvation,
do you <hi>ſet light</hi> by that Man's <hi>Wit,</hi> and by his <hi>Words,</hi>
and hear the Reproaches of a holy Life, as you would
hear the Words of a Mad-man; not with regard, but
with a Compaſſion of his Miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:63044:131"/>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. What wonder if we and our preaching be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,
and the beſt Miniſters complain of ill ſucceſs,
when the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles themſelves did ſucceed
no better? What wonder if for all that we can ſay or do,
our Hearers ſtill ſet light by Chriſt and their own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when the Apoſtles Hearers did the ſame? They
that did ſecond their Doctrines by Miracles. If any Men
could have ſhaken and torn in pieces the Hearts of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
they could have done it: If any could have laid
them at their Feet, and made them all cry out as ſome,
<hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> it would have been they. You may
ſee then that it is not meerly for want of good Preachers
that Men make light of Chriſt and Salvation: the firſt
News of ſuch a thing as the Pardon of Sin, and the
Hopes of Glory, and the Danger of everlaſting Miſery,
would turn the Hearts of Men within them, if they were
as tractable in ſpiritual Matters as in temporal: But
alas, it is far otherwiſe. It muſt not ſeem any ſtrange
thing, nor muſt it too much diſcourage the Preachers of
the Goſpel, if when they have ſaid all that they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
to ſay to win the Hearts of Men to Chriſt, the moſt
do ſtill ſlight him; and while they bow the Knee to
him, and honour him with their Lips, do yet ſet ſo light
by him in their Hearts, as to prefer every fleſhly
Pleaſure or Commodity before him. It will be thus
with many: let us be glad that it is not thus with
all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. But for cloſer Application. Seeing this is the
great condemning Sin, before we enquire after it into
the Hearts of our Hearers, it beſeems us to begin at
home, and ſee that we who are Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
be not guilty of it our ſelves. The Lord forbid that
they that have undertaken the ſacred Office of reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Excellencies of Chriſt to the World, ſhould
make light of him themſelves, and ſlight that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they do daily preach. The Lord knows we
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63044:67"/>
are all of us ſo low in our Eſtimation of Chriſt, and do
this great Work ſo negligently, that we have cauſe to
be aſhamed of our beſt Sermons; but ſhould this Sin
prevail in us, we were the moſt miſerable of all Men.
Brethren, I love not Cenſoriouſneſs; yet dare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend
ſo vile a Sin in my ſelf or others under pretence
of avoiding it, eſpecially when there is ſo great Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
that it ſhould be healed firſt in them that make it
their Work to heal it in others. O that there were no
cauſe to complain that Chriſt and Salvation are made
light of by the Preachers of it! But, 1. Do not the
negligent Studies of ſome ſpeak it out? 2. Doth not
their dead and drowſy Preaching declare it? Do not
they make light of the Doctrine they preach, that do it
as if they were half aſleep, and feel not what they ſpeak
themſelves?</p>
            <p>3. Doth not the Careleſneſs of ſome Mens private
Endeavours diſcover it? What do they for Souls?
how ſlightly do they reprove Sin? how little do they
when they are out of the Pulpit for the ſaving of Mens
Souls?</p>
            <p>4. Doth not the continued Neglect of thoſe things
wherein the Intereſt of Chriſt conſiſteth diſcover
it? 1. The Churches Purity and Reformation; 2. Its
Unity.</p>
            <p>5. Doth not the covetous and worldly Lives of too
many diſcover it, loſing Advantages for Mens Souls for
a little Gain to themſelves? and moſt of this is becauſe
Men are Preachers before they are Chriſtians, and tell
Men of that which they never felt themſelves. Of all
Men on Earth, there are few that are in ſo ſad a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as ſuch Miniſters: and if indeed they do believe
that Scripture which they preach, methinks it ſhould
be terrible to them in their ſtudying and preaching
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. Beloved Hearers; the Office that God hath
called us to, is, by declaring the Glory of his Grace, to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63044:67"/>
help under Chriſt to the ſaving of Mens Souls. I hope
you think not that I come hither to Day on any other
Errand. The Lord knows I had not ſet a Foot out of
Doors, but in hope to ſucceed in this Work for your
Souls. I have conſidered and often conſidered, what is
the matter that ſo many thouſands ſhould periſh when
God hath done ſo much for their Salvation; and I find
this that is mentioned in my Text is the Cauſe. It is one
of the Wonders of the World, that when God hath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
loved the World as to ſend his Son, aud Chriſt hath
made a Satisfaction by his Death ſufficient for them all,
and offereth the Benefits of it ſo freely to them, even
without Money or Price, that yet the moſt of the World
ſhould periſh; yea the moſt of thoſe that are thus
called by his Word! Why here is the Reaſon, when
Chriſt hath done all this, Men make light of it. God
hath ſhewed that <hi>he</hi> is not unwilling; and Chriſt hath
ſhewed that <hi>he</hi> is not unwilling that Men ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to God's Favour and be ſaved; but Men are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
unwilling <hi>themſelves.</hi> God takes not <hi>pleaſure</hi> in the
Death of Sinners, but rather that they return and live,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. But Men take ſuch <hi>pleaſure</hi> in Sin, that
they will die before they will return. The Lord Jeſus
was content to be their Phyſician, and hath provided
them a ſufficient Plaiſter of his own Blood: but if Men
make light of it, and will not apply it, what wonder
if they periſh after all? This Scripture giveth us the
Reaſon of their Perdition. This ſad Experience tells
us the moſt of the World is guilty of. It is a moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
thing to ſee how moſt Men do ſpend their Care,
their Time, their Pains for known Vanities, while God
and Glory are caſt aſide: That he who is <hi>all,</hi> ſhould
ſeem to them as <hi>nothing;</hi> and that which is <hi>nothing,</hi> ſhould
ſeem to them as good as <hi>all;</hi> that God ſhould ſet Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in ſuch a Race where Heaven or Hell is their certain
End, and that they ſhould ſit down, and loiter, or run
after the childiſh Toys of the World, and ſo much
forget the Prize that they ſhould run for. Were it but
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63044:68"/>
poſſible for one of us to ſee the <hi>whole</hi> of this Buſineſs,
as the All-ſeeing God doth; to ſee at one View both
Heaven and Hell which Men are ſo near, and ſee what
moſt Men in the World are minding, and what they are
doing every Day, it would be the ſaddeſt ſight that could
be imagined. O how ſhould we marvel at their Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and lament their Self-deluſion! O poor diſtracted
World! what is it that you run after? and what is it
that you neglect? If God had never told them
what they were ſent into the Word to do, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were going, or what was before them in
another World, then they had been excuſable; but he
hath told them over and over, till they were weary of it.
Had he left it doubtful, there had been ſome excuſe; but
it is his ſealed Word, and they profeſs to believe it,
and would take it ill of us if we ſhould queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do believe it or not.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I come not to accuſe any of you particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of this Crime: but ſeeing it is the commoneſt Cauſe
of Mens Deſtruction, I ſuppoſe you will judg it the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Matter for our Enquiry, and deſerving our greateſt
Care for the Cure. To which end I ſhall, 1. Endeavour
the <hi>Conviction</hi> of the Guilty. 2. Shall give them ſuch
Conſiderations as may tend to humble and reform them.
3. I ſhall conclude with ſuch Direction as may help them
that are willing to eſcape the deſtroying Power of this
Sin. And for the firſt, conſider,</p>
            <p>1. It is the Caſe of moſt Sinners to think themſelves
freeſt from thoſe Sins that they are moſt enſlaved to;
and one reaſon why we cannot reform them, is, becauſe
we cannot convince them of their Guilt. It is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Sin ſo far to blind and beſool the Sinner, that
he knoweth not what he doth, but thinketh he is free
from it when it reigneth in him, or when he is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it: it bringeth Men to be ſo much unacquainted
with themſelves, that they know not what they think,
or what they mean and intend, nor what they love or
hate, much leſs what they are habituated and diſpoſed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63044:68"/>
to. They are alive to Sin, and dead to all the Reaſon,
Conſideration and Reſolution that ſhould recover them,
as if it were only by their ſinning that we muſt know
they are alive. May I hope that you that hear me to
Day, are but willing to know the Truth of your Caſe,
and then I ſhall be encouraged to proceed to an enquiry.
God will judg impartially; why ſhould not we do ſo?
Let me therefore by theſe following Queſtions, try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
none of you are Slighters of Chriſt and your own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
And follow me, I beſeech you, by putting them
cloſe to your own Hearts, and faithfully anſwering them.</p>
            <p>1. Things that Men highly value will be <hi>remembred,</hi>
they will be matter of their freeſt and ſweeteſt thoughts;
this a known Caſe.</p>
            <p>Do not thoſe then make light of Chriſt and Salvation,
that think of them ſo ſeldom and coldly in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of other things? Follow thy own Heart Man, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
what it daily runneth out after; and then judg
whether it make not light of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We cannot perſwade Men to one Hour's ſober Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
what they ſhould do for an Intereſt in Chriſt,
or in Thankfulneſs for his Love, and yet they will not
believe that they make light of him.</p>
            <p>2. Things that we highly value will be Matter of our
Diſcourſe: The Judgment and Heart will command the
Tongue: Freely and delightfully will our Speech run
after them: this alſo is a known Caſe.</p>
            <p>Do not thoſe then make light of Chriſt and Salvation,
that ſhun the mention of his Name, unleſs it be in a
vain or ſinful Uſe? Thoſe that love not the Company
where Chriſt and Salvation is much talk'd of, but
think it troubleſom preciſe Diſcourſe; that had rather
hear ſome merry Jeſts, or idle Tales, or talk of their
Riches or Buſineſs in the World: When you may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them from Morning to Night, and ſcarce have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
Word of Chriſt, but perhaps ſome ſlight and
weary mention of him ſometimes; judg whether theſe
make not light of Chriſt and Salvation. How ſeriouſly
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63044:69"/>
do they talk of the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 8, 11. and ſpeak
Vanity! but how heartleſly do they make mention of
Chriſt and Salvation?</p>
            <p>3. The things that we highly value, we would ſecure
the Poſſeſſion of, and therefore would take any conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Courſe to have all Doubts and Fears about them
well reſolved. Do not thoſe Men then make light of
Chriſt and Salvation, that have lived 20 or 30 Years
in Uncertainty whether they have any part in theſe or
not, and yet never ſeek out for the right Reſolution of
their Doubts? Are all that hear me this Day certain they
ſhall be ſaved? O that they were! O had you not made
light of Salvation, you could not ſo eaſily bear ſuch
Doubtings of it; you could not reſt till you had made it
ſure, or done your beſt to make it ſure. Have you no
Body to enquire of, that might help you in ſuch a Work?
Why you have Miniſters that are purpoſely appointed
to that Office. Have you gone to them, and told them
the Doubtfulneſs of your Caſe, and asked their Help in
the judging of your Condition? Alas, Miniſters may ſit in
their Studies from one Year to another, before ten
Perſons among 1000 will come to them on ſuch an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand!
Do not theſe make light of Chriſt and Salvation?
When the Goſpel pierceth the Heart indeed, they cry
out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved? Acts</hi>
16. 30. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 6. trembling and aſtoniſhed <hi>Paul</hi> cries
out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And ſo did the
convinced Jews to <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2. 37. But when hear we
ſuch Queſtions?</p>
            <p>4. The things that we value, do <hi>deeply affect</hi> us, and
ſome Motions will be in the Heart according to our Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of them. O Sirs, if Men made not light of
theſe things, what working would there be in the Hearts
of all our Hearers? what ſtrange Affections would it
raiſe in them to hear of the Matters of the World to
come! How would their Hearts melt before the Power
of the Goſpel! what Sorrow would be wrought in the
Diſcovery of their Sin! what Aſtoniſhment at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63044:69"/>
of their Miſery! what unſpeakable Joy at
the glad Tidings of Salvation by the Blood of Chriſt!
what Reſolution would be raiſed in them upon the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of their Duty! O what Hearers ſhould we have if
it were not for this Sin! Whereas now we are liker to
weary them, or preach them aſleep with Matters of
this unſpeakable Moment. We talk to them of Chriſt
and Salvation, till we make their Heads ake: Little
would one think by their careleſs Carriage, that they
heard and regarded what we ſaid, or thought we ſpoke
at all to them.</p>
            <p>5. Our Eſtimation of things will be ſeen in the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of our Endeavours. That which we highlieſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
we ſhall think no pains too great to obtain. Do
not thoſe Men then make light of Chriſt and Salvation,
that think all too much that they do for them, that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
at his Service, and think it too grievous for them
to endure? that ask of his Service, as <hi>Judas</hi> of the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>What need this waſte? cannot Men be ſaved without ſo
much ado? this is more ado than needs.</hi> For the World
they will labour all the Day, and all their Lives; but
for Chriſt and Salvation they are afraid of doing too
much. Let us preach to them as long as we will, we
cannot bring them to reliſh or reſolve upon a Life of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.
Follow them to their Houſes, and you ſhall not
hear them read a Chapter, nor call upon God with their
Families once a Day; nor will they allow him that one
Day in ſeven which he hath ſeparated to his Service.
But Pleaſure, or worldly Buſineſs, or Idleneſs muſt have
a part. And many of them are ſo far hardened, as to
reproach them that will not be as mad as themſelves.
And is not Chriſt worth the ſeeking? Is not everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Salvation worth more than all this? Doth not
that Soul make light of all theſe, that thinks his Eaſe
more worth than they? Let but common Senſe judg.</p>
            <p>6. That which we moſt highly value, we think we
cannot <hi>buy too dear:</hi> Chriſt and Salvation are freely given,
and yet the moſt of Men go without them, becauſe
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63044:70"/>
they cannot enjoy the World and them together. They
are called but to part with that which would hinder them
from Chriſt, and they will not do it. They are called
but to give God his own, and to reſign all to his Will,
and let go the Profits and Pleaſures of this World, when
they muſt let go either Chriſt or them; and they will
not. They think this too dear a Bargain, and ſay they
cannot ſpare theſe things; they muſt hold their Credit
with Men; they muſt look to their Eſtates, how ſhall
they live elſe? they muſt have their Pleaſure, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
becomes of Chriſt and Salvation: As if they could
live without Chriſt better than without theſe: as if they
were afraid of being Loſers by Chriſt, or could make a
ſaving Match by loſing their Souls to gain the World.
Chriſt hath told us over and over, that if we will not
forſake all for him, we cannot be his Diſciples,
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. 33. Far are theſe Men from forſaking all,
and yet will needs think that they are his Diſciples
indeed.</p>
            <p>7. That which Men highly eſteem, they would <hi>help
their Friend's to</hi> as well as themſelves. Do not thoſe Men
make light of Chriſt and Salvation, that can take ſo
much care to leave their Children Portions in the World,
and do ſo little to help them to Heaven? that provide
outward Neceſſaries ſo carefully for their Families, but
do ſo little to the ſaving of their Souls? Their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
Children and Friends will witneſs, that either
Chriſt, or their Childrens Souls, or both were made light
of.</p>
            <p>8. That which Men highly eſteem, they will ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
ſeek after, that you may ſee it in the <hi>ſucceſs,</hi>
if it be a Matter within their reach. You may ſee how
many make light of Chriſt, by the little Knowledg they
have of him, and the little Communion with him, and
Communication from him; and the little, yea, none of
his ſpecial Graces in them. Alas, how many Miniſters
can ſpeak it to the Sorrow of their Hearts, that many
of their People know almoſt nothing of Chriſt, though
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63044:70"/>
they hear of him daily, nor know they what they
muſt do to be ſaved! If we ask them an account
of theſe things; they anſwer as if they underſtood not
what we ſay to them, and tell us they are no Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and therefore think they are excuſable for their
Ignorance. O if theſe Men had not made light of
Chriſt and their Salvation, but had beſtowed but half
ſo much Pains to know and enjoy him, as they have
done to underſtand the Matters of their Trades and
Callings in the World, they would not have been ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
as they are: they make light of theſe things,
and therefore will not be at the Pains to ſtudy or learn
them. When Men that can learn the hardeſt Trade in
a few Years, have not learned a Catechiſm, nor how
to underſtand their Creed, under twenty or thirty
Years Preaching, nor cannot abide to be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about ſuch things; doth not this ſhew that they
have ſlighted them in their Hearts? How will theſe
Deſpiſers of Chriſt and Salvation be able one Day to
look him in the Face, and to give an account of theſe
Neglects?</p>
            <p>Thus much I have ſpoken in order to your Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Do not ſome of your Conſciences by this time ſmite
you, and ſay, <hi>I am the Man that have made light of my
Salvation?</hi> If they do not, it is becauſe you make light
of it ſtill for all that is ſaid to you. But becauſe,
if it be the Will of the Lord, I would fain have this
damning Diſtemper cured, and am loth to leave you in
ſuch a deſperate Condition, if I knew how to remedy

and make uſe of them as we go, and lay open your
Hearts to the Work of Grace, and ſadly bethink you
what a Caſe you are in, if you prove ſuch as make light
of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Conſider, 1. Thou makeſt light of him that made

of nothing but Contempt. As a Man, what art
thou but a Worm to God? As a Sinner, thou art far viler
than a Toad: yet Chriſt was ſo far from making light of
thee and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Happineſs, that he came down into the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ife of Suffering, and offered himſelf a
Sacrifice to the Juſtice which thou hadſt provoked, that
thy miſerable Soul might have a Remedy. It is no
leſs than Miracles of Love and Mercy that he hath
ſhewed to us: and yet ſhall we ſlight them after all?</p>
            <p>Angels admire them, whom they leſs concern, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. 12. and ſhall redeemed Sinners make light of them?
What barbarous, yea deviliſh, yea worſe than deviliſh
Ingratitude is this? the Devils never had a Saviour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them, but thou haſt, and doſt thou yet make light
of him?</p>
            <p>2. Conſider the Work of Man's Salvation by Jeſus
Chriſt is the Maſter-piece of all the Works of God,
wherein he would have his Love and Mercy to be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.
As the Creation declareth his Goodneſs and
Power, ſo doth Redemption his Goodneſs and Mercy;
he hath contrived the very Frame of his Worſhip ſo,
that it ſhall much conſiſt in the magnifying of this
Work; and after all this, will you make light of it? His
Name is Wonderful, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. He did the Work that
none could do, <hi>John</hi> 15. 24. Greater Love could none
ſhew than this, <hi>John</hi> 15. 13. How great was the Evil
and Miſery that he delivered us from! the Good procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for us! all are Wonders from his Birth to his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
from our new Birth to our Glorification, all are
Wonders of matchleſs Mercy. And yet do you make
light of them!</p>
            <p>3 You make light of Matters of <hi>greateſt Excellency
and Moment in the World:</hi> you know not what it is that
you ſlight; had you well known, you could not have
done it. As Chriſt ſaid to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,
John</hi> 4. 10. hadſt thou known who it is that ſpeaketh
to thee, thou wouldſt have asked of him the Waters
of Life: had they <hi>known,</hi> they would not have crucified
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63044:71"/>
the Lord of Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. So had you known
what Chriſt is, you would not have made light of him;
Had you been one Day in Heaven, and but ſeen what they
poſſeſs, and ſeen alſo what miſerable Souls muſt endure
that are ſhut out, you would never ſure have made ſo
light of Chriſt again.</p>
            <p>O Sirs, it is no Trifles or jeſting Matters that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
ſpeaks of. I muſt needs profeſs to you, that when
I have the moſt ſerious Thoughts of theſe things my
ſelf, I am ready to marvel that ſuch amazing Matters
do not overwhelm the Souls of Men: that the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Subject doth not ſo overmatch our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
and Affections, as even to drive Men beſide
themſelves, but that God hath always ſomewhat allayed
it by the diſtance; much more that Men ſhould be ſo
blockiſh as to make light of them. O Lord, that
Men did but know what everlaſting Glory, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Torments are; would they then hear us as they
do? would they read and think of theſe things as they
do? I profeſs I have been ready to wonder when I have
heard ſuch weighty things delivered, how People can
forbear crying out in the Congregation; much more,
how they can reſt till they have gone to their Miniſters
and learned what they ſhould do to be ſaved, that this
great Buſineſs might be put out of doubt. O that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Hell ſhould work no more on Men! O that
Everlaſtingneſs ſhould work no more! O how can you
forbear when you are alone, to think with your ſelves
what it is to be everlaſtingly in Joy or in Torment! I
wonder that ſuch Thoughts do not break your Sleep;
and that they come not in your mind when you are about
your Labour! I wonder how you can almoſt do any
thing elſe! How you can have any Quietneſs in your
Minds! How you can eat, or drink, or reſt, till you
have got ſome Ground of everlaſting Conſolations! Is
that a <hi>Man</hi> or a <hi>Corps</hi> that is not affected with Matters of
this Moment? that can be readier to ſleep, than to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when he heareth how he muſt ſtand at the Bar of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63044:72"/>
God! Is that a <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>a Clod of Clay,</hi> that can riſe
and lie down without being deeply affected with his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Eſtate? that can follow his worldly Buſineſs,
and make nothing of the great Buſineſs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Damnation; and that when they know it is
hard at hand. Truly Sirs, when I think of the Weight
of the Matter, I wonder at the very beſt of God's Saints
upon Earth, that they are no better, and do no more
in ſo weighty a Caſe. I wonder at thoſe whom the
World accounteth more holy than needs, and ſcorns
for making too much ado; that they can put off Chriſt
and their Souls with ſo little; that they pour not out
their Souls in every Supplication; that they are not
more taken up with God; that their Thoughts be not
more ſerious in preparation for their Account. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that they be not an hundred times more ſtrict in
their Lives, and more laborious and unwearied in
ſtriving for the Crown, than they are. And for my
ſelf, as I am aſhamed of my dull and careleſs Heart,
and of my ſlow and unprofitable Courſe of Life; ſo
the Lord knows, I am aſhamed of every Sermon that I
preach: when I think <hi>what</hi> I have been ſpeaking of, and
<hi>who</hi> ſent me; and that Mens Salvation or Damnation is
ſo much concerned in it. I am ready to tremble, leſt
God ſhould judg me as a Slighter of his Truth, and the
Souls of Men, and leſt in the beſt Sermon I ſhould be
guilty of their Blood. Methinks we ſhould not ſpeak
a Word to Men in Matters of ſuch Conſequence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Tears, or the greateſt Earneſtneſs that poſſibly we
can: were not we too much guilty of the Sin which we
reprove, it would be ſo. Whether we are alone, or
in Company, methinks our End, and ſuch an End,
ſhould ſtill be in our Mind, and as before our Eyes;
and we ſhould ſooner forget any thing, and ſet light by
any thing, or by all things, than by this.</p>
            <p>Conſider, 4. Who is it that ſends this weighty Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to you? Is it not God himſelf? Shall the God
of Heaven ſpeak, and Men make light of it? You
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63044:72"/>
would not ſlight the Voice of an Angel or a Prince.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Whoſe</hi> Salvation is it that you make light of? Is it
not your own? Are you no more near or dear to your
ſelves, than to make light of your <hi>own</hi> Happineſs or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery?
Why Sirs, do you not care whether you be ſaved
or damned? Is Self-love loſt? Are you turned your own
Enemies? As he that ſlighteth his Meat doth ſlight his
Life; ſo if you ſlight Chriſt, whatſoever you may think,
you will find it was your own Salvation that you ſlighted.
Hear what he ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 36. <hi>All they that hate me,
love Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Your Sin is greater, in that you profeſs to believe
the Goſpel which you make ſo light of. For a profeſſed
Infidel to do it, that believes not that ever Chriſt died,
or roſe again, or doth not believe that there is an Heaven
or Hell, this were no ſuch marvel; but for you that
make it your Creed, and your very Religion, and call
your ſelves Chriſtians, and have been baptized into this
Faith, and ſeemed to ſtand to it, this is the Wonder,
and hath no Excuſe. What! believe that you ſhall
live in endleſs Joy or Torment, and yet make no more
of it, to eſcape Torment, and obtain that Joy. What!
believe that God will ſhortly judg you, and yet make no
more Preparation for it. Either ſay plainly, <hi>I am no
Chriſtian, I do not believe theſe wonderful things, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
nothing but what I ſee;</hi> or elſe let your Hearts be
affected with your Belief, and live as you ſay you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
What do you think when you repeat the Creed,
and mention Chriſt's Judgment, and everlaſting Life?</p>
            <p>7. What are theſe things you ſet ſo much by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to
prefer them before Chriſt, and the ſaving of your Souls?
Have you found a better Friend, a greater and ſurer
Happineſs than this? Good Lord! what Dung is it that
Men make ſo much of, while they ſet ſo light by ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Glory! What Toys are they that they are daily
taken up with, while Matters of Life and Death are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected!
Why Sirs, if you had every one a Kingdom
in your Hopes, what were it in compariſon of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63044:73"/>
Kingdom? I cannot but look upon all the Glory
and Dignity of this World, Lands and Lordſhips, Crowns
and Kingdoms, even as on ſome brainſick beggarly Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that borroweth fine Clothes, and plays the Part
of a King or a Lord for an Hour on a Stage, and then
comes down, and the Sport is ended, and they are
Beggars again. Were it not for God's Intereſt in the
Authority of Magiſtrates, or for the Service they might
do him, I ſhould judg no better of them. For as to
their own Glory, it is but a Smoak: what matter is it
whether you live poor or rich, unleſs it were a greater
Matter to <hi>die</hi> rich than it is? You know well enough
that Death levels all: what Matter is it at Judgment,
whether you be to anſwer for the Life of a rich Man,
or a poor Man? Is <hi>Dives</hi> then any better than <hi>Lazarus?</hi>
O that Men knew what a poor deceiving Shadow they
graſp at, while they let go the everlaſting Subſtance!
The ſtrongeſt and richeſt, and moſt volup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
do but lay in fuel for their Sorrows, while they think
they are gathering together a Treaſure. Alas, they are
aſleep, and dream that they are happy; but when they
awake, what a Change will they find! Their Crown is
made of Thorns: their Pleaſure hath ſuch a Sting as
will ſtick in the Heart through all Eternity, except un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
Repentance do prevent it. O how ſadly will
theſe Wretches be convinced ere long what a fooliſh
Bargain they made in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elling Chriſt and their Salvation
for theſe Trifles! Let your Farms and Merchandize then
ſave you if they can, and do that for you that Chriſt
would have done. Cry then to thy <hi>Baal</hi> to ſave thee.
O what Though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s have Drunkards and Adulterers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
of Chriſt, that will not part with the baſeſt Luſt for
him! For a piece of Bread, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſuch Men do
tranſgreſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 21.</p>
            <p>8. To ſet ſo light by Chriſt and Salvation is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Mark that thou haſt no part in them, and if thou ſo
continue, that Chriſt will ſet <hi>as light</hi> by thee: thoſe that
honour him he will honour, and thoſe that deſpiſe him
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63044:73"/>
ſhall be lightly eſteemed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. Thou wilt
feel one Day that thou canſt not live without him. Thou
wilt confeſs then thy need of him: and then thou
mayeſt go look for a Saviour where thou wilt, for he
will be no Saviour for thee hereafter, that wouldſt not
value him, and ſubmit to him here. Then who will
prove the Loſer by thy Contempt? O what a thing will
it be for a poor miſerable Soul to cry to Chriſt for Help
in the Day of Extremity, and to hear ſo ſad an Anſwer
as this! Thou didſt ſet light by me and my Law in the
Day of thy Proſperity, and I will now ſet as light by
thee in thy Adverſity. Read <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24 to the end.
Thou that, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> didſt ſell thy Birth-right for a Meſs of
Pottage, ſhalt then find no Place for Repentance, though
thou ſeek it with Tears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. Do you think
that Chriſt ſhed his Blood to ſave them that continue to
make light of it? and to ſave them that value a Cup
of Drink, or a Luſt, before his Salvation? I tell you
Sirs, though <hi>you</hi> ſet ſo light by Chriſt and Salvation, <hi>God</hi>
doth not ſo: He will not give them on ſuch Terms
as theſe: He valueth the Blood of his Son, and the
everlaſting Glory; and he will make <hi>you</hi> value them,
if ever you have them. Nay, this will be thy Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and leaveth no Remedy. All the World cannot
ſave him that ſets light by Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.
24. None of them ſhall taſte of his Supper, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.
37. Nor can you blame him to deny you what you
made light of your ſelves. Can you find fault if you
miſs of the Salvation which you ſlighted?</p>
            <p>9. The time is near when Chriſt and Salvation will
not be made light of, as now they are. When God hath
ſhaken thoſe careleſs Souls out of their Bodies, and you
muſt anſwer for all your Sins in your own Name; O
then, what would you give for a Saviour! when a thouſand
Bills ſhall be brought in againſt you, and none to relieve
you, then you will conſider, <hi>O Chriſt would now have
ſtood between me and the Wrath of God: had I not deſpiſed
him, he would have anſwered all.</hi> When you ſee the World
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63044:74"/>
hath left you, and your Companions in Sin have deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves and you, and all your merry Days are
gone; then what would you give for that Chriſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
that now you account not worth your Labour?
Do you think when you ſee the Judgment ſet, and you
are doomed to everlaſting Perdition for your Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that you ſhould then make as light of Chriſt as
now? Why will you not judg now, as you know you
ſhall judg then? Will he then be worth ten thouſand
Worlds, and is he not now worth your higheſt Eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and deareſt Affection?</p>
            <p>10. God will not only deny thee that Salvation thou
madeſt light of, but he will take from thee all that which
thou didſt value before it: He that moſt highly eſteems
Chriſt, ſhall have him and the Creatures ſo far as they are
good here, and him without the Creature hereafter,
becauſe the Creature is not uſeful; and he that ſets more
by the Creature than by Chriſt, ſhall have ſome of the
Creature without Chriſt here, and neither Chriſt nor it
hereafter.</p>
            <p>So much of theſe Conſiderations, which may ſhew
the true Face of this heinous Sin.</p>
            <p>What think you now, Friends, of this Buſineſs? Do
you not ſee by this time what a Caſe that Soul is in that
maketh light of Chriſt and Salvation? What need then
is there that you ſhould take heed leſt this ſhould
prove your own Caſe? The Lord knows it is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
a Caſe. Whoever is found guilty at the laſt of this
Sin, it were better for that Man he had never been born.
It were better for him he had been a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Indian,</hi>
that never had heard the Name of a Saviour, and that
never had Salvation offered to him: For ſuch Men have
no cloak for their Sin, <hi>John</hi> 15. 22. Beſides all the reſt
of their Sins, they have this killing Sin to anſwer for,
which will undo them. And this will aggravate their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
<hi>That</hi> Chriſt whom they ſet light by, muſt be their
Judg, and for <hi>this</hi> Sin will he judg them. O that ſuch
would now conſider how they will anſwer that Queſtion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63044:74"/>
that Chriſt puts to their Predeceſſors, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 33.
<hi>How will ye eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi> or <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3.
<hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> Can
you eſcape without a Chriſt? or will a deſpiſed Chriſt
ſave you then? If he be accurſed that ſets light by Father
or Mother, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 16. what then is he that ſets light
by Chriſt? It was the heinous Sin of the Jews, that
among them were found ſuch as ſet light by Father and
Mother, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 7. but among us, Men ſlight the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Spirits. In the Name of God, Brethren, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you to conſider how you will then bear his Anger
which you now make light of? You that cannot make
light of a little Sickneſs or Want, or of natural Death,
no not of a Tooth-ach, but groan as if you were undone,
how will you then make light of the Fury of the Lord,
which will burn againſt the Contemners of his Grace? Doth
it not behove you beforehand to think of theſe things?</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have been convincing you of the Evil of
the Sin, and the Danger that followeth: I come now to
know your Reſolution for the time to come. What ſay
you? Do you mean to ſet as light by Chriſt and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as hitherto you have done? and to be the ſame Men
after all this? I hope not. O let not your Miniſters
that would fain ſave you, be brought in as Witneſſes
againſt you to condemn you. At leaſt, I beſeech you
put not this upon me. Why Sirs, if the Lord ſhall
ſay to us at Judgment, Did you never tell theſe Men
what Chriſt did for their Souls, and what need they had
of him, and how nearly it did concern them to look to
their Salvation, that they made not light of it? we muſt
needs ſay the Truth: Yea Lord, we told them of it as
plainly as we could; we would have gone on our Knees to
them, if we had thought it would have prevailed; we
did intreat them as earneſtly as we could to conſider theſe
things: they heard of theſe things every day; but alas, we
could never get 'em to their Hearts: they gave us the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but they made light of all that we could ſay to them.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63044:75"/>
O ſad will it prove on your ſide, if you force us to ſuch
an Anſwer as this.</p>
            <p>But if the Lord do move the Hearts of any of you,
and you reſolve to make light of Chriſt no more: Or if
any of you ſay, We do not make light of him; let me
tell you here in the Concluſion, what you muſt do, or
elſe you ſhall be judged as Slighters of Chriſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I will tell you what will not ſerve the
turn.</p>
            <p>1. You may have a notional Knowledg of Chriſt, and
the Neceſſity of his Blood, and of the Excellency of
Salvation, and yet periſh as Neglecters of him. This
is too common among profeſt Chriſtians. You may
ſay all that other Men do of him. What Goſpel-Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
had <hi>Balaam?</hi> Jeſus I know, and <hi>Paul</hi> I know,
the very Devils could ſay, who believe and tremble,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p>2. You may weep at the Hiſtory of his Paſſion, when
you read how he was uſed by the Jews; and yet make
light of him, and periſh for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>3. You may come deſirouſly to his Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
<hi>Herod</hi> heard gladly; ſo do many that yet muſt
periſh as Neglecters of Salvation.</p>
            <p>4. You may in a fit of Fear have ſtrong Deſires after
a Chriſt to eaſe you, and to ſave you from God's Wrath,
as <hi>Saul</hi> had of <hi>David</hi> to play before him; and yet you
may periſh for making light of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>5. You may obey him in many things, ſo far as will
not ruine you in the World, and eſcape much of the
Pollutions of the World by his Knowledg; and yet
neglect him.</p>
            <p>6. You may ſuffer and loſe much for him, ſo far as
leaveth you an earthly Felicity; as <hi>Ananias,</hi> the young
Man. Some Parcels of their Pleaſures and Profits ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
will part with in Hope of Salvation, that ſhall periſh
everlaſtingly, for valuing it no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:63044:75"/>
7. You may be eſteemed by others a Man Zealous for
Chriſt, and loved and admired upon that account, and
yet be one that ſhall periſh for making light of him.</p>
            <p>8. You may verily think you ſelves, that you ſet
more by Chriſt and Salvation than any thing, and yet be
miſtaken, and be judged as Contemners of him: Chriſt
iuſtifieth not all that juſtify themſelves.</p>
            <p>9. You may be zealous Preachers of Chriſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and reprove others for this neglect, and lament
the Sin of the World in the like Expreſſion as I have
done this Day; and yet if you or I have no better Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to prove our hearty Eſteem of Chriſt and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we are undone for all this.</p>
            <p>You hear, Brethren, what will <hi>not</hi> ſerve the turn;
will you now hear what Perſons you <hi>muſt</hi> be if you would
not be condemned as Slighters of Chriſt? O ſearch whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be thus with your Souls or no.</p>
            <p>1. Your Eſteem of Chriſt and Salvation, muſt be
greater than your Eſteem of all the Honours, Profits
or Pleaſures of this World, or elſe you ſlight him:
<hi>No leſs</hi> will be accounted ſincere, nor accepted to your
Salvation: Think not this hard, when there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
in the Matters eſteemed. To eſteem the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Glory on Earth before Chriſt and everlaſting Glory,
is a greater Folly, and Wrong to Chriſt, than to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
a Dog before your Prince, would be Folly in you,

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a Wrong to him. Scripture is plain in this,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother, Wife,
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ildren, Houſe, Land, or his own Life more than me, is not
worthy of me, and cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.</p>
            <p>2. You muſt manifeſt this Eſteem of Chriſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in your daily Endeavours and ſeeking after him,
and in parting with any thing that he ſhall require of
you. God is a Spirit, and will not take an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Profeſſion inſtead of the Heart and ſpiritual Service
which he commandeth. He will have the Heart or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and the chief Room in the Heart too. Theſe
muſt be had.</p>
