            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe true Miniſters of the Goſpel, the Miniſters of the new Covenant, were ordained and appointed by God to be Miniſters of Light, Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, Miniſters of the Spirit, <hi>Mat. 5.14. 2 Cor. 11.15.</hi> and <hi>Chap. 3.6.</hi> And this was their work and ſervice, even to preach the Light, to deliver their Meſſage concerning the Light, which they heard of Chriſt and were ſent by him <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> preach, as is recorded, <hi>1 John 1.5.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that they were to tell men what the Light was, and where it was to be found, and to turn men from darkneſs to Light, from ſin and unrighteouſneſs to purity and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from the ſpirit and power of Satan to the Spirit and Power of the living God <hi>(Dan. 12.3. Act. 26.18.)</hi> that ſo they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45696:3"/>
might come from under Satans authority, power and kingdom of darkneſs, into the light, wherein Chriſt reigns as King, Prieſt and Prophet, unto and over all his: who is faithful in all his Houſe, as Son and Lord of all, diſtributing Life, Righteouſneſs, Mercy and Peace to his whole Family, as they abide in him and walk in ſubjection to his Spirit. So that there is no condemnation to them that are gathered unto Chriſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into him, and who abide in him (walking not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit) who is the Quickener, Guide and Rule of all the Children of the new Covenant. For Chriſt is the Way, the Truth and the Life in and to them all, and is made by God all in all unto them. He is their Shepherd, their King, their Captain, their Vine, their Olive Tree, their Leader, their Door, their Path, their Rule, their Righteouſneſs, their Holineſs, their Wiſdom, their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Altar, their Sacrifice, their Prieſt, their Prophet, their Sabboth, their Light, their Day-ſpring, their Bright and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45696:3"/>
Morning Star, their Son, their Shield, their Rock, and their High Tower. What ſhall I ſay! God hath gathered together all things into one, even in him, whoſe Spirit, Life and Light Eternal is the one Subſtance, which anſwers all the Figures and Shadows of the Law; and they are all comprehended and fulfilled and end in him. So that he is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs, to all that believe in him. And he Miniſters Righteouſneſs, he Miniſters Truth, he Miniſters Life, he Miniſters Salvation, he Miniſters Power, he Miniſters Pure Heavenly Wiſdom, and no good thing will he with-hold, from them that come unto him in the Drawings of his Father, and follow him whitherſoever he leads, and obey his Goſpel, which is Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly new and living.</p>
            <p>Now this precious Miniſtry hath been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn and hid from Ages and Generations, in the long Night of the great Apoſtacy and thick Darkneſs. And how could it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? for men being in the Dark, and having Erred from the True Spirit, and let
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45696:4"/>
in a wrong ſpirit, and built up wrong Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and having not known the True Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs (nor being willing to flee into it) whither the True Church fled, and was Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by God with the true Food, even with the true living vertue and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all this Dark Night of the Apoſtacy: I ſay, how could they come at the true Light, the true Spirit, the true Power (from which the true Miniſtry is) which did not viſibly now appear, but was with the true Church in the Wilderneſs? So that there hath been a true Church all this while, which the Gates of Hell have not been able to prevail againſt, as to her inward Temple and Altar (nor over the Worſhippers which have worſhip'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) although they have gained the outward Court, God having ſevered it from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward building, and given it to the Gentiles in ſpirit, who are not true <hi>Jews,</hi> who are not Worſhippers in the Spirit and in the Truth <hi>Rev. 21.1, 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now at length, bleſſed be the Lord, the long Night of Darkneſs araws towards
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45696:4"/>
an end, yea is come to an end in many Spirits, and the true Light is broken forth again (and ſhineth again inwardly in many) and the true Mninſtry is revived again, and the everlaſting Goſpel (the Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Life, Mercy and Salvation, in and through Chriſt Jeſus the Light and Life of men) preached again. For now, it is not only outwardly read that God is Light: But the Meſſage hath been received, and perſons choſen and ſent forth by God to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it, and to turn men from Darkneſs to Light, and from Satans power to God. And, bleſſed be the Lord, the publiſhing of this precious Teſtimony (in the power and authority of the Moſt High) hath not been in vain: but the Captivity of many hath been broken by the Power of Light, and the power and ſtrength of Darkneſs (inwardly) overturned by it. O how hath the ſtrong man which kept the Houſe, before the ſtronger then he appeared in the name and authority of his Father, I ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, how hath he Trembled at the inward and Spiritual Appearance of him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45696:5"/>
that was ſtronger than he? and how have the pillars of the old building been ſhaken? How hath the witneſs of God been reached to in mens ſpirits? how have the dead been raiſed, the blind eye opened, the deaf ear unſtopped, the dumb tongue looſed, the Lame cauſed to leap as an Hart and the tongue of the dumb to ſing, the inward Spiritual Leproſie cleanſed and done away forever, the wounded healed, the broken-hearted bound up: and what hath not the Lord done inwardly and ſpiritually for his people, who have been ſenſible of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and gathered by his Spirit and Power to the true Shiloh, who is the true Shepherd, the Land of the living, the holy City and Temple, the Light of the City, the Life of the City, the Gates and Wall of the City, the King and Kingdom both: for his Life, his nature, his Spirit is all and in all. Ah what do we deſire to have, but Chriſt the Seed, and this Seed ſown in our Hearts and abiding in us, and his Life righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and glory, his holy Power Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45696:5"/>
and Kingdom ſpringing up in it! And as, in the Apoſtles days, there was the Seal to their Teſtimony in peoples hearts, where their Miniſtry was ordered by the Lord and was received: even ſo it is now. O how doth the witneſs anſwer in mens hearts and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces! and they that keep to the witneſs and its Teſtimony, not hearkening after words to the wiſdom of the fleſh, how do they become living Epiſtles to be ſeen and read of all men, as the Lord pleaſeth to open that eye in any, which can ſee and read.</p>
            <p>Now to be often Teſtifying of this Light (which the Lord hath viſited us with, and wherein we experience the knowledg of his Son, and Redemption by him) to us it is not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and it is good and ſafe for others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it ariſing in my heart in the ſpringings of Life, and lying upon me (as in the Sight of the Lord) to give forth this further (ſhort) Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, for the ſakes of ſuch as have any deſire to know and experience the Truth as it is in Jeſus; I am given up in Spirit to ſerve my God therein, and do give it forth in humility, in fear, in tenderneſs of ſpirit, in true love,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45696:6"/>
with breathings to my God, that he would pleaſe to open the hearts of thoſe that ſhall be inclin'd to read it, that they may feel ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that in themſelves from which the Teſtimony came, &amp; ſo there-from may hear, in true ſenſe and underſtanding, the true and good report of the ſound of Life and Salvation in this our Age, and may learn ſo to turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly from the darkneſs to the Light; from the power of Satan to Gods Spirit and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance inwardly, that the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rm of the Lord may be revealed in them and powerfully ſtretched out for them. And this is the precious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt indeed, even to know Chriſt the Power of God, Chriſt the Wiſdom of God inwardly revealed and working in the heart, deſtroying ſin there, and building up the holy building, wherein he himſelf will dwell and reign. O that all that truly breath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, might not be with-held from him (and his living Teſtimony &amp; inward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) by the power of darkneſs &amp; deceit, which works ſubtilly in the heart againſt the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, power and work of the Lord there: but might thus come to know him, Amen.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is that which ſhineth from God in the heart, wherein God is neer to men, and wherein and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men may ſeek after God and find him.</p>
               <p>God is a Spirit: and his Spirit and Preſence is neer to all men. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I go from thy Spirit? or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I flee from thy Preſence? (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. &amp;c.) It is impoſſible for any ſo to do. For God, who is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (and the Father of Spirits) is nigh to every Spirit. Every Spirit depends upon him the Fountain of Spirits, and hath its being, Life and motion from him and in him, after a ſence, though not after ſuch a ſence, as they who are quickened by him experience.</p>
               <p>Now God, who is Light, being ſo neer every man: doth he never ſhine upon them? They are Darkneſs:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45696:7"/>
but doth he never appear in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? He who is Light loveth Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: doth he never viſit them with his love? He knoweth what and how great inward and ſpiritual Enemies Man-kind hath: doth he never make any diſcoveries of their Enemies to them? Yes; The Light is neer all Man-kind to diſcover to them and help them againſt the darkneſs: and the love is neer to help them againſt the enmity which deſtroyeth, and ſo to ſave them. For whoſoever joyneth to the Light of Gods Spirit, cannot but witneſs Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereby: for it is of a ſaving nature, and bringeth Salvation with it to all that receive it. Chriſt is in it, and is known by it (inwardly, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, livingly known) and he is not nor can be known without it. He that knoweth the Light of Gods Spirit, knoweth Chriſt; and he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in it, believeth in him: and he that knoweth not nor believeth therein, neither knoweth nor believeth in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45696:8"/>
Chriſt. So that as the <hi>Jews</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion outward, and their knowledge and thinking to be juſtified by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and works of the Law (which moſt of them brake and were Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of, though <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, he was <hi>touching the righteouſneſs which is in the Law, blameleſs</hi>) I ſay, as this was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned and denyed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the circumciſion and work of God on the hearts of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſet over it, and exalted above it: (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.) So is it now alſo. The knowledge of thoſe, and belief of thoſe who own the Light and believe in the Light, is owned by God's Spirit (in this our day) for the true believing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and for that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is life eternal: and the knowing and believing on him, as men account it, according to their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the Letter, without this, is reckoned with God for ignorance and unbelief.</p>
               <p>So that, in this is God known, in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45696:8"/>
this is Chriſt believed in. Here God draws nigh to every man, and is a God not afar off, but nigh at hand; and his Salvation is nigh, and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ready to be revealed here: and here every man may ſeek after and obtain the knowledge of him, the ſaving knowledge, the knowledge of the Grace, of the Gift of Grace which brings Salvation. In this is the Son kiſſed, in this is he drawn nigh to, and come to by the Soul, and not out of it. Here are the drawings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther felt. Let any man feel this, he feels that which begets to God: he feels that which comes from the Son, is of the nature of the Son, wherein the Father draws (the heart of the Child whom he begets) to the Son. And in this the Soul comes: it comes out of the darkneſs wherein Chriſt is not nor dwels, into the Light wherein Chriſt is with the Father: and ſo in this the Soul is ever neer, and out of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45696:9"/>
it ſtill afar off. In this is the holy root witneſſed, and the ingrafting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into: out of this the holy Root is not known, nor can men underſtand what it is to be ingrafted into him, and how he is an Olive Tree, a Vine, a Door, a Shepherd, a Leader, a Captain, a Redeemer. Nor can men poſſibly know the voice of the true Shepherd, from the voice of a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, till they come hither; nor how the true Shepherd walks before his Sheep, and what it is to follow him out of that which deſtroys, into that which regenerates, makes new and living, till they come hither.</p>

Why, by turning to Gods Spirit which ſtrove with them, his Power would effect it in them: and men are ſaid to purifie their hearts, through the Spirit, in loving and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth which doth it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17.</p>

Again, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the Light of the World: he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but ſhall have the Light of Life,</hi> Chap. 8.12. How is Chriſt the Light

                  <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt teſtified of <hi>the Word which was in the beginning,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>In him was life, and the Life was the Light of men.

                  <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh of God as the father of Lights, from whom every good and perfect Gift proceedeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.17.

And the Angel that opened the Propheſies and Myſteries of that Book to <hi>John,</hi> ſaid, that <hi>the Teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Spirit of Propheſie,</hi> Chap. 19.10.

And all the Nations of them that are ſaved, are to walk in the Light of God's Spirit.

O how did poor <hi>David,</hi> the man after God's own Heart ſuffer, by letting the Enemy's temptations in upon him, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy Preſence, ſaid he, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi> Indeed he did loſe his condition at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and he ſpeaks as a man in danger of being quite undone; though afterwards he came to Comfort and Aſſurance, that God would reſtore to him the Joy of his Salvation, and light his Candle and enlighten his Darkneſs again.</p>
               <p>But I am not inſenſible of what doubts and diſputes there are in mens minds, about this Teſtimony which we give (from certain knowledge and true experience) concerning the Light, wherewith God enlighteneth Souls. At firſt, when the Teſtimony firſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45696:20"/>
came forth, men would not grant ſuch a thing, as a Light from God in men, which convinced of and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for Sin. But now there are many will aſſent to that, who yet cannot believe it to be a Meaſure of the Grace and Truth which comes by Jeſus Chriſt, and that in it the Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and Power of God is revealed againſt the ſtrength and power of Satan. But let ſuch ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
               <p>Firſt, who they are that have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and teſtifie of this Light? They are Perſons who, generally, have been deeply exerciſed in Religion: Perſons, who have read the Scriptures very diligently, with much praying and waiting upon God for the true, certain and clear underſtanding of them: Perſons, who (ſeveral of them) have had experience of moſt (if not all other) ſeparated Wayes; but could never meet with the Anſwer
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45696:21"/>
of the Cry of their Souls, nor with Satisfaction to that Birth, which brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in them after the Lord, night and day.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, What their Teſtimony is, which is manifold, as firſt, That they were by the Lord (even by his holy Spirit, and the ſhinings and ſpringings of his precious Seed in them) turned to this light, and ſhewn it to be of God. 2dly, That in turning to it, they ſtill met with the Preſence, Appearance, and Power of the Lord working in their hearts. 3dly, That it did not only diſcover Sin to them, but alſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſiſt it, fight againſt it and bring it under; which no light and power, beſides the Light and Power of God's Spirit can do. 4thly, That the Life of the Son is manifeſted and revealed in it, and they come therein truly to ſee, and taſte and handle the Word of eternal Life. 5thly, That in this Light they come to witneſs clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45696:21"/>
by the Blood of the Lamb, and the everlaſting Covenant made with them (even the ſure Mercies of <hi>David</hi>) and the holy and precious Promiſes fulfilled in them, whereby they are made Partakers of the divine Nature, and come to witneſs an enterance into the holy City, and drink of the Streams of the pure Chryſtal River, which refreſh and make glad the City of our God, and all the Tabernacles wherein he dwels. Laſtly, to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no more, the Lord hath ſhewn them, how this had been formerly with them, even in the dayes of their former Profeſſion; and how God had wrought by this in them in former times, though they then knew it not; and that all their Ability then to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any thing of God aright, or to pray unto him, or reap any true benefit from the Scriptures, was through the ſtirring of this in them, whereby God even then in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45696:22"/>
enlightened and quickened their minds. For, there being ſuch a Principle in man, it works variouſly, and many times when he is not aware of it: and he hath benefit thereby, if he reſiſt it not, but receive its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and operation, though he hath not the diſtinct knowledge and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, Again conſider, Whether the Light of Chriſts Spirit, or the Grace and Truth which is by Jeſus Chriſt, hath not this property of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering, convincing and reproving for ſin? Doubtleſs the Law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, in the loweſt Miniſtration of it, is of that nature that it diſcovereth, and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Law of ſin and death, wherever it finds it. And whether the Comforter, the holy Spirit of Truth, who leads out of all Error and Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and into all Truth, is not as well to be known by this, even by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45696:22"/>
the world of ſin, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproving for ſin, as by his comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Saints, in their holy Travels out of ſin and Battels againſt ſin?</p>
               <p>Conſider 4thly, Whether any thing can convince of ſin, but the Light of God's holy Spirit ſhining in the heart? There may be an outward Declaration of ſin by the Law out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but it never reacheth the heart and Conſcience, but by the ſhining of the Light inward: Nay, it cannot ſo much as reach to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but as God opens the heart, and brings home the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his Light and Power. This we have experience of in the <hi>Jews,</hi> who though the Prophets came with certain evidence and demonſtration from God's Spirit, yet they were not convinced thereby, but ſtood it out againſt the Prophets, and juſtified themſelves againſt the Voice and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45696:23"/>
Word of the Lord, their Eyes being cloſed, their Ears ſhut and Hearts hardened againſt that of God in them, as may be read in <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> 2. and in divers other places, even to Admiration. And what wickedneſs is ſo great, which the hardened man will not plead for, and be defending and juſtifying himſelf in? Yea, if God do open mens underſtandings in ſome meaſure, ſo that they cannot but confeſs ſuch and ſuch things to be evil in general (as Pride, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, drunkenneſs, riotouſneſs, exceſs in apparel, lying, ſwearing, &amp;c.) yet they are not able to ſee the evil and danger of theſe things in and to themſelves, but have covers and excuſes to hide them, unleſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Light and Spirit of the Lord ſearch their hearts, and make them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, Conſider the weight and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tendency of theſe two Scriptures,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45696:23"/>
and do not form another meaning, and ſo put off the drift and intent of God's holy Spirit in them. The firſt is that of the Apoſtle, Epheſ. 5.13.14. <hi>But all things that are reproved, are made manifeſt by the Light: For whatſoever doth make manifeſt, is Light. Wherefore he ſaith, Awake thou that ſheepeſt, &amp;c.</hi> Every man is bid to Awake, becauſe every man hath ſome proportion of that in him, which (if hearkened to) will reprove, rouſe up and awaken him, and lead him from among the dead, to him who gives the Light and cauſeth it to ſhine in him, even in the midſt of his darkneſs and corruption, that it might awaken him out of it. The other Scripture is that of <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>7. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Fleſh its luſting againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and that theſe two are contrary. Did not God's Spirit ſtrive with the old World? not only with the Sons of God, who
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45696:24"/>
had corrupted themſelves, but with the reſt alſo? And what is it that hath ſtriven with wicked men ſince, and that doth ſtrive with wicked men ſtill? Is it not the ſame good Spirit? What is it alſo that inwardly reſiſts and luſts againſt the Will and ſtrivings of God's Spirit? Is it not Fleſh? So here are the two Seeds, the two Principles (which are contrary one to the other) near man. For there is the Creature man (which of right is the Lords) into whom the Deſtroyer hath gained enterance, and in whom he rules by the Law of Sin and Death. Now, he who made man ſeeketh after him, and findeth out his Enemy in man, and giveth forth a Law againſt him inwardly in the heart: which ſo far as any man gives ear to, believes and receives, there ariſeth preſently a fight and ſtriving between theſe two contrary Principles in him, ſo that this man cannot do the things that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45696:24"/>
he would. Now that which thus ſtrives againſt ſin in any man, and troubles him becauſe of ſin, reproving and condemning him for it; that is of another nature then the Fleſh, (which harbours ſin) and contrary to it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, conſider the great love of God to mankind, and the great care he hath of them. Firſt, as touching their Bodies. How doth he provide for the Bodies of all mankind! He would have none hurt, none deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but feedeth all, nouriſheth all, making plentiful proviſion and giving fruitful ſeaſons, cauſing his Sun to ſhine and his Rain to deſcend on all. Then, as to their Souls: He knoweth the preciouſneſs thereof, and what the loſs of a Soul is: yea he knoweth how eager the Devourer is to deſtroy, and ſetteth himſelf againſt him. He is the Father of Spirits, and his Son the Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45696:25"/>
whoſe nature it is to gather and ſave; and it is ſaid expreſly of God, by the Teſtimony of the Spirit of Truth, that he would <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave all to be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the Truth. And whereas it was ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that God was as the Potter, and they as the Clay; and he could make them Veſſels either of honour or diſhonour at his pleaſure, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.6. yet it was ſaid to this end, even to invite and incourage them to be ſubject to him, that they might be made Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of honour by him, as appears <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Now conſider; If God be as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſouls, as of the bodies of men; doth he not make proviſion for the ſoul, as well as for the body? Would he not have the ſoul live, and would he not have the ſoul fed, as well as the body? If ſo: then needs muſt the light of his holy Spirit ſhine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly throughout all Nations, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45696:25"/>
the ſaving Grace and Power be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt everywhere, even in every heart, in ſome meaſure, and the Fleſh and Blood of the Son of God (which is the ſouls food) be diſtributed to all. And truly, the Lord is not an hard Maſter to any, (as the unprofitable Servant, in every Diſpenſation, is ready to account of him:) for the times of ignorance and darkneſs God winketh at or paſſeth over, being very tender towards men in that eſtate: yea, a little that is of him, turned to and heeded, according to the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Underſtanding that God gives, will be owned and accepted, even in the midſt of a great deal of Darkneſs and evil-working againſt it.</p>
               <p>There was a time before the Law (for the Law was given by <hi>Moſes</hi>) what ſaved then? Was it any thing but the ſaving Grace, the ſaving Light, the ſaving Spirit, the holy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45696:26"/>
Anointing? Could any be ſaved, but thereby?</p>
               <p>What ſaved under the Law? Did the Shadows then ſave, or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Life vailed under them? Did not the Spirit then work inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, redeem inwardly, ſave inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Did not the Word or Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments nigh in the mouth and heart (to which <hi>Moſes</hi> by Gods direction had turned their minds) enlighten and ſave inwardly?</p>
               <p>And any of the Gentiles, as this Word or Spirit of Life did work in them, did it not circumciſe inwardly and ſave them alſo? So that though they had not the Law or Miniſtration of <hi>Moſes</hi> outward, yet they had the inward Writing from God on their hearts, and ſhewed the work and efficacy of it there, and ſhall at laſt be juſtified by and according to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel, which juſtifieth all whatſoever, ſo far as in any meaſure
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45696:26"/>
they receive and are ſubject to the Light and Law of Gods pure Spirit, which the carnal mind cannot receive nor be ſubject to.</p>
               <p>O that men could dye to themſelves, even to their own wiſdom and pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and not lean to their own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, nor idolize their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and conceivings, but wait to receive underſtanding from God, who giveth liberally of the true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to thoſe that ask and wait a right! And how doth God give true Wiſdom and Underſtanding? Is it not by the ſhining of his Light in the heart? O that men were turned inwardly thither, and inwardly dead to that wiſdom and prudency from which God ever hid things and ever will. He that will be truly wiſe, muſt firſt become a Fool, that he may be wiſe: that is, He muſt not ſtrive to learn in the comprehenſive way of mans wiſdom and prudency the things of Gods Kingdom, but feel
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45696:27"/>
the begettings of life in his heart, and in that receive ſomewhat of the new &amp; heavenly Underſtanding, and ſo dye to the other, &amp; know no more the things of God after the fleſh, that is, as a wiſe man, as a learned Scribe, as a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant (for where is the Wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the Diſputer of this World? Can they find out the myſtery of life, the Myſtery of Gods Kingdom in this Age, any more then they could in former Ages?) but become a Babe, a Fool, and ſo receive and bow to that which his own wiſdom will call fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and account weakneſs, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Birth which is begotten and born of God, will know and daily experience to be the Wiſdom and Power of God unto Salvation.</p>

            <head>An APPEAL to the Witneſs of God in all Conſciences; which is the More Sure Word of Propheſie, the Teſtimony of the Scriptures <hi>Without,</hi> or the Voice and Teſtimony of the Light and Spirit of God <hi>Within</hi> in the Heart.</head>
            <p>THe Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of a more ſure word of Propheſie (or of a more ſure prophetical word, as the Greek hath it) then that voice which came from Heaven, which they heard, when they were with Chriſt in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mount, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. Now what this more ſure word is, which ought to be given heed to in the moſt eſpecial manner, more then to ſuch
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45696:28"/>
an eminent Voice and Teſtimony from Heaven, even from the excellent Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is a very great and weighty Queſtion. Now ſome affirm that it is the word and teſtimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without, others affirm that its the voice, ſound and teſtimony of the Word of Life within.</p>
            <p>I do not know a Scripture that my heart hath been more tenderly ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about, deſiring to give due honour both to the Spirit of God and to the holy Scriptures, and alſo to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the Lord would have me in the moſt eſpecial manner give heed to, until the ſeaſon came from him, in which he ſhould cauſe the Day to dawn and the Day-Star to ariſe in my heart. And now that others might come to the ſame underſtanding and ſatisfaction alſo, are theſe following Conſiderations propoſed in the weight of my Spirit to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:45696:28"/>Firſt, conſider how ſure the Word of Propheſie was, how ſure the Voice and Teſtimony from Heaven was, then which the Apoſtle directs them to ſomewhat as more ſure. This I may clearly ſay of it, It was undoubtedly from God, and that in a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner, even in Chriſts preſence, when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were with him, and God beſtowing upon him honour and glory, transfiguring him before his Diſciples, cauſing his face to ſhine as the Sun, and making his Raiment white as the Light, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.2. And the intent of it was to give the Diſciples full evidence and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (for the Voice was not for his ſake, but for theirs) or rather that they might have a full ground, after his death and reſurrection, to teſtifie for the ſatisfaction and confirmation of others: for till then, they were to keep it ſecret, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Now that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45696:29"/>
which was thus provided for this end, doubtleſs it was very ſure, teſtified by them who were choſen to be faithful Witneſſes in this reſpect.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Conſider, Whether the Teſtimonies of the Prophets concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt were ſurer, then this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Voice from God himſelf? Were they ſurer to thoſe that lived in thoſe dayes, or to thoſe that ſhould come after, then this Teſtimony was to the Apoſtles and to thoſe they did communicate it in the Will and Counſel of the Lord? The Prophets did teſtifie from Gods holy, unerring Spirit: but they that lived in thoſe dayes, did not alwayes believe and receive their Propheſies, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doubted of them and queſtioned them; yea their Propheſies were not alwayes evident and clearly underſtood by thoſe who deſired to underſtand, but their Viſions were many times a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45696:29"/>
Book ſealed, both to the learned and unlearned. But this Teſtimony, this Word of Propheſie, this Voice from the excellent Glory <hi>(This is my beloved Son, hear him</hi>) is a very plain, evident, full Teſtimony, eaſie to be underſtood by any in that preſent or in after Ages: and I muſt confeſs, as to my ſelf, the reading of it did alwayes deeply affect and ſatisfie my heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Conſider the manner of Gods appearing to the Prophets, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the manner of this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. God appeared to them ſometimes in Viſions, ſometimes in Dreams. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw a Buſh burning, and heard a Voice. <hi>The Viſion of Iſaiah the ſon of Amos,</hi> Iſa. 1.1. and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw Viſions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1. and <hi>Daniel</hi> had a Dream and Viſions on his Bed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.1. And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had that ſweet Propheſie (of Gods ſatiating the weary ſoul, and repleniſhing every
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45696:30"/>
ſorrowful ſoul) in his ſleep, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.26. Now here, to theſe bleſſed Apoſtles, was a Viſion given of the glory of Chriſt, and of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> with him; not in the mind or head, as <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſions were, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.1. but the excellent glory did appear, and Chriſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were really there together on the mount (which is more then a prophetick Viſion of a thing) and Chriſt was cloathed with and ſwallowed up in the glory. For God the Father did ſet himſelf to honour and glorifie him ſo, as never man was glorified before; and the Voice came (the certain Voice: What Voice could be more certain?) from the excellent Glory, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. And this pure Viſion of Glory (even of Gods thus appearing, and Chriſts thus transfiguring) they ſaw, and heard the Voice which came from Heaven, when they were with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45696:30"/>
him in the holy Mount. Now were <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat he ſhould be thus and thus, &amp;c. equal to this in evidence and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. Why was <hi>John</hi> greater then the reſt of the Prophets? Was it not in that he was choſen to be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Fore-runner and Preparer of the Way, and could point with his finger to the <hi>Meſſiah?</hi> And yet, is not this immediate teſtimony from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Glory, greater then the teſtimony of <hi>John?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Conſider, Whether Chriſts own Words, in the Fleſh, to his Diſciples, were ſurer then this Voice from the excellent Glory? If I ſhould extol the Words of Chriſt in the Fleſh, above the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which teſtified of him, ſhould I therein do the words and teſtimonies of the Prophets any wrong? He was
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45696:31"/>
the Son, he had the fulneſs of Life, the fulneſs of the Spirit, the great authority and vertue of God his Father. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpoke in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> (Hebr. 1.1, 2.) ſeeming to exalt and magnifie Gods ſpeaking by his Son, and the Way of this Miniſtration above the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prophets (which Miniſtration was firſt by him in fleſh, afterwards in Spirit, which is properly called the Miniſtration of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8.) Now conſider, whether this ſure word of Propheſie from the excellent Glory, ſo immediately from the Majeſty on High, was not intended by him as a ſeal to the Faith of the Diſciples, as a ſeal to Chriſt's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Fleſh, and to what he had taught them (which was ſometimes in Parables, and not ſo fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45696:31"/>
by them;) and whether this was not more bright, more raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, more certain, more eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then his common Preſence and Appearance among them, and then the words which he from the Father, not the Father ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately himſelf ſpake to them? For that which is given to confirm a thing, is (in order of nature and for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſake) more certain and clear, then that which it is given to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, Conſider, Whether the Voice of Gods Spirit and Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in the heart, be not more clear and certain to him that hears it, then any Word or Teſtimony from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? Is it not a ſurer Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, then this Relation or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Apoſtles, of what they heard from the excellent Glory? yea is it not ſurer then any Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45696:32"/>
of the Scriptures, or then all outward Teſtimonies put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly, Conſider, Whether they who are turned from Darkneſs to the Light, even to the inward Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods holy Spirit, ought not to give diligent heed unto it, until the day dawn and the Day-Star ariſe in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Conſider, What is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between this Light ſhining (as a Word of Propheſie) in the dark place, and the day dawning and the Day-Star ariſing in the heart? Is it not the ſame Light, only further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and ſhining in it's glory, in the holy and pure place?</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> excellently openeth the thing, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.25.20, 27. Firſt he ſpeaketh of the Word in general, which he was to fulfil, or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45696:32"/>
fully to preach. Then he ſheweth how this Word is a Myſtery, hid in the Gentiles (for ſo the <hi>Greek verſ.</hi> 27. is) even in them that believe not; the Word is nigh there, the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Commandment of Life nigh there. But, in thoſe that receive the Grace, and believe in the Light, and ſo become children of the Light, and walk in the Light as God is in the Light; in them Chriſt is riſen, and they are riſen together with him, and he is in them the hope of glory. So that the day hath dawned, there the Day-Star hath ariſen; and they know not only a Meaſure of Grace from Chriſt, but Chriſt himſelf ariſen, dwelling, living, acting, walking in them, and they in him.</p>
            <p>Let theſe things be duly conſidered of and equally weighed in the holy Ballance, and then I dare appeal to every ſerious and ſober heart and mind, Whether the inward Light, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45696:33"/>
Word, the word nigh in the mouth and heart, and the holy living teſtimony thereof, the voice of the Witneſs within, of the Propheſie within, be not ſurer to that man that hath it, and hears and knows the voice of it, then any outward voice or teſtimony whatſoever?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. But ſome may object thus, or after this manner. I am ſatisfied that there is a Word nigh in the mouth and heart (to which</hi> Moſes <hi>did direct the</hi> Jews, <hi>and the Apoſtles the Chriſtians) and that this Word doth enlighten the mind, and doth ſeparate in the mouth between words and words, and is a ſwift Witneſs againſt the bad words, and a Juſtifier of the good words, which come from the truth and uprightneſs of the heart, and are ſeaſoned with grace. I alſo believe that this Word is quick and powerful in the heart, ſeparating and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding between the thoughts and intents there, and that the teſtimony thereof is ſurer
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45696:33"/>
and clearer (as to the hearts in which it ſhines, and to them whoſe ſpiritual ears are opened to hear its voice) then any words and teſtimonies from without. And I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied alſo, that they who are the Sheep of Chriſt, do thus hear the Shepherds Voice, and do know both the Voice behind them, when it comes after them to reprove their wandrings and direct their minds into the true Way, and alſo the voice before them, when the Shepherd (who is the Leader</hi>) putteth forth his Sheep, and goeth before them and they follow him, for they knew his Voice, <hi>John</hi> 10.4. <hi>Yea, I have had the experience hereof in my own heart: for I have felt that work within, and that living ſweet teſtimony of Gods Spirit in my own heart, which hath been more to me, then all that ever I heard or read, from without: ſo that I can truly ſay (with the</hi> Samaritans, <hi>John</hi> 4.42.) <hi>Now I believe, not becauſe of the teſtimonies or words I have heard from without, but from the evidence and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Life and of Gods holy Spirit in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45696:34"/>
my own heart. Nor can I ſee, how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> Peter <hi>in this place, can prefer the Teſtimonies of the Prophets (for that which is called the new Teſtament, was not yet writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and added to the old) before this glorious immediate Teſtimony from God Almighty, which Chriſt was honoured with, and they were greatly honoured in being admitted to be Beholders and Witneſſes of. Yet ſomewhat ſticks with me, namely thoſe words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi> ver. 20.21. <hi>wherein he plainly ſeems to me to ſpeak of the Scriptures or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophets, as if that had been the more ſure Word of Propheſie, which in this place he had directed to. For why ſhould he ſay thus,</hi> Knowing this firſt, &amp;c. <hi>unleſs he had intended the ſame Word of Propheſie, which he had been ſpeaking of before, and directing their minds how they might make uſe of that Word of Propheſie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Peter</hi> was the Miniſter of the Circumciſion, and he was to deal with people who were great Admirers and Studiers of the Letter. Therefore
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45696:34"/>
though he, as well as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> and the other Apoſtles (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.) was to direct men to the Word within and Light within: yet he knew it was of great concernment to them, rightly to read and be able to underſtand the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without. Therefore having firſt dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them to the Word of propheſie, to the Path of the Juſt, which is the inward ſhining Light, to the Light which ſhines more and more in the dark place, to them that give heed to it: in the next place it was very proper, uſeful and neceſſary, to direct them how to read the Scriptures aright. For indeed, the Oracles of God were given to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. and they ought to be diligent in the reading of them, that they might underſtand the holy Propheſies and precious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp;c. and reap the hope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them, and be made Partakers of the divine Nature, which is the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45696:35"/>
thing promiſed. And not only to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to the Chriſtians gathered from among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in that Age, were the Scriptures greatly uſeful: and ſo they are alſo to ſuch as are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the holy Spirit and Power of God in this Age. The Propheſies, the Judgments, the Promiſes, the Mercies, the Experience, &amp;c. are all uſeful and profitable, to thoſe that read and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them in the Light of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit. But the firſt thing needful is to turn a mans mind to the Light, that he may have ſomewhat to guide him, ſomwhat to ſtay his mind upon in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, ſomwhat to open and unſeal the holy and divine Words and Myſteries to him. For no man can truly and rightly underſtand the Scriptures, but as his mind is opened by the Lord, and the underſtanding of words and things given him. So that this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding neceſſary to be known (after a man is turned to the Light and Word of Propheſie within, and comes to read the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45696:35"/>
outward Oracles and Teſtmonies of the holy Spirit) that all holy men ſpake not in their own wills; not in the will of the Fleſh, not in the will of man; but as the Spirit of God gave them words and moved them to ſpeak. And thoſe words, ſpoken by Gods Spirit, knoweth none but that Spirit which ſpake them. So that no man ought to venture by his private Spirit, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to open and interpret thoſe words; but he muſt firſt receive the ſame Word of Life, the ſame Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie within, and wait upon him and learn to know his Voice, who openeth what and when he pleaſeth to the ſons of men, either of what he ſpake for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, or of what he pleaſeth to ſpeak now. And ſo, when the ſame Word of Life ſpeaks in a mans heart now, ſhewing things to come, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a mans ſelf or others, that man muſt be careful to retire and lie very low before the Lord, waiting
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45696:36"/>
upon him for the true underſtanding and right interpreting of his own words, elſe a man may eaſily miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and miſ-apply what was truly and rightly ſpoken. So that this is the right way of underſtanding the Words of Propheſie from the holy men of God in former Ages, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Word of Life in the heart. <hi>The ſecrets of the Lord are with them that fear him.</hi> In the true fear the Ear is opened and the right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding given: but in the wiſdom of the Fleſh, and in the confidence thereof, it is eaſie erring at any time from the true ſenſe and right uſe of that, which was opened and given by God, either for the ſouls own good, or for the good of others.</p>
            <p>To Conclude this appeal: There is one conſideration on my heart to propoſe to the ſerious and ſober mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and Oh that they might rightly conſider and underſtand it. David
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45696:36"/>
was a man after Gods own heart, a wiſe man, an inwardly exerciſed man, an experienced man, an holy, ſpiritual, heavenly man; a man who knew the inward, everlaſting Kingdom, and had the Spirit of God, and witneſſed his Truth in the inward parts. Can ye think that <hi>David</hi> did not know the Word and Commandment of Life within? Did not God write his Law in his heart? how elſe could he become a man after Gods own heart? Did not he witneſs the everlaſting Covenant and the Law thereof, the new Law, the living Law, even the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus? Now when <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul:</hi> What Law did he mean? What is the Law, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the ſoul to God? Can any thing leſs then an inward Power, an inward Light, an inward Law, an inward Life, then the inward drawings and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gods Spirit, convert the ſoul
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45696:37"/>
to God? And what teſtimony is that, which makes wiſe the ſimple? Is it not the inward teſtimony? What made him wiſer then the Ancients, and then his Teachers, who knew and could teach the Law outward? were they not the inward teachings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward precepts of Gods holy Spirit from the Word of Life within, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs was very nigh him, he being a man ſo exerciſed by Gods Spirit, and ſo formed after his heart? And what are thoſe right Statutes, which rejoyce the heart? and the pure Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which enlightens the eyes? and the clean fear, and the righteous Judgments? Are not theſe all things known within, and received within? Doth not God put his fear within, in the heart? Doth not God reveal his righteous Judgements within, againſt ſin and iniquity? O how did <hi>David</hi> cry out, becauſe of Gods dreadful judgements upon him for ſin, and ſaid,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45696:37"/>
his Sore ran in the night, and he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his Couch with his Tears? and in another place, <hi>My Fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And when he ſpeaketh ſo much (as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. of Gods Word, Gods Law, his Teſtimonies, Precepts, Statutes, Judgements, &amp;c. what doth he ſpeak of? Doth he ſpeak of the outward, or inward miniſtration of the word in the heart? Doth he not ſpeak of the inward writing? of the Law in the heart? of the Commandment in the heart? of the teſtimony of Life there? For he had the Teſtimony with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Spirit within, the Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Light within, the inward and ſpiritual Kingdom (wherein the holy dominion of God is revealed) he knew within: and ſo, believing, could ſpeak of the power and glory thereof, and of Gods wonderous works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. And when he ſaid, <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp unto my Feet, and a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45696:38"/>
Light unto my Path</hi>: What Word did he mean? Did he mean the Letter or Law outward? or the Word nigh in the mouth and heart, which <hi>Moſes</hi> had teſtified of and directed the <hi>Jews</hi> to, and he himſelf had been very well acquainted with? When, again, he ſaith, <hi>Wherewithal ſhall a young man cleanſe his way?</hi> and immediately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the anſwer, By taking heed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy word. Doth he mean the Letter without, or the Word within? What is it, that cleanſeth the heart? that cleanſeth the way? Is it any leſs then the Water of Life, then the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant, then the Word and Life of Truth within? <hi>Sanctifie them by thy Truth, thy Word is Truth.</hi> In the ſenſe of that inwardly and obedience to it, is the renewing and Sanctification felt. And ſo this brings to be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in the way, and to keep the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Life, and preſerves from
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45696:38"/>
doing iniquity. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who walk in the Law of the Lord. Bleſſed are they that keep his Teſtimonies, that ſeek him with the whole heart. They alſo do no iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> Had he no experience of theſe things himſelf? Yea ſurely. He knew the holy heart, the pure heart, the new and heavenly Image, the heart after Gods own heart: and he knew what it was to walk in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and to be kept out of Sin: Hear what he himſelf ſaith, Pſal. 18.21. &amp;c. <hi>For I have kept the Wayes of the Lord, and have not wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly departed from my God. For all his Judgements were before me, and I did not put away his Statutes from me. I was alſo upright before him: and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity:</hi> What was that? Was not that it which had moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over him, and was moſt apt to entangle and enſnare him? Now,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45696:39"/>
he that arrives here, he that doth this, that keeps himſelf from his iniquity, doubtleſs witneſſeth great power and victory over leſſer and ſmaller Sins. Was not <hi>David</hi> ſtrong in the Lord and in the Power of his might? did not the Word of God abide in him? did not he overcome the wicked one by the Power thereof? How elſe could he walk thus in the Wayes of the Lord, as he expreſſeth, and keep himſelf from his iniquity?</p>
            <p>Now, this Word of Life, theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Teſtimonies and Precepts, yea the everlaſting Ordinances and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the new Covenant, with the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi>: which Word <hi>Moſes</hi> had teſtified of and directed to, and <hi>David</hi> had experienced (it being the Pearl he had treaſured up and hid in his heart) and which was the Word of Faith which <hi>Paul</hi> and the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preached and teſtified of, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45696:39"/>
men from darkneſs to this inward Light; I ſay, this Word, this living Word (and the inward Miniſtration thereof) God hath revealed and made manifeſt in this our day, and hath turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the minds of many to it, and is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inviting men to <hi>Shiloh</hi>'s Streams, to the living Waters, to the Light and Habitation of the Living. Bleſſed are they that hear the joyful ſound, and come to the holy Mount and City of our God, where Life lives and reigns, and is fed on by all the living; who are Gods elect, Gods Heritage, Gods Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of Red Wine, Gods encloſed Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, whom he watcheth over night and day, and watereth every moment; and in whom he dwelleth and walketh, and is to them a God and Father, and maketh them daily ſenſible that they are his Servants, Children and Spouſe, in whom is his great delight, and on whoſe hearts and fore-heads is written, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord.</hi> Yea and the Lord

            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:45696:40"/>
            <head>Poſtſcript.</head>
            <argument>
               <p> There is a Scripture now openeth in me, as it hath often done; and it hath been very ſweet to my Taſte; but I have not had freedom to give it forth to others, as at this time it is with me to do: It is that <hi>Scripture,</hi> Rom. 9.18. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath he Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he Hardeneth.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NOw many apprehend from this Scripture, as I alſo formerly did, That God hath Choſen out a certain Number of Perſons, on
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45696:41"/>
whom he will have Mercy and Save by Chriſt Jeſus the Lord; and that he hath paſſed over the reſt, ſo that they were never intended to have any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by Chriſt's death, as to their Eternal Salvation. This the wiſdom of man, from the Letter of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and many other places, may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend and ſtrongly reaſon for. But as the Lord openeth the mind, and men come to a ſenſe of his Nature and Spirit, and his Intent in ſending his Son, and receive the Key which opens the Truth as it is in Jeſus; they will eaſily ſee that this is contrary to Gods Nature, and his Intent in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son, and the univerſall Covenant of Light and Life, and the manifeſt Teſtimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As touching the Nature of God. His Nature is Love; Love to all his Creatures. He would not have it go ill with any of them. He
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45696:41"/>
needeth not their Miſery to make himſelf Happy. His Nature is to love, to Bleſs to Save: not to Deſtroy or Cut off, not to Afflict or Grieve the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, not to Hurt either the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Soul of any. He preſerveth man and Beaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As touching his ſending his Son. He ſent him in his Love to Mankind, to ſave Mankind. His Love was not to a few only: but he loved all his Creatures, he loved all loſt Souls; and he ſent his Son to ſave them all. He gave him Light to enlighten them all, and he gave him Life to quicken them all; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he diſpenceth this in various wayes, according to the Infinite Wiſdom and Good Pleaſure of his Father.</p>
            <p>So that, Thirdly, the Covenant of Light and Life is univerſal and nigh all Mankind, by which the darkeſt parts and corners of the Earth are at
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45696:42"/>
ſometimes enlightened, and feel ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Quickning Life. For the life is the light of men: and the light comes from the life, and is a quick, piercing, quickning, Light, conveying Warmth and Life, yea living Vertue into the darkeſt hearts, as it moves and finds entertainment in them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As for the Teſtimony of the Scriptures, it is very clear that God would have none to Periſh. <hi>All Souls are mine,</hi> ſaith the Lord, Ezek. 18.4. <hi>I have no Pleaſure in the Death of him that dyeth,</hi> ver. 32. and again, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no Pleaſure in the Death of the Wicked,</hi> Chap. 33.11. I have ſent my Light to enlighten all men, and turn all men; and I would have all men receive it and be turned by it. I have ſhewed every man what is Good, and what I the Lord require of him: and I would have every man anſwer the Manifeſtation of my Light
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45696:42"/>
and Spirit in him. Do ye not read Gods charge againſt the whole Earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.5. That they had tranſgreſſed the Law, changed the Ordinance, broken the everlaſting Covenant? Why then they all had the Law, had the Ordinance, had the everlaſting Covenant: and for this cauſe it is that the Curſe and Judgement comes upon them, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. So that this was the Condemnation from the begining, and this is the Condemnation ſtill, that Light is come into the World, and men love darkneſs rather then Light, becauſe their Deeds are Evil. Men are not condemned for want of Light from Chriſt Jeſus; but becauſe they do not believe in and obey that Light which they have from him: becauſe they believe in the Darkneſs, believe in the dark ſpirit, believe in the dark power which riſeth up againſt the Miniſtration of Light in the heart; and do not believe in that which is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45696:43"/>
given of God to diſcover and work it out. What ſhould I multiply Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for? That common Scripture is abſolutely undeniable (as the Lord opens the heart unto the Simplicity of Truth, and keeps it out of the ſubtle, enchanting wiſdom) <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>For God ſo Loved the World, that he gave his onely begotten Son: that whoſoever believeth in Him, ſhould not Periſh, but have Everlaſting Life. For God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World: But that the World through him might be ſaved.</hi> What can be more naked and plain then theſe Words of Chriſt, who knew the very Heart of God in this particular, and plainly declares what it is: even not to condemn, not to deſtroy; but to ſave men from Condemnation and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And would Chriſt have ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately Wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had he known it to have been his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45696:43"/>
Fathers will and Determinate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, that they ſhould have periſhed, and not have been gathered and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him? I ſhall add but one Place more, where the Apoſtle (who knew God's Counſel, and underſtood the Myſtery of Election and Reprobation, and had the Mind of Chriſt) ſaith expreſly, that <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. What words can be ſpoken more plain and full? And let People mind, that theſe words are far plainer and eaſier to be underſtood, then thoſe Scriptures which treat of Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is a deep Myſtery; and men muſt come to a growth in the Truth, before they can receive that capacity, which is neceſſary towards the underſtanding of them. But to open the thing a little, as it is now in my heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:45696:44"/>There hath been a threefold Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God to Mankind. A Diſpenſation of the Law to the <hi>Jews.</hi> A Diſpenſation of the Goſpel (or promiſe, which was as well before the Law, as after it) to the called <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And a ſecret, hidden Diſpenſation of the Myſtery of Grace, of the Myſtery of Life and Salvation, which the Apoſtle calls the Myſtery hid in the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Coloſſ.</hi> 1.27. For ſomewhat of God, ſomewhat of the Nature and Spirit of Chriſt, the Souls of all Mankind have had neer them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them, and to turn them from Satan's power to God; though it hath not been a thing known to them, but a Myſtery hid in them.</p>
            <p>Now, that God did caſt off any <hi>Jew</hi> under the Law, or any whom he viſits with the Grace and Power of the Goſpel, from a meer, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45696:44"/>
will in himſelf, becauſe he would deſtroy them and have them periſh, to ſhew forth the Praiſe of his Juſtice, and his abſolute Soveraignity: this the true ſenſe of Life in me denies. But all have a viſit, of that which ſaves, heartily and in true Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will from God: and he that is turned to that which God hath ſent to turn him, ſhall be owned and ſaved thereby. He that believeth in the Truth, in the Light, in the Word nigh; even in the very loweſt appearance of it (for the loweſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is the ſame thing in nature with the higheſt; and the Grace is ſaving in its very loweſt appearance, as well as in its higheſt) ſhall be ſaved thereby.</p>
            <p>Now mark: God's Grace, God's Mercy, God's Love, Gods Light, God's Spirit, God's Power, &amp;c. is his own: And he may do with his own what he pleaſeth. Now,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45696:45"/>
it being by this that he ſtrives, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts and ſaves: And it being in his own will and good pleaſure, how long he will ſtrive and contend to ſave; it lieth therefore abſolutely in him, even in his own will, what he will do in this kind. He may take advantage againſt Rebellious Man, and cut him off when he will: And again, he may ſtrive and raiſe true ſenſe in a mans heart, and give Repentance and Pardon his Tranſgreſſions as long as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; Yea, he may ſo change a man's heart, and ſo Create him a new in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo bring him into Unity with the pure Seed, and to that eſtate in the Seed, as that he may have aſſurance he ſhall never be utterly caſt off: But that though he ſhould Sin, and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Holy Law of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, his Iniquity ſhall be chaſtiſed with Stripes, and his Soul recovered
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45696:45"/>
and brought back thereby, but not utterly rejected by the Lord. Now, it being thus, hath not God Mercy on whom he will? And doth not he Harden as he pleaſeth? Did not God give up the <hi>Jews</hi> to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, after much ſtriving with them? Did not God give up the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to hardneſs, and to vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the true God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had rejected a meaſure of the True Knowledge? (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21.) Have not the Veſſels of Wrath, who are fitted to deſtruction, a day of much long-ſuffering firſt? <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. Had not the Old World, who were fitted for that Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Floud, a long day of Patience and Forbearance from God, his Spirit reproving of them and ſtriving with them? To what end did God forbear them, and cauſe his Spirit to ſtrive with them? Was it not to lead them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45696:46"/>
that thereby they might have Avoided that Deſtruction, which by their Rebellion and Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, againſt God's good and Tender Spirit, they were fitted for and expoſed to? See <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. So for <hi>Cain.</hi> How tenderly did God deal with him! how uprightly did God ſeek his good! Would not God have had him come to a true ſenſe and repentance? Would not God have had him believed and offered in the Faith, and been accepted as his brother was? And for <hi>Pharaoh</hi>: God, indeed, was againſt that nature and Spirit in him, which oppreſſed <hi>Iſrael</hi>: but would not the Lord have had him denied and turned from that nature and Spirit, and let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go? God would have no man do evil and bring upon themſelves De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, though in his juſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is many times provoked to give men up to that, which leadeth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45696:46"/>
into and hardeneth in Evil. So not onely <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to their own hearts Luſts, when they would none of the Lord, nor hearken to his counſel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12. But, ſaith the Lord, O that it had been otherwiſe! <hi>O that my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had hearkened unto me,</hi> &amp;c. it ſhould then have been otherwiſe with them, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So that God, of himſelf, doth not deſire the Deſtruction of his Creature; nor doth he deſire to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them, or to give them up to a deluding ſpirit, that they might be damned: but men firſt refuſe the Truth and turn from it, or let it go, not receiving it in the love of it, or not liking to retain the knowledge of it (which is Death to the man's corrupt nature, ſpirit, will and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſuch a Croſs and Yoke, as he is in no wiſe willing to bear:) and then the Lord, in his juſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45696:47"/>
Judgement, gives them up to the Deceitfulneſs of Sin, to be harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. Now this liveth in God's own Breaſt when and to whom to do it, according to his own Will, and according to his own Wiſdom and Counſel; ſo that it may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly ſaid, <hi>He hath mercy and Compaſſion on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> But that God hath determined to harden any, without giving them a Day of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; or that it is Gods Will and determinate Counſel, that men ſhould reject the Day of his Mercy and precious Invitation, that they might be hardened by him and periſh: This is not God's Truth, but mens Miſ-Apprehenſions upon true words, gathering Meanings therefrom in their own wiſdom, and not waiting upon God till he cauſe the true Light to ſhine in them, and thereby give them the True
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45696:47"/>
Knowledge and Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Therefore, ſince there is ſuch Mercy in God towards all, and he hath given all men a Day of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, greater or leſſer; yea, ſince of late he hath cauſed his Light to ſhine forth, and given this Age ſuch a Viſitation, as many Ages have not had: O let men take heed how they cloſe their Eyes, ſtop their Ears and harden their Hearts againſt it; leſt they provoke God to give them up to their own imaginary, conceited, fleſhly comprehenſive knowledge of the Letter, and ſo ſeal them up in that hardneſs of heart and deafneſs of Spirit, which they firſt gave themſelves up to. For the Letter without the Spirit killeth: And ſo doth all litteral knowledge: and there needs no greater Curſe from God (it will ſufficiently avenge the Cauſe of his Reproached Light and holy Covenant of Life in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45696:48"/>
Chriſt Jeſus, now abundantly revealed and made manifeſt) then to cloſe mens Eyes, and ſtop their Ears, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their Hearts (in their Litteral Knowledges and Practiſes) from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and partaking of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life and Vertue of this holy and Living Miniſtration in Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, wherewith God viſiteth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemeth his people.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Phyſitian is come inwardly and ſpiritually, and he inwardly heals and reſtoreth his People; faithfully, ſeeking after the Sick, the Diſtreſſed, the Broken, the Wounded; pouring Oyl into their Wounds, and healing them. But there are ſome, who are ſo ſound and whole in their notional Apprehenſions and Practiſes, that they have no need of the Phyſitian: and then the Phyſitian paſſeth by, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him, and whom he intendeth ſhall have no ſhare with him. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols</hi> (he is well, he hath
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45696:48"/>
enough, he hath no need of me) <hi>let him alone,</hi> ſaith the Lord. I will pour out the choice Vertue of my Spiritual Life, and redeeming Power, among my gathered Sheep and Lambs, who have need thereof and will rejoyce therein. Theſe will know my Voice, theſe will juſtifie the appearance of my ſpirit and power, theſe love the ſavour of my Anointing and precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which runs down from the Head upon all the Living Body: and theſe ſhall have it. Theſe underſtand how I have Mercy on whom I will, and whom I will I Hearden: and it is my will to have Mercy on theſe, my once greatly Diſtreſſed Ones, and to deſtroy (inwardly to deſtroy, O who knows what that means) the fat and the ſtrong, and to feed them with judgement. O that men did know to whom the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to whom the Judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. To the wiſdom of the Fleſh, to the wiſe Comprehenders of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45696:49"/>
things of God after the Fleſh, is the judgement: to the Poor, to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, to the Broken in Spirit (not to them that are at eaſe in their Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Knowledge, but to the Mourners in <hi>Sion</hi> after the holy God, and his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Power and Righteouſneſs) is the Everlaſting Goſpel, the Mercy, the Love, the Peace, the binding-up, the Redemption which is by Chriſt Jeſus, the living Miniſter in the holy Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary of our God.</p>
