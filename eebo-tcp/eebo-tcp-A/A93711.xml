         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SOme of you know the meetings we have had with this decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Brother, and the purpoſe ſtill of all our diſputings, as your
ſelves well know, ended only in this, that you would lay by
the formes in practiſe, and ſtrengthen the hands of our godly bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in the Reformation, but we could not prevaile upon you, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Arguments were too weak, or your corruptions too

may heare an Argument ſtronger then ours, the words of your dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brother, which I had concealed from the world, had not the
Lord ſent down a <hi>beam from heaven</hi> into the deceaſed, to give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony

I that I ſhould withſtand God?</hi> And here I am ſorry that you were
not preſent to have <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>heard,</hi> you might have ſeen one whom
you knew well, ſpeaking with a power more then his own, <hi>For it
was not he that ſpoke, but our heavenly Father which ſpoke in him:</hi> you
might have ſeen the <hi>picture</hi> of <hi>one</hi> in another world, a <hi>copy</hi> of the
<hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as if <hi>God</hi> had <hi>raiſed</hi> him from the <hi>grave</hi> to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
unto the <hi>truth:</hi> you might have heard ſuch expreſſions as are
not to be heard from Pulpits, words that were ſpirited more then
ordinary, as <hi>one having authority, and not as the Scribes,</hi> and here I
ſhall repeat them, but that <hi>heavenly accent</hi> they had from him, I
cannot: my prayer is, that this paper may breath out his laſt ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſo effectually to the world, that all (but thoſe, whom neither
the <hi>Arguments</hi> of the <hi>living</hi> nor <hi>dying</hi> can convince) may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded

have ſhewed them the grounds; I truſted too much to my own memory, I
have not uſed the communion of Saints here; but Lord thou haſt many
to ſave, thou mayeſt caſt me off as a poor ſtinking Goat, but Jeſus Chriſt is
willing to receive thoſe that come to him, but I have no full aſſurance yet;

prayed with me, and at the laſt prayer made with him, he ſaid,
my ſoul is exceedingly comforted: the Lord hath ſpared my life
to be comforted thus in prayer; here I left him reſting, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
morning he drew neerer the grave, and ſaid to ſome about
him, they would not let him go the right way: but would have
him on the left hand to heaven, (a good warning to ſome then
neer him, who may do well to obſerve it) and come up more to
the Power of godlineſſe, then they do, and about day he died,
that very time he had told on ſo much, having aſſured both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

               <head>Obſervations.</head>
               <p>I ſhall obſerve ſome few things concerning him and his
ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the beginning of his weakneſſe he left off the formes of Common
prayer he uſed, more then before,</hi> whence I obſerve, theſe mixtures
in the worſhip of God muſt needs be uncomfortable and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,
which dare not abide the triall of a grave.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>He uſed but little of theſe formes of late, for he had almoſt layd
them by before his ſickneſſe, and yet ſo much as he uſed was a burthen,
now we may obſerve,</hi> that it is no dallying nor trifling in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, and the leaſt mixtures will be thorns and briers in
the conſcience of a tender Chriſtian, when he gives up his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
little ſinnes will be great ones at that day.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>He ſpoke ſtill in the aſſurance and full perſwaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112054:3"/>
and the time of it, an evidence not</hi> ordinary to departing ſouls, as if
God had raiſed him up higher then others to ſee his grave, and to
argue from heaven for the power of godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>IIII. <hi>His ſpeeches carried a ſtrength and ſpirit in them more then
naturall, and deeply pierced the better affected that were preſent, and
could not but convince the other,</hi> We may obſerve that the children
of God the neerer they come to Glory, the more of it they take
in, and their laſt breathings are pureſt and ſtrongeſt.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>The time of his perſwaſion that he ſhould die was after the ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
he had:</hi> Thus God did as it were awaken him from another
world, and truly all the words that he ſpake were me thought
like the words of one that had ingaged himſelf to dye, when he
had reported ſomething he had to ſay from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the world.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>In the firſt part of his ſpeech he ſadly and paſſionately ſpake of
his dying, and his certain going down to the grave about the morning,
or very time he departed,</hi> we may obſerve that the revelations of
God concerning his purpoſes and decrees are unchangeable, and
have their juſt accompliſhment, in the things he foretells.</p>
               <p>VII. <hi>In the next paſſages of his ſpeech you may ſee his ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with ſinne and ſathan, Iuſtice ſayes ſmite, mercy ſayes no,</hi> And here
his words were like the words of one that had ſeen a viſion of the
attributes of God, of his juſtice and mercy pleading for him, and
his carriage was like one that had looked onto ſee the iſſue of that
glorious pleading in Heaven for a poor ſoul; and here I obſerve
further, that while we are in this body of ſinne, juſtice will ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
into the ſoul, that mercy and free grace may be more exalted,
<hi>and thouh there be no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
yet the ſoul ſtands not alwayes in ſo clear a view of this free juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<hi>we ſee but in part, and darkly as in a glaſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. In his <hi>ſpirituall conflict</hi> we may obſerve by the interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<hi>of fears and comforts,</hi> that God will have the ſouls of his to ſee
what he could do againſt ſinne, and what in juſtice they might
expect, and yet in all theſe he holds forth ſo much of Chriſt, as
may bear up the ſoul, and their <hi>comforts</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> work ſtill high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then their <hi>feares</hi> and <hi>doubtings,</hi> as we obſerve in his <hi>ſpeeches,</hi> for
the <hi>free grace</hi> of Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

IX. In his <hi>reaſonings he had with his own</hi> actions, he could not find
in the beſt of them any thing he could make up a ſoul cordiall on,
for ſpeaking of conſcience, <hi>oh ſayes he, but what do I ſpeak of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</hi>
and thus he threw off his own <hi>righteouſneſſe as a menſtruous
cloath,</hi> and nothing would hold out to him but free grace, and
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> there only he graſped and held, as you may ſee in his
expreſſions.</p>
               <p>X. <hi>He was ſorry that he lived not to perfect ſome holy reſolutions in
his miniſtery in the Power of godlineſſe,</hi> We may obſerve that when
good purpoſes are kept too long at home, God lets them not ſtirre
abroad when they would, it is good <hi>performing while it is in the
power of the hand to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. <hi>He was much grieved that he ſought no more the Communion of
Saiats (as he ſayes) here below,</hi> we may ſee that the neerer any ſoul
draws to the communion above, the more they ſee into the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſocietie of the Saints below, and the communion here, and
we ſee it is a comfort to a ſoul that they can be here in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of grace,</hi> with thoſe, with whom hereafter they ſhall be in the
<hi>Kingdom of glory,</hi> this would be well obſerved by thoſe who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ſlightly of godly meetings, or caſt notions of <hi>Scandall,</hi> or
<hi>Conventicle</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>XII. <hi>It grieved him that he ſpent time in diſputes that did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi>
when the ſoul is preparing for another world, no other thing
can give it any proportionable comfort, but ſomething that hath
more communion with glory, the pureſt and higheſt learning and
reaſonings are but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, the ſoul that is for
Heaven finds no advantage in any thing, but what hath <hi>the Power
of God in it to ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. <hi>His ſpeeches did much tend to the advancing the Power of
godlineſſe in his miniſtery, if God did reſtore him,</hi> we may obſerve,
that the emptineſſe of mans inventions in the worſhip of God are
then only diſcerned to be emptineſſe and folly, when the ſoul is
neereſt God, and moſt ſpirituall, no wonder that mixtures and
formes of men in the ordinances of God are ſo little diſcerned by
ſo many Neuters and Malignants, for the more carnall they are,
the darker is their judgement in the things of God, <hi>he that is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
only diſcerneth.</hi>

               <p>

XIV. <hi>He ſpoke againſt the formes of his father in Law, who it
ſeemes is not now of ſo pure a practice in worſhip;</hi> who can deſire a
ſtronger evidence next to Scripture, then the judgement of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
whoſe learning was now more gloriouſly ſanctified, from
the immediate light of God, to a clearer diſcerning; though carnall
reaſons may plead ſtrongly for mixtures and corrupt formes, yet
when Heaven opens to convince the ſoul, and to argue againſt
them, which of them or their Abettors are able to appear againſt
ſuch an argument, and mighty evidence.</p>
               <p>XV. <hi>He ſpoke againſt not coming in the right way into Benefices,</hi>
which corrupt Patrons, and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that are as eaſie to give, as
the other to take, may do well to obſerve, and all ſuch who come
in by other wayes of contract, or bargain, or marriage Symony.</p>
               <p>I obſerve the ſeverall expreſſions in his ſpeeches give a clear and
undeniable teſtimony to theſe Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. His certain perſwaſion of his death, and the very time, to this
Scripture. Joel</hi> 2. 28. I will power my ſpirit upon all fleſh, and your ſonnes
and your daughters ſhall propheſie, your old men ſhall dream dreams,
your young men ſhall ſee viſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. His conflicts with ſinne and Sathan, to this Scripture,</hi> Epheſ.
6. 12, 13. we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood but againſt principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſſe of this world, againſt
ſpirituall wickedneſſe in high places, wherefore take unto you the whole
armour of God, that ye may be able to withſtand in the evill day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. His doubtings and fears, to this Scripture,</hi> Philip. 2. 12.
work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. His overcoming temptations through free grace in</hi> Chriſt
Ieſus <hi>when he thought himſelf vildeſt, to this ſcripture,</hi> Zach. 3.
1, 2, 3, 4. And he ſhewed me <hi>Joſhua</hi> the high Prieſt ſtanding before the
Angell of the Lord, and ſathan ſtanding at his right hand to reſiſt him,
and the Lord ſaid unto ſathan, the Lord rebuke the oh ſathan, now <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>
was cloathed with filthy garments, and ſtood before the Angell,
and he anſwered and ſpoke unto thoſe that ſtood before him, ſaying, take
away the filthy garments from him, and to him he ſaid, behold I have
cauſed thine iniquity to paſſe from thee, and I will cloath thee with change
of raiment.</p>

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:112054:5"/>

this ſcripture.</hi> Rom. 3. 20, 21, 22. therefore by the deeds of the Law, there ſhall no
fleſh be juſtified in his ſight, but now the righteouſneſſe of the Law is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
even the righteouſneſſe of God, which is by faith of Ieſus Chriſt unto all, and
upon all them that beleeve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VI. His being ſorry that he lived not to perfect his better reſolutions in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
for advancing the Power of godlineſſe, to this ſcripture,</hi> Eccleſiaſt. 12. 1.
Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, while the evill dayes come

               <p>
                  <hi>VII. His ſorrow for not enjoying more the Communion of Saints here below,
to theſe ſcriptures. Act. 2. Pſal</hi> 119. 63. and they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Doctrine and fellowſhip, and all that beleeved were together: I am a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VIII. His grief that he ſpent time in any diſputes that did not profit, to theſe
ſcriptures,</hi> Tit. 3. 9. Coloſſ. 2. 8. but avoid fooliſh queſtions and genealogies, and
contentions and ſtrivings about the Law, for they are unprofitable, and vaine,
beware leſt any man ſpoyle you through philoſophy and vain deceit after the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of men, and not after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IX. His ſpeaking againſt the corrupt formes and mixtures in worſhip, and
in particular, by the name of one that uſed them formerly, to this ſcripture.</hi>
1 Tim. 6. 3, 5. if any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholeſome words
even the words of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to the Doctrine which is according
to godlineſſe, from ſuch withdraw thy ſelf.</p>

                  <hi>His ſpeaking againſt not coming in the right way of coming into livings, to
