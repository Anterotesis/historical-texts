         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and the time of it, an evidence not</hi> ordinary to departing ≈øouls, as if
God had rai≈øed him up higher then others to ≈øee his grave, and to
argue from heaven for the power of godline≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>IIII. <hi>His ≈øpeeches carried a ≈øtrength and ≈øpirit in them more then
naturall, and deeply pierced the better affected that were pre≈øent, and
could not but convince the other,</hi> We may ob≈øerve that the children
of God the neerer they come to Glory, the more of it they take
in, and their la≈øt breathings are pure≈øt and ≈øtronge≈øt.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>The time of his per≈øwa≈øion that he ≈øhould die was after the ≈ølum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
he had:</hi> Thus God did as it were awaken him from another
world, and truly all the words that he ≈øpake were me thought
like the words of one that had ingaged him≈øelf to dye, when he
had reported ≈øomething he had to ≈øay from God<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> to the world.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>In the fir≈øt part of his ≈øpeech he ≈øadly and pa≈ø≈øionately ≈øpake of
his dying, and his certain going down to the grave about the morning,
or very time he departed,</hi> we may ob≈øerve that the revelations of
God concerning his purpo≈øes and decrees are unchangeable, and
have their ju≈øt accompli≈øhment, in the things he foretells.</p>
               <p>VII. <hi>In the next pa≈ø≈øages of his ≈øpeech you may ≈øee his ≈øpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with ≈øinne and ≈øathan, Iu≈øtice ≈øayes ≈ømite, mercy ≈øayes no,</hi> And here
his words were like the words of one that had ≈øeen a vi≈øion of the
attributes of God, of his ju≈øtice and mercy pleading for him, and
his carriage was like one that had looked onto ≈øee the i≈ø≈øue of that
glorious pleading in Heaven for a poor ≈øoul; and here I ob≈øerve
further, that while we are in this body of ≈øinne, ju≈øtice will ≈øpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
into the ≈øoul, that mercy and free grace may be more exalted,
<hi>and thouh there be no condemnation to them that are in Chri≈øt Je≈øus,</hi>

<hi>of fears and comforts,</hi> that God will have the ≈øouls of his to ≈øee
what he could do again≈øt ≈øinne, and what in ju≈øtice they might

IX. In his <hi>rea≈øonings he had with his own</hi> actions, he could not find
in the be≈øt of them any thing he could make up a ≈øoul cordiall on,
for ≈øpeaking of con≈øcience, <hi>oh ≈øayes he, but what do I ≈øpeak of con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</hi>
and thus he threw off his own <hi>righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe as a men≈øtruous
cloath,</hi> and nothing would hold out to him but free grace, and
<hi>Chri≈øt Ie≈øus,</hi> there only he gra≈øped and held, as you may ≈øee in his
expre≈ø≈øions.</p>
               <p>X. <hi>He was ≈øorry that he lived not to perfect ≈øome holy re≈øolutions in
his mini≈øtery in the Power of godline≈ø≈øe,</hi> We may ob≈øerve that when
good purpo≈øes are kept too long at home, God lets them not ≈øtirre
abroad when they would, it is good <hi>performing while it is in the
power of the hand to do it.</hi>

               <p>XI. <hi>He was much grieved that he ≈øought no more the Communion of

draws to the communion above, the more they ≈øee into the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
≈øocietie of the Saints below, and the communion here, and
we ≈øee it is a comfort to a ≈øoul that they can be here in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of grace,</hi> with tho≈øe, with whom hereafter they ≈øhall be in the
<hi>Kingdom of glory,</hi> this would be well ob≈øerved by tho≈øe who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
≈ølightly of godly meetings, or ca≈øt notions of <hi>Scandall,</hi> or

               <p>XII. <hi>It grieved him that he ≈øpent time in di≈øputes that did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi>
when the ≈øoul is preparing for another world, no other thing
can give it any proportionable comfort, but ≈øomething that hath
more communion with glory, the pure≈øt and highe≈øt learning and
rea≈øonings are but vanity and vexation of ≈øpirit, the ≈øoul that is for
Heaven finds no advantage in any thing, but what hath <hi>the Power
of God in it to ≈øalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. <hi>His ≈øpeeches did much tend to the advancing the Power of
godline≈ø≈øe in his mini≈øtery, if God did re≈øtore him,</hi> we may ob≈øerve,
that the emptine≈ø≈øe of mans inventions in the wor≈øhip of God are
then only di≈øcerned to be emptine≈ø≈øe and folly, when the ≈øoul is
neere≈øt God, and mo≈øt ≈øpirituall, no wonder that mixtures and
formes of men in the ordinances of God are ≈øo little di≈øcerned by
≈øo many Neuters and Malignants, for the more carnall they are,
the darker is their judgement in the things of God, <hi>he that is ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
