            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO A
Person of Quality in the CITY,
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Perceive your Mind is disturb'd, which my
Friendship with you can no more let me be
unconcern'd for, than if I heard you were
sick; nor less to study your Relief. Such
may be the <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> of your Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and such the <hi>disproportion</hi> between the
One and the Other, as to need it a great deal more, though
yet perhaps to deserve it less. For your sickness might be
your infelicity only, but a perturbation that exceeds its
Cause, cannot but be your fault. Which kind of Evil,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49885:3"/>
though it be much greater, and therefore needs more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
for the removing of it; yet it can challenge less
help from another, because you are your own Afflicter,
and may, when you please cure your self, which no man
else can do for you.</p>
            <p>But if another may contribute towards it, by laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you apt Considerations which you are your self to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
you know you are to expect it from no mans good will
more than mine. If indeed you expect much from my
Ability, that is another Fault, entirely your own, and
whereto you could have no temptation.</p>
            <p>Thus much I shall freely profess to you that I have a
great value of an equal temper and composure of mind,
not apt to be unduly mov'd, or entertain any thing that
occurs<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with indecent perturbation, or other resentment
than is due and suitable to the occasion: And desire it more
than either to be in the best external circumstances, or
not to be in the worst. As I wish for my self, I wish for
you; and therefore am willing to place my endeavour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
where it may be in a possibility of effecting
somewhat to your advantage, and where it is most desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
it should.</p>
            <p>In the present case, the Fault I find with you is, that
your resentment of the matter you complain of, is <hi>undue,</hi>
and <hi>not proportionable to the occasion.</hi> And whereas you
seem to labour under the Distemper and excess of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Passion, <hi>of Fear,</hi> lest a just and good Cause (as you
and I do both account) should suffer some great prejudice,
by this opposition of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet:</hi> And of <hi>Anger,</hi> that
he from whom better things might have been expected,
should attempt any thing in this kind. I shall hereupon
endeavour to represent to you the causlesness both of your
<hi>Fear,</hi> and (in great part) of your <hi>Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first defend the Cause against Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49885:3"/>
then add somewhat in defence of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> against
you.</p>
            <p>1. As to the former we are

                  <item>
                     <hi>I.</hi> To give the plain state of it, with the Doctors
Judgment against us in it.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>II.</hi> To discuss the Matter with the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and
shew;

                        <item>1. The Indefensibleness of that Judgment.</item>
                        <item>2. The Inefficacy of the <hi>Doctor's</hi> Attempt to

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. It is first necessary that we have a true state of the
cause it self before our Eyes; which is plainly this,</p>
            <p>That as there are very great numbers of People, beyond
what the Ministers of Parishes, in divers places, can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
perform Ministerial Duty unto: So there are withal
very many that cannot be satisfied in conscience, to intrust
their Souls and their Spiritual Concernments to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal
Care and Conduct of the Parochial Ministry only;
Though they generally have a very reverend esteem of
<hi>divers</hi> who are of it: do, many of them, very frequently
partake of some part of their Labours, and rejoyce in
<hi>them</hi> as great Ornaments and real Blessings to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church. But <hi>these</hi> are very unproportionable in
number to the Necessities of the People, and are by
<hi>Legal</hi> restraints ty'd up <hi>one way,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> by <hi>conscientious,</hi> are
<hi>another,</hi> in respect of some principal parts of Christian
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49885:4"/>
Worship; without which they should be visibly in the
condition of <hi>Pagans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are also many persons who have been devoted to
the Service of God and his Church in the Ministerial Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
some of them in the way which now obtains,
others in a way which this Reverend Author did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve,
who are not satisfied in Conscience about the
Terms upon which they might have continued, or may
be admitted Parochial Incumbents.</p>
            <p>So that here are numerous Flocks scattered without
Pastors, here are many Pastors without Flocks.</p>
            <p>The People it is true, on whose behalf these Papers are
more especially written, are in this destitute condition by
their own scruples. Not is it the present design to justify
all those scruples. But they are, with many, of long
continuance, and, for ought appears, unremoveable. If
they should be defer'd, and bidden to use patience, while such
further endeavours are used with them as this Sermon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
yet death will have no Patience, nor be defer'd. So
that there are multitudes passing into eternity out of a
Christian Nation, having no benefit of Christian Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
no means of instruction in the Truth and Doctrines
of the Christian Religion, in order to their Salvation.</p>
            <p>The course which is <hi>de facto</hi> taken in this distress for
their relief is that which the reverend Author bends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
against in this Sermon. And there are two sorts of
Persons concern'd in it. <hi>The People;</hi> who, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the state of <hi>Paganism,</hi> implore the help of these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imploy'd
Ministers, desiring them to perform the duty
of Christian Ministers towards them. And <hi>the Ministers,</hi>
who rather than <hi>they</hi> should cease to be Christians, or <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
alwaies</hi> cease from the Work of Ministers, comply
with their desires; and, as they can, allow them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
help.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49885:4"/>
This Author doth more directly and professedly speak to
the case of the People; To that of the Ministers, only by
way of Oblique reflection.</p>
            <p>You and I, who (among the <hi>former)</hi> do often partake in
the Worship and Ordinances of God, in the separate As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
(though we are not so squeamish as to balk the
Publick, nor so unjust and ungrateful, as not to thank God
for the excellent advantages that are sometimes to be met
with there) are both concern'd, and led by the Doctors
discourse, to consider what is said as to this case of ours.
Which yet I would have us consider not so appropriate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as to exclude <hi>them</hi> our very compassionate considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that are more pincht and confin'd to narrower limits,
by their own scruples, than we are; and whose Number
you cannot but apprehend to be so great, as to call for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
large compassion in considering their case.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a case of far-prospect, and which lookes down
upon after-times. You know how easily it may be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
all along from the beginning of the <hi>English</hi> Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when some very eminent among our Reformers were
not well satisfi'd with the Ceremonial part of the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
settled at that time; How an unsatisfi'd party hath
gradually increased from Age to Age among the Common
People also. They are now grown very numerous. And
unless some very over-powring impression upon mens
minds, (not reasonably to be expected according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
measures) should alter the case, it is still likely to
increase in succeeding Ages.</p>
            <p>You are not ignorant that no one thing is more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scrupled by this unsatisfi'd Party, than the addition of
that federal Rite in the dedicating of their Children to
God, <hi>the signing them with the sign of the Cross,</hi> which many
(how justly or unjustly I am not now to discusse) esteem so
sinful a practice, that, rather than admit it, they will choose
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49885:5"/>
not to offer their Children to Baptism. Nor is it <hi>in it self</hi>
of less weight (perhaps 'tis of much greater) that, <hi>in this
solemn dedication,</hi> they have no opportunity of performing
the <hi>Parental Duty,</hi> of Covenanting with God on behalf of
their own Children, but <hi>that part</hi> (with the exclusion of
<hi>themselves)</hi> is to be done <hi>by others,</hi> whom God hath not
concern'd in the business; and who, after the solemnity is
over, are never like to concern themselves. And there
are divers other scruples besides, in reference to <hi>this,</hi> and
<hi>other</hi> parts of Worship that, with multitudes, are in no great
probability to admit of cure.</p>
            <p>Now let us see what the Reverend Doctors judgement
is upon this state of our case, who dissent from the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht
way, whether <hi>the people,</hi> or <hi>their Ministers,</hi> and that
both <hi>concerning what they do,</hi> and <hi>what,</hi> by consequence from
his judgment upon their case, <hi>they are to suffer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Practice</hi> of the People in this case (at least the
negative part of it) he hath some Charity in his Censure,
for in their declining to joyn in the Publick Assembles, he
beleives <hi>them</hi> generally to practice according to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as he professes <hi>P.</hi> 37. of his Sermon. For the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
most of them, none at all, who as he saies in the
same Place he believes go against theirs. His Words are,
  <q>I dare say, if most of the Preachers at this day in <hi>the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
meetings</hi> were soberly asked their judgements, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were lawful for the People to joyn with us in the
Publick Assemblies, they would not deny it; and yet the
People that frequent them, generally judge otherwise.
For it is not to be supposed, that faction among them
should so commonly prevail beyond interest.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But his judgement concerning what both are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
<hi>is eventually,</hi> and <hi>in the sequel,</hi> as he states their case,
much more hard in respect of the People, who cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
themselves, whereas the Ministers, according to the
notion he hath of them, presently may.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49885:5"/>
We are to attend chiefly to what he says in reference to
the Lay-people, and shall consider, 1. How severe he is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; and 2. How well consistent he is therein
with himself.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>His severity towards those of us</hi> in respect of what we
practice, <hi>who put ourselves under the pastoral care of</hi> other
<hi>than the</hi> Parochial <hi>Ministers is to be seen in what he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to himself to evince,</hi> P. 20. <hi>viz.</hi> That our proceeding to
the forming of separate Congregations, <hi>i. e.</hi> under other Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and by other Rules, than what the established Religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
is the present case of separation which he intends to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
and to make the sinfulnefs and mischief of it appear. <hi>He
doth you see in short, absolutely pronounce our practice in
this case to be</hi> sinful <hi>and</hi> mischievous.</p>
            <p>Now it is <hi>hence</hi> also to be collected, how hard things he
would have us <hi>suffer</hi> upon supposition of our only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unsatisfi'd to joyn ourselves into the Parochial Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
He doth not indeed bespeak for us Gibbets, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-posts,
or Dungeons. Nor (directly) any thing grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to our Flesh. But to such as consider themselves to
have souls made for an everlasting state, the doom which
his words imply, in the mentioned place, cannot be
thought gentle. Which that you may apprehend the more
distinctly; observe that he hath nothing to say against our
<hi>bare suspending Communion in some particular Rites which we
modestly scruple, while we use it in what we judge lawful, p.</hi> 20
(whereas <hi>p.</hi> 37. he supposing us generally to judge it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to joyn in the Publick Assemblies) to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he also speaks in his <hi>late Dialogues p.</hi> 171. and 172.
(giving his Antagonist an account of what he had said in
his <hi>Irenicum</hi> to the matter now in discourse) viz. <hi>That some
scrupulous and conscientious men, after all endeavours used to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
themselves, may remain unsatisfied as to the lawfulness
of some imposed Rites, but dare not proceed to positive separation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49885:6"/>
from the Church, but are willing to comply in all other things
save in those Rites which they still scruple: and concerning these
he puts the Question, whether such bare Non-conformity do involve
such men in the Guilt of Schism.</hi> And this he confesses he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
negatively (approving or not disavowing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.)
Thus far indeed he well agrees with himself;
and seems to have no Quarrel with us.</p>
            <p>But consider the fatal consequence. He well knows that
if we suspend Communion in the Rite of the Cross (upon
our never so modest scruple) we connot have our Children
Ministerially dedicated to God in the Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
nor be so ourselves, if, being adult, we remain any of
us unabptized (as he may well apprehend many among us
are) nor if we decline the use of <hi>Sponsors</hi> as to what we
conceive should be performed by Parents for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and by adult persons for themselves. And that if we
kneel not before the consecrated Elemens at the Lords
Table, we are not to partake of his Holy Supper. Yea, and
what if we scruple somewhat that is more than ritual, to
sit under the Ministery of a noted drunkard, or open Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to godliness as our Teacher and Guide, when we might
enjoy the fruitful labours of one that hath not <hi>his qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
every Lords day? <hi>No, by no means,</hi> whithout limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or the supposition of any possible case wherein it may
be otherwise, a meeting never so little besides the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
course, he will <hi>make appear is sinful and mischievous,</hi> and
not tolerable upon any terms.</p>
            <p>What then would he have us do? He directs us indeed
afterward to the endeavour of satisfaction. But what shall
we do if after our utmost endeavours our dissatisfaction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main?
What, while we are endeavouring? which may
be all our days in vain. What if we can never be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning the established way of Baptism for ourselves
and our Children, and of partaking the Body and Blood of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49885:6"/>
our Lord and Saviour? Nor to hear or give Countenance
to such a ones pretending to Preach the glorious Gospel of
the Blessed God, who either substantially perverts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves
it, or whose profligate life proclaims him an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
and enemy to the Holy Rules and desin of it? Nor to
commit our selves to the pastoral care and charge of a less
exceptionable person, yea though otherwise never so deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that hath ty'd his own hands, and is under such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
that he cannot, or so disinclin'd that he will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
the Ordinances of Christ in such a way, as wherein
with satisfaction to our Consciences we may enioy them.</p>
            <p>Read over the Doctors Sermon again, and again, and you
will find no course is prescribed us, but to sit still without
any enjoyment of Christian Ordinances at all. And with
how great numbers must this be the case? for himself pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
to believe, that the People that frequent the separate
meetings (who you know are not a few) <hi>do generally</hi> judge
it to be unlawful to joyn in the Publick Assemblies. And
are we alwaies to sit still thus? That is to exchange Visible
Christianity for Visible (at least negative) <hi>Paganism!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi> if you take the whole compass of it, is a thing of
awful importance, that so great a Limb of a Christian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they and their posterity, should be Paganized from
Age to Age, and cut off from the whole Body of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Community, only because they scruple some things,
the least exceptionable whereof are no part of the Christian
Institution (as himself, and they whose Advocate he is, will
freely confess) nor do necessarily belong to it, being (as they
contend) but <hi>indifferent</hi> things.</p>
            <p>He <hi>seems</hi> rather contented we should not be Christians at
all, than not to be Christians of this particular mode. That
we should rather want the substance of Christs Gospel and
Sacraments, than have them accompany'd with confessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
needless additions, and which we fear to be forbidden us
by their Lord and ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49885:7"/>
We do sincerely profess wherein we decline the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
he invites us to, we only displease him, and those
of his way and mind, out of a real fear of otherwise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
God. We agree with them in far greater things
than we can differ in. We are of that <hi>One Body</hi> which
they themselves profess to be of, so far as <hi>meer Christianity</hi>
is the distinction, and collective bond of it, and desire to
be under the conduct and Government of that <hi>One Spirit.</hi>
We are called with them in that <hi>One Hope</hi> of our calling,
and earnestly expect (whatever hard thoughts they have of
us) to meet many a one of them in the participation of the
blessed hoped end of that calling. We acknowledge that
<hi>One Lord,</hi> that <hi>One Faith,</hi> that <hi>One Baptism,</hi> (or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which the Baptism of our Lords appointment seales)
and that <hi>One God</hi> and Father of all, who is above all, and
through all, and in us all. Yet because we cannot, we
dare not consent with them to the additions which belong
not (and which we fear are unduly affixt) to the Religion of
Christians, we are adjudged to be (as much as in them is)
cut off from Christ, deprived of the dear pledges of his
love, and acquisitions of his Blood, <hi>are driven out from the
inheritance of the Lord,</hi> and it is in effect said to us <hi>go and serve
other Gods.</hi> Thus far the severity of this reverend Author
towards us extends. Which while we thus truely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and recount, let us also.</p>
            <p>2. Consider what agreement it holds with what we
elsewhere observe from him. We have already taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that <hi>for our bare non-conformity</hi> he acquits us of the
guilt of <hi>Schism.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 20. of this Sermon, he says, 
<q>He
doth not confound <hi>bare suspending Communion in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Rites,</hi> which persons do modestly scruple, and
using it in what they judge to be lawful, with either
<hi>total,</hi> or at least <hi>ordinary forbearance of Communion in what
they judge to be lawful; and proceeding to the forming of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49885:7"/>
Congregations, &amp;</hi>
               </q>
`Tis this latter he severs and
singles out for his opposition. Against our <hi>suspending Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in some particular Rites</hi> (which we judge unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)
<hi>if we use it in what we judge lawful,</hi> (which I with him,
presume the Lay-Dissenters in <hi>England</hi> generally do;) he
hath nothing to say: Yea, and undertaking to shew <hi>what
Error of Conscience doth excuse a man from sin, in following
the Dictates of it;</hi> he tells us <hi>p.</hi> 44. That <hi>if the Error be wholly
involuntary,</hi> i.e. <hi>If it be caused by invincible ignorance,</hi> (which
he thus explains in the following words) <hi>or after using
the best means for due information of his Conscience; though the
act may be a fault in it self, yet it shall not be imputed to him
for a sin, because it wanted the consent of the Mind, by which
the Will is determined.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I beseech you consider, 1. When he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
if we be willing to be satisfied, and our Errour be
involuntary, it shall not be imputed to us for a sin; Why
are we to be so severely dealt with for what is not to be
imputed to us for a sin? If it were any, methinks it should
not deserve such <hi>rigor</hi> at the hands of <hi>Men,</hi> that are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
also liable to Mistakes and Errors. Is it so very cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
if every poor illiterate Dissenter in <hi>England</hi> (Man
or Woman) cannot in all their days attain to a better and
more settled Judgment in such dubious matters, than this
Reverend Person had himself arriv'd to twenty years ago?
Especially that never had, or were capable of having
those peculiar helps and inducements, to temper and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their judgments that he hath enjoy'd. 'Tis a long
time that his own judgment hath been ripening to that
maturity, as, at length to think it fit and seasonable to
say so much as he hath, for the reforming of ours, even
in this Sermon. Methinks he should not be so very quick
and hard towards us, upon so slender a cause, as our
scrupling <hi>some particular Rites</hi> to adjudge us and ours to be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49885:8"/>
totally deprived of <hi>Baptism,</hi> which themselves count ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to our salvation, and of the other Ordinances of
Christ, which they do not think unnecessary.</p>
            <p>And consider secondly, Whereas he says, That <hi>if a man
erre after using the best means for due information of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,â€”it
shall not be imputed to him as a sin.</hi> What if
we erre this Error (as he counts it) after using the best
means for due information; [that we ought rather than
to return to the state of <hi>Paganism,</hi> to bear our part in the
forming of such Meetings for the Worship of God, as
wherein we may, with the satisfaction of our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
enjoy all his holy Ordinances.] It will surely
be within the compass of this his general Position, and
not be imputable as a sin. Then it is to be hoped we should
rather choose to do so, then Paganize our selves, or live
in the wilful neglect of his Institutions: Which to do by
our own choice, when we might do otherwise, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think a very great sin.</p>
            <p>If here the Doctor should assume to himself to tell us
not only that we erre herein (whereof we are to regard
his proof, as it shall be considered by and by, more than
his Affirmation:) But also that our Error is wilful, we
shall appeal from him to one that better knows, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
how gladly we should receive information, and
admit the belief, that we ought to content our selves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
and only with such provisions as the established Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
(to use the <hi>Doctors</hi> phrase) allows us, if the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the thing it self did not seem irresistibly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
to perswade us otherwise. And for him to say
so, were but to suppose men wilful, only for not being
of his mind, who can as easily think him so, for not being
of theirs.</p>
            <p>But this cannot be a Question between the Doctor and
us; whom, as we have taken notice above, he hath so
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49885:8"/>
far obliged, as to admit <hi>p.</hi> 37. That <hi>we generally judge as
we practice, and that it is not to be supposed that faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us should so commonly prevail beyond interest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But since this appears to be his determination concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us, and that his Assertion seems positive and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>
p. 20. <hi>[That in this our case,</hi> to proceed to the forming
of Congregations under other Teachers, and by other Rules than
what the establisht Religion allows, where a sinful and mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
separation.]</p>
            <p>We are in the next place,</p>
            <p>2ly, To discuss the Matter with the Doctor; wherein
we shall endeavour to shew,</p>
            <p>1. The indefensibleness of the Judgment the Doctor
hath given in this case; which will both infer (and in
some part excuse) what we are afterwards to discover:
<hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2ly, The Infirmity of what is alledged by him in this
Attempt of his to defend it.</p>
            <p>1. For the former, it being obvious to common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
that a natural self-indulgence and aptness to
decline and wave what is of more terrible import to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
doth usually insinuate and influence mens minds
in their judging of such Cases: We are the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
(because a favourable false judgment will do us
no good) with an impartial strictness to hold our selves
<hi>to the thing it self.</hi> And when we most strictly do so, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
the Doctor should have somewhat an hard Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of it. For his Determination amounts to thus much,
[That we ought to be kept in a state of Damnation for
scrupling the Ceremonies] <hi>(i.e.</hi> to be deprived of the
necessary means of our salvation.) And <hi>that,</hi> while he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
our scruple (after the use of due means for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation)
not imputable to us as a sin: And not <hi>that</hi>
only, but that we ought to consent to our own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49885:9"/>
for this no sin of ours. Inasmuch as it would be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and mischievous to procure to our selves the necessary
means of our salvation in another way, while we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that, without our sin, we cannot have them in the
way which he allows us.</p>
            <p>We are indeed satisfied, that our sin one way or other
would contribute little to our salvation: But when also
we are satisfied that we cannot enjoy the means of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his way without sin; and <hi>he tells us,</hi> we cannot
without sin enjoy them in our own: We hope every Door
is not shut up against us, and cannot think the merciful
and holy God hath so stated our case, as to reduce us to a
necessity of sinning to get out of a state of damnation.
And therefore this Reverend Author having already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
that our Remedy cannot lie (as our Consciences
are hitherto inform'd) in coming over to him and his
way; For he believes we generally judge it unlawful to
joyn with them in the publick Assemblies, <hi>p.</hi> 37. and says,
<hi>p. 43. That no man that hath any Conscience will speak against
the power of it, and he that will speak against it, hath no reason
to be regarded in what he says:</hi> (as no question he expected
to be, otherwise he had not given himself so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
and concludes, <hi>p. 44. That we should sin in going against
it.</hi> As he also thinks we should in acting with it, which
(as is necessarily imply'd) we as yet see not: Our great
hope upon the whole matter is, that our relief must lye in
taking the way which we do take; And that it cannot
be proved to be sinful.</p>
            <p>We reckon it is not, and that the Doctors judgment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is simply indefensible, because whatsoever is sinful must
transgress some Law immediately divine, or that obliges
by vertue of the divine Law. And we cannot find that
God hath made any Law, or enabled any made by others,
to oblige us <hi>so far,</hi> in our present Circumstances, as that we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49885:9"/>
should be involv'd in the guilt of sin, by some variation from
the letter of it. For any Divine Law that can be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to oblige us to the use of the things we scruple, or else
to live without the Worship and Ordinances of God, not
knowing any such our selves, we must wait till we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that his Law doth give an obliging force</hi> so far <hi>to
any other, we as yet understand not. Wheresoever he hath
been pleased to lodge and entrust the Keys of the Church,
we do not find he hath appointed them to that use, to admit
us into the Communion of his Worship and Ordinances,
or totally to exclude us, upon such terms. And herein we
suppose we have the Doctor consenting with us. Who in
his</hi> Irenicum, p. 216. <hi>plainly asserts,</hi> That the Office which the
power of Keys implies is Ministerial, and not Authoritative;
Declarative, and not Juridical. <hi>And says in the Preface to
the same Book, That</hi> He that came to take away the unsupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Yoke of the Jewish Ceremonies, did never intend to gall the
Disciples Necks with another instead of it. <hi>Whereto he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
adds in the same Preface.</hi> And it would be strange the
Church should require more than Christ himself did; and make
other conditions of her Communion, than our Saviour did of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipleship.
What possible reason can be assign'd or given why such
things should not be sufficient for Communion with a Church,
which are sufficient for eternal Salvation? And certainly those
things are sufficient for that, which are laid down by our Lord and
Saviour in his Word. What ground can there be why Christians
should not stand upon the same terms now, which they did in the
time of Christ and his Apostles? Was not Religion sufficiently
guarded and fenced in them? Was there ever more true and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
reverence in the Worship of God? What Charter hath Christ
given the Church to bind men up to more than himself hath done,
or to exclude those from her society, who may be admitted into
Heaven? Will Christ ever thank men at the great day for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49885:10"/>
such out from Communion with his Church, whom he will
Vouchsafe not only Crowns of Glory to, but it may be aureolae too,
if there be any such things there? The Grand Commission the
Apostles were sent out with, was only to teach what Christ had
Commanded them. Not the least Intimation of any power given
them to impose or require any thing beyond what himself had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to them, or they were directed to by the Immediate guidance
of the Spirit of God. It is not whether the things Commanded
and required be lawful or no? It is not whether indifferences
may be determined or no? It is not how far Christians are bound
to submit to a restraint of their Christian liberty? Which I now
inquire after, (of those things in the Treatise it self) but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do consult for the Churches Peace and Unity who suspend
it upon such things? How far either the example of our Saviour
or his Apostles doth warrant such rigorous impositions? We never
read the Apostles making Laws but of things supposed necessary.
When the Counsel of Apostles met at Jerusalem for deciding a Case
that disturbed the Churches Peace, we see they would lay no other
burden <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> besides these necessary things. <hi>Act.</hi>
15. 29. It was not enough with them that the things would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
when they had required them, but they looked on an Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
necessity either absolute or for the present state, which was
the only ground of their imposing those Commands upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Christians. There were, after this, great diversities of pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice
and Varieties of Observations among Christians, but the Holy
Ghost never thought those things fit to be made matters of Laws,
to which all parties should conform; all that the Apostles requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as to these, was mutual forbearance aud condescension towards
each other in them. The Apostles valued not differences at all,
and those things it is evident they accounted such, which whether
men did them or not, was not of concernment to Salvation. And
what reason is there why men should be so strictly tyed up to such
things, which they may do or let alone, and yet be very good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
still? Without all controversie the main In-let of all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49885:10"/>
confusions and divisions of the Christian World, hath
been by adding other conditions of Church-communion than Christ
hath done.</p>
            <p>Nor am I now inquiring whether the things Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
be lawful or no? Nor whether indifferences may be
determined or no? Nor how far Christians are bound to
submit to a restraint of their Christian Liberty? But only
inquiring (as he there doth) concerning the <hi>Charter given
by Christ</hi> for the binding men up to more than himself hath
done? And I further inquire, <hi>by what power</hi> they can be
bound <hi>which Christ hath not given?</hi> And if there be no such
power to bind them, suppose the things required were all
lawful (which if it can be evinc't, I should rejoyce to see
done) yet while they cannot in conscience think they are,
how can they apprehend themselves bound to be without
the means of Salvation <hi>which Christ's Charter entitles them
to?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I readily grant it is fit a man do many things for peace
and Common Orders sake which, otherwise, no Law doth
<hi>formally oblige</hi> him to i.e. <hi>supposing he can do those things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intolerable prejudice to himself.</hi> And so it is commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in the matter of scandals. But can it be thought
a man is to put himself out of the state or way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in complement to such as will otherwise take offence?
And be so Courteous as to Perish for ever, rather than they
shall be displeased.</p>
            <p>Yea, and it may be moreover added, That our course
being accounted lawful, must also (as the Doctor speaks
in another case) be thought a duty: For the things that
are <hi>as means</hi> necessary to our salvation, are also necessary <hi>by
Divine Precept.</hi> We are commanded to hear Gods Word,
to devote our selves and our Children to God in Baptism;
and, <hi>at the Lords own Table</hi> to <hi>remember him,</hi> and shew
forth his death till he come. And if we compare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49885:11"/>
certain Positions of this Reverend Author, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see but he must, as our case is, acknowledge our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to the practice which he here seems to blame. For
in his <hi>Iren. p.</hi> 109. He asserts, <hi>That every Christian is under
an obligation to joyn in Church-society with others; because it
is his duty to profess himself a Christian, and to own his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
publickly, and to partake of the Ordinances and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Gospel, which cannot be without society with some
Church or other.</hi> And he after adds (on the same page)
<hi>It had been a case disputed by some (particularly by</hi> Grotius
<hi>the supposed Author of a little Tract,</hi> An semper sit commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicandum
per symbola? <hi>When he design'd the Syncretism
with the Church of</hi> Rome) <hi>whether in a time when Churches
are divided, it be a Christians duty to communicate with any
of those Parties which divide the Church, and not rather to
suspend communion from all of them. A case not hard to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oided;
for either the person questioning it doth suppose the
Churches divided to remain true Churches, but some to be
more pure than other; in which case, by vertue of his genral
obligation to Communion, he is bound to adh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re to that Church
which appears most to retain its Evangelical purity.</hi> To which
purpose he further tells us, page 110. He knows not <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Chrysostom'<hi>s act were to be commended, who after being
made a Deacon in the Church of</hi> Antioch <hi>by</hi> Meletius, <hi>upon
his death; because</hi> Flavianus <hi>came in irregularly as Bishop of
the Church, would neither communicate with him, nor with</hi>
Paulinus <hi>another Bishop at that time in the City; nor with
the</hi> Meletians <hi>but for three years time withdrew himself
from communion with any of them.</hi> And p. 113. <hi>Where any
Church is guilty of Corruptions both in Doctrine and Practice,
which it avoweth and professeth, and requireth the owning them
as necessary conditions of communion with her, there a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion
with that Church is necessary, and a total and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
separation is lawful and convenient.</hi> What he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49885:11"/>
               <hi>page</hi> 111, 112. upon the Question, Whether it is a sin
to communicate with Churches <hi>true,</hi> as to <hi>Essentials,</hi> but
supposed <hi>corrupt</hi> in the exercise of Discipline? Many of
us will no doubt heartily concur with him in. But it
touches not the case of <hi>many more,</hi> who do not so much
fear upon the account of the neglect of Discipline, to be
involv'd in the guilt of other mens sin; as (there seems to
be little cause, <hi>that part</hi> being not incumbent upon us:)
Nor, if <hi>that</hi> be his meaning, when he speaks of <hi>separating
on a pretence of great purity,</hi> is it the case with most of us:
but we justly fear (and therefore avoid) to be made to
<hi>sin our selves,</hi> by having such things as we judge to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>imposed on us,</hi> as the Conditions of our Communion. And
as to this case, this Reverend Author speaks our sense in
this last cited Proposition, and pleads our present Cause.
Nor need we more to be said on behalf of it than what is
reducible to that general Proposition; or particularly, to
that second thing (compared with the third) which
<hi>p.</hi> 115. he says makes separation and withdrawment of
communion lawful and necessary; viz. <hi>Corruption of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi>
where we say as he doth, <hi>We speak not of practice, as
relating to the civil conversation of men, but as it takes in
the</hi> Agenda <hi>of Religion; when unlawful things of that kind,
are not only crept into a Church, but are the prescribed devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it: Those being required</hi> (which he adds as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the foregoing) <hi>as necessary conditions of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
from all the Members of their Church, which makes our
withdrawing from them unavoidably necessary, as long as we
judge them to be such corruptions as indeed they are.</hi> And
whereas he instances only in such things as belong to the
Head of <hi>Idolatrous Customs,</hi> (suppressing what might be
instanced under the other Head, which he also <hi>there</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
viz. <hi>Superstitious practice)</hi> yet we doubt not if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things also, that appear to be sinful, besides idolatrous
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49885:12"/>
Customs, be required as necessary conditions of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
the case will be the same, unless we will distinguish
sins, into such as be lawful, and such as be unlawful. Or
there be any that may be committed, that we may be
admitted to the communion of this or that Church.</p>
            <p>Now (to reduce things to the method which sutes the
present case) if this reverend Author do still judge [that
where sinful conditions of Communion are imposed there
Non-communion is necessary (and those things be sinful
to us which our Consciences judge to be so, as he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.])
And again if he still judge [that we
are under an Obligation to joyn in Church-society, so as to
own our Religion publickly, and to partake of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and Sacraments of the Gospel.] He must certainly
account <hi>that</hi> our duty which he taxes in this Sermon as our
fault, at least till our Consciences be otherwise informed,
whereof many of us have no great hope.</p>
            <p>We are indeed not so stupid, as not to apprehend there
are Laws, the Letter whereof seems adverse to us Nor
are we so ungrateful as not to acknowledge his Majesties
clemency in not subjecting us to the utmost rigor of
those Laws; whom we cannot without deep regret, <hi>so
much as seem</hi> not, in every thing, exactly to obey. Nor can
it enter into our minds to imagine that he expects to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
by us, at the expence of our Salvation. Or that it
would be at all grateful to him that being, as we are, unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in some things that are by the Law made necessary
to our partaking the priviledges of the Christian Church,
we should become Pagans in duty to him. His Majesty
was once pleased to give an ample Testimony by his never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
be-forgotten gracious declaration of <hi>March,</hi> 15. 1672.
How remote any such thought was from his Royal Breast,
and though we humbly submit to the exigency of those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of State from whence it proceeded, that we enjoy not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49885:12"/>
the continued positive favour which his Majesty was then
pleased to express towards us; yet we have no reason to
doubt, but his propensions are equally benigne as they
were.</p>
            <p>Nor, though it be uncertain to us what Laws they are,
the Authority whereof this reverend person relies upon to
make our practice sinful, yet we hope he doth not mean to
urge us herein with the Laws of the Civil Government,
because those as much forbid our Non-Communion (and
under as severe penalty) for which he acquits us from the
Guilt of Shism (or if we endeavour satisfaction) from
any sin imputable to us.</p>
            <p>But if that should be his meaning, we desire it may be
considered how unreasonable it seems, that the design of
the Law relating to that part of our practice which the
Doctor in this Sermon condemns, being declaredly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
sedition; they should take themselves to be meant
who are conscious of no such design or disposition.</p>
            <p>And again, that it is not with any reason, Charity or
Justice to be supposed, that when <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>other,</hi> restrictive
Laws were made, either the Temporal ruine of so great a
part of the Nation as are now found to be dissenters, was
intended by the legislators, or the reducing them to the
condition of Heathens. But an uniformity in the Worship
of God being, in it self, a thing realy desireable; this
means was thought fit to be tryed in order to that end.
And so are humane Laws, about such mutable matters, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
designed to be probationary; the event and success
being unforeknown. Whereupon, after a competent time
of Trial, as his Majesty was graciously pleased to declare
his own favourable sense and intention, so it is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known that the like propensions were by Common
suffrage expressed in Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> To grant a relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So that the Law, being in its own Nature, nothing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49885:13"/>
else but an indication of the Legislators will, we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the thing was in substance done, so far as may satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
a mans private reason and conscience concerning the
Law-givers intention, and pleasure; though it were not
done <hi>with that formality</hi> as uses (and is generally needful) to
be stood upon, by them who are the Ministers of the Law.
And that it was not done with that formality also, seemed
rather to be from a disagreement about the manner, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of doing it, than about the thing to be done. And
how usual is it for Laws, without formal repeal, gently and
gradually to expire, grow Old, and vanish away, not being
longer useful<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as the ritual part of the Mosaical Law did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come an ineffectual and unprofitable thing? And how
easie were it to instance in many other Laws, <hi>the letter of
which,</hi> they that urge <hi>these</hi> against the Dissenters, do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
scruple transgress? and from which no such weighty
reasons do urge to borrow now and then a point? How
many dispense with themselves in many parts of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Conformity, that have obliged themselves to it?
<hi>The Priests in the Temple trangress the Law and are blameless.</hi>
Yea, and he that knows all things, and who is judge of all
knows how litte scruple is made of transgressing the Laws
by gross immoralities and debaucheries. Men learn to
judge of the sacredness of Laws by their own inclinations.
Any that can be wire-drawn, and made by torture, to speak
against Religion not modified their way must be most bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
Such as prohibit the vilest and most open wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
bind as the Withs did <hi>Sampson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The summe of all is, that whereas we are under the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of the Divine Law to Worship God in the use of
those his Ordinances which require to be dispensed and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in society, and that we apprehend we cannot do it
without sin in the way which this reverend Author invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
us to, Whereas also we do, with this Author, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49885:13"/>
whether Christ hath given any power to men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to the things we scruple, or disoblige us from the
things we practice and judge it unproved. We cannot but
reckon the judgment the Dr. hath given in our case [that
our practice is sinful] is erroneous and indefensible by any
Man, but least fitly, of most other men, attempted to be
defended by himself. From whom it would little have
been expected that he should so earnestly recommend that
very thing to us as the only Foundation of Union, which
he had so publickly told us in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Irenicum</hi>
was, 
<q>
                  <hi>without Controversie,</hi> the main in-let of all the distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
confusions, and divisions of the Christian World,
viz. <hi>the adding other conditions of Church-communion than
Christ hath done.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And though he hath lately told the World there are some
passages in that book that shew only the inconsiderateness
of Youth, and that he seems to wish unsaid, yet he hath not,
that we know, declared that these are some of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
since this present determination and judgement of his
against us is so peremptory and positive as well as severe,
let us in the next place,</p>
            <p>2. Consider and carefully examine as we are concerned,
what he hath performed in defence of it, and it is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the inefficacy and weakness of his attempt therein will
sufficiently appear. What I can find in his Sermon hath
any aspect or design that way is either <hi>ad rem</hi> or, <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>
And to my apprehension his reasonings, of the one
kind or the other, are altogether unconcluding.</p>
            <p>1. As to what may be supposed to be <hi>ad rem,</hi> if you
look narrowly you will find, that the principal things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by him, that can, under that notion, give support
to his Cause, are only affirmed, but not proved. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>p.</hi> 9. When he tells us, that the 
<q>
                  <hi>Apostle supposed</hi>
the necessity of one fixed and certain Rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
This
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49885:14"/>
had been very material to his purpose; if, 1. He had told
us, and had proved, the Apostle meant some Rule or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
super-added to the Sacred Scriptures: For then he
might, it is to be presumed, as easily have let us know
what that Rule was, which, most probably, would have
ended all our controversie; it being little to be doubted
we should all, most readily, have agreed to obey it. Or,
2ly, If he had proved, that, because the Apostle had power
to make such a Rule, and oblige the Churches to observe
it, that therefore such Church-Guides as they whose cause
the Doctor pleads, have an equal power to make <hi>other
Rules</hi> divers from his, containing many new things, which
he never enjoyn'd, and to enforce them upon the Church;
(though manifestly tending to its destruction rather than
edification.) But these things he doth but <hi>suppose himself,</hi>
without colour of proof.</p>
            <p>Again, for his Notion of Churches, <hi>p.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19.
examine, as strictly as you will, what he says about it;
And see whether it come to any thing more than only to
represent a <hi>National Church a possible thing?</hi> and whereto
the name <hi>Church</hi> may, without absurdity, be given. His
own words seem to aim no higher. 
<q>Why <hi>may there not</hi>
be one National Church from the consent in the same
Articles of Religion, and the same order of Worship?
<bibl>
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 18.</bibl>
               </q>
               <q>The word was used in the first Ages of the
Christian Church, as it comprehended the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Governours, and the people of whole Cities. And
why many of these Cities being united together under
one Civil Government, and the same Rules of Religion,
should not <hi>be called</hi> one National Church, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
<bibl>
                     <hi>p.</hi> 19.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But can it now be infer'd <hi>thence,</hi> that therefore God hath
actually constituted every Christian Kingdom or Nation
<hi>such a Church?</hi> Can it further be infer'd, that he hath invested
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49885:14"/>
the Guides of <hi>this Church,</hi> not chosen by the people (according
Scripture, and Primitive practice for some ages) with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to make Laws and Decrees, prescribing not only things
necessary for common order and decency, but new federal
Rites, and teaching Signs and Symbols, superadded to
the whole Christian Institution; with many more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
and unnecessary things besides? and to exclude so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and pious Christians, from the Priviledges that are
proper to the Christian Church, as such, meerly for that
out of conscience towards God, they dare not admit into
their Worship those Additions to the Christian Religion?
To take order they shall have no Pastors, no Sacraments,
no Assemblies for Worship? and because they will not be
so much more than Christians, that they shall not be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
at all?</p>
            <p>He that would go about to make these Inferences <hi>meerly
from the forementioned ground,</hi> would gain <hi>to be laught at</hi> by
all sober men, instead of a <hi>conclusion?</hi> whatsoever better
success he should have, who should undertake to prove
the same things any other way.</p>
            <p>This Reverend Author was so wise as not to attempt
either of these: But then in the mean time, what doth
the meer <hi>possible notion</hi> of such a Church advantage his
Cause? <hi>Because</hi> it is <hi>possible</hi> there <hi>might have been such a
Macedonian,</hi> or <hi>such a Lydian Church,</hi> is such a one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>necessary?</hi> and any other Constitution of a Christian
Church <hi>impossible, or unlawful?</hi> Or because the General
meeting of the Magistrates of the whole City and People
together in <hi>Pagan Athens</hi> was <hi>called</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, therefore
such must be the constitution of a Christian Church? And
therefore <hi>such a Church</hi> hath such powers from Christ as
were above mentioned?</p>
            <p>Here, howsoever we make our stand, and say that till
the Doctor hath proved these two things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49885:15"/>
1. That such a Church as he hath given us the notion of, as
of a thing meerly possible, is actually a Divine Institution. <hi>And</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2ly, That God hath given to the Ecclesiastical Governours in
it never chosen by the Christian Community, or to any other
Power, to super-add Institutions of the nature above mentioned,
and to enforce them under the mentioned Penalties. <hi>All his
reasonings that pretend to be</hi> ad rem, <hi>are to no purpose,
and do nothing at all advantage his Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet there are some passages in this part of his Discourse,
that though they signifie nothing to his main purpose, are
yet very remarkable, and which 'tis fit we should take
some notice of.</p>
            <p>As when <hi>pag.</hi> 16. He tell us <hi>what he means by whole
Churches;</hi> viz. 
<q>The Churches of such Nations, which,
upon the decay of the Roman Empire, resumed their just
power of Government to themselves, and upon their
owning Christianity, incorporated into one Christian
Society, under the same common tyes and rules of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Government.</q>
As if there could be no <hi>whole
Churches</hi> in the world that had not been of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
Or as if those of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> could not have
been <hi>whole Churches</hi> without resumption of the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Or (as we suppose he means) as if (which he intimates,
<hi>p. 19.) we</hi> needed this (so dearly espoused notion as a
ground) to acquit us from the imputation of Schism, in
our separating from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it were not for the advantage of the Protestant
Cause to admit: For then all that remain within the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
were bound to continue in the Communion of the
<hi>Roman Church.</hi> And in the other Kingdoms, where Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have not resumed their just right of reforming Errors
in Doctrine, and Corruptions in Worship; all should be
Schismaticks that should separate from the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49885:15"/>
Again, when <hi>p.</hi> 17. He would confute that <hi>great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,</hi>
the making the <hi>notion</hi> of a Church barely to relate
to <hi>Acts of Worship:</hi> (A mistake whereof I never knew any
man guilty) He surely runs into as great an opposite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
in making the notion of a Church to be <hi>no more</hi>
than of a society of men united together, <hi>for their Order
and Government,</hi> according to the Rules of the Christian
Religion. <hi>Now</hi> Faith and Worship are quite excluded
the notion of a Church: And Order and Government, and
the Rules of the Christian Religion, but <hi>as they refer to
these,</hi> only included. Whence it will come to pass, that
we can have no notion of <hi>one Catholick Church,</hi> from which
yet he argues at the bottom of the same <hi>page.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor, though I dislike the thing, do I understand the
strength of the Doctors Argument, against making the
notion of the Church barely to relate to Acts of Worship;
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>if this held true, the Church must be dissolved as soon
as the Congregation is broken up.</hi> For will it not also follow
as well, that if the notion of a Church relate only to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Government, every time any meeting for Affairs
of Order and Government is broken up, the Church is
dissolved? And that an Assembly of the States in any
Kingdom or Nation cannot break up, without a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the Government? A Parliament (at least) not
Adjourn or be Prorogued without being dissolved? And
whereas he adds, <hi>But if they retain the nature of a Church,
when they do not meet together for worship, then there is some
other Bond that unites them, and whatever that is, it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
the Church.</hi> Is it not possible there may be such a
Bond for Worship, as well as for Government? an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to meet at stated times for that purpose, when
they are not met? And then (if this were all that were
to be said to the contrary) why might not <hi>that Bond</hi> as
well serve to Constitute the Church?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49885:16"/>
But secondly, For his reasonings <hi>ad hominem,</hi> they need
not detain us long; he argues from the Judgment of the
<hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>All which arguing must suppose, if it concern us, That
we are bound to be of the same Judgment with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that are and have been so and so minded, which I for
my part understand not. But I perceieve <hi>here</hi> his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, having endeavoured to draw us off from our
Ministers; now to move another Stone, and try if he can
draw them off from ns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Assembly,</hi> I think it fit those that survive of them
should be as much concluded by what they then determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as this reverend Author by the <hi>Irenicum.</hi> But I know
no reason that such as they never represented, nor who
ever pretended to be of their Party, should be so conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Worlds end. Nor do understand why even
<hi>the same Party</hi> may not be as well supposed in a possibility
to vary from it self in fourty years, as the same man from

when some think themselves grown wiser by prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
others by adversity, there is less reason to suspect the
latter.</p>
            <p>Yet also this reverend Author ought to have considered
the great disparity of the Cases he would parallel. For
when <hi>one sort of men</hi> are considering of having only such a
frame of things settled, as are imposed by Christ himself,
whether they judge rightly or no, that he hath imposed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part of that frame, yet while they think and judge that
he hath, and consequently that nothing is to be abated of it;
'twere very unfitly argued, that therefore <hi>another sort</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49885:16"/>
to impose many things never imposed by Christ,
should abate nothing of their unnecessary impositions.</p>
            <p>For such as the Doctor quotes besides of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,
acknowledging the Parish Churches true Churches,
and the lawfulness of holding, sometimes, Communion
with some of them. It is not to be thought but among so
many Parties as come all under one Common Notion of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
from the publick rule (and whom that Rule did not
find <hi>one,</hi> but made them so <hi>in that Common Notion)</hi> there
must be great diversity of Opinions, and proportionably
differing practices in these matters. I heartily prefer the
most moderate as I believe you do. But here this reverend
Author takes occasion for so ignominious reflections upon
our Preachers, as insincere, dishonest and unconscientious,
as I doubt not in one 20 Years more his ingenuity will <hi>oblige</hi>
him to repent more heartily, than ever it <hi>permitted</hi> him to
do of his <hi>Irenicum.</hi> Because he can alledge a very few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that have spoken to this purpose, therefore first it must
be represented to the World as their <hi>common judgement,</hi> next<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
they are charged with concealing this judgment <hi>(why is
this kept up as such a mighty secret in the breasts of their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
p. 37.)</hi> and then it is endeavoured to make men
think they practice against their own judgments in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to seperate Congregations.</p>
            <p>Surely you and I are concern'd, as we have occasion, to
say what we truly can, for the just vindication of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.
I doubt not but you believe and you have, <hi>for
some,</hi> particular reason to be confident, it is for our sakes they
expose themselves to the displeasure of such men as D. <hi>St.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must for my part say, 1. That I beleive it to be the
judgement of very few that every Parish is, <hi>as such<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> a true
Christian Church. I am sorry I have such a ground to fear
it <hi>of one kind, viz.</hi> that some may not be so, as not having
among them any tolerable understanding of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49885:17"/>
fundamental Principles of Christian Religion.
What say you to such where the Minister is grosly ignorant
of the Principles of Religion, or habitually vicious, and of
a profligate life? Do meer Orders make him a Minister
who (perhaps since he received them) is become destitute
of the most essential qualifications? any more than the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
a Monk? or a Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> But I
see not how <hi>they</hi> can apprehend there is the <hi>fitness</hi> which is
<hi>simply necessary,</hi> who judge there are conditions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
imposed that are sinful.</p>
            <p>And I beleive this reverend Author will think it possible
a true Church may impose some sinful conditions of her
Communion, in which case he hath determined a Non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with her necessary and unavoidable.</p>
            <p>3. For those that are of that judgement, the Parochial
Assemblies ought to be Communicated with <hi>so far</hi> as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
was declared. As I know none of the dissenting
Ministers, that thought they <hi>ought always,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> to be
Communicated with, so I see not with what pretence it
can be said they keep up their judgment herein, as a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
secret. If it be so, how came this Author to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to him? Is Printing it to the World keeping it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49885:17"/>
Some have published it <hi>in that way</hi> as we see is known
to the Doctor. Others by their frequent discourses, and
their own practice. And to my observation divers of them
have in their Sermons made it much their business to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the minds of their hearers to a truly Catholick, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Union, as I have been much pleased to take notice some
of the Conforming Clergy do also. But if this be the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
quarrel with any of our Ministers (who think such
Communion Lawful) that they do not constantly, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sermon inculcate the business of Communicating in the
Ceremonial way, for my part I shall blame them as much
as he, when once he hath made it very evident, that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
are more profitable, and likely to do more good
to the souls of men than repentance, the faith of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
the fear of God, a good life in this world, and eternal life
in the other, which I confess are the more usual subjects, so
far as I have had opportunity to observe, of their preaching.</p>
            <p>And let me add, that I can tell you of a secret which some
might be apt to think (as it is <hi>really,</hi> so) is <hi>industriously</hi> and
much <hi>more unrighteously</hi> kept up in one mans breast, that
may be conscious of a great design in it. The Author of
the Book intitled the <hi>Weapon Salve,</hi> or <hi>Irenicum,</hi> seems to
have found it some inconveniency to him, to have been the
Author of so good a Book, whereupon in a certain <hi>Soliloquy</hi>
(though he is pleased to represent it as a <hi>tripartite Dialogue)</hi>
he askes himself his own opinion of it, and gives himself
this answer; <hi>I will tell you freely</hi> (as you know men use
great liberty in talking with themselves, though pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
would direct that to be done in some cases, with
great Caution, and not to talk inconvenient things too
loud, left they be too much overheard) <hi>I beleive there are
many things in it, which if D. St. were to write now, he would
not have said, for there are some things which shew his Youth
and want of due consideration, others in which he yielded too far,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49885:18"/>
&amp;c.</hi> Now here (though I beleive he had begun to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to throw away his <hi>Salve,</hi> and use only the <hi>Weapon</hi> for
the Wounding of sound parts, not the cutting off the incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
yet) I conceive one may safely enough take it for
granted, his intention was not to retract the whole Book.
But whereas he tells us not what he <hi>doth,</hi> (how would the
Doctor take it if one should ask) why is this kept up as such
a mighty secret in his own breast? 
<hi rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Or say the tenderness of
his mind might,</hi> 'tis likely, <hi>out of meer shamefac'dness keeps
him from declaring</hi> against what his own Conscience tells
him is truth.</hi>
However his retractation cannot make that
which was true become false. The <hi>reason of things</hi> is sullen,
and will not alter to serve mens conveniences. Perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his judgment is really altered. If therefore he would
acquit himself like an <hi>honest and conscientious man,</hi> let him tell
the world plainly, which be the pernicious principles of that
Book, that honest and consciencious men who have thought
well of many things in it, (and perhaps the same things
which he now disapproves) may not always be deceived
by the shews of Reason that deceived himself, and by which
he deceived them. The same justice that obliges not to lay
a stumbling block in the way of the blind, doth also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him to remove it who hath laid it: Which is to be
done not by professing another opinion, for we depend
not on his authority, which he hath himself so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished;
but on the reasons he alledged, which if they
were fallacious, let him shew wherein, and answer his
own reasons. To say the truth, the gravity and serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
wherewith that Book was written, appears to have
so little of the <hi>youth</hi> in it, in comparison of the jooularity,
and sportful humor of some of his latter Writings, when
he hath been discussing the most weighty and important
Cases of Conscience, that it seems as a Prodigy in Nature,
and that he began his life at the wrong end; that he was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49885:18"/>
old in his youth, and reserved his <hi>puerility</hi> to his more
grown age. But we hope there is a great residue behind,
wherein he may have opportunity and inclination to shew
the World, that he did not repent <hi>the pious design</hi> of that
Book: Or, at least with a repentance that (can, as well
as that) ought to be repented of.</p>
            <p>4. And whereas such of the dissenting Ministers, as
have most openly declared for communicating at some
times with some of the Parochial Churches, have also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their judgment of the lawfulness and necessity
of Preaching and Hearing, and doing other Religious
Duties in other Congregations also. If now either the
Doctor discern not the consistency of these things, or <hi>they</hi>
discern not their inconsistency; is there nothing to be
said or thought but that they <hi>acquit not themselves like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and conscientious men?</hi> Must it be taken for a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of a mans want of honesty and conscience, not
be presently of the Doctors Opinion in every thing? or
not to see every consequence which he sees, or thinks
he sees?</p>
            <p>But let us consider the goodness of this Consequence,
which it must be so great a piece of dishonesty not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.
If it be the duty of <hi>some</hi> to communicate <hi>sometimes</hi>
with <hi>some</hi> Parish-Churches (for this is the most the Doctor
could make of that Relators Concession, whom he cites
<hi>p.</hi> 21, 22. of his Sermon) Therefore it is the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one to communicate with any Parish-Church where
his abode is, so constantly and entirely as never to have any
communion with any otherwise constituted Congregation.</p>
            <p>This is the thing must be to his purpose infer'd; yea
and he would have it be from somewhat a lower premise.
For he tells us, 
 <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>p.</hi> 37.</bibl> That he dare say, if most of the
Preachers at this day in the separate Meetings were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
askt their judgments, whether it were <hi>lawful</hi> (only)
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49885:19"/>
for the people to joyn with us in the publick Assemblies,
they would not deny it.</q>
He surely dare not say that
their meaning was, that it was lawful <hi>constantly</hi> to joyn
with them in <hi>all their Parochial Assemblies,</hi> unless he <hi>dare
say,</hi> what he hath not, from any of them, the least ground
to think. Now hereupon he collects, <hi>p.</hi> 38. that our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<hi>cannot declare so much in a separate Congregation,</hi> but
<hi>this truth</hi> must fly in their faces: Because he supposeth is
repugnant <hi>to it,</hi> to preach at all in a separate Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(and yet afterwards on the same <hi>page,</hi> he so well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with himself, as to bid them, <hi>if they would acquit
themselves like honest and conscientious men, tell the people
plainly that they look on our Churches as true Churches, and
that they may lawfully communicate with us in Prayers and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:</hi>
And where are they to tell them so, but in the
separate Congregation? <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>severally</hi> he knows it
were impossible. Nor do I think he would reckon Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and Conscience obliging them to come and tell the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
so in <hi>their Congregations.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I am afraid there are but a very few honest and
conscientious men in the World at this day, if none are
to go for such; but who can perceive the strength and
reasonableness of the above-mentioned consequence.</p>
            <p>And that you may further see what reason <hi>our Ministers</hi>
may have<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> notwithstanding all the alledged Concessions,
to administer in the Worship of God in <hi>our Assemblies;</hi>
though it were never so much their common universal
judgment, that they and we might sometimes commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
in some of the <hi>Parochial;</hi> let us consider, That in
the more populous and frequented places, as with you at
<hi>London</hi> for instance, the Churches connot receive, some
not a tenth part, some not half of the people belonging
to them, few can receive all. Methinks good men should
not be offended that multitudes do in this distress relieve
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49885:19"/>
themselves by resorting to other places for necessary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
And though it be the inclinations of the people
that divide them this way and that (as it can be nothing
else) and though places for their resort be not every
where most conveniently situate for their resort, where
there is most need, (which must be taken not always
where it were most desirable, but where they can be had)
yet they that have a mind, had better go to places at a
more inconvenient distance, than have no whither to go;
and it is better the necessities <hi>of many</hi> should be provided
for in such an exigency, <hi>than of none.</hi> In the mean time,
the Churches of worthy conforming Ministers, in such
populous places are generally fill'd, as I have been inform'd,
and have sometimes had occasion to observe.</p>
            <p>Do not necessities of a much lower nature oblige us to
recede from stated humane rules? It is well known there is
a law against relieving such as beg out of their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes.
But if one find upon the road such a poor wretch
ready to perish, am I not bound, notwithstanding, if I can,
to releive him? And who would think in such a case I
transgrest the true intention of the Law?</p>
            <p>Yea and Gods own Laws respecting <hi>Rituals, Common Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and the <hi>external part of Religion,</hi> were by his own dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to yield to far less urgent necessities. <hi>To the plucking an
Ass or Ox out of a Ditch,</hi> how much more the souls of men?
<hi>Have we not read what David did when he was an hungred,
and they that were with him, how he entred into the House of
God, and did eat the shew bread, which it was not lawful for him
to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the
Priests.</hi> How expresly is it alledged by our blessed Saviour,
against those nice and punctilious Observers and Urgers of
the letter of the Law, the Pharisees, <hi>I will have mercy and
not sacrifice.</hi> And if he were willing to abate a <hi>sacrifice to
himself,</hi> that there might be room for the exercise of mercy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49885:20"/>
towards <hi>mens bodies,</hi> how monitory and reprehensive should
that be to such merciless persons, as would have the <hi>very
souls of men themselves be sacrifices to their stiff and unyielding
humors!</hi> Positive Laws cease to bind when, by accident,
they thwart the Law of Nature. Which binds to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more deeply than the endeavour of saving ones own
Soul, and (within the bounds of his calling) his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as his own.</p>
            <p>What if many of our Ministers think it <hi>lawful,</hi> and, at
some times, a <hi>duty</hi> to joyn in some of the publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies?
It is not <hi>then</hi> their duty, when an inviting oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and so urgent necessities lay before them greater duty.
This reverend Author tells us, very pertinently to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
when he was declaiming against us and our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
<q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>p.</hi> 31. of his Sermon:</bibl>
It is a great fault among some
who pretend to great niceness in some <hi>positive duties,</hi> that
they have so little regard to <hi>comparative duties:</hi> For that
which may be a duty in one case, when it comes to thwart
a greater duty, may be none. This Doctrine we learn
from our blessed Saviour in the case of the obligation of
the Sabbath; which he makes to yield to duties of mercy.
And can we think that a Duty lying upon us, which, in
our circumstances, makes a far greater Duty impractible?</q>
We acknowledge Order and Unity very lovely and desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things, but we think it of greater importance that the
Ministers with whom such fault is found conduct men,
though not in so accurate Order (which they cannot help)
to Heaven, than let them go in the best Order, yea (and as
the case is) without any at all, to hell.</p>
            <p>And what though <hi>the necessity</hi> of many of us arise from
our own Scruples, and what though those scruples were
without ground, doth it therefore follow we must be
abandoned to perish? When our very Error if we be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to admit conviction (as we sincerely are could the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49885:20"/>
matter admit it) is not imputable to us for a sin? This
Author was once pleased to make it one of his proposals for
accommodation, 
 <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>p.</hi> 64. of his <hi>Irenicum;</hi>
                  </bibl> That no sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be made, nor mulcts or penalties be inflicted on such,
who only dissent from the use of some things, whose law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
they at present scruple, till sufficient time and
means be used for their information of the nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
of the things, that it may be seen whether it be
out of wilful contempt, and obstinacy of Spirit, or only
weakness of conscience, and dissatisfaction concerning the
things themselves, that they disobey. And if it be made
evident to be out of contempt, that only such penalties be
inflicted as answer to the nature of the offence.</q>
               <hi>Where be adds,</hi>
               <q>I am sure it is contrary to the Primitive practice,
and the moderation then used, to suspend and deprive men
of their Ministerial function for not conforming in habits,
gestures, or the like.</q>
Which he makes good by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
instances beyond his own present contradiction. It is
strange that for <hi>such like</hi> things, now, it is thought so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
just, that our Ministers are totally to be kept out of the
Ministery, and we out of the Church, and the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation!
are these unproportionable penalties even where
contempt appears? and what are they when, through
Gods mercy, there appears not the least colour of it?</p>
            <p>Is meer scrupling an humane device in the worship of
God, and an inability to see with other mens eyes, and to
mould and form our judgements and consciences, as some
other men can do theirs, a crime so inexpiable, that nothing
less than our eternal ruine can satisfy for it? They know,
who have read the Turkish History, that <hi>meer scruple</hi>
brought that <hi>necessity</hi> upon the Garrison of <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> in
<hi>Scanderbegs</hi> daies, that, rather than drink of water which
they thought polluted, they must either surrender, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
If another possible way could have been found to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49885:21"/>
them, was it fit they and the Town should rather be
lost, than their unreasonable scruple be born with? Or
should they, in that exigency, be still held to it, to drink of
that very water or none? We think we have greater reason
to urge for our scruples, we think our necessity is greater,
the case more important, And God deliver us from such
Pastors, as will not think so too, and value souls at an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Rate.</p>
            <p>Our case being thus, we apply ourselves to <hi>Ministers,</hi>
bound by their calling and Office to attend the Affairs of
the souls of men, they are at leasure, have nothing else to
do, they may not live idle and useless in the World. This
is their proper business; Whatever their Opinion is about
the things we scruple (and we believe it is mostly the same
with ours) we see not how they can, or dare, deny us the
help of their Ministerial labours, we thank God that they
dare not. And should they daily spend their pains upon us
to urge us to the Ceremonial way, as we beleive they
would do it very heartlesly (wishing things to be in that
respect, otherwise in the Christian Church, as well as we)
so would their labour in that kind be unprofitable, and
therefore ungrateful to us. Nor do we think it needs any
sort of <hi>mortifiedness</hi> in them (as we find they are jeer'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Notion) not to send us away unedifi'd and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from their Congregations; so much as a mortifiedness
in their love of souls, and their sense of eternal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
Wherein too many others, have attained to a great
degree of mortification.</p>
            <p>But now (my Honored Friend) what think you of
our cause? Let us seriously consider it, not according to
the appearance which it will have to a Captious Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Wit; But as you will apprehend it to look in the eyes
of our supream and final Judge; considering also the same
Blessed Jesus, as that mighty Redeemer and Lover of Souls,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49885:21"/>
who once suffered the just for the unjust to bring them to
God. Bring the matter before him, with whom you are
to expect no tricks, but most plain and equal dealing. And
bethink your self, whether of these two things he will be
more likely to have regard unto, <hi>The saving of Souls,</hi> which
he bought with his blood; or, <hi>The preserving inviolate cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
humane institutions and rules, confessed by the devisers of
them not to be necessary to the being of the Church</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason sees unnecessary to its <hi>well being,</hi> to its external
order and decency (evidently as great without them)
which this Author makes foreign thereto, when he tells us,
that <hi>matters of order and decency are allowable and sitting, but
Ceremonies properly taken for actions significative, and therefore
appointed because significative their lawfulness may with better
ground be scrupled,</hi> Iren. p. 68. And which experience shews
to be destructive. As whereby so great numbers, not only
of his labourers are to be discarded, but of living, flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
plants to be torn up by the roots, and all thrown out
of his vineyard together?</p>
            <p>For my own part I must profess not to have the least
doubt concerning the <hi>thing it self</hi> which we and our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
do, and practice, it is only our common great
concern, to be very careful with <hi>what temper of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and <hi>with what design</hi> we do it. It should to the
uttermost be endeavoured to be done with all meekness
and humility, with all possible reverence to Authority,
abhorrence of the least <hi>real contempt,</hi> and unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
there should be any <hi>appearance</hi> of it, though never
so unavoidable; With a design only to glorifie God, and
promote the common salvation; Not to make or serve
a party, or advance any other interest than that of
<hi>meer substantial Christianity and Godliness.</hi> Let us co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
this temper of mind, and where we see persons of
real worth, and of a true latitude and largeness of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49885:22"/>
commensurate to the Christian interest, that fall in
with the publick constitution<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> value and love them nothing
the less, than if their judgments about these lesser things
were never so exactly squared with our own, and so much
more, by how much they may excell us in far greater and
more valuable things. And if it be our lot to suffer under
the notion of <hi>evil doers</hi> for doing what we take to be <hi>our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
let it be according to the Doctors wholesome Counsel
with an unrepining patience, and with much thankfulness
both to God and our Rulers that we have enjoy'd so much
tranquillity; and with that cheerfulness that becomes those
that expect a blessed eternity; and to be translated ere long
into a pure and peaceful region, where we are to serve
God, in society even with many of them who have been
offended with us, without scruple or trouble to ourselves
or them. If with such dispositions and aims we persist in our
course, while our case is attended with such circumstances
as now it is; I have no fear, I sincerely profess to you, of
our acceptance with God, and, sooner or later, with all
good men.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, I conceive the honest Cause
you were so deeply concerned for, is really unharm'd, and
I hope you apprehend it too; and that therefore your
fear and despondency was causless, as if it could not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
this attempt against it by Doctor <hi>St.</hi> As you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
see how capable it is of defence against him, I shall
not forget the other part of my undertaking: but shall</p>
            <p>Secondly, Say somewhat (as yours sufficiently lets me
see there is Cause) in his just defence against you. And
really Sir, though that be an untoward thing to dispute
against, I find it needful to defend him only <hi>against your
anger,</hi> i.e. <hi>the excess of it:</hi> Which although it can no
more harm him, than he hath done the Cause; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the blunting and breaking its edge (which is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49885:22"/>
the thing I aim at) cannot advantage him, yet it will do
him right; and (which was the thing I first intended)
'twill be an advantage and kindness to you.</p>
            <p>I must here indeed tell you, that I cannot blame you
for being in some measure offended, as I can excuse the
Doctor but in part. I do dislike as well as you two things
especially in his way of managing this business; <hi>viz.</hi> His
<hi>too great acrimony,</hi> and <hi>too little seriousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the former</hi> it is too evident, and I heartily pity him
for it, that he should so forget, and suffer himself to be
transported beyond the rules of Christianity and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
neither of which would allow him, (and I am
sure within the compass of the former, his Text would
not) so to make himself a Standard to all other men, as
to suppose no man can be honest or conscientious that is
not of his mind in the matters he then undertook to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert,
or that should not judge of the connections of
things as he did: I cannot think it hath added to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to reflect so grosly before such an Assembly, upon
a whole Party of Men that are, many of them, well known
in the World; and who, in point of Integrity, are so little
liable to be suspected, that an attempt to blemish them
upon so slight a pretence, and in <hi>matter of fact, so untrue,</hi>
could not but recoil upon himself; especially with them
that shall impartially compare their Inducements to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate
with what he hath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for the other,</hi> it were indeed to have been wisht, that
upon so grave and solemn an Occasion he had forborn <hi>Jests,</hi>
especially <hi>of that nature;</hi> as for instance, <hi>such mortifi'd and
conscientious men,</hi> and <hi>the most godlyâ€”can least endure to
be told of their faults, &amp;c.</hi> Which expressions any one that
considers his scope, will understand to be Ironical; and
that considers the <hi>matter,</hi> to be somewhat bold Ironies;
and the <hi>occasion,</hi> to be causless ones. Inasmuch as it is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49885:23"/>
not impossible, that truly mortified and conscientious men
may desire opportunities to do God Service in the World,
in a way that he dislikes. And it may consist with real
Godliness, not to count all those things Faults, which he
takes to be such. And indeed <hi>in his Dedication,</hi> his way
of averting the report of <hi>those ill men,</hi> that <hi>he intended to stir
up the Magistrates and Judges to a Persecution of the Dissenters,</hi>
is, to any considering man, sportful and ludierous; <hi>viz.</hi>
Offering them only such a way of escaping Persecution, as
whereupon a man may shun suffering, if he please, from
any party of men in the world, <hi>as such,</hi> by being in every
thing of their mind and way: But which in effect grants
the Charge which he would avoid, that if we will not be so
united to his Party, we were to expect nothing but utmost
rigor. One would rather have thought he should have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew'd
that Discourse with Tears, which had <hi>in it self,</hi> most
manifestly so awful and tremendous a Design: As not
only the devoting of so great Numbers, that might possibly
not be convinced, and perswaded by him, to a temporal
ruine; but the depriving them of the ordinary means of
their salvation. And that, if he thought it necessary for the
preserving of Order in the Church, they should be so dealt
with; he should have spoken of their Case with greatest
compassion and tenderness, not with derision and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>Yet I would have you use lenitives with yourself, and
calm your own spirit; and I wish you were capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
any thing to the moderating and pacifying his
too. That though he have been angry unprovok'd, and
with a sort of men, that have ever respected and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him as if he had been of themselves; his anger that hath
been <hi>without cause</hi> (as you know perhaps who in a like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
blames the exorbitancy of another passion) may
not also be <hi>without end.</hi> At least I pray you take heed you
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49885:23"/>
do not deserve the like sharp repartee; which the <hi>Cynick</hi> met
with from <hi>that noble Philosopher,</hi> that he <hi>taxed his pride with
greater pride;</hi> that you exceed not the heats whereof you
complain. If he will still retain his fervour, let him be
angry alone. And his displeasure have its continuance,
with as little influence or concomitancy of yours (and I
could wish of any other mans) as (for ought I know,) it
had its beginning. And that since he thinks <hi>of being a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
he may only burn gently in his own flame, which he
may moderate as he please, and I hope will seasonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish,
before he have suffered much harm by it.</p>
            <p>For the qualifying of <hi>your own too great resentment and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;</hi>
I would have you consider how great reason you
have to believe, that this blow came only from the (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
misgovern'd) hand of a pious and good man. Be it
far from you to imagine otherwise. If you think he was
to blame for intimating suspicious of their sincerity whom
he opposes, make not yourself equally blameable, by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
hereupon, <hi>any,</hi> concerning <hi>his.</hi> Which would argue a
mean narrow spirit, and a most unwarrantable fondness of
a party, as if all true Religion and Godliness were bound
up in it.</p>
            <p>And if it look unlovely in your eyes to see one of much
avowed latitude and enlargedness of mind, and capable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that account of being the more universally serviceable to
the Christian Chuch, forsaking <hi>that comprehensive interest,</hi> so
far as to be <hi>ingulft into a party</hi> upon <hi>a private and distinct basis,</hi>
consider what aspect the same thing would have in your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And never make his difference with you in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a reason to yourself of an hard judgment concerning
him; who can, you must consider, differ no more from us,
than we do from him.</p>
            <p>Beleive him, <hi>in the substance</hi> of what he said, to speak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his <hi>present</hi> judgment. Think how gradually
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49885:24"/>
and insensibly mens judgments alter, and are formed by
their converse. That <hi>his</hi> circumstances have made it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to him to converse most for a long time, with those
who are fully of that mind which he here discovers, that
his own real worth must have drawn into his acquaintance
the best and most valuable of them, and such for whom he
might not only have a kindness, but a reverence; and who,
therefore, must have the more power and influence upon
him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to conform his sentiments to their own.</p>
            <p>We ourselves do not know, had we been, by our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
led to associate and converse mostly with men of
another judgment, what our own would have been. And
they that are wont to discover most confidence of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
do usually but discover most ignorance of the <hi>nature
of man;</hi> and how little they consider the <hi>power</hi> of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
objects and inducements to draw mens minds this way
or that. Nor indeed, as to matters of this nature, can any
man be confident that the <hi>Grace of God</hi> shall <hi>certainly</hi> incline
him to be of this, or another opinion or practice in these
matters; because we find those that we have reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
have great assistances of divine grace are divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, and go not all one way.</p>
            <p>We may indeed be confident that had <hi>the same conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
occur'd to us which have, we should have been of
the same mind and judgment that we are. But it is very
supposable that some accidental occasions might possibly
have happened, that might hinder <hi>our actual taking up
such considerations,</hi> though the things to be considered were
not unknown to us. And not <hi>that</hi> only, but that might
<hi>prevent our knowing,</hi> even matters of Fact, that have signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
not a little to the determining our judgments that way
which they now incline to.</p>
            <p>And I do particularly believe (as I doubt not but God
is graciously present with those that in the sincerity of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49885:24"/>
their hearts have chosen to serve him in the way which the
Law prescribes so) that if Doctor <hi>St.</hi> had known what
Proofs there are of <hi>that same gracious presence,</hi> in these so
much censured Meetings, his thoughts would have been
very different of them from what they are. I do not speak
of proselyting men to a Party, which I heartily despise as
a mean and inconsiderable thing: But have known some,
and heard of many Instances of very ignorant and profane
persons, that have been led, perhaps by their own curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
or it may be, by the perswasion of some Neighbour
or Friend, to hear and see what was done in such Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that have (through Gods blessing, upon so despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
means) become very much reformed men, and (for
ought that could be judged) serious and sincere Christians.
And whereas some, that have very prejudicial thoughts of
all that frequent such Meetings, may be apt to suspect all
effects of that kind, to be nothing else but illusions of fancy,
or a disposition (at least) to Enthusiasm, or an artificial
and industrious hypocrisie; I am very confident that if the
Doctor had had the opportunity, frequently to observe and
converse with such, as we have had, and heard the sobriety
and consistency of their discourse, and seen the unaffected
simplicity, humility, and heavenliness of their conversation,
he could not have allow'd <hi>himself</hi> the liberty of such hard
censures, but would have judged of many such persons as
you and I do.</p>
            <p>Upon supposition of all which, I make little question
but it would have been very remote from him to wish that
so many persons had rather lived in sin, and perished fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
than have been brought to repentance and a good life,
by being now and then at a <hi>separate</hi> Meeting.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>for the substance of what he hath said against such
Meetings,</hi> we have reason to impute it to his judgment; and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>is judgment to such circumstances, very much, as I have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49885:25"/>
mentioned, that have led him the way he hath taken; and
not given him opportunity to know what might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
a better opinion in him of the way which he opposes.</p>
            <p>But <hi>for the manner</hi> of his treating of his subject, <hi>That</hi> I
impute to the prevalency of some present temptation; and
hope he did not express in that Sermon his <hi>habitual temper.</hi>
And am highly confident, notwithstanding what he hath
said in it; if it were in his power, we might even safely
trust him to prescribe us terms, and should receive no hard
ones from him.</p>
            <p>Somewhat it is likely he was expected (and might be
urged) to say to this business. And his own thoughts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
set a work, fermented into an intemperate heat, which
it is to be hoped, will in time evaporate.</p>
            <p>If I may freely speak to you my own thoughts, he seems
to deal in this business as one that <hi>forced himself</hi> to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.
For though I apprehend he speaks his judgment, yet
the expressing it in this time and manner he might regret.
And because it might appear a becoming thing to him to
seem earnest; The temptation prevailed with him (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his habitual inclination) to supply with sharpness,
the defect of reason; which the poverty of the Cause af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
not. For realy his reasonings are faint, unconclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and unlike Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi> So that if any <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected</hi>
this performance from him, one may think (and
this ought in some part to excuse him) that, besides some
little flourishes of his reading and wit, he seems only to
have lent them his name. Which however I pray you let
still be of great value with you. And turn your displeasure
into serious earnest praying for him, that his spirit may
not be further harm'd; that, amidst his many temptations,
he may be delivered and preserved from being at all puft up
or any way imbittered, and that so valuable a person be not
lost, or in the least degree, rendred less useful to the Church
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49885:25"/>
of God. And that all that know his more inward conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
may discern in his frequent savoury discourses, in his
continued serious calling upon God in his family, in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to do good, especially to the souls of men, in his apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to condescend to those that are much beneath him, how
great the Efficacy is, of <hi>divine Grace.</hi> And that, through
the power of it, a great measure of Wit, learning, applause,
and secular advantages, may not only consist with vivid god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and sincere devotedness to the Interest of Religion,
but contribute abundantly to the service and diffusion
thereof in the World. <hi>I am very serious</hi> in this advice to you.
Nor, thanks be to God, have so low or profane thoughts of
prayer (which hath ever born so great a part in the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all times, nations, and sorts of men) as to think it
will signifie nothing. Especially when the design of it is
not <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>private,</hi> but such wherein all good men will
Unite.</p>
            <p>I little doubt but if ever there shall be good days, and an
happy state of things on Earth, a factious Zeal for Parties
will become a contemptible thing: And all the discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Accretions to Religion, which are severally scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to all other Parties except their own, who embrace
any sort of them (too probably for the sake of some secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
interest or other which is hoped to be gratified and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
thereby) will be spontaneously quitted and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
by all Parties from an over-powring sense and
grateful relish of substantial Religion it self; i.e. <hi>Entire
devotedness to God and the Redeemer, with the joyful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the blessedness of the other World:</hi> And so all become
one.</p>
            <p>But is this to be done while <hi>we</hi> sleep and do nothing?
Or have we in our Circumstances, any thing to do, by
which we may hope to contribute so much towards it <hi>as
by Prayer?</hi> By this means (if men of sincere and pious
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49885:26"/>
Minds, did with universal and abstracted Aims, apply
themselves to this great Duty) we are to reckon the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Spirit of <hi>Holiness, love,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> would be more and
more drawn <hi>into consent.</hi> Do you your own part herein,
you will find your own present advantage by it: It will
fill you with good thoughts, hopes, and expectations. The
kindly benign influences whereof, will pleasantly qualifie
and temper your Spirit, and make you know how much
more grateful an Inhabitant that <hi>Charity</hi> is, which think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no evil, beareth all things, believeth all things, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
all things, endureth all things, than frowardness,
discontent, vexation, and anger, at any one that thinks
and speaks otherwise, than you did expect or wish. Insist
upon such things in Prayer, as wherein it may reasonably
be expected good men shall generally agree with you. You
have the more reason to expect being heard; yea, and
ought to hope the <hi>Spirit</hi> of this Person, whom you have
taken such offence at, will be rescued out of temptation,
and be drawn into <hi>full consent</hi> with you. For you have no
cause to doubt, but that he hath those Principles wrought
into the temper of his Mind, which need only <hi>resuscita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that they may dispose him to union with the whole
body of sober and serious Christians of his own way, or
of others, (whensoever that can be seasonably endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for) upon more probable and hopeful terms than he
hath proposed in this Sermon. <hi>Therefore be you serious and
fervent</hi> in Requests <hi>to this purpose,</hi> as you have that love
to God and his Church, which you profess; and that
value for this worthy Person which I reckon you still
ought to have: or (if that can be fit to be added) any
kindness for</p>

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:49885:26"/>
               <p>SInce my writing these Pages, I hear of Answers to the
Dean's Sermon; which, in so remote a Corner, I
have had no opportunity to see: What is here written
may therefore (upon comparing) be communicated, or
suppressed, as shall be thought fit.</p>
               <p>And so I should take leave of you, but that it may be
needful, whereas I have principally considered in these
Papers, the case of such as think it unlawful to joyn in the
publick Assemblies; to add somewhat (whomsoever it
may serve) in reference to their case that think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
For to say the truth, this is <hi>here</hi> the more common
case: And though the Doctor believes they that frequent
the <hi>separate Meetings,</hi> do generally judge it unlawful to joyn
in the <hi>Publick;</hi> Howsoever it is with you, (and it is likely
the Doctor speaks of what is more within the compass of
his own knowledge, or <hi>theirs</hi> who inform him:) It is
<hi>with us in this part of this Country</hi> quite contrary. And I
may truly say, that <hi>in this place</hi> (and others where I have
sometimes occasionally been) the generality of them who
come to the other Meetings do also attend the Publick.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>these</hi> may perhaps think themselves left under
blame and may apprehend the Doctors Consequence is
strong against them, [that if occasional Communion be
lawful, constant Communion must be a Duty:] Which
he no doubt, understands exclusively of any distinct way
of Communion.</p>
               <p>And if indeed they judge that Consequence strong, I
would fain know what hurt they can think it doth them?
Why should any man be afraid of <hi>his duty?</hi> or of <hi>the
truth</hi> which makes it known? And, if hereupon, they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49885:27"/>
can, with the satisfaction of their own Consciences, wave
all other opportunities of worshipping God with others of
his People, they have the less to do: And why should they
complain who are satisfy'd?</p>
               <p>But in short, either they apprehend such other additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
means, a real necessary help and advantage to them,
or they do not. <hi>If they do not,</hi> they have no cause to
trouble themselves, nor to grudge that so much is said for
others; Whose, for ought I know, may, as the Doctor
thinks, (for I cannot make an estimate from this or that
little spot) be the much more common case. <hi>If they do,</hi>
they have little reason to be concern'd about the Doctors
Consequence: Which I much wonder if he himself can
think strong. It hath not, you see, been altogether over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look't
in the foregoing Discourse: And if any feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wounded by it; He is so great an <hi>Achilles,</hi> that they
may have their Wound and Healing from the same Hand.</p>
               <p>For, as hath been noted from him in his Preface to the
<hi>Irenicum,</hi> he seems plainly to intimate, that <hi>men have no
Charter,</hi> or <hi>Grant of Divine Power,</hi> to make other Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Church-Communion than Christ hath made.
If so, then <hi>the Conditions</hi> by which <hi>this way of Communion</hi> is
distinguished from the <hi>other,</hi> (supposing they be lawful)
are still, <hi>in themselves, matter of liberty,</hi> not <hi>of duty:</hi> And so
'tis left to the prudence of a Christian to determine him (as
in all like cases) this way or that; as will make most for
the common good, consistently with that of his own Soul.
<hi>That</hi> is <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Duty,</hi> which in this or that case, will do
more hurt or good. There being no <hi>particular</hi> rule to
guide a mans practice, he must have recourse to that <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
one: <hi>By which</hi> it may be my duty, upon some great
reason, to do that, <hi>at one time;</hi> which for as great reason,
I ought not to do in a continued course. And it is highly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49885:27"/>
commendable, when a Christian understands the latitude
which the <hi>Law of Christ</hi> hath left him; Is, in his own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
exempt from servile restraints, by other <hi>imagined</hi>
bonds: And can with a generous liberty (pure from base
self-respects) turn himself this way or that, as shall make
most for the service of the ends he lives for. And when
any accordingly use that liberty, 'tis a fancy of none but
half-witted persons, to think they must therefore addict
themselves to this or that Party.</p>
               <p>If a mans case come to be so stated, that he hath reason
to apprehend it will do more good than hurt <hi>to others,</hi> that
he own a sort of Christians, who have <hi>particularly</hi> modified
themselves, otherwise than they needed, by any divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
(or by any that God hath empowr'd men to put
them under) by communicating with them <hi>under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
notion of Christians,</hi> only, not <hi>as so modified:</hi> He doth
but express the genuine complexion of a truly Christian
Spirit. But he is not to do so <hi>in a continued course,</hi> if he find
it will be a real damage to his own soul, in comparison of
another way that he finds more edifying. Perhaps if he will
be religious only, after the mode of this or that party, his
Fare may be either too fine or too course for his constant
diet. I may, besides my own inclination, drink a single glass
of Wine out of Civility to one person, or of Water, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when I am not, for any mans pleasure, to destroy my
health by tying my self to drink nothing else. And whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Christian condescendingness, and goodness of temper
may prompt a man to, who makes not <hi>what others do,</hi> but
<hi>what they ought to do</hi> his rule and measure: They have least
reason to expect much compliance from others, who bind
themselves up within their own party, are enwrapt as <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi>
in his Scales, call themselves <hi>the Church</hi> (as many say
here is Christ, and there is Christ) and call all men <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
that will not be of <hi>their Church.</hi> And perhaps they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49885:28"/>
and appropriate the name with no more pretence or
colour, and with no better-sense, than if an humorsom
company of men, should distinguish themselve from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by wearing a blue or a yellow girdle, <hi>and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
mankind!</hi> Do not too many in our daies distinguish
their Church and Christian Communion, by things no
more belonging to a Church, or to Christianity, than a
girdle of this or that colour to humane Nature? And
which no more qualify for <hi>Christian Society,</hi> than <hi>that</hi> doth
for <hi>human?</hi> If however, an ingenuous, free spirited man,
out of respect to his present company, or for any other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
reason, should in such a case put on a blue girdle, I
shall find no fault with him. But if any should go about to
pinch him too close with it, so as would be inconvenient
to his ease and health, or oblige him to protest against the
<hi>true humanity</hi> of all that neglect it. I doubt not he would
throw it away with scorn. Much less would he be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sederate
with them that use it, if they professedly combine
for the destruction of the rest of mankind that use it not,
when many of them that refuse it apprehend it a real grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.
Especially, when they that would impose it, live,
with many of the rest, under the Government of a just and
sovereign Prince, from whom they have no <hi>Charter</hi> for their
imposition, but who hath declared he will not have his
subjects so impos'd upon.</p>
               <p>In sum, we are all indispensably oblig'd by our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, the sovereign Prince and Ruler of his Church,
<hi>to the substance of</hi> all Christian Ordinances. As to <hi>uninstitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
modes thereof,</hi> we are free. And they that understand
their liberty, may use or not use them as is more for their
own, and the common good. They that understand it
not, and think themselves under an obligation from Christ
not to admit questionable, devised additions into their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
they are not therefore to deprive themselves of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49885:28"/>
                  <hi>substantial Ordinances</hi> of the Christian Religion, whereof
there is no question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I shut up all with the words of the great Apostle, Rom.</hi>
14. 3. 4. One beleiveth that he may eat all things: another,
who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth despise him
that eateth not, for God hath received him. v. 13. Let us not
therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that
no man put a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall in his brothers
way.</p>
