         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>I Do not think it at all needful to tell the
World, what it was which led me to the
<hi>Writing</hi> of this Discourse concerning <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
the substance of which was preached se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years ago; Nor am I concern'd to Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize
for the <hi>Publication</hi> of it; If I thought
it needed an Apology, I would not consent to
it. That Temper of Mind which it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to promote, and to charm Men into,
every one will own to be highly conducive to
the Comfort of Humane Life, the Honour of
our Holy Religion, and the Welfare and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of all Societies, Civil and Sacred:
And therefore, while the <hi>Design</hi> cannot be
dislik'd, I hope what is weak and defective
in the <hi>Management</hi> will be excus'd. Some
useful Discourses have been of late published
against <hi>Rash Anger,</hi> and an excellent <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive
from Revenge</hi> by the present <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Chester,</hi> wherein those brutish <hi>Vices</hi> are

Design I am driving, while I recommend the

contrary <hi>Virtues</hi> to the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of
all that profess Relation to the <hi>Holy Jesus:</hi>

            <p>IT was with real difficulty, through the not
easily vincible Aversion of the <hi>Reverend
Author,</hi> that these <hi>two Discourses</hi> are now
at length brought <hi>together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> into publick view.
Nor, were that more distinctly known, would
they be the less acceptable to the more Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
part of the World.</p>
            <p>Through the Humility and Self-depressing
thoughts that are wont to accompany true Worth,
the best Men are not always the most equal
Iudges of their own Performances.</p>
            <p>The Reason which <hi>Socrates</hi> is reported to
have given, why he made nothing publick,
<note n="*" place="margin">Apud Stob.</note>, <hi>that the Paper was dearer, and of more
value than what he had to write,</hi> we can
easily apprehend satisfy'd no body but himself.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if many, that more truly might,
had made that judgment, more Mercy had
been us'd towards that perishable Commodity
without Injustice, or Infelicity to the World.</p>
            <p>But in reference to what hath true value in
it, and so real usefulness unto common Good,
as appears <hi>in this little Volume;</hi> a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt of
extortion was not unduly us'd, to draw it forth,
and wrest it out of the hands that <hi>Penn'd it,</hi>
in the first intention, <hi>for a few,</hi> that it might
<pb facs="tcp:98022:4"/>
serve a further end; and, as it was equally
capable, do good to many.</p>
            <p>It hath, indeed, been so ancient, and so
common <hi>a wont,</hi> to let <hi>things that tend,</hi> tho'
never so directly, <hi>to the bettering of Mens
Minds,</hi> stand to be gaz'd at in Books, or obtain
at the most (as hath long ago been noted) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of <hi>cold praise,</hi> without any thought of ever
being possest of the <hi>things themselves,</hi> that
Men easily agree, <hi>because it is a fashion,</hi> to
pardon to one another <hi>this absurd neglect,</hi>
seldom <hi>knowing shame</hi> for it, or taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the incongruity, that it should be <hi>thus</hi>
in reference to things of <hi>this most excellent
kind;</hi> when in things that apparently serve
to bodily, or secular advantage, there is so
observable a difference!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Otherwise,</hi> for the <hi>former of these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses</hi>
concerning <hi>Christian Meekness,</hi> were
it a <hi>Common Design</hi> to have Minds habited
and cloath'd, according to it, what a blessed
calm would it introduce into our World! How
serene and peaceful a Region would it make
every Man's Soul to himself, and to all about
him! It would then be truly said of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, <hi>This is the House of God, this
is the Gate of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>How near an Alliance this Complexion of
Soul hath with the Heavenly Regions, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious</hi>
Moralist<note n="*" place="margin">Sen. de irâ</note> 
               <hi>aptly represents, taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi>
That the upper and better order'd part
<pb facs="tcp:98022:4"/>
of the World, next the Stars, is driven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
into no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>loud, hurried into no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,

the inferior Regions throw about Thunders
and Lightnings. So is the sublime Mind
always quiet, placed in a station of undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Tranquility, sober, venerable, and
compos'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And nothing is more plain, than that the higher
and greater things our Minds are exercis'd and
taken up with, the more sedate they are, and less
liable to unbeseeming Commotion; And hereto the
scope and design of the annexed Discourse most
aptly agrees.</p>
            <p>Christianity is too high and too great a thing to
be a <hi>SECT;</hi> of too near affinity to Heaven, the
common term of all our pursuits and hopes. That
Holy Religion, by its direct and steady tendency
thitherward, abstracts our Minds from low and
little Arts and Aims. All Parties terminate in
the Earth, there can be no room for them above;
the will be buried in the dust. Christian Religion
is debased and abused, when it is made subservient
to so mean purposes. It is treated Ignominiously,
when Men so represent it, or concern themselves
about the Affairs of it, as if it were a <hi>Sect:</hi> Or,
as if <hi>to be a Christian,</hi> and <hi>to be a Sectary,</hi>
were terms of the same signif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cation; or its Cause
were accordingly to be managed, wrathfully, and
with fury, with calumny and slander, of such as
in every arbitrary mode of Speech and Practice
agree not with us. So the little Interests are w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt
to be served, and contended for, that belong only
to this present World, and will end with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98022:5"/>
Too many, God knows, treat the Noble Cause
of <hi>Religion</hi> at this rate, at least what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be it. <hi>Religion it self,</hi> indeed, disdains
to be so served; nor, where Minds are once deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

something of <hi>Metaphor</hi> in it, will illustrate
the former, and therefore we shall speak of them
distinctly.</p>
                     <p>[1.] We must be of a <hi>meek</hi> Spirit.—<gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>facilis:</hi> So the Criticks. Meekness is
<hi>easiness</hi> of Spirit; not a <hi>sinful</hi> easiness to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched,
as <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s that <hi>willingly walked after
the Commandment</hi> of the idolatrous Princes, <hi>Hos.</hi>
5. 11. Nor a <hi>simple</hi> easiness to be imposed upon
and deceiv'd, as <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s, who when he was
forty Years old is said to be <hi>young and tender-hearted,</hi>
2 Chron. 13. 7. but a <hi>gracious</hi> easiness
to be wrought upon by that which is good, as
their's whose <hi>Heart of Stone</hi> is taken away, and
to whom a <hi>Heart of Flesh</hi> is given. Meekness is
<hi>easiness,</hi> for it <hi>accommodates</hi> the Soul to every
<hi>Occurrence,</hi> and so makes a Man <hi>easie</hi> to himself
and to all about him. The Latines call a meek
Man <hi>mansuetus:</hi> qu. <hi>manu assuetus;</hi> us'd to the
Hand, which alludes to the taming and reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Creatures wild by Nature,<note place="margin">Jam. 3. 7, 8.</note> and bringing
them to be tractable and <hi>familiar.</hi> Man's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature hath made him like <hi>the wild Ass us'd
to the VVilderness,</hi> or the <hi>swift Dromedary tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
her ways,</hi> Jer. 2. 23, 24. But the Grace
of <hi>Meekness,</hi> when that gets Dominion in the
Soul, alters the temper of it, brings it to <hi>hand,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
it to management, and now the <hi>VVolf</hi> dwels
with the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>Leopard</hi> lies down with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98022:9"/>
the <hi>Kid</hi> and <hi>a little Child may lead them;</hi> for
Enemies are laid aside, and there's nothing to
<hi>hurt or destroy, Isa,</hi> 11. 6, 9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Meekness</hi> may be considered with respect both
to <hi>God</hi> and to our <hi>Brethren;</hi> it belongs to both
the Tables of the Law, and attends upon the
<hi>First</hi> great Commandment, <hi>Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God,</hi> as well as the Second which is
like unto it, <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as
thy Self;</hi> though its special reference is to the
<hi>latter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, There is <hi>Meekness towards God,</hi> and it
is the easie and quiet <hi>Submission</hi> of the Soul
to his whole <hi>Will,</hi> according as he is pleased to
make it known, whether by his <hi>Word</hi> or by his
<hi>Providence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. It is the silent submission of the Soul to the
<hi>Word</hi> of God: The Understanding bowed to
every Divine Truth, and the Will to every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Precept; and both <hi>without murmuring or
disputing.</hi> The Word is then an <hi>engrafted Word</hi>
when it is <hi>received with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Meekness,</hi> Jam. 1. 21.
<hi>i. e.</hi> with a sincere willingness to be taught, and
desire to learn. <hi>Meekness</hi> is a Grace that cleaves
the <hi>Stock,</hi> and holds it open, that the Word as
the <hi>Imp</hi> may be <hi>graffed</hi> in; it breaks up the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Ground, and makes it fit to receive the Seed,
captivates the high thoughts, and lays the Soul
like White Paper under God's Pen: When the
Day <hi>Spring</hi> takes <hi>hold of the ends of the Earth,</hi>
it is said to be <hi>turned as Clay to the Seal,</hi> Job 38.
12, 13, 14. Meekness doth in like manner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Soul to admit the Rays of Divine Light;
which before it rebelled against, it opens the
Heart, as <hi>Lydias</hi> was opened; and sets us down
with <hi>Mary</hi> at the <hi>feet of Christ;</hi> the learners

                        <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Posture:</hi> Compare, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 3. The
promise of Teaching is made to the Meek, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are disposed to learn, the <hi>meek will he

is <hi>Gospel</hi> indeed, Good tidings <hi>to the meek, Isa.</hi>
61. 1. they will entertain it and bid it welcome;

                        <hi>wait daily at her Gates, and like Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars

of this meekness is that of the Child <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,
1 Sam. 3. 9. Speak Lord for thy Servant
heareth;</hi> and that of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> who when he was in
that high Post of Honour, giving command to <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
and bidding Defiance to all their Enemies, his
Breast filled with great and bold thoughts; yet
upon the intimation of a Message from Heaven
thus submits himself to it, <hi>Iosh. 5. 14. What
saith my Lord unto his Servant?</hi> And that of
<hi>Paul,</hi> (and it was the first breath of the New Man)
<hi>Acts 9. 6. Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And
that of <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. 33. And <hi>now we are
all here present before God, to hear all things that
are commanded thee of God:</hi> And that of the
good Man I have read of, who when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to hear the Word, used to say, Now, <hi>let the
Word of the Lord come, and if I had six hundred
Necks I would bow them all to the Authority of it.</hi>
To receive the Word with meekness, is to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
into it,</hi> as into a <hi>Mold:</hi> it seems to be
<hi>Pauls</hi> Metaphor, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. that form of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine

Meekness softens the Wax that it may receive

or Reproof; for Correction or Instruction in

                     </p>
                     <p>2. It is the silent submission of the Soul to the

God concerning us.</p>
                     <p>(1.) When the Events of Providence are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and afflictive, displeasing to sense, and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our secular interests; meekness doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>quiet</hi> us under them, but <hi>reconcile</hi> us to them;
and inable us not only to <hi>bear,</hi> but to <hi>receive</hi> evil
as well as <hi>good</hi> at the hand of the Lord; which
is the excellent frame that <hi>Iob</hi> argues himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<hi>Iob.</hi> 2. 10. 'Tis to kiss the Rod, and even
to <hi>accept</hi> of the punishment of our iniquity; tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all in good part that God doth: Not <hi>daring</hi>
to <hi>strive</hi> with our Maker, no, nor <hi>desiring</hi> to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe</hi>
to him, but <hi>Dumb</hi> and <hi>not opening the
Mouth</hi> because God doth it. How meek was
<hi>Aaron</hi> under the severe dispensation which took
away his Sons with a particular mark of Divine
Wrath, he <hi>held his peace, Levit,</hi> 10. 3. God
was <hi>Sanctified,</hi> and therefore <hi>Aaron</hi> was <hi>Satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and had not a word to say against it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to this was the <hi>Temper,</hi> or rather the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper</hi>
of <hi>David,</hi> who then was not like a <hi>Man
after Gods own Heart,</hi> when he was <hi>displeased,
because the Lord had made a breach upon</hi> Uzza,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 8. as if God must have ask'd <hi>David</hi>
leave thus to assert the Honour of his Ark.
When Gods Anger is <hi>kindled,</hi> ours must be <hi>stifled;</hi>
such is the Law of Meekness, that <hi>whatsoever
pleaseth God must not displease us: David</hi> was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98022:11"/>
in a better frame when he Penn'd the 56 <hi>Psalm,</hi>
the <hi>Title</hi> of which, some <hi>think,</hi> speaks the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and submissiveness of his Spirit when the
<hi>Philistines took him in</hi> Gath: It is upon <hi>Ionath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elem-reckokim,</hi>
the <hi>silent</hi> Dove <hi>afar off:</hi> It was
his calamity that he was <hi>afar off,</hi> but he was
then as a <hi>silent Dove; (mourning</hi> perhaps, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38.
14.) but not <hi>murmuring,</hi> not strugling, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting,
when seized by the <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Prey;</hi> and
the Psalm he Pen'd in this frame was <hi>Michtam,</hi>
a <hi>Golden Psalm.</hi> The Language of this meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is that of <hi>Eli, 1 Sam. 3. 18. It is the Lord;</hi>
and that of <hi>David</hi> to the same purpose, 2 <hi>Sam.
15. 25, 26. Here I am, let him do to me as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
good unto him.</hi> Not only, he <hi>can</hi> do what
he will, subscribing to his <hi>Power,</hi> for who can
stay his Hand: Or, He <hi>may</hi> do what he will, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
to his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> for he giveth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of any of his matters: Or, He <hi>will</hi> do
what he will, subscribing to his <hi>Unchangableness,</hi>
for he is in one mind, and who can turn him?
But <hi>let him do what he will,</hi> subscribing to his
Wisdom and Goodness, as <hi>Hezekiah, Isa. 39. 8.
Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
Let him do what he <hi>will,</hi> for he will do
what is <hi>best,</hi> and therefore if God should <hi>refer</hi>
the matter to me, (saith the meek and quiet
Soul) being well assured that he knows what is
good for me better than I do for my my self, I
would <hi>refer it to him again;</hi> he shall <hi>chuse our
Inheritance for us, Psal.</hi> 47. 4.</p>
                     <p>(2.) When the <hi>methods</hi> of Providence are <hi>dark</hi>
and <hi>intricate,</hi> and we are quite at a loss what God
is about to do with us, <hi>his way</hi> is <hi>in the Sea and his

that all things shall <hi>work together for

apprehend how or which way. It teacheth us

                        <hi>Meekness</hi> in the School of the Philosophers is
a Virtue consisting in a mean between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
of rash excessive Anger on the one Hand,
and a defect of Anger on the other, in which

                        <hi>Meekness</hi> in the School of Christ is one of
the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5. 22, 23. it is a
<hi>Grace</hi> (both <hi>gratis data,</hi> and <hi>gratum faciens)</hi>
wrought by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> both as a <hi>Sanctifier</hi>
and as a <hi>Comforter</hi> in the Hearts of all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
teaching and enabling them at all times
to keep their passions under the Conduct and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Religion</hi> and right <hi>Reason:</hi> I say it
is wrought in the Hearts of all true Believers,
because, though there are some <hi>rough</hi> and <hi>knotty</hi>
pieces that the Spirit works upon, whose <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Temper</hi> is unhappily <hi>sower</hi> and <hi>harsh,</hi> which
are long in the <hi>squaring;</hi> yet wheresoever there
is true Grace, there is a disposition to strive
against, and strength in some measure to conquer
that Distemper. And tho' in this as in other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
an absolute <hi>Sinless</hi> Perfection cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in this present state, yet we are to <hi>labour</hi>
after it and <hi>press</hi> towards it.</p>
                     <p>More particularly: The Work and Office of
Meekness is to enable us <hi>prudently</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> our
own anger when at any time we are provok'd, and
<hi>patiently</hi> to <hi>bear</hi> the Anger of others, that it
may not be a provocation to us. The former is
its Office especially in <hi>Superiors,</hi> the latter in
<hi>Inseriors,</hi> and both in <hi>Equals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Meekness teacheth us <hi>prudently to govern
our own Anger, whenever any thing occurs that
is provoking.</hi> As it is the work of <hi>Temperance</hi>
to moderate our Natural Appetites towards those
things that are <hi>pleasing</hi> to sense, so it is the work
of <hi>Meekness</hi> to moderate our Natural Passions
against those things that are <hi>displeasing</hi> to sense,
and to guide and govern our Resentments of
those things. Anger in the Soul is like <hi>Mettle</hi>
in a Horse, good if it be well managed: Now
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98022:12"/>
                        <hi>Meekness</hi> is the <hi>Bridle,</hi> as <hi>Wisdom</hi> is the <hi>Hand</hi>
that gives Law to it; puts it into the right way,
and keeps it of an even, steddy and regular pace
in that way, reducing it when it turns aside, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
it in a due <hi>Decorum,</hi> and restraining it
and giving it check, when at any time it grows
headstrong and outragious, and threatens Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to our selves or others. It must thus be
held in, <hi>like the Horse and Mule with Bit and
Bridle</hi> (Psal. 32. 9.) lest it break the Hedge, run
over those that stand in its way, or throw the
Rider himself head-long.<note place="margin">Non cognosci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur andaci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which we say of <hi>Fire,</hi> That it's a <hi>good Servant,</hi>

<hi>Hitherto thou shalt come and no further; here shall
thy proud Waves be staid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In reference to <hi>our own</hi> Anger when at any
time we meet with the <hi>Excitements</hi> of it, the
work of <hi>MEEKNESS</hi> is to do these four
things.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>To consider the Circumstances of that which
we apprehend to be a Provocation,</hi> so as at no time
to express our displeasure but upon due and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>deliberation.</hi> The Office of Meekness is to
keep <hi>Reason</hi> upon the <hi>Throne</hi> in the Soul, as it
ought to be, to preserve the Understanding clear
and unclouded, the Judgment untainted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biassed
in the midst of the greatest Provocations,
so as to be able to set every thing in its true
<hi>Light,</hi> and to see it in its own <hi>Colour,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
accordingly, as also to keep <hi>silence</hi> in the
<hi>Court,</hi> that the <hi>still small Voice,</hi> in which the
Lord is (as he was with <hi>Elijah</hi> at <hi>Mount Horeb,</hi>
1 Kin, 19. 12, 13.) may not be <hi>drown'd</hi> by the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98022:13"/>
noise of the <hi>Tumult</hi> of the <hi>Passions.</hi> A meek
Man will never be angry at a Child, at a Servant,
at a Friend, till he hath first seriously <hi>weigh'd</hi>
the Cause in just and even <hi>Ballances,</hi> while a
<hi>steddy</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> Hand held the Scales, and
a free and unprejudiced Thought had adjudg'd it
<hi>necessary.</hi> It is said of our Lord Jesus, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 33.

speaks it a <hi>considerate Act,</hi> and what he saw
reason for. Then things go right in the Soul
when no <hi>Resentments</hi> are admitted into the <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
but what have first undergone the <hi>Scrutiny</hi>
of the <hi>Understanding,</hi> and thence received their
<hi>Pass.</hi> That Passion which cometh not in by this
Door, but climbeth up some other way, <hi>the
same is a Thief and a Robber,</hi> which we should
stand upon our Guard against. In a time of <hi>War</hi>
(and such a time it is in every sanctified Soul, in
a strict War between Grace and Corruption) due
care must be taken to <hi>examine</hi> all Passengers,
especially those that come arm'd, <hi>whence</hi> they
<hi>came, whither</hi> they <hi>go, who</hi> they are <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>what</hi>
they would <hi>have?</hi> Thus should it be in the well-govern'd,
well-disciplin'd Soul. Let Meekness
stand <hi>Centinel,</hi> and upon the <hi>advance</hi> of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,

and let them go no further? Such as these are
the Interrogatories which Meekness would put
to the Soul, and in answer to them would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
all that which <hi>Passion</hi> is apt to suggest, and

Job 31. 13, 14, 15. When our Hearts are at any time

Why so far transported and dispossess'd of my

so as that the inward Peace may not be disturbed
by any outward Provocation.</hi> No doubt but a Man
may express his <hi>displeasure</hi> against the <hi>Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages</hi>
of another, as much as at any time there
is occasion for, without suffering his Resentments
to <hi>recoil</hi> upon himself, and to put his own Soul
into a hurry. What need a Man to <hi>tear himself
(his Soul,</hi> so it is in the Hebrew) <hi>in his anger?</hi>
Job 18. 4. Cannot we charge home upon our
Enemies Camp, without the wilful disordering
of our own Troops? Doubtless we may, if <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
have the command, for that's a Grace which
preserves a Man <hi>Master</hi> of himself, while he
contends to be Master of another; And tho'
there may be some firing in the <hi>Out-works,</hi> yet
fortifies the <hi>Heart,</hi> the Main-Fort, the Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
against the assaults of Provocation which
do us no great harm, while they do not rob us
of our Peace, nor disturb the Rest of our Souls.
As <hi>Patience</hi> in case of Sorrow, so <hi>Meekness</hi> in

a meek man is like fire struck out of Steel, hard
to be got out, but when it is out, soon gone. The
wisdom that is from above, as it is gentle, and
so not apt to provoke; so it is <hi>easie to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
when any provocation is given, <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 17.

and hath some <hi>excuse</hi> or other ready where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to <hi>extenuate</hi> and <hi>qualifie</hi> the provocation,
which an angry man, for the exasperating and

7. 9. Angry thoughts, as other <hi>vain thoughts,</hi> may
crowd into the heart upon a sudden surprize, but
meekness will not suffer them to <hi>Iodge</hi> there,
(<hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 14.) nor let the Sun go down upon the
wrath, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26.) for if it do, there's danger
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98022:17"/>
lest it rise <hi>bloody</hi> the next morning. Anger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
becomes <hi>Malice;</hi> 'tis the wisdom of
meekness by proper applications to discuss the
<hi>humour</hi> before it comes <hi>to a head.</hi> One would
have thought when <hi>David</hi> so heinously resented
<hi>Nabal</hi>'s abuse, that nothing less than the blood
of <hi>Nabal</hi> and all his house could have quench'd
his Heat, but it was done at a cheaper rate, and
he shewed his Meekness, by yielding to the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi>
that <hi>Abigail's</hi> Present and Speech gave
him, and that with satisfaction and thankfulness;
He was not only soon pacified, but blessed her,
and blessed God for her that pacified him. God
doth not <hi>contend for ever,</hi> neither is he <hi>always
wroth;</hi> his <hi>anger endureth but a moment,</hi> Ps. 30. 5.
How unlike then are those to him whose <hi>Sword
devours for ever,</hi> and whose anger burns like the
<hi>Coals of Iuniper?</hi> But the Grace of Meekness, if
it fail of keeping the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Soul from
being broken, yet fails not to <hi>recover</hi> it presently,
and to make up the <hi>Breach,</hi> and upon the least
transport steps in with <hi>help in the time of need,
restores the Soul, puts it in frame again,</hi> and no
great harm is done. Such as these are the
<hi>Atchievements of Meekness,</hi> as it governs our
own <hi>Anger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Meekness teacheth and enableth us
<hi>patiently to bear the Anger of others,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Meekness we have especially occasion
for, in reference to our Superiors and Equals;
commonly that which provokes Anger is <hi>Anger,</hi>
as Fire kindleth Fire; now <hi>Meekness</hi> prevents
that violent Collision which forceth out these
Sparks, and <hi>softens</hi> at least one <hi>side,</hi> and so puts
a stop to a great deal of Mischief; for it is the
<hi>second blow</hi> that makes the <hi>Quarrel.</hi> Our <hi>first
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98022:17"/>
care</hi> should be to <hi>prevent</hi> the Anger of others,
by giving no offence to any, but becoming all
things to all Men, every one studying to <hi>please
his Neighbour for good to Edification,</hi> Rom. 15. 2.
and endeavouring as much as lies in us, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
our selves to the temper of all with
whom we have to do, and to make our selves
acceptable and agreeable to them: How easie
and comfortable should we make every Relation,
and every instance of Conversation, if we were
but better acquainted with this <hi>Art of Obliging.
Napthalie</hi>'s Tribe, that was famous for giving
<hi>goodly Words</hi> (Gen. 49. 21.) had the happiness of
being satisfied with <hi>Favour,</hi> Deut. 33. 23. For
every Man shall <hi>kiss his Lips that giveth a right
Answer,</hi> Pro. 24. 26. In the Conjugal Relation,
it is taken for granted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 33, 34. that the
care of the Husband is to <hi>please his Wife;</hi> and
the care of the Wife is to <hi>please her Husband;</hi> and
where there is that mutual care, comfort cannot
be wanting. Some People love to be cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grain'd,
and take a pleasure in <hi>displeasing,</hi> and
especially contrive to provoke those whom they
find passionate and easily provok'd, that (as he
that giveth his <hi>Neighbour drink, and putteth his
Bottle to him,</hi> Hab. 2. 15, 16.) they may look upon
his shame to which in his Passion he exposeth
himself, and so they <hi>make a mock at sin,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like the <hi>mad Man that casteth Fire-brands,
Arrows and Death; and saith, Am not I in sport?</hi>
But the Law of Christ forbids us to <hi>provoke one
another,</hi> Gal. 5. 26. (unless it be to <hi>love and to
good works,</hi>) and enjoyns us (as it follows there,
Chap. 6. 2.) to <hi>bear one anothers Burthens, and
so to fulfil the Law of Christ.</hi>

But because they must <hi>rise betimes,</hi> that will
<hi>please every Body,</hi> and carry their <hi>Cup even,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that will <hi>shed</hi> no offence; our next care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be so to behave our selves when others
are angry, that we may not make <hi>ill worse.</hi> And
this is one principal thing in which the <hi>Younger</hi>
must submit themselves to the <hi>Elder;</hi> nay, in
which all of us must be subject one to another,
as our Rule is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. And here Meekness is
of use either to <hi>injoyn Silence,</hi> or to <hi>indite a soft
Answer.</hi>

<hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9. to <hi>please their Masters well in
all things,</hi> not <hi>answering again;</hi> for that must
needs be <hi>displeasing:</hi> Better say <hi>nothing</hi> than
say that which is provoking. When our Hearts
are <hi>hot within us,</hi> it is good for us to <hi>keep silence,</hi>
and <hi>hold our Peace:</hi> So <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 2, 3.
and when he did speak, it was in prayer to God,
and not in reply to the <hi>wicked that were before
him.</hi>

but enflame it the more, as Wheels are heated by
a rapid Motion. One Reflection and Repartee
begets another, and the beginning of the Debate
is <hi>like the letting forth of VVater,</hi> hardly stop'd,

When a Fire is begun, it is good, if possible, to
smother it, and so prevent it's spreading. <hi>Come

<hi>Anger</hi> in the Heart is like those <hi>Books</hi> which
were stow'd up in the Cellars in the Conflagration
of <hi>London,</hi> which tho' they were extreamly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
yet never took Fire, till they took Air many

them into a <hi>Flame.</hi> When the Spirits are in a

check and suppress them, and the head-strong
Passion hardly admit the <hi>Bridle,</hi> yet afterwards
<hi>it will be no grief of Heart to us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Those who find themselves wrong'd and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griv'd,
think they may have <hi>leave to speak,</hi> but
it's better be <hi>silent</hi> than speak <hi>amiss,</hi> and make
work for <hi>Repentance.</hi> At such a time he that
holds his <hi>Tongue,</hi> holds his <hi>Peace;</hi> and if we
soberly reflect, we shall find that we have been
often the worse for our <hi>speaking,</hi> but seldom the
worse for our <hi>silence.</hi>

other ten, that the <hi>words of the Men of</hi> Judah
<hi>were fiercer than the words of the Men of</hi> Israel,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 43. When Passion is up, that God whose
Eyes are upon all the ways of Men, takes notice
who speaks <hi>fiercely,</hi> and sets a <hi>mark</hi> upon them.</p>
                     <p>The good effect of a soft Answer, and the ill
consequents of a peevish one, are observable in
the Stories of <hi>Gideon</hi> and <hi>Iophthah:</hi> Both of
them in the day of their Triumphs over the
Enemies of <hi>Israel,</hi> were causelesly quarrel'd with
by the <hi>Ephraimites</hi> (an angry sort of People it
seems<note n="*" place="margin">Hence we read of the <hi>Envy of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, <hi>ija.</hi> 11. 13.</note>) who took it very heinously when the
danger was past, and the Victory was won, that
they had not been call'd upon to engage in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98022:20"/>
Battle; <hi>Gideon</hi> pacified them with a soft An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>Iudg. 8. 2. What have I done now in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of you?</hi> magnifying their Atchievements,
and lessening his own, speaking honourably of
them, and meanly of himself; <hi>Is not the glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Grapes of</hi> Ephraim, <hi>better than the
Vintage of</hi> Abiezar? In which Reply it's hard
to say whether there was more of <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
And the effect was very good; the <hi>Ephrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>
were pleased, their Anger turned away, a
Civil War prevented; and no Body could think
the worse of <hi>Gideon</hi> for his Mildness and Self-denial;
but on the contrary, that he won more
true Honour, by this Victory over his own Passion,
than he did by his Victory over all the Host
of <hi>Midian;</hi> for he that <hi>hath Rule over his own
Spirit, is better than the Mighty,</hi> Pro. 16. 32. The
Angel of the Lord had pronounced him a <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Man of Valour,</hi> Judg. 6. 12. and this his tame
submission did not at all derogate from that
part of his Character. But <hi>Iephthah</hi> (who by
many instances appears to be a Man of a rough
and hasty Spirit, tho' enroll'd among the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 32. for all good People
are not alike happy in their Temper.) When the
<hi>Ephraimites</hi> in like manner pick a Quarrel with
him, he rallies them, upbraids them with their

thousand <hi>Ephraimites,</hi> v. 6. All which had been
haply prevented if <hi>Iephthah</hi> had had but half
as much <hi>meekness</hi> in his heart, as he had <hi>reason</hi>
on his side.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>soft Answer</hi> is the Dictate and Dialect of
that Wisdom which is from above, which is
<hi>peaceable, gentle, and easie to be intreated:</hi> And to
recommend it to us, we have the pattern of <hi>good
men,</hi> as that of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Carriage to <hi>Esau,</hi> tho'
a <hi>Brother offended,</hi> who is so hard to be won, yet
as he had prevail'd with God by Faith and Prayer,
so he prevail'd with his Brother by Meekness
and Humility: We have also the Pattern of <hi>good
Angels,</hi> who even then when a rebuke was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
yet durst not turn it into a railing <hi>Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
durst not give any reviling Language, no
not to the Devil himself, but refer'd the matter
to God, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee,</hi> as that passage,
<hi>Iude</hi> ver. 9. is commonly understood. Nay,
we have the Pattern of a <hi>good God,</hi> who tho'
he could <hi>plead against us with his great Power,</hi>
yet gives soft Answers: witness his dealing with
<hi>Cain,</hi> when he was wroth and his countenance
fallen, reasoning the case with him, <hi>Gen. 4. 6, 7.
Why art thou wroth—If thou dost well, shalt
not thou be accepted?</hi> With <hi>Ionah</hi> likewise, when
he was so discontented, <hi>Ion. 4. 4, 9. Dost thou well
to be angry?</hi> This is represented in the Parable
of the Prodigal Son, by the carriage of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towards the Elder Brother that was so
high, and humorsom, so <hi>angry that he would not
come in.</hi> The Father did not say, Let him stay
out then, but he <hi>came</hi> himself <hi>and intreated him,</hi>
(when he might have interposed his Authority
and commanded him) and said, <hi>Son, thou art
ever with me,</hi> Luke 15. 28, 31. When a passion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98022:21"/>
Parley is begun, there is a Plague broke out,
the meek Man like <hi>Aaron</hi> takes his Censer with
the Incense of a <hi>soft Answer,</hi> steps in seasonably
and stays the Plague.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>soft Answer,</hi> in case we have committed
a <hi>Fault</hi> (tho' perhaps not culpable to that degree
that we are charged with) must be <hi>Penitent,
Humble</hi> and <hi>Submissive,</hi> and we must be ready to
acknowledge our Error, and not stand in it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon our own Vindication, but rather ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
than excuse it, rather condemn than justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our selves: It will be a good evidence of our
<hi>Repentance</hi> towards God, to humble our selves
to our Brethren, whom we have offended, as it
will be also a good evidence of our being <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given</hi>
of God if we be ready to <hi>sorgive</hi> those
that have offended us: And such <hi>yielding paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
great Offences.</hi> Meekness teacheth us as
oft as we trespass against our Brother to turn
again and say, I <hi>repent,</hi> Luke 17. 4. An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
in case of a <hi>wilful</hi> Affront is
perhaps as necessary to pardon, as (we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say) <hi>Restitution</hi> is in case of <hi>wrong:</hi>—And so
much for the opening of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
which yet will receive further light from
what follows.</p>
                     <p>[2.] We must <hi>be of a quiet Spirit.</hi> Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the evenness, the composure, and the rest
of the Soul, which speaks both the nature and
the excellency of the Grace of Meekness. The
greatest Comfort and Happiness of Man is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
set forth by <hi>Quietness.</hi> That <hi>Peace</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
which Christ hath left for a Legacy to
his Disciples, that present <hi>Sabbatism</hi> of the Soul,
which is an earnest of the Rest that remains for
the People of God, is call'd, <hi>Quietness and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98022:22"/>
for ever,</hi> and is promised, as the <hi>effect
of Righteousness,</hi> Isa. 32. 17. and it follows, <hi>v. 18.
My People shall dwell in quiet resting-places.</hi> So
graciously hath God been pleased to <hi>twist Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests</hi>
with us, as to enjoyn the same thing under
the Notion of a <hi>Duty,</hi> which he proposeth
and promiseth under the Notion of a <hi>Priviledge.</hi>
Justly may we say, that we serve a good Master,
whose Yoke is <hi>easie,</hi> Matth. 11. 30. 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
not only easie, but <hi>sweet,</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> (so the
word signifies) not only tolerable, but amiable
and acceptable: <hi>Wisdom's ways</hi> are not only
pleasant, but <hi>pleasantness</hi> it self, and all her
<hi>paths are Peace,</hi> Pro. 3. 17. It is the Character of
the Lord's People both in respect of <hi>Holiness</hi> and
<hi>Happiness,</hi> that (however they be branded as the
<hi>Troublers of</hi> Israel) they are the <hi>Quiet in the
Land,</hi> Psal. 35. 20. If every Saint be made a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<hi>Prince</hi> (Rev. 1. 6.) having a <hi>Dignity</hi> above
others, and a <hi>Dominion</hi> over himself, surely he
is like that <hi>Seraiah,</hi> Jer. 51. 59. a <hi>quiet Prince.</hi> It
is a <hi>Reign</hi> with Christ, the transcendent <hi>Solomon,</hi>
under the influence of whose Golden Scepter
there is abundance of Peace <hi>as long as the Moon
endures,</hi> yea, and longer, <hi>for of the increase of
his Government and Peace, there shall be no end.
Quietness</hi> is in the Text recommended to us as a
<hi>Grace,</hi> which we should be endued with, and as
a <hi>Duty</hi> which we should practise. In the midst
of all the Affronts and Injuries that are, or can
be offer'd us, we must keep our <hi>Spirits sedate,</hi>
and undisturbed, and evidence by a <hi>calm</hi> and
<hi>even,</hi> and <hi>regular behaviour,</hi> that they are so.
This is <hi>Quietness.</hi> Our Saviour hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Blessing of Adoption upon the Peace-makers,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 9. <gap reason="foreign">

120. 7. in opposition (such an opposition as
Meekness is capable of) to those that <hi>delight in
War,</hi> Psal. 68. 30. Now if Charity be for <hi>Peace-making,</hi>
Surely this <hi>Charity begins at home</hi> and is
for making Peace there in the first place; Peace
in our own Souls, is some conformity to the
example of the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> who tho' he doth
not always give Peace on this Earth, yet ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<hi>makes Peace in his own high place,</hi> Job 25.

for <hi>making</hi> in Scripture notes the bent and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

given to Lying; so to make Peace, is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to Peace; to have a disposition in the
Soul ready to <hi>command the Peace,</hi> when there is
at any time, any kind of disturbance. In a word:
<hi>Quietness of Spirit</hi> is the Soul's <hi>stillness,</hi> and
silence, from intending Provocation to, or
<hi>resenting</hi> Provocatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we have to do.</p>
                     <p>The word hath something in it of a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,
which we would not <hi>chase,</hi> but fairly
<hi>prosecute,</hi> for the Illustration of the Grace of
Meekness.</p>
                     <p>1. We must be quiet as the <hi>Air is quiet from
Winds.</hi> Disorderly Passions are like <hi>stormy Winds</hi>
in the Soul, they toss and hurry it, and often
split, or strand, or overset it; they move it <hi>as
the Trees of the Wood are mov'd with the Wind;</hi>
'tis the Prophets comparison, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. 2. and is an
apt Emblem of a Man in Passion. Now Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
restrains these Winds, saith to them, <hi>Peace,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98022:23"/>
be still,</hi> and so preserves a calm in the Soul, and
makes it conformable to him, who hath the
<hi>Winds in his Fists,</hi> and is herein to be praised, that
even the stormy Winds <hi>fulfil his Word. A brisk
Gale</hi> is often useful, especially to the <hi>Ships of
Desire,</hi> as the Hebrew phrase is, <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 26. so
there should be in the Soul such a warmth and
vigor as will help to speed us to the desired
Harbour. It is not well to lye <hi>Wind-bound</hi> in
dulness and indifferency. But <hi>Tempests</hi> are
perillous, yea, tho' the Wind be in the right
Point; so are strong Passions, even in good Men,
they both hinder the Voyage, and <hi>hazzard</hi> the
Ship: Such a <hi>Quickness</hi> as consists with <hi>Quietness,</hi>
is what we should all labour after, and Meekness
will contribute very much towards it, it will si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the Noise, controul the Force, moderate
the <hi>Impetus,</hi> and correct all undue and disorderly
Transports.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>What manner</hi> of Grace is this, that
<hi>even the VVinds and the Seas</hi> obey it? If we will
but use the Authority which God hath given us
over our own Hearts, we may keep the <hi>winds</hi> of

We make our Voyage among Rocks and
Quick-sands, but if the Weather be <hi>calm,</hi> we can
the better steer so as to avoid them, and by a due
care and temper hit the mean between extreams,
whereas he that suffers these <hi>VVinds</hi> of Passion
to get head, and spreads a <hi>large</hi> Sail before them,
while he shuns one Rock, splits upon another,
and is in danger of being <hi>drown'd in destruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion

2. We must be quiet <hi>as the Sea is quiet
from VVaves.</hi> The <hi>wicked</hi> (whose sin and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both lye in the unruliness of their own
Souls, and the Violence and Disorder of their
own Passions, which perhaps will not be the
least of their eternal Torments) are compared
<hi>to the troubled Sea, when it cannot rest, whose
Waters cast forth Mire and Dirt,</hi> Isa. 57. 20. that
is, they are uneasie to themselves, and to all
about them, <hi>raging Waves of the Sea</hi> (so they
are described, <hi>Iude</hi> 13.) <hi>foaming out their own
shame;</hi> their <hi>hard Speeches</hi> which they speak
against God, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and <hi>Dignities,</hi> ver. 8. and
<hi>things which they know not,</hi> ver. 10. their <hi>great
swelling words,</hi> ver. 16. and <hi>mockings,</hi> ver. 18.
these are the <hi>shame</hi> they <hi>foam out.</hi> Now Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is a Grace of the Spirit, that <hi>moves upon
the face of the VVaters</hi> and quiets them, smooths
the ruffled Sea, and stills the Noise of it, ('tis
now <hi>mare pacificum)</hi> it casts forth none of the
Mire and Dirt of Passion. The Waves mount not
<hi>up to the Heaven</hi> in Proud and Vain-glorious
Boastings; go not <hi>down to the depths</hi> to scrape
up vile and scurrilous Language; no <hi>reeling to
and fro,</hi> as Men overcome with Drink, or with
their own Passion, which is all one, (for if <hi>VVine</hi>
be a <hi>mocker,</hi> and <hi>strong Drink raging,</hi> Pro. 20. 1.
Anger is no less so,) none of that transport which
brings them <hi>to their wits end;</hi> I refer to the
Psalmist's description of a Storm, Ps. 107. 26, 27.
but as it follows there, v. 30. <hi>They are glad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are quiet, so he bringeth them to their
desir'd Haven.</hi> This calmness and evenness of
Spirit makes our passage over the Sea of this
World safe and pleasant, quick and speedy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the desired Harbour, and is amiable and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98022:24"/>
exemplary in the Eyes of others, such a <hi>path</hi>
doth the meek and quiet Christian make to
<hi>shine after him. One would think the deep to be
hoary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. We must be quiet as the <hi>Land is quiet from
VVar.</hi> It was the observable Felicity of <hi>Asa</hi>'s
Reign, that in his days <hi>the Land was quiet,</hi> 2 Chr.
14. 1, 5. In the preceding Reigns there was <hi>no
peace to him that went out, or to him that came
in,</hi> whether outward-bound or home-wards bound,
they were exposed to <hi>great vexations,</hi> ch. 15. 5.
but now the rumors and allarms of War were
still'd, and the people <hi>deliver'd from the noise of
Archers at the place of drawing VVaters,</hi> as
when the Land had rest in <hi>Deborah</hi>'s time, <hi>Iud.</hi>
5. 11. Such a quietness there should be in the
Soul, and such a quietness there will be where
Meekness sways the Scepter. A Soul enflamed
with Wrath and Passion upon all occasions is like
a Kingdom embroil'd in War, in a Civil War,
subject to continual Frights, and Losses, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils,
Deaths and Terrors in their most horrid
Shapes, walk triumphantly, Sleeps disturb'd,
Families broken, Friends suspected, Enemies
fear'd, Laws silenced, Commerce ruin'd, Business
neglected, Cities wasted, such heaps upon heaps,
doth ungovern'd Anger lay when it is let loose in
the Soul. <hi>Ius<expan>
                              <am>

makes these Wars to cease, <hi>breaks the Bow,
cuts the Spear,</hi> sheaths the Sword, and in the
midst of a Contentious World preserves the
Soul from being the Seat of War, and makes
Peace in those Borders. The rest of the Soul
is not disturb'd, it's Comforts not plunder'd, it's
Government not disorder'd, the Laws of Religion
and Reason rule, and not the Sword: The Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Duties
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98022:24"/>
are not interrupted, neither its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, nor its Communion with the
Saints intercepted, no <hi>breaking in</hi> of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
no <hi>going out</hi> of Corruption, no <hi>complaining
in the Streets,</hi> no occasion given, no occasion
taken to complain. <hi>Happy is the Soul that is in
such a case,</hi> Psal. 144. 14, 15. <hi>The words of such
wise men are heard in quiet, more than the cry of
him that ruleth among Fools, and this wisdom is
better than weapons of war,</hi> Eccl. 9. 17, 18. This
is the <hi>Quietness</hi> we should every one of us <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>
after, and it is what we might attain to, if
we would but more support and exercise the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of our <hi>Graces</hi> (which are as the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners</hi>
of the <hi>Peace)</hi> and guide and controul the
power of our Passions (which are as the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners</hi>
of <hi>Array)</hi> in our Souls.</p>
                     <p>4. We must be quiet <hi>as the Child is quiet after
weaning.</hi> It is the Psalmist's comparison, <hi>Psal.
131. 2. I have behaved</hi> (or rather, I have <hi>composed,</hi>
so <hi>Ainsworth</hi> reads it) <hi>and quieted my Self, (my
Soul,</hi> Heb. for our Souls are our selves, and our
principal care must be concerning them) <hi>as a
Child that is weaned of his Mother, my Soul is
even as a weaned Child.</hi> A Child while it is <hi>in
the weaning</hi> perhaps is a little cross, and froward,
and troublesom for a time, but when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
wean'd, how quickly doth it forget the
Breast, and accommodate its self to its new way
of feeding; Thus a quiet Soul, if provok'd by
the denial or loss of some Creature-Comfort or
Delight, that hath been dear, quiets it self, and
doth not fret at it, nor perplex it self with anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cares, how to live without it, but compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it self to <hi>make the best of that which is.</hi> If
Wormwood be put upon the Breasts, which we
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98022:25"/>
have call'd the Breasts of our Consolation, it is
but to make us indifferent to them, and we must
set our selves to answer that Intention, and sit
loose to them accordingly. And this Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
to the Delights of Sense, is (like the
weaning of a Child) a good step taken towards
the <hi>perfect Man,</hi> the <hi>measure of the Stature of
the fulness of Christ.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Yet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appear betimes. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di zelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulum qui intuebatur pallidus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maro aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctucollacta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum suum.

is free from all the uneasiness and disquietment
of Care, and Fear, and Envy, and Anger, and
Revenge: How undisturbed are its Sleeps, and
even then its Dreams pleasant and smiling? How
easie its Days? How quiet its Nights? If put
into a little pett now and then, how soon is it
over, the Provocation forgiven, the Sense of it
forgotten, and both bury'd in an innocent Kiss?
Thus, if ever we would enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven, must we be <hi>converted</hi> from Pride,

                     <head>CHAP. II. The Excellency of Meekness and
Quietness of Spirit.</head>
                     <p>THE very opening of this <hi>Cause,</hi> one would
think, were enough to <hi>carry</hi> it, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of the <hi>Nature of Meekness and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
should suffice to <hi>recommend</hi> it to us: Such
an amiable Sweetness doth there appear in it,
upon the very first View; if we look upon this
<hi>Beauty,</hi> we cannot but be <hi>enamour'd</hi> with it. But
because of the Opposition that there is in our
corrupt Hearts to this, as to other the Graces of
the Holy Spirit, I shall endeavour more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to shew the <hi>Excellency</hi> of it, that we may
be brought, if possible, to be in <hi>love with it,</hi>
and to submit our Souls to the <hi>charming Power</hi>
of it.</p>
                     <p>It is said, <hi>Pro.</hi> 17. 27. That <hi>a Man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

(so the <hi>Chetib,</hi> though the <hi>Keri,</hi> which our

                        <hi>frigidus Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu,</hi>
so <hi>Tremellius,</hi> he is <hi>of a cool Spirit;</hi> put
them together, and it teacheth us, <hi>That a cool
Spirit is an excellent Spirit,</hi> and he is <hi>a Man of
understanding</hi> that is acted and govern'd by such
a Spirit. The Text tells us (what need we more?)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98022:26"/>
that it <hi>in the sight of God of great price,</hi> and
we may be sure that's precious indeed which is
so in God's sight; that's good, very good which
he pronounceth so, for his Judgment is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Truth, and <hi>sooner or later he will bring
all the World to be of his Mind;</hi> for as he hath
decided it, so shall our Doom be, and he will
be <hi>justified when he speaketh, and clear when he
judgeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The excellency of a meek and quiet Spirit,
will appear, if we consider the <hi>Credit</hi> of it,
and the <hi>Comfort</hi> of it, the present <hi>Profit</hi> there
is by it, and the <hi>Preparedness</hi> there is in it, for
something further.</p>
                     <p>[1.] Consider how <hi>Creditable</hi> a meek and quiet
Spirit is. Credit and Reputation is a thing
which most People are very sensibly touch'd with
the Ambition of, tho' few consider aright either
what it is, or what is the right way of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and particularly it is little believed what
a great deal of true honour there is in the Grace
of <hi>Meekness,</hi> and what a sure and ready way,
mild and quiet Souls take to gain the <hi>good word</hi>
of their Master, and of all their Fellow-Servants
that love our Master, and are like
him.</p>
                     <p>Let us see what <hi>Credit</hi> there is in <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. There is in it <hi>the credit of a Victory.</hi> What
a great Figure do the Names of high and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Conquerors make in the Records of Fame?
How is their <hi>Conduct,</hi> their <hi>Valor,</hi> and their <hi>Success</hi>
more than either cry'd up and celebrated? But
if we will believe the Word of Truth, and pass
a Judgment upon things according to the Rules
of that, <hi>He that is slow to anger is better than
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98022:26"/>
the Mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he
that taketh a City,</hi> Pro. 16. 32. Behold a greater
than <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Caesar</hi> is here: The former of
which some think lost more true Honour by
yielding to his own ungovern'd Anger, than he
got by all his Conquests. No triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
so <hi>easie,</hi> so <hi>safe,</hi> so truly <hi>glorious,</hi> as that in
which the meek and quiet Soul <hi>rides</hi> over all the
Provocations of an injurious World, with a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>unconcernedness:</hi> No train so splendid, so
noble, as that train of Comforts and Graces,
which attend this Chariot. The Conquest of an
unruly Passion is more honourable, than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of an unruly People, for it requires more
true Conduct: It is easier to kill an Enemy
without us, which may be done at a <hi>Blow,</hi> than
to Chain up and govern an Enemy within us
which requires a <hi>constant</hi> even steddy Hand, and
a <hi>long</hi> and regular Management. It was more
the Honour of <hi>David</hi> to yield himself <hi>conquer'd</hi>
by <hi>Abigail</hi>'s Perswasions, than to have made
himself a <hi>Conqueror</hi> over <hi>Nabal</hi> and all his
House. A <hi>rational</hi> Victory must needs be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
more honourable to a rational Creature
than a <hi>brutal</hi> one. This is a cheap, safe and
unbloody Conquest that doth no Body any harm,
no Lives, no Treasures sacrificed to it, the <hi>Glory</hi>
of these Triumphs, not stain'd as others use to be
with <hi>Funerals: Every Battle of the Warrior</hi>
(saith the Prophet, Isa. 9. 5.) <hi>is with confused noise,
and Garments roll'd in Blood, but this shall be
with burning, even by the Spirit of the Lord of
Hosts;</hi> as a <hi>Spirit of Iudgment,</hi> and a <hi>Spirit of
Burning.</hi> Nay, in meek and quiet suffering, we
are <hi>more than Conquerors, thro' Christ that loved
us,</hi> Rom. 8. 37. Conquerors <hi>with little loss;</hi> we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98022:27"/>
lose nothing but the gratifying of a base Lust,
Conquerors <hi>with great gain,</hi> the Spoils we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
are very rich, the Favour of God, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the Spirit, the Foretasts of everlasting
Pleasures, these are <hi>more glorious and excellent
than the Mountains of Prey. We are more than
Conquerors;</hi> that is, <hi>Triumphers,</hi> we live a
Life of Victory, every day a day of Triumph
in the meek and quiet Soul.</p>
                     <p>Meekness is a Victory over <hi>our Selves,</hi> and the
Rebellious Lusts in our own Bosoms; 'tis the
quieting of <hi>intestine Broils,</hi> the stilling of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
at Home, which is oftentimes more
hard to do, than to resist a foreign <hi>Invasion.</hi> It
is an effectual Victory over <hi>those that injure us,</hi>
and make themselves Enemies to us, and is often
a means of winning their Hearts. The Law
of Meekness is, <hi>If thine Enemy hung<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>, Propina illi,</hi> not only
<hi>give him drink,</hi> (which is an Act of Charity) but
<hi>drink to him,</hi> in token of Friendship, and true
Love, and Reconciliation, and <hi>in so doing thou
shalt heap Coals of Fire upon his Head,</hi> not to
<hi>consume</hi> him, but to <hi>melt</hi> and <hi>mollifie</hi> him, that
he may be cast into a new mould; and thus while
the angry and revengeful Man, that will bear
down all before him with a high hand is <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of evil,</hi> the patient and forgiving <hi>overcome
evil with good,</hi> Rom. 12. 20, 21. and forasmuch as
their <hi>ways please the Lord,</hi> he maketh even their
<hi>Enemies to be at Peace</hi> with them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16. 7.
Nay, Meekness is a Victory over <hi>Satan</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Enemy of all: What Conquest can sound
more great than that? It is written for Caution
to us all, and it reflects honour upon those who
through Grace overcome, that <hi>we wrestle not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98022:27"/>
against Flesh and Blood, but against Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Powers, and the Rulers of the darkness
of this World,</hi> Eph. 6. 12. The magnifying of the
Adversary magnifies the Victory over him; such
as these are the meek Man's vanquish'd Enemies,
the spoils of these are the Trophies of his Victory.<note place="margin">

It is the design of the <hi>Devil,</hi> that great <hi>Deceiver</hi>
and <hi>Destroyer</hi> of Souls, that is <hi>baffled,</hi> 'tis his
attempt that is defeated, his assault that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd
by our Meekness and Quietness. Our
Lord Jesus was more admired for his controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and commanding the <hi>unclean Spirits,</hi> than
for any other of the Cures he wrought: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
Passions are <hi>unclean Spirits,</hi> Legions of
which some Souls are possess'd with, and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
outragious work they make: The Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
like that miserable Creature, <hi>(Mark</hi> 5.
3, 4, 5. that <hi>cry'd and cut himself,</hi> or that, <hi>Mark</hi>
9. 22. who was so often <hi>cast into the Fire, and
into the Waters.</hi> The meek and quiet Soul is
through Grace a Conqueror over these Enemies,
their fiery darts are quenched by the shield of
Faith, Satan is in some measure trodden under
his Feet, and the Victory will be compleat
shortly, when <hi>he that overcometh shall sit down
with Christ upon his Throne, even as he overcame
and is set down with the Father upon his Throne;</hi>
where he still appears in the Emblem of his
<hi>Meekness,</hi> a <hi>Lamb as it had been slain,</hi> Rev. 5. 6.
And upon Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> at the Head of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Hosts, he appears also as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> Rev. 14. 1.
Such is the Honour that Meekness hath in those
higher Regions.</p>
                     <p>2. There is in it, the <hi>Credit of a Beauty.</hi> The
<hi>Beauty</hi> of a thing consists in the Symmetry,
Harmony and Agreeableness of all the Parts:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98022:28"/>
Now what is Meekness, but the Souls <hi>Agreement
with it self?</hi> 'Tis the joynt Concurrence of all
the Affections to the universal Peace and Quiet of
the Soul, every one regularly acting in its own
Place and Order, and so contributing to the
<hi>common good.</hi> Next to the <hi>Beauty of Holiness,</hi>
which is the Souls Agreement with <hi>God,</hi> is the
<hi>Beauty of Meekness,</hi> which is the Soul's Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with <hi>it Self.</hi> Behold <hi>how good and how
pleasant</hi> a thing it is, for the Powers of the Soul
thus to dwell together in Unity, the <hi>Reason</hi>
knowing how to <hi>Rule,</hi> and the <hi>Affections</hi> at the
same time knowing how to <hi>Obey.</hi> Exorbitant
<hi>Passion</hi> is a Discord in the Soul: It is like a
Tumor in the Face, which spoils the Beauty of
it: Meekness scatters the Humor, binds
down the swelling, and so <hi>prevents</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi>
and <hi>preserves</hi> the <hi>Beauty.</hi> This is
one instance of the <hi>comliness</hi> of Grace, thro'
<hi>my comliness</hi> (saith God to <hi>Israel,</hi> Ezek. 16. 14.)
<hi>which I had put upon thee.</hi> It puts a charming
Loveliness and Amiableness upon the Soul,
which renders it acceptable to all that know
what true Worth and Beauty is. <hi>He that in
Righteousness, and Peace, and Ioy in the Holy
Ghost:</hi> that is, in Christian Meekness and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Spirit, <hi>serveth Christ, is acceptable to
God and approved of Men,</hi> Rom. 14. 17, 18. and
to whom else can we wish to recommend
our selves?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> (a very competent Judge of Beauty)
hath determined, That it is a Man's <hi>Wisdom</hi>
that makes <hi>his Face to shine,</hi> Eccl. 8. 1. and
doubtless the <hi>Meekness of Wisdom,</hi> contributes
as much as any one Branch of it to this <hi>Luster.</hi>
We read in Scripture of three, whose <hi>Faces</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:98022:28"/>
shone remarkably, and they were all three emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for <hi>Meekness.</hi> The Face of <hi>Moses</hi> shone,
Exod. 34. 30. and he was the meekest of all the
Men on Earth. The Face of <hi>Stephen</hi> shone,
<hi>Acts</hi> 6. 15. and he it was, who in the midst of
a shower of Stones, so meekly submitted, and
prayed for his Persecutors. The Face of our
<hi>Lord Iesus</hi> shone in his <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> and
he was the great Pattern of Meekness. It is
a sweet and pleasing Air, which this Grace
puts npon the Countenance, while it keeps the
Soul in <hi>tune,</hi> and frees it from those jarring ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured
<hi>Discords,</hi> which are the certain effect
of an ungovern'd Passion.</p>
                     <p>3. There is in it the <hi>Credit of an Ornament.</hi>
The Text speaks of it, as an <hi>Adorning,</hi> much
more excellent and valuable than <hi>Gold,</hi> or
<hi>Pearls,</hi> or the most <hi>costly Array,</hi> much more
recommending than all the Bravery of <hi>the
Daughters of Zion.</hi> It is an adorning to <hi>the
Soul,</hi> the principal, the immortal part of the
Man. That <hi>outward</hi> adorning doth but deck,
and beautifie the Body, which at the best, is but
a <hi>Sister to the Worms,</hi> and will ere long be a
<hi>Feast</hi> for them, but this is the Ornament of the
Soul, by which we are ally'd to the invisible
World. 'Tis an adorning which recommends us
to God, which is in his sight of <hi>great price;</hi>
so the Text saith, and in that saith <hi>enough</hi> to
its praise. <hi>Ornaments</hi> go by <hi>Estimation:</hi> now
we may be sure, that the Judgment of God
is right and unerring. Every thing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
as it is <hi>with God:</hi> Those are righteous
indeed,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 6.</note>, that are <hi>righteous before God;</hi> and that
is an Ornament indeed, which he calls and
counts so. It is an Ornament of God's own
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98022:29"/>
                        <hi>making;</hi> Is the Soul thus deck'd? 'Tis he that
hath deck'd it: <hi>By his Spirit he hath garnished
the Heavens,</hi> Job 26. 13. and by the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath he <hi>garnished</hi> the meek and quiet Soul. It is
an Ornament of his <hi>accepting,</hi> (it must needs be
so, if it be of his own working) for to him
that hath this Ornament, more adorning shall
be given. He hath promised, <hi>Psal.</hi> 149. 4. that
he will <hi>beautifie the meek with Salvation;</hi> and if
the Garaments of <hi>Salvation</hi> will not <hi>beautifie,</hi>
what will? The Robes of Glory will be the
everlasting Ornament of the meek and quiet
Spirits. This Meekness is an <hi>Ornament</hi> which
(like the <hi>Israelites</hi> Cloths in the Wilderness)
never waxeth old, nor will ever go out of
fashion, while right Reason and Religion have
any place in the World: All wise and good
People will reckon those <hi>best drest,</hi> that put on
the Lord Jesus Christ, and walk with him in
the <hi>white</hi> of Meekness and Innocence. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
in all his Glory was not arrayed like one
of these <hi>Lillies of the Vallies,</hi> tho' <hi>Lillies
among Thorns.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same Ornament, which in the Text is
recommended to Wives, is by the same Apostle
recommended to us all, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 5. Yea all of you
be subject one to another,</hi> that explains what
Meekness is; it is that mutual yielding which
we owe one to another, for edification, and in
the <hi>fear of God, (Eph</hi> 5. 21.) This seems to be a
hard Saying, how shall we digest it? an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable

When our Lord Jesus is described <hi>in his Majesty,

Psal. 45. 4. The Courage of those who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
this <hi>great red Dragon</hi> of Wrath and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
by meek and patient suffering, and by
<hi>not loving their Lives unto the Death,</hi> Rev. 12. 11.

crowned with Glory, and Honour, and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
when those that <hi>caused their terror in the
Land of the Living, fall ingloriously,</hi> and <hi>bear
their shame with them that go down to the Pit,</hi>
Ezek. 32. 24.</p>
                     <p>5. The Credit of a <hi>Conformity to the best
Patterns.</hi> The Resemblance of those that are
confessedly Excellent and Glorious, hath in it an
Excellency and Glory. To be meek, is to be
like the <hi>greatest Saints;</hi> the Elders that obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a good Report, and were of Renown in their
Generation. 'Tis to be like the <hi>greatest Angels,</hi>
whose Meekness in their Converse with, and
Ministration to the Saints, is very observable in
the Scriptures; nay, it is to be like the <hi>Great
God himself,</hi> whose Goodness is his Glory, (who
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98022:30"/>
is <hi>Deus Optimus,</hi> and therefore <hi>Maximus)</hi> who
is slow to Anger, and in whom <hi>Fury is not,</hi> Isa.

                     <p>Let the true Honour that attends this Grace
of Meekness, recommend it to us: It is one
of those things that are <hi>Honest,</hi> and <hi>Pure,</hi>
and <hi>Lovely,</hi> and <hi>of good Report;</hi> A Vertue that
hath a <hi>Praise</hi> attending it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. A Praise,
perhaps not of the most of Men, but of <hi>God,
Rom.</hi> 2. 29. It is the certain way to get and keep,
if not a <hi>great</hi> Name, yet a <hi>good</hi> Name. Such
as is <hi>better than precious Ointment.</hi> Though
there be those that trample upon the meek of
the Earth, and look upon them as <hi>Michal</hi> upon
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98022:31"/>
                        <hi>David</hi> despising them in their Hearts, yet <hi>if
this is to be vile,</hi> let us be <hi>yet more vile,</hi> and <hi>base
in our own sight,</hi> and we shall find (as <hi>David</hi>
argues there) that there are those of whom we
shall be <hi>had in honour,</hi> sooner or later, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
6. 22. for the Word of Christ shall not fall to

                     </p>
                     <p>[2.] Consider how <hi>comfortable a meek and
quiet Spirit is.</hi> Inward <hi>Comfort</hi> is a desirable
<hi>good,</hi> which hath more in it of <hi>reality,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
less upon <hi>Opinion,</hi> than that of <hi>Credit:</hi>
And this is that which Meekness and Quietness
of Spirit, hath such a direct tendency to, nay
which it carries along with it. What is true
Comfort and Pleasure, but a <hi>Quietness</hi> in our
own Bosom? Those are most easie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that are so to <hi>all about them,</hi> while they
that are a burthen and a Terror to others, will
not be much otherwise to themselves. He that
would lead a quiet, must lead a peaceable Life,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. The surest way to find Rest <hi>to our
Souls,</hi> is <hi>to learn of him who is meek and lowly
in heart,</hi> Mat. 11. 29. Let but <hi>our moderation be
known unto all Men; And the Peace of God
which passeth all understanding, will keep our Hearts
and Minds,</hi> Phil. 4. 5, 7. <hi>Quietness</hi> is the thing
which even the busie, noisie part of the World
pretend to desire and pursue; They <hi>will be quiet,</hi>
yea, that they will, or they'l know why, they
will not endure the least disturbance of their
Quietness. But verily they go a mad way to
work, in pursuit of quietness; greatly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
themselves inwardly, and put their Souls
into a continual hurry, only to prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
some small outward Disquietment from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98022:31"/>
others. But he that is meek, finds a sweeter,
safer Quietness, and much greater Comfort than
that which they in vain pursue. <hi>Great Peace
have they that love this Law of Love,</hi> for <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shall offend them,</hi> (Psal. 119. 165.) What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Offence</hi> is intended, it is not so <hi>interpreted,</hi>
and by that means the <hi>Peace</hi> is preserved. If
there be a <hi>Heaven</hi> any where upon Earth, it is in
the meek and quiet Soul, that Acts, and Breaths
above that lower Region, which is infested with
Storms and Tempests, the Harmony of whose
Faculties, is like the <hi>Musick</hi> of the <hi>Spheres</hi> they
talk of, a <hi>perpetual Melody. Mercy and Truth
are met together, Righteousness and Peace have
kissed each other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A meek and quiet Christian must needs live
very comfortably, for he <hi>enjoys Himself,</hi> he <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
his Friends,</hi> he <hi>enjoys his God,</hi> and he puts
it out of the reach of his Enemies to <hi>disturb</hi>
him in these Enjoyments.</p>
                     <p>1. He <hi>enjoys Himself.</hi> Meekness is very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ally'd to that <hi>Patience</hi> which our Lord Jesus
prescribes to us, as necessary to the keeping of
the <hi>Possession</hi> of our own Souls, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 19.
How Calm are the Thoughts, how Serene are the
Affections, how Rational the Prospects, and how

in his Heart by Faith, hath in him that
<hi>Peace,</hi> which the World can neither give, nor

(Iedidijah</hi>'s, one of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Names, who was

of the Meek is quiet, and sweet, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed:
Those that by Innocency and Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
make themselves the Sheep of Christ,
shall be made to lye down in the <hi>green Pastures,</hi>
Psal. 23. 2. <hi>That which would break an angry
Man's Heart, will not break a meek Man's Sleep.</hi>
It is promised, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 26. That <hi>the meek shall
eat and be satisfied.</hi> He hath what sweetness is
to be had in his Common-Comforts, whilst the
angry Man either cannot eat, his Stomach's too
full, and too high, as <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 21. 4. or
eats and is not satisfied, unless he can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged,
as <hi>Haman,</hi> Esth. 5. 12, 13. <hi>All this avails

                     <p>It is spoken of as the Happiness of the Meek,

Peace like a River, and this such as they have
a Heart to <hi>delight themselves</hi> in, <hi>sat lucis intus,</hi>
as <hi>Oecolumpadius</hi> said, their Souls are a <hi>Goshen</hi>
in the midst of the <hi>Aegypt</hi> of this World, they
have <hi>Light in their Dwelling,</hi> when <hi>Clouds and
Darkness are round about them:</hi> This is the <hi>joy
which a stranger doth not intermeddle with.</hi> We
may certainly have (and we would do well to
consider it) less inward disturbance, and more
true ease and satisfaction in <hi>forgiving</hi> twenty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
than in <hi>avenging</hi> one. No doubt <hi>Abigail</hi>
intended more than she express'd, when to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
<hi>David,</hi> and to perswade him to pass by the
Affront which <hi>Nabal</hi> had given him, she pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
suggested, that <hi>hereafter this shall be no

                        <hi>nor offence of Heart.</hi>—Not
only so, but it would be very sweet, and easie,
and comfortable in the reflection. Such a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing</hi>
is it, especially in a Suffering-day, to have
the Testimony of Conscience that in <hi>simplicity,</hi>
and <hi>godly sincerity,</hi>

                        <hi>not with fleshly Wisdom, but
by the Grace of God,</hi> particularly the Grace of
Meekness, <hi>we have had our Conversation in the
World,</hi> and so have pleased God, and done our
Duty. He did not speak the Sense, no not of
the <hi>sober</hi> Heathen, that said, <hi>Est vindicta bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
vitâ jucundius ipsâ:</hi> Revenge is <hi>sweeter</hi>
than <hi>Life,</hi> for it often proves more <hi>bitter</hi> than
<hi>Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. He <hi>enjoys his Friends:</hi>—And that's a
thing in which lies much of the Comfort of
humane Life. Man was intended to be a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
Creature, and a Christian much more.
But the angry Man is <hi>unfit</hi> to be so, that takes
Fire at every Provocation; fitter to be abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98022:33"/>
to the <hi>Lions Dens,</hi> and the <hi>Mountains of the
Leopards,</hi> than to <hi>go forth by the footsteps of the
Flock.</hi> He that hath <hi>his hand against every Man,</hi>
cannot but have (with <hi>Ishmael</hi>'s Character, <hi>Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s
Fate) <hi>every Man's hand against him,</hi> (Gen.
16. 12.) and so he lives in a State of War; But
Meekness is the <hi>Cement</hi> of Society, the Bond of
Christian-Communion; it plaineth and polisheth
the Materials of that <hi>Beautiful Fabrick,</hi> and
makes them lye close and tight, and the living
Stones which are built up a Spiritual House, to
be like the Stones of the Temple that <hi>Herod</hi>
built, all as one Stone, whereas, <hi>Hard upon hard</hi>
(as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Proverb is) <hi>will never make a
Wall.</hi> Meekness preserves among <hi>Brethren</hi> that
<hi>Unity,</hi> which is like the Ointment upon the
<hi>Holy Head,</hi> and the Dew upon the <hi>Holy Hill,</hi>
Psal. 133. 1, 2. In our present state of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
there can be no Friendship, Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or Conversation maintain'd without mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Allowances; we do not yet dwell with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
or Spirits of just Men <hi>made perfect,</hi> but with
Men <hi>subject to like Passions.</hi> Now Meekness
teaches us to consider this, and to allow accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
and so Distances and Strangeness, Fewds
and Quarrels are happily prevented, and the
<hi>beginnings</hi> of them crushed by a <hi>timely</hi> care.
How necessary to true <hi>Friendship</hi> it is to <hi>surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
our Passions, and to <hi>subject</hi> them all to the
Laws of it, was (perhaps) intimated by <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>'s
delivering to <hi>David</hi> his <hi>Sword,</hi> and his <hi>Bow,</hi>
and his <hi>Girdle,</hi> all his <hi>Military Habiliments,</hi>
when he entred into a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Friendship
with him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 3. 4.</p>
                     <p>3. He <hi>enjoys his God;</hi> and that's most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
of all. 'Tis the Quintessence of all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98022:33"/>
Happiness, and that without which all our other
Enjoyments are <hi>sapless,</hi> and <hi>insipid:</hi> For this,
none are better qualified than those that are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed
with the <hi>Ornament of a meek and quiet
Spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</hi>
'Twas when the Psalmist had newly conquer'd
an unruly Passion, and compos'd himself, that he
lift up his Soul to God, in that pious and pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Breathing, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee,
and there is none upon Earth, that I desire in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison

the Tasts and Tokens of his Love, when
we experience in our selves the Communications
of his Grace, and the continued instances of his
Image stamped upon us: And this those that are
most <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>quiet</hi> have usually the greatest
degrees of. In our Wrath and Passion, we give
place to the <hi>Devil,</hi> and so provoke God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from us: Nothing <hi>grieves the Holy Spirit
of God</hi> (by whom we have Fellowship with
the Father) more than <hi>bitterness, and wrath, and
anger, and clamor, and evil speaking,</hi> Eph. 4. 30, 31.
But to this Man doth the God of Heaven look
with a peculiar Regard, <hi>even to him that is

him that is quiet,</hi> so the <hi>Syriack; to him that is
meek,</hi> so the <hi>Caldee.</hi> The great God over-looks
Heaven and Earth to give a favourable look to
the Meek and Quiet Soul. Nay, he not only looks
at such, but, <hi>Isa. 57. 15. He dwells with them;</hi> noting
a constant Intercourse and Communion between
God and humble Souls. His <hi>Secret is with them;</hi>
he gives them more <hi>Grace,</hi> and they that thus
dwell in Love, <hi>dwell in God, and God in Them.</hi>
The <hi>Waters were dark indeed,</hi> but they were
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98022:34"/>
                        <hi>quiet,</hi> when <hi>the Spirit of God moved upon
them,</hi> and out of them produced a beautiful
World.</p>
                     <p>This calm and sedate Frame, doth very much
qualifie and dispose us for the Reception and
Entertainment of Divine Visits, and <hi>sets bounds
to the Mountain,</hi> (Exod. 19. 12.) on which God
is to descend, that no Interruption may break
in, and chargeth the <hi>Daughters of Ierusalem,</hi> by
<hi>the Roes and the Hinds of the Field</hi> (those sweet,
and gentle, and peaceable Creatures) <hi>not to stir
up or awake our Love until he please,</hi> Cant. 2. 7.
Some think it was for the quieting and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of his Spirit (which seems to have been a
little ruffled) that <hi>Elisha call'd for the Minstrel,</hi>
2 Kings 3. 15. <hi>and then the hand of the Lord
came upon him.</hi> Never was God more intimate
with any meer Man, than he was with <hi>Moses,</hi>
the <hi>meekest</hi> of all the Men on the Earth, and
it was requir'd as a needful Qualification of the
High-Priest, who was to draw near to Minister,
that he should have <hi>Compassion on the ignorant,
and on them that are out of the way,</hi> Heb. 5. 1, 2.
The <hi>meek will be guide in Iudgment,</hi> with a still
small Voice which cannot be heard, when the
Passions are loud and tumultuous. The angry
Man when he awakes, is still with the Devil,
contriving some malicious Project; The meek
and quiet Man, <hi>when he awakes is still with God,</hi>
solacing himself in his favour. <hi>Return unto thy
Rest, O my Soul,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 116. 7. when
<hi>v.</hi> 6. he had reckon'd himself among the simple,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the mild, innocent, and inoffensive People.
<hi>Return to thy Noah,</hi> so the word is, (for <hi>Noah</hi>
had his Name from <hi>Rest</hi>) perhaps alluding to
the Rest which the Dove found with <hi>Noah</hi> in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98022:34"/>
the Ark, when she could find none any where
else. Those that are harmless, and galless, and
<hi>simple</hi> as Doves, can with comfort return to God
as to their Rest. It is excellently paraphras'd by
Mr. <hi>Patrick,</hi> 
                        <q>
                           <hi>God and thy Self (my Soul) enjoy;
in quiet Rest, free'd from thy Fears.</hi>
                        </q> It is said,
<hi>Psalm</hi> 147. 6. That the <hi>Lord lifteth up the meek;</hi>
As far as their Meekness Reigns, they are lifted
up above the stormy Region, and fixt in a Sphere
perpetually calm and serene. They are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
indeed that are at home in God, and live
a Life of Communion with him, not only in
Solemn Ordinances, but even in the Common
Accidents and Occurences of the World. Every
Day is a Sabbath-day, a Day of <hi>Holy Rest</hi> with
the meek and quiet Soul, that is, <hi>one of the Days
of Heaven.</hi> As this Grace gets ground, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the Holy Ghost grow stronger and stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
according to that precious Promise, <hi>Isa. 29. 19.
The Meek also shall increase their Ioy in the
Lord, and the Poor among Men, shall rejoyce in
the Holy One of Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. It is <hi>not in the Power of his Enemies to
disturb and interrupt him in these Enjoyments.</hi>
His Peace is not only sweet, but safe and secure:
As far as he acts under the Law of Meekness,
it is above the reach of the assaults of those
that wish ill to it. He <hi>that abides quietly under
the shadow of the Almighty, shall surely be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the Snare of the Fowler,</hi> Psal. 91. 1, 3.
The greatest Provocations that Men can give
would not hurt us,<note place="margin">Nemo laedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur nisi à seipso. Dict. Diogen.</note> if we did not, by our inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
and foolish concern, come too near them,
and within reach of their Canon; we may
therefore thank our selves, if we be damaged;
He that hath learned, with Meekness and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98022:35"/>
to forgive Injuries, and pass them by, hath
found the best and surest way of <hi>baffling</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating</hi>
them,<note place="margin">Idcirco quis te laedit ut doleas, quia fructus lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore laesi est, ergo, cum fructumejus everteris non dolendo, ipse doleat necesse est amissione fructûs sui Improbum caedis susti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendo.

It was an evidence that <hi>Saul</hi> was acted
<hi>by another Spirit,</hi> in that when the Children of
<hi>Belial</hi> despis'd him, and brought him no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
hoping by that Contempt to give a shock
to his Infant-Government, <hi>he held his peace,</hi> and
so neither his Soul, nor his Crown received any
disturbance, 1 <hi>Sam. 10. 27. Shimei,</hi> when he cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>David,</hi> intended thereby to pour Vinegar
into his Wounds, and to add affliction to the
afflicted: but <hi>David,</hi> by his Meekness, preserv'd
his Peace, and <hi>Shimei</hi>'s design was frustrated,
<hi>So let him curse;</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10.) Alas poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!
he hurts himself more than <hi>David,</hi> who,
while he keeps his Heart from being Tinder to
those Sparks, is no more prejudiced by them,
than the Moon is by the foolish Curr that barks
at it. The meek Man's Prayer is that of <hi>David,</hi>
Psal. 61. 2. <hi>Lead me to the Rock that is higher than</hi>
I: And there I can (as Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> expresses it,)
<q>
                           <l>—smile to see,</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>The meek Man is like a Ship that rides at
Anchor, <hi>movetur sed non amovetur;</hi> the Storm
<hi>moves</hi> it, (the meek Man is not a Stock or Stone
under Provocation,) but doth not <hi>remove</hi> it from
its Port. It is a Grace that in reference to the
Temptations of Affront and Injury, as Faith
in reference to Temptation in general,<note place="margin">Meekness is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Affront to all Injuries in the World, for it returns them upon the injurious, and makes them Useless, Ineffective and Innocent. <hi>Taylor, Great Exempl.</hi> p. 304.</note>

the Peace of the Soul there, where <hi>Thief

lays all his Comforts at the Mercy of every

                     <p>So that, upon the whole Matter, it appears,
That the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit,
is as easie as it is comely.</p>
                     <p>[3.] Consider how profitable a meek and quiet
Spirit is. All People are for what they can get;
'tis that which the busie World is set upon, <hi>Every
one for his Gain from his Quarter,</hi> Isa. 56. 11. 'Tis
for this that they break their Sleep, and spend
their Spirits, and raise so great a Dust: Now
it will be hard to convince such, that really there
is more to be gotten by Meekness and Quietness
of Spirit, than by all this Hurry and Adoe. They
readily believe, that <hi>in all Labour, there is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;</hi>
but let God himself tell them, <hi>In Returning
and rest shall ye be saved, in Quietness and in
Confidence shall be your strength,</hi> they will not
take his Word for it, but they say, (as it follows
there) <hi>No, for we will flee upon Horses, and we
will ride upon the Swift,</hi> Isa. 30. 15, 16. He that
came from Heaven to bless us, hath entail'd a
special Blessing upon the Grace of Meekness,
<hi>Mat. 5. 5. Blessed are the Meek;</hi> and his saying,
they are blessed, makes them so, for those whom
he blesseth, are blessed indeed; <hi>blessed, and they
shall be blessed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Meekness is gainful and profitable.</p>
                     <p>1. As it is the Condition of the Promise: The
Meek are therefore blessed, <hi>for they shall inherit
the Earth.</hi> 'Tis quoted from <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 11. and is
almost the only express Promise of temporal

Some read it, <hi>They shall inherit the Land; i. e.</hi>
the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was not only a Type
and Figure, but to them that believed, a Token
and Pledge of the Heavenly Inheritance. So
that, <q>A double <hi>Canaan</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves)

him, which we believe of <hi>Adam,</hi> if he

which hath more than other Branches of
it, the <hi>promise of the Life that now is,</hi> 1 Tim.

is founded in Sonship: That which comes by
Descent to the Heir, the Law attributes to the
Act of God, who hath a special Hand in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for the Meek. They are his Children,
and <hi>if Children, then Heirs.</hi> It is not always
the largest Proportion of this World's Goods,
that falls to the meek Man's share, but whether
he hath more less, he hath it by the best Title;
not by a Common, but a Covenant-Right: He
holds <hi>in Capite,</hi>

Old <hi>Wickleff's</hi> Translation reads it, (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
'tis quoted in <hi>The Book of Martyrs)</hi> and
very significantly. Good Management contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
more to our comfort, than great Possessions.
Whatever a meek Man hath of this Earth, he
knows how to weild it, to make a right and
good use of it, and that's all in all. Quiet Souls
so far inherit the Earth, that they are sure to
have as much of it as is good for them; as
much as will serve to bear their Charges thro'
this World to a better, and who would cover
more? Enough is as good as a Feast. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God without present Possession, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Possession of the World, without an
interest in the Promise.</p>
                     <p>2. As it hath in its own Nature a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to our present Benefit and Advantage.
<hi>He that is thus wise, is wise for himself,</hi> even in
this World, and effectually Consults his own
Interest.</p>
                     <p>1. Meekness hath a good influence upon our
Health. If envy be the <hi>rottenness of the Bones,</hi>
Pro. 14. 30. Meekness is the Preservation of them.
As the indulging of inordinate Appetites towards
those things that are pleasing to the Flesh, so the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98022:37"/>
indulging of inordinate Passions against those
things that are displeasing, do in the effect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and injure the very Body which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
so much for. The Excesses and Exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Anger, stir up those peccant Humors in
the Body, which kindle and increase wasting
and killing Diseases, but Meekness governs
these Humors, and so contributes very much
to the good Temper and Constitution of the
Body. When <hi>Ahab</hi> was sick for <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
Meekness would soon have cured him.
<hi>Moses,</hi> the meekest of Men, not only liv'd to
be old, but was then free from the Infirmities
of Age; <hi>His Eye was not dim, nor his Natural
Force abated,</hi> Deut. 34. 7. which may be very
much imputed to his Meekness, as a means. The
days of old Age would not be such evil Days,
if old People did not, by their own frowardness
and unquietness, make them worse than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they would be. Ungovern'd Anger enflames
the Natural Heat, and so begets acute Diseases,
drys up the Radical Moisture, and so hastens
Chronical Decays. The Body is call'd, the
<hi>Sheath</hi> or Scabbard of the Soul, <hi>Dan. 7. 15. Marg.</hi>
How often doth an envious fretful Soul, like a
Sharp Knife, <hi>cut</hi> its own Sheath, and, as they say
of the Vipers Brood, eat its own way out: All
which Meekness happily prevents.</p>
                     <p>The Quietness of the Spirit will help to cool
distempering Heats, to suppress Melancholy
Vapours; and this, as other of Wisdom's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
will be <hi>Health to the Navel, and Marrow
to the Bones; Length of Days, and long Life, and
Peace shall they add unto thee, but Wrath kills the
foolish Man,</hi> Job 5. 2.</p>
                     <p>

2. It hath a good influence upon our <hi>Wealth,</hi>
the preservation and increase of it. As in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
so in Families and Neighbourhoods; <hi>War
begets Poverty.</hi> Many a one hath brought a fair
Estate to ruine, by giving way to the Efforts of an
ungovern'd Anger, that barbarous Idol to which
even the Children's Portions, and the Families
Maintenance are oftentimes sacrificed. <hi>Contention</hi>
will as soon cloath a Man with Rags as <hi>Sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness;</hi>
that therefore which keeps <hi>the Peace</hi>
doth not a little befriend <hi>the plenty.</hi> It was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s
meek Management of his Quarrel with
<hi>Lot,</hi> that secured both his own and his Kinsman's
Possessions, which otherwise would have been
an easie Prey to the <hi>Canaanite</hi> and the <hi>Perizzite</hi>
that dwelt then in the Land, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 7, 8. And
<hi>Isaac,</hi> whom I have sometimes thought to be the
most quiet and calm of all the Patriarchs, and
that passed the days of his Pilgrimage most
silently, raised the greatest Estate of any of them,
<hi>Gen. 26. 13. he grew till he became very great:</hi>
And his Son <hi>Iacob</hi> lost nothing at long run, by
his meek and quiet Carriage towards his Uncle
<hi>Laban.</hi> Revenge is costly; <hi>Haman</hi> bid largely
for it, no less than <hi>ten thousand Talents of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
Esth. 3. 9. it's better to forgive, and <hi>save</hi> the
Charges. Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> us'd to say, <hi>Love is better
than Law, for Love is cheap, but Law is charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
Those Tradesmen are commonly observ'd
to thrive <hi>most,</hi> that make the <hi>least noise,</hi> that
with quietness Work, and mind their own Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
                     <p>3. It hath a good influence upon our <hi>Safety.</hi>
In the day of the Lord's Anger, the meek of
the Earth are most likely to be secured. <hi>It may
be you shall be hid,</hi> so runs the Promise, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 3.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98022:38"/>
If any be, you shall, you stand fairest for spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Protections. Meekness approacheth to that
<hi>Innocence</hi> which is commonly an effectual secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
against Wrongs and Injuries. However,
some base and servile Spirits may insult over
the Tame and Humble: Yet with all Persons of
Honour, it is confessedly a piece of Cowardise
to set upon an unarm'd unresisting Man, that
resents not Provocation, and is ready to yield to
every demand. <hi>Who is he that will harm you, if
you be followers <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap> or cocks his Pistol at the harmless silent
Lamb, while every one is ready to do it, at the
furious barking Dog? thus doth the meek Man
escape many of those perplexing Troubles, those
<hi>Woes,</hi> and <hi>Sorrows,</hi> and <hi>Wounds without cause,</hi>
which he that is Passionate, Provoking and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful,
pulls upon his own Head. <hi>Wise Men
turn away Wrath, but a Fool's Lips enter into
Contention, and his Mouth calleth for Strokes.
It is an Honour</hi> to a Man <hi>to cease from strife,</hi>
but every Fool will be meddling to his own hurt.
An instance of this I remember Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> gives
in his Book of <hi>Obedient Patience,</hi> which was
this, <q>That once going along <hi>London-streets</hi> a
Hectoring rude Fellow justled him; he went
on his way and took no notice of it; but the
same Man affronting the next he met in like
manner, he drew his Sword and demanded
Satisfaction, and Mischief was done.</q> He that
would sleep both in a whole Skin, and in a whole
Conscience, must learn rather to forgive Injuries,
than to revenge them. The two Goats that met
upon the narrow Bridge (as it is in <hi>Luther</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
were both in danger, should they quarrel,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98022:38"/>
but were both preserv'd by the Condescension
of one that lay down and let the other go over
him. It is the evil of Passion that it turns our
Friends into Enemies, but it is the excellency of
Meekness, that it turns our Enemies into Friends,
which is an effectual way of conquering them.
<hi>Saul,</hi> as inveterate an Enemy as could be, was
more than once melted by <hi>David</hi>'s Mildness and
Meekness, <hi>Is this thy voice, my Son David?</hi> saith
he, 1 <hi>Sam. 24. 16. I have sinned, return my Son
David,</hi> 1 Sam. 26. 21. And after that, <hi>Saul perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
him no more,</hi> Chap. 27. 4. The change that
<hi>Iacob</hi>'s Meekness made in <hi>Esau</hi> is no less o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
and (some think) is remark'd as very
strange and surprizing, by an unusual Pointing in
the Hebrew Text, upon <hi>Esau</hi>'s kissing <hi>Iacob,</hi>
Gen. 33. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> a prick over every Letter, to
put the Reader in mind to take special notice of
it. In the ordinary Dispensations of Providence,
some tell us<note n="*" place="margin">Dr: <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Pract. Cat. p.</hi> 117.</note>, they have found it remarkably
true in times of Publick Trouble and Calamity,
it hath commonly fared best with the meek and
quiet; their Lot hath been safe and easie, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if compared with the contrary Fate of the
turbulent and seditious. Whoso is wise and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
these things will understand the loving
kindness of the Lord to the quiet in the Land,
against whom we read indeed of <hi>Plots</hi> laid,
and deceitful matters devis'd, Psal. 35. 20.—37,
12, 14. But those by a kind and over-ruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ordinarily baffled and made succesless.
Thus doth this Grace of Meekness carry its own
Recompence along with it, and in keeping of
this Commandment, as well as after keeping it,
there is a <hi>great Reward,</hi> Psalm 19. 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:98022:39"/>
[4.] Consider what a Preparative it is for
something further. It is a very desirable thing
to <hi>stand compleat in all the Will of God,</hi> Col. 4. 12.
to be fitted and furnished for every good Work,
to be made ready, a people <hi>prepared for the
Lord:</hi> A living Principle of Grace is the best
Preparation for the whole Will of God. Grace
is establishing to the Heart, it is the <hi>Root of the
Matter,</hi> and a <hi>good Foundation for the time to
come.</hi> This Grace of <hi>Meekness</hi> is particularly a
good Preparation, for what lies before us in this
World.</p>
                     <p>1. It makes us fit <hi>for any Duty.</hi> It puts the
Soul in Frame, and keeps it so for all Religious
Exercises. There was <hi>no noise of Axes and
Hammers</hi> in the building of the Temple: Those
are most fit for Temple-service that are most
quiet and compos'd. The Work of God is best
done, when it is done without noise. Meekness
qualities and disposes us to hear and receive the
Word: When Malice and Envy are laid aside,
and we are like new-born Babes, for Innocency
and Inoffensiveness, then we are most fit to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the sincere Milk of the Word,</hi> and are most
likely to grow thereby, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2. Meekness
prepares the Soil of the Heart, for the Seed of
the Word, as the Husbandman <hi>opens and breaks
the Clods of his Ground, and makes plain the
face thereof,</hi> and then <hi>casts in the principal
Wheat, and the appointed Barley,</hi> Isa. 28. 24, 25.
Christs Ministers are Fishers of Men, but we
seldom fish successfully in these troubled Waters.
The Voice <hi>Eliphaz</hi> heard was ushered in with a
profound silence, <hi>Iob</hi> 4. 16. and in <hi>slumbrings upon
the Bed,</hi> a quiet Place and Posture. <hi>God openeth
the Ears of Men, and sealeth their Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

Job 33. 15, 16. <hi>Prayer</hi> is another Duty
which Meekness doth dispose us for the right
and acceptable Performance of. We do not
lift up pure Hands in Prayer, if they be not
without Wrath, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. Prayers made in
<hi>Wrath</hi> are written in <hi>Gall,</hi> and can never be <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>

Prey, but Calves, and Kids, and Lambs, and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Doves, and young Pigeons, all of them
Emblems of Meekness, and Gentleness, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensiveness,
for <hi>with such Sacrifices God is well
pleased.</hi> This quietness of Spirit contributes very
much to the constant steddiness and regularity of
a religious Conversation. Hot and eager Spirits
that are ready to take Fire at every thing, are
usually very inconstant in their Profession, and of
great Inconsistency with themselves, like a Man
in an Ague Fit, sometimes burning hot, and
sometimes shivering for cold; or like those that
Gallop in the beginning of their Journey, and
tire before the end of it; whereas the meek and
quiet Christian is still the same, and by keeping
to a constant rate rids Ground. If you would
have one Foot of the Compasses go even round
the Circumference, you must be sure to keep the
other fixt and quiet in the Centre, for <hi>your
strength is to sit still.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. It makes us <hi>fit for any Relation,</hi> which God
in his Providence may call us into. Those that
are quiet themselves, cannot but be easie to all
that are about them, and the nearer any are to
us in Relation and Converse, the more desirable
it is that we should be easie to them. Relations
are various, as Superiors, Inferiors and Equals;
he that is of a meek and quiet Spirit, is cut out
for any of them. <hi>Moses</hi> was forty Years a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> forty Years a Servant in <hi>Midian,</hi>
and forty Years a King in <hi>Ieshrun,</hi> and his Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
qualified him for each of these Posts, and still
he held fast his Integrity. There are various Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
requisite, according as the Relation is, and
various Graces to be exercised, but this of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the Golden Thread that must run thro'
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98022:40"/>
all. If Man be a sociable Creature, the more
he hath of Humanity, the more fit he is for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
Meekness would greatly help to preserve
the Wisdom and due Authority of Superiors, the
Obedience and due Subjection of Inferiors, and
the Love and mutual Kindness and Serviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Equals. A calm and quiet Spirit receives
the comfort of the Relation most thankfully,
studies the Duty of the Relation most carefully,
and bears the Inconvenience of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
(for there is no unmixed Comfort under
the Sun) most chearfully and easily. I have
heard of a Married Couple, who, tho' they
were both naturally of a hot and hasty Temper,
yet lived very comfortably in that Relation by
observing an Agreement made between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>Never to be both angry together;</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
law of Meekness it is, which if faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
liv'd up to, would prevent many of those
Breaches among Relations, which occasion so
much <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Grief,</hi> and are seldom heal'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Scar.</hi> 'Twas part of the good Advice given
by a Pious and Ingenious Father, to his Children
newly entred into the Conjugal Relation,
<q>
                           <l>Doth one speak Fire? 'tother with Water come;</l>
                           <l>Is one provok'd? be 'tother soft or dumb.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus <hi>one wise, both happy.</hi> But where
Wrath and Anger are indulged, all Relations are
embittered, those that should be <hi>helps</hi> meet,
become as Thorns in our Eyes, and Goads in our
sides. <hi>Two indeed are better than one,</hi> and yet
it is better <hi>to dwell alone in the Wilderness, than
with a Contentious and Angry Relation, who is
like a continual dropping in a very rainy day,</hi> Pro.

                     <p>3. It makes us <hi>fit for any Condition,</hi> according
as the wise God shall please to dispose of us.
Those that through Grace are enabled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and quiet themselves, are fit to live in this
World, where we meet with so much every
day to discompose and disquiet us. In general,
whether the outward Condition be <hi>prosperous</hi>
or <hi>adverse,</hi> whether the World smile or frown
upon us, a meek and quiet Spirit is neither lifted
up with the one, nor cast down with the other,
but still in the same poise: In Prosperity humble
and condescending, the Estate rising, but the
Mind not rising with it; in <hi>Adversity</hi> encourag'd
and chear'd up, <hi>cast down, but not in despair;</hi> in
both <hi>even,</hi> like a Dye, throw it which way you will
it lights on a square side. St. <hi>Paul</hi> that had
learn'd in every Estate to be content, <gap reason="foreign">

within himself, <hi>knew how to be abased, and
knew how to abound, every where, and in all
things he was instructed both to be full and to be
hungry, both to abound and to suffer need,</hi> Phil. 4.
11, 12. Changes without, made none within.
It is a Temper which, as far as it hath the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant
in the Soul, makes every Burthen sit
light, by bringing the <hi>Mind</hi> to the <hi>Condition,</hi>
when the <hi>Condition</hi> is not in every thing brought
to the <hi>Mind. Prosperity</hi> and <hi>Adversity</hi> have
each of them their particular Temptation to
Peevishness and Frowardness, the former
by making Men <hi>imperious,</hi> the latter by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Men <hi>impatient;</hi> against the Assaults of each
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98022:41"/>
of these Temptations, the Grace of Meekness
will stand upon the Guard. Being to pass thro'
this World <hi>by Honour and Dishonour, by evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and good Report;</hi> that is, thro'a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Conditions and Treatments, we have
need of that <hi>long-suffering and kindness, and
love unfeigned, which will be armour of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
on the right hand and on the left.</hi> I
refer you to that Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8. Meekness
and quietness will fortifie the Soul on each hand,
and suit it to the several Entertainments which
the World gives us, like a skilful Pilot, that
which Point of the Compass soever the Wind
blows from, will shift his Sails accordingly, and
knows either how to get forward, and weather

                     <p>4. It makes us fit for <hi>a Day of Persecution.</hi>
If Tribulation and Affliction arise because of the
word (which is no foreign Supposition) the
meek and quiet Spirit is arm'd for it, so as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
its Peace and Purity at such a time, which
are our two great Concernments, that we may
neither torment our selves with a <hi>base fear,</hi> nor
pollute our selves with a base <hi>compliance.</hi> We
use to say, <hi>We will give any thing for a quiet
Life,</hi> I say, any thing but a <hi>quiet Conscience,</hi>
which will be best secur'd under the Shield of a
meek and quiet Spirit, <hi>which doth not render rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for railing,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 9. nor aggravate the
threatned Trouble, or respresent it to it self in

the most righteous Testimony with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Fear, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. like our Master, who
<hi>when he suffered, threatned not, but committed
himself to him that judgeth righteously,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 23.
Suffering-Saints, (as the Suffering-Jesus) are
compar'd to <hi>Sheep,</hi> Isa. 53. 7. Rom. 8. 36.) as Sheep
dumb before the <hi>Shearer,</hi> nay, dumb before the
<hi>Butcher.</hi> The meek and quiet Christian, if duly
call'd do it, can tamely part, not only with the
<hi>Wool,</hi> but with the <hi>Blood;</hi> not only with the
<hi>Estate,</hi> but with the <hi>Life,</hi> and even then rejoyce
with joy unspeakable and full of Glory. Angry
froward. People in a day of Rebuke, are apt to
pull Crosses upon themselves by needless Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
or to murmur, and complain, and fly in
the face of Instruments, and give unbecoming
Language, contrary to the Laws of our Holy
Religion, and the Example of our Master, and
so do more hurt than good by their suffering.
Whenever we have the honour to be <hi>persecuted
for righteousness-sake,</hi> our great care must be to
<hi>glorifie</hi> God, and to <hi>adorn our Profession</hi> (which
is done most <hi>effectually</hi> by Meekness and Mildness
under the hardest Censures, and the most cruel
Usage.) So manifesting that we are indeed under
the power and influence of that <hi>Holy Religion,</hi>
which we think it worth our while to suffer
for.</p>
                     <p>5. It makes us fit for <hi>Death and Eternity.</hi>
The Grave is a quiet place, <hi>there the wicked cease
from troubling,</hi> Job 3. 17. Those that were most
troublesom are there bound to the Peace; and
their <hi>Hatred and Envy</hi> (those great make-bates)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98022:42"/>
                        <hi>are there perished,</hi> Eccles. 9. 6. Whether we will
or no, in the Grave we shall <hi>lye still and be quiet,</hi>
Job 3. 13. What a great Change them must it
needs be to unquiet, angry and litigious People,
and what a mighty <hi>shock</hi> will that sudden forced
<hi>Rest</hi> give them after such a violent rapid <hi>Motion!</hi>
It is therefore our Wisdom to compose our selves
for the Grave, to prepare our selves for it, by
Adapting and Accommodating our selves to that
which is likely to be our <hi>long Home;</hi> this is <hi>dying
daily;</hi> quieting our selves, for Death will shortly
quiet us.</p>
                     <p>The meek and quiet Soul is at Death let into
that <hi>Rest,</hi> which it hath been so much labouring
after, and how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>welcome must that needs be?—Thoughts
of Death and the Grave are very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to those who love to be quiet, for then and
there, they shall <hi>enter into Peace,</hi> and <hi>rest in
their Beds,</hi> Isa. 57. 2.</p>
                     <p>After Death we expect the Judgment, than
which, nothing is more dreadful to them that are
<hi>Contentious,</hi> Rom. 2. 8. The coming of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
brings terror along with it, to those that
smite <hi>their Fellow-Servants,</hi> Luke 12. 45, 46. but
those that are meek and quiet are likely to have
their Plea ready, their Accounts stated, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it comes, it will be no surprize to them:
To those whose <hi>Moderation is known to all Men,</hi>
it will be no ungrateful News, to hear that <hi>the
Lord is at hand,</hi> Phil. 4. 5. It is therefore prescrib'd
as that which ought to be our constant care, that
whenever our Master comes, we may be found
of him in <hi>Peace,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 14. <hi>i. e.</hi> in a peaceable
Temper. <hi>Blessed is that Servant, whom his Lord
when he comes shall find in</hi> such a frame. <q>
                           <hi>A
good Man</hi> (saith the late excellent A. B. <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotson,</hi>

in his Preface to his Book of <hi>Family Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion)
would be loth to be taken out of the World
reeking hot from a sharp Contention with a
perverse Adversary; and not a little out of
Countenance to find himself in this Temper
translated into the calm and peaceable Regions
of the Blessed, where nothing but perfect Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Good-will reigns for ever.</hi>
                        </q> Heaven
for certain is a quiet Place, and none are fit for

that delight in War; turbulent and unquiet
People would be out of their Element, like a
Fish upon Dry Ground, in those Calm Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>They are the Sheep of Christ, such as are

                     <p>Now lay all this together, and then consider,
Whether there be not a real excellency in this
Meekness and Quietness of Spirit, which doth
highly recommend it to all that Love either God,

                     <p>AND now, <hi>First,</hi> Have we not reason to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the want of the Ornament of a
<hi>meek and quiet Spirit,</hi> among those that profess
Religion, and especially in our own Bosoms? If
this be Christianity, the Lord help us! How
little is there of the Thing, even among those
that make great Pretensions to the Name?
Surely, (as one said in another Case) <hi>Aut hoc
non Evangelium, aut hi non Evangelici:</hi> Either
this is not Gospel, or these are not Gospel-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.
And, O how hare and uncomly doth
Profession appear, for want of this adorning!
When the <hi>Israelities</hi> had stript themselves of their
Ornaments to furnish up a Golden Calf, it is said,
they were <hi>made naked to their shame,</hi> Exod. 32. 25.
How naked are we (like <hi>Adam</hi> when he had
sinn'd) for want of this <hi>Ornament,</hi> 'tis well if
it were to the shame of true Repentance, for
there's reason enough for it.</p>
                     <p>I am not teaching you to Judge and Censure
others in this matter, there is but too much of
that to be found among us; we are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted
enough to spy faults in others, the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of whose Passions, we should interpret
favourably. But we have all cause more or less
to condemn our selves, and confess Guilt in this
Matter. In many things we all offend, and
perhaps in this, as much as in any, coming short
of the Law of Meekness and Quietness.</p>
                     <p>We are called Christians, and it is our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
and Honour that we are so: We name
the Name of the meek and lowly Jesus, but
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98022:44"/>
how few are acted by his Spirit, or conform'd
to his Example? It is a shame that any occasion
should be given to charge it upon Professors, who
in other things are most strict and sober, that in
this they are most faulty; And that many who
pretend to Conscience and Devotion should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
themselves in a peevish, froward and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
Temper and Conversation, to the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of that worthy Name by which we are
called. May we not say, as that Mahometan
did when a Christian Prince had per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

broke his League with him, <hi>O Iesus, are these
thy Christians?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the manifest Design of our Holy and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Religion to smooth, and soften, and
sweeten our Tempers, and to work off the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedness
and unevenness of them; is it not a
wretched thing therefore, that any who profess
it, should be sowr'd, and embitter'd, and less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versable
and fit for humane Society, than other
People? He was look'd upon as a very good
Man in his Day, and not without Cause, who
yet had such an unhappy temper, and was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so transported with Passion, that his Friend
would say of him, <hi>He had Grace enough for ten
Men, and yet not enough for himself.</hi> All the
Disciples of Jesus Christ, even those of the
first three, do not <hi>know what manner of Spirit
they are of,</hi> Luke 9. 35. So apt are we to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
our selves, especially when these Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
shrowd themselves under the specious and
plausible pretence of Zeal for God and Religion.
But yet the Fault is not to be laid upon the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
or the strictness and singularity of that in
other things that are praise-worthy; nor may
we think the worse of Christianity for any
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98022:44"/>
such Blemishes: We know very well, that <hi>the
Wisdom that is from above is peaceable, and gentle,
and easie to be entreated,</hi> and all that's sweet, and
aimable, and endearing, tho' she is not herein
justified of all that call themselves her Children.
But the blame must be laid upon the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Folly of the Professors themselves, who
are not so perfectly deliver'd into the Mold of
Christianity as they should, but neglect their
Ornament, and prostitute their Honour, and
suffer the Authority of their Graces to be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled

                     <p>And yet, blessed be God! even in this corrupt

                     <p>But that we may each of us judge our selves,
and find matter for Repentance herein, I shall only
mention those instances of irregular Deportment
towards our particular Relations, which evidence
the want of <hi>Meekness and Quietness of Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Superiors are commonly very apt to chide,</hi>
and that's for want of Meekness. It's spoken to
the praise of him, who is the Great Ruler of
this perverse and rebellious World, that <hi>he will
not always chide,</hi> Psa. 103. 9: But how many Little

they are provok'd. Their Carriage fiery and
hasty; their Language scurrilous and undecent;
they care not what they say, nor what they do,
nor who they fall foul upon, such <hi>Sons of Belial,
that a Man cannot speak to them,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 17. one
had as good meet a Bear robb'd of her Whelps,
as meet Them. Here wants Meekness. <hi>Husbands
should not be bitter against their Wives,</hi> Col. 3. 19.
<hi>Parents should not provoke their Children,</hi> Eph. 6. 4.
<hi>Masters must forbear threatning,</hi> Eph. 6. 9. These

The undue and intemperate Passion of Superiors,
goes under the umbrage and excuse of necessary
strictness, and the maintaining of Authority, and
the Education and Controul of Children and
Servants: But surely every little faileur needs

and all this adoe? Is this the product of a meek
and quiet Spirit? Is this the best Badge of your
Authority you have to put on? And are these
the Ensigns of your Honour? Is there no other
way of making your Inferiors know their place,
but by putting them among the Dogs of your
Flock, and threatning them as such? Not that

and such <hi>Reproofs</hi> as are necessary to the
support and preservation of that, and those so
sharpned, as some Tempers require and call for.
But while you are governing others, pray learn
to govern your selves, and do not disorder your
own Souls under pretence of keeping Order in
your Families: For tho' you your selves may
not be aware of it, yet it is certain, that by
those Indications of your displeasure, which
transgress the Laws of Meekness, you do but
render your selves Contemptible, and Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and rather <hi>prostitute</hi> than <hi>preserve</hi> your
Authority. Tho' your Children dare not tell you
so, yet perhaps they cannot but think that you

and so (if you will but allow your selves the
liberty of Reflection) you cannot but know
the Heart of an Inferior, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 9.) and
should therefore treat those that are now under
you, as you your selves then wish'd to be treated.
A due expression of Displeasure, so much as is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98022:46"/>
necessary to the amendment of what is amiss,
will very well consist with Meekness and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And your Gravity and Awful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posedness
therein will contribute very much
to the preserving of your Authority, and will
command respect abundantly more than your
Noise and Chiding. Masters of Families (and
Masters of Schools too) have need, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to behave themselves wisely, Psal. 101. 2. so
as to avoid the two Extreams, that of <hi>Eli</hi>'s
foolish Indulgence on the one hand, 1 Sam. 2.
23, 24. and that of <hi>Saul</hi>'s brutish Rage, on the
other Hand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 30, 33. and for the

                     <p>2. Inferiors are commonly very apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
If every thing be not just to their Mind,
they are freting, and vexing, and their Hearts
are hot within them; they are uneasie in their
Place and Station, finding fault with every thing
that is said or done to them. Here wants a quiet
Spirit, which would reconcile us to the Post
we are in, and to all the difficulties of it, and
would make the best of the present state, tho'
it be attended with many Inconveniencies. Those
unquiet People, whom the Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> in his
Epistle compares to <hi>raging Waves of the Sea, and
wandring Stars,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>were Murmurers and
Complainers,</hi> ver. 16. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>Blamers of their
Lot.</hi>—So the Word signifies. 'Tis an instance
of Unquietness to be ever and anon quarrelling
with our Allotment. Those Wives wanted a
meek and quiet Spirit, that <hi>cover'd the Altar of
the Lord with Tears,</hi> Mal. 2. 13. Not Tears of
Repentance for Sin, but Tears of Vexation, at
the Disappointments they met with in their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98022:46"/>
outward Condition. <hi>Hannab</hi>'s Meekness and
Quietness was in some degree wanting, when
she fretted, and wept, and would not eat,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 7. but Prayer compos'd her Spirit, and
set here to rights, <hi>v. 18. Her Countenance was no
more sad.</hi> It was the unquietness of the Spirit
of the Elder Brother, in the Parable, that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel'd
so unreasonably with the Father for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
and entertaining the Penitent Prodigal,
<hi>Luke</hi> 15. 19. For those that are given to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,
will never want something or other to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of. It is true (tho' not so readily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended)
that the sullenness, and murmuring, and
silent frets of Children and Servants is as great
a Transgression of the Law of Meekness, as the
more open, noisie and avowed Passions of their
Parents and Masters. We find the King's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains
<hi>wroth with the King,</hi> Esth. 2. 21. and
<hi>Cain</hi>'s quarrel with God himself, for accepting
of <hi>Abel,</hi> was interpreted Anger at God, <hi>Gen. 4. 6.
Why art thou wroth, and why is thy Countenance
fallen?</hi> The Sowr Looks of Inferiors, are as
certain an indication of Anger resting in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
as the Big Looks of Superiors; and how
many such instances of Discontent there have
been, especially under a continual Cross, our
own Consciences may perhaps tell us. It is
the want of Meekness only, that makes those
whom Divine Providence hath put under the
Yoke, Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> that is, impatient of
the Yoke.</p>
                     <p>3. Equals are commonly very apt to <hi>clash</hi> and
<hi>contend.</hi> It is for want of Meekness that there
are in the Church so many Pulpit and Paper-Quarrels,
such strifes of Words, and perverse
Disputings: That there are in the State such
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98022:47"/>
Factions and Parties, and between them such
Animosities and Heart-Burnings; That there
are in Neighbourhoods such Strifes, and Brawls,
and Vexatious Law-suits, or such Distances, and
Estrangements, and Shiness one of another: That
there are in Families Envies, and Quarrels among
the Children and Servants, Crossing, and Thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and finding Fault one with another: And
that Brethren that dwell together, do not as they
should <hi>dwell together in Unity.</hi> It is for want
of Meekness that we are so impatient of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in our Opinions, Desires and Designs,
that we must have our own Saying, right or
wrong, and every thing our own way: That we
are so impatient of Competitors, not enduring
that any should stand in our Light, or share in
that Work or Honour, which we would engross
to our selves: That we are so impatient of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
so quick in our Apprehension and Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the least Slight or Affront, and so preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in our Fancy of Injuries, where really there
are none, or none intended. They are not only
Loud and profess'd Contentions, that evidence a
want of Meekness, but also those silent Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Affection and Conversation, which make
a less noise, little Piques and Prejudices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
which Men are themselves so ashamed
of, that they will not own them; those shew
the Spirit disturb'd, and wanting the Ornament
of <hi>Meekness.</hi> In a word; The wilful doing
any thing to disquiet others, Slandering, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting,
Whispering, Tale-bearing, or the like, is
too plain an Evidence, that we are not our selves
rightly disposed to be quiet.</p>
                     <p>And now, may we not all remember our Faults
this Day? and instead of condemning others,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98022:47"/>
tho' never so Faulty, should we not each of us
bewail it before the Lord, that we have been so
little acted by this excellent Spirit, and repent
of all that which we have at any time said or
done, contrary to the Law of Meekness, and
from under the Direction and Influence of it?
Instead of going about to extenuate and excuse
our sinful Passions, let us rather aggravate them,
and lay load upon our selves for them; <hi>So foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
have I been and ignorant, and so like a Beast,</hi>
as the Psalmist speaks, when he is recovering
himself from an intemperate heat, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 22.
Think how often we have appear'd before God
and the World, without our Ornament, without
our Livery, to our shame. God kept account
of the particular Instances of the unquietness of
<hi>Israel: They have tempted me</hi> (saith he) <hi>now
these ten times,</hi> Numb. 14. 22. Conscience is
God's Register that Records all our Miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
Even what we say and do in our haste, is
not so quick as to escape its Observation: Let
us therefore be often opening that Book now,
for our Conviction and Humiliation, or else it
will be opened shortly to our Confusion and
Condemnation. <hi>But if we would judge our selves,
we should not be judged of the Lord.</hi> May we
not all say, as <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Brethren did, (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some are, as they were, in a special manner
call'd to say it, by humbling Providences) <hi>We
are verily guilty concerning our Brother,</hi> Gen. 42. 21.
Such a Time, in such a Company, upon such an
Occasion, I wanted Meekness, and was unquiet;
my Spirit was provok'd, and I spake unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
with my Lips, and now I remember it
against my self. Nay, have not I lived a Life
of Unquietness, in the Family, in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98022:48"/>
always in the Fire of Contention, as in
my Element, and breathing Threatnings? And
by so doing, have not I dishonour'd my God,
discredited my Profession, disturbed my own
Soul, grieved the blessed Spirit, and been
to many, an occasion of Sin? And for all this,
ought not I to be greatly humbled and ashamed?
Before we can put on the Ornament of a Meek
and Quiet Spirit, we must first wash in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of true Repentance, not only for our Gross
and Open Extravagancies of Passion, but for
all our Neglects and Omissions of the Duties of
Meekness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Have we not Reason to labour and
endeavour, since there is such a Vertue, there is
such a Praise, to attain these things? Should we
not lay out our selves to the utmost, for this
<hi>Ornament of a Meek and Quiet Spirit?</hi> For your
Direction in this Endeavour, (if you be indeed
willing to be directed) I shall briefly lay before
you,

                        <p>1. That we must <hi>seek Meekness.</hi> This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
we have, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 3. and (which is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
observable) it is directed to the Meek of
the Earth: <hi>Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the
Earth:—Seek Meekness.</hi> Tho' they were
Meek, and were pronounced so by him that
searcheth the heart, yet they must seek <hi>Meekness,</hi>
which teacheth us, That those who have much
of this Grace,<note place="margin">Putomultos potuisse ad sapientiam pervenire, nisi putas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent se per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venisse. Sen. de tranqu.</note> have still need of more, and must
desire and endeavour after more; <hi>Si dixisti, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit,
periisti.</hi> He that sits down content with the
Grace he hath, and is not pressing forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Perfection, and striving to grow in Grace,
to get the Habits of it more strengthened and
confirm'd, and the Actings of it more quickned
and invigorated, it is to be fear'd hath no true
Grace at all; but tho' he sit never so high, and
never so easie in his own opinion, yet <hi>sits down</hi>
short of Heaven. Where there's <hi>Life,</hi> one way
or other there will be <hi>Growth,</hi> till we come to
the perfect Man. Job 17. 9. <hi>He that hath clean
hands will be stronger and stronger. Paul</hi> was a
Man of great attainments in Grace, and yet we
find him forgetting the things that are <hi>behind,</hi> and
reaching <hi>forth</hi> to those that are <hi>before,</hi> Phi. 3. 13, 14.
Those who took joyfully the spoiling of their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98022:49"/>
Goods, are yet told that they had <hi>need of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
Heb. 10. 34, 36. Thus the meek of the Earth
(who being on the Earth, are in a state of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and Imperfection, of Trial and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
have still need of Meekness, that is, they
must learn to be yet more calm and compos'd,
more steddy, and even, and regular in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of their Passions, and in the managery of
their whole Conversation. They who have silenc'd
all angry Words, must learn to suppress the very
first Risings and Motions of angry Thoughts.</p>
                        <p>It is observable, When the meek of the Earth,
are especially concern'd to seek Meekness, even
then when the Decree is ready to bring forth,
<hi>v.</hi> 2. when the <hi>day of the Lord's Anger hastens on,</hi>
when the Times are bad, and desolating Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are breaking in, then we have occasion for
all the Meekness we have, and all we can get,
and all little enough. Meekness towards God,
the Author, and towards Men, the Instruments
of our Trouble: Meekness to bear the Trial,
and to bear our Testimony in the Trial. There
is sometimes an <hi>Hour of Temptation,</hi> Rev. 3. 10.
a Critical Day, when the exercise of Meekness is
the Work of the Day; Sometimes the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Men are more than ordinary provoking,
and then the Children of God have more than
ordinary need of Meekness. When God is justly
angry, and Men are unjustly angry, when our
Mothers Children are angry with us, and our
Father angry too, there's anger enough stirring,
and then, <hi>Blessed are the Meek,</hi> that are careful
to keep possession of their Souls, when they can
keep possession of nothing else; whose Hearts
are fixed, and quiet in shaking and unquiet Times.</p>
                        <p>Now the way prescribed for the attainment of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98022:49"/>
Meekness is to seek it. Ask it of God, pray for
it, 'tis a fruit of the Spirit, 'tis given by the
God of all Grace, and to him we must go for it.
It is a Branch of that Wisdom, which he that
<hi>lacketh must ask of God,</hi> and it <hi>shall be given him,</hi>
Jam. 1. 5. The God we address to is call'd, <hi>The
God of Patience and Consolation,</hi> Rom. 15. 5. and
he is therefore the God of Consolation, because
the God of Patience (for the more patient we
are, the more we are comforted under our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions)
and as such we must eye him, when
we come to him for Grace to make us <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,</hi>
that is, meek and loving one towards
another, which is the Errand the Apostle there
comes upon, to the Throne of Grace. God's
People are, and should be a <hi>Generation of Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that covet the best Gifts, and make their
Court to the best Giver;</hi> who never said to the
wrestling Seed of <hi>Iacob, Seek in vain,</hi> but hath
given us an assurance firm enough for us to build
upon, and rich enough for us to encourage our
selves with, <hi>Seek and ye shall find.</hi> What would
we more? <hi>Seek Meekness,</hi> and <hi>ye shall find it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Promise annexed is very encouraging to
the <hi>meek of the Earth,</hi> that seek Meekess; <hi>It may

Tho' it be but a Promise with an [<hi>it may be,</hi>] yet
it ministers abundance of Comfort: God's <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities,</hi>
are better than the Worlds <hi>Certainties:</hi>
And the meek ones of the Earth, that hope in

we have, <hi>Col. 3. 12. Put on therefore (as the Elect
of God, Holy and Beloved)—Meekness.</hi> It
is one of the Members of the new Man, which,
according to the Obligations we lye under from
our Baptism, we must put on. Put it on as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi>
to keep Provocations from the Heart, and
so to defend the Vitals. They that have try'd it
will say, it is <hi>Armour of Proof;</hi> when you are
putting on the whole Armour of God, do not
forget this. Put it on as <hi>Attire,</hi> as your neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Cloathing, which you cannot go without;
look upon your selves as Ungirt, Undrest, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
without it. Put it on as a <hi>Livery-Garment,</hi>
by which you may be known to be the Disciples
of the Meek, and Humble, and Patient Jesus, and
to belong to that Peaceable Family. Put it on
as an <hi>Ornament,</hi> as a Robe, and a Diadem, by
which you may be both beautified and dignified
in the Eyes of others. Put it on as the <hi>Elect of

Provocations of Anger often set our Meekness
at a distance from us, and we have it to seek then
when we have most need of it; But we must
follow after it, and not be taken off from the
pursuit, by any Diversion whatsoever. While
others are Ingenious and Industrious enough in
following after Malice and Revenge, projecting
and prosecuting angry Designs, be you as wise
and diligent to preserve the Peace, both within
doors and without.—<hi>Following Meekness,</hi>
bespeaks a sincere Desire, and a serious Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to get the Mastery of our Passion, and to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98022:51"/>
check, and govern, and moderate all the Motions
of it. Tho' we cannot fully attain this Mastery, yet
we must follow after it and aim at it. <hi>Follow
Meekness,</hi> that is, <hi>as much as in you lies</hi> live
peaceably with all Men, endeavouring to keep
the unity of the Spirit; we can but make one
side of the Bargain, if others will quarrel, yet
let us be peaceable; if others will strike the
Fire, that's their fault, let not us be as Tinder
to it.</p>
                        <p>4. We must <hi>shew all Meekness unto all Men.</hi>
This is one of the Subjects which <hi>Paul</hi> directs a
young Minister to preach upon, <hi>Tit. 3. 2. Put
them in mind to shew all Meekness.</hi>—It is that
which we have need to be often minded of. <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is there opposed to Brawling and Clamour,
which is the Fruit and Product of our own Anger,
and the Cause and Provocation of the Anger of
others. Observe, it is <hi>all Meekness,</hi> that is here
recommended to us <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>—all kinds
of Meekness, <hi>bearing Meekness,</hi> and <hi>forbearing
Meekness, qualifying Meekness, condescending
Meekness, forgiving Meekness; the Meekness
that endears our Friends,</hi> and <hi>that which recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

our Enemies; the Meekness of Authority
over Inferiors; the Meekness of Obedience to
Superiors,</hi> and <hi>the Meekness of Wisdom towards
all. All Meekness</hi> is Meekness in <hi>all</hi> Relations, in
reference to <hi>all</hi> Injuries, <hi>all</hi> sorts of Provocation,
Meekness in <hi>all</hi> the Branches and Instances of
it: In this piece of our Obedience, we must be U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal.
Observe further, we must not only have
Meekness, <hi>all</hi> Meekness, but we must <hi>shew</hi> it,
by drawing out this Grace into Exercise, as there
is occasion: In our Words, in our Looks, in our
Actions, in every thing that falls under the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98022:51"/>
of Men, we must manifest that we have
indeed a regard to the Law of Meekness, and that
we make Conscience what we say and do, when
we are provok'd. We must not only have the
Law of Love written in our Hearts, but in our
Tongues too, we must have the Law of Kindness,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 31. 26. And thus the Tree is known by its
Fruits. This Light must shine, that others may
see the good Works of it, and hear the good
Words of it too, not to glorifie us, but to glorifie
our Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 16. we should study to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in all our Converse, so mild, and gentle,
and peaceable, that all that see us may witness
for us, that we are of the Meek of the Earth.
We must not only be moderate, but let our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
be known,</hi> Phil. 4. 5. He that is in this
respect a wise Man, let him shew it in the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Wisdom, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 13. What are good
Cloaths worth, if they be not worn? Why hath
the Servant a fine Livery given him, but to shew
it for the honour of his Master, and of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
he belongs to? How can we say we are
meek, if we do not shew it? The shewing of
our Meekness will beautifie our P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ofession, and
will adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour, and
may have a very good influence upon others,
who cannot but be in Love with such an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Grace, when thus, like the <hi>Ointment of the
right Hand, it betrayeth it self,</hi> and the House is
filled with the Odor of it. Again, This Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
must be thus shew'd unto all Men, Foes as
well as Friends, those without, as those within,
all that we have any thing to do with. We
must shew our Meekness not only to those above
us, that we stand in awe of, but to those below
us, that we have an Authority over. <hi>The Poor</hi>
                           <pb n="94" facs="tcp:98022:52"/>
indeed <hi>useth Intreaties,</hi> but whatever is the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
it is not the Priviledge of the rich to answer
roughly, Prov. 18. 23. We must <hi>shew our Meekness
not only to the Good and Gentle, but also to the
Froward,</hi> for this is thank-worthy, 1 Pet. 2. 18, 19.
Our Meekness must be as extensive as our Love,
so exceeding broad is this Commandment, <hi>All
Meekness to all Men.</hi> We must shew this Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
most, to those with whom we do most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
There are some, that when they are in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with Strangers, appear very mild and good
humored, their Behaviour is plausible enough,
and complaisant, but in their Families they are
peevish, and froward, and ill-natured, and those
about them scarce know how to speak to them;<note place="margin">Habet ubi se etiam in privato lare explicet magnus Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. Sen.</note>
This shews that the fear of Man gives greater
check to their Passions, than the fear of God.
Our Rule is to be meek towards all, even to the
Brute Creatures, over whom we are Lords, but
must no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Beast.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Observe the Reason which the Apostle there
gives, why we should <hi>shew all Meekness towards
all Men, for we our selves also were sometime
foolish,</hi> verse 3. Time was when perhaps we were
as bad as the worst of those we are now angry
at,<note place="margin">Haec &amp; nos risimus ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, non nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani. Tertul.</note> and if now it be better with us, we are
purely beholden to the free Grace of God in
Christ, that made the difference: And shall we
be harsh to our Brethren, who have found God
so kind to us? Hath God forgiven us that great
Debt, and pass'd by so many wilful Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and shall we be extream to mark what is
done amiss against us, and make the worst of
every slip and oversight? The great Gospel Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for mutual forbearance and forgiveness
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98022:52"/>
is, that <hi>God for Christ's sake hath forgiven us,</hi>
Col. 3. 13.</p>
                        <p>It may be of use also for the qualifying of
our Anger at our Inferiors, to remember not only
our former sinfulness against God in our Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
State, but our former Infirmities in the
Age and State of Inferiors; were not we our
selves <hi>sometimes foolish?</hi> Our Children are
careless, and playful, and froward, and scarce
governable, and were not we our selves so
when we were of their Age? And if we have
now <hi>put away childish Things,</hi> yet they have
not.—, <hi>Children may be brought up in the Nurture
and Admonition of the Lord, without being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked

that is, study not to disturb others, nor to be
your selves disturbed by others; those are quiet
that are not apt either to give or take offence,

Compose your selves to this holy Rest; put your
selves in a posture to invite this blessed Sleep,
which God gives to his beloved. Take pains as
Students in Arts and Sciences do, to understand
the Mystery of this Grace. I call it a <hi>Mystery,</hi>

deep things of God, speaks of this as a Mystery,

of Meekness; and to furnish our selves with
such Considerations as tend to the quieting of

Others are studying to disquiet us, the
more need we have to study how to quiet our
selves, by a careful watching against all that
which is ruffling and discomposing. Christians

for wise Men to walk in. Let us <hi>go forth then
by the Footsteps of the Flock, and set our selves
to follow them, who through Faith and Patience
inherit the Promises.</hi> We <hi>are compassed about
with a great Cloud of Witnesses,</hi> that will bear
their Testimony to the Comfort of <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and upon trial recommend it to us; but
we shall single out only some few out of the
Scripture.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Pattern of <hi>Meekness,</hi> and he
<hi>was the Father of the Faithful.</hi> The Apostle here in
the verse but one before the Text, proposeth <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
for an Example to Women, particularly an
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98022:54"/>
Example of Meekness in an inferior Relation;
<hi>she obeyed Abraham,</hi> and (in token of the respect
due to a Husband) <hi>she called him Lord.</hi> Now
<hi>Abraham</hi> is a Pattern of the same Grace in a
Superior. He that was famous for Faith, was
famous for Meekness; for the more we have of
Faith towards God, the more we shall have of
Meekness towards all Men.—How meek was
<hi>Abraham,</hi> when there happened a strife betwixt
his Herdsmen and <hi>Lot</hi>'s, which, had it proceeded,
might have been of ill Consequence, for the
<hi>Canaanite</hi> and the <hi>Perizzite</hi> dwelled then in the
Land, but it was seasonably taken up by the
Prudence of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 13. 8. <hi>Let there be
no strife, I pray thee:</hi> Tho' he might command
the Peace, yet for Love's sake <hi>he rather beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
Every word hath an air of Meekness, and
a tendency to keep the Peace. And when the
Expedient, pitch'd upon for the prevention of
Strife, was their parting from each other, tho'
<hi>Let</hi> was the <hi>Iunior,</hi> yet <hi>Abraham,</hi> for Peace-sake
quitted his right, and gave <hi>Lot</hi> the choice,
<hi>ver.</hi> 9. and the gracious visit which God gave
him thereupon, <hi>v.</hi> 14. was an abundant recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for his mildness and condescension. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
instance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Meekness, we have
in his Carriage towards <hi>Sarah,</hi> when she quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel'd
with him so unreasonably about her Maid,
angry at that which she her self had the doing
of, <hi>Gen. 16. 5, 6. My wrong be upon thee;—The
Lord judge between me and thee.
Abraham</hi> might soon have replied, You may e'ne
thank your self, it was your own Contrivance;
but laying aside the present Provocation, he
abides by one of the Original Rules of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<hi>Behold thy Maid is in thy Hand.</hi> He did
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98022:54"/>
not answer Passion with Passion, that would
have put all into a flame presently; but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
Passion with Meekness, and so all was
quiet. Another instance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Meekness,
we have in the Transactions between Him and
<hi>Abimelech</hi> his Neighbour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 24, 25. He first
enters into a Covenant of Friendship with him,
which was confirm'd by an Oath, and then (not
reproacheth him, but) reproveth him for a wrong
that his Servants had done him about a Well of
Water, which gives us this Rule of Meekness,
<hi>Not to break Friendship for a small matter of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference:</hi>
Such and such occasions there are, which
they that are disposed to it, might quarrel about,
but <hi>what is that between me and thee?</hi> If Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Rule, matters in Variance may be fairly
reasoned and adjusted without Violation or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringment
of Friendship. This is the Example
of that great Patriarch. The future Happiness
of the Saints is represented as the Bosom of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Luke</hi> 16. 23. a quiet State. Those that
hope to lye in the Bosom of <hi>Abraham</hi> shortly,
must tread in the steps of <hi>Abraham</hi> now, whose
Children we are, <hi>as long as we thus do well, and
who (as Maimonides</hi> expresseth it) <hi>is the Father
of all that are gathered under the Wings of the
Divine Majesty.</hi>

This Character of him comes in there in a
Parenthesis, (probably inserted by the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Pen, that wrote the last Chapter of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy)</hi>
upon occasion of an Affront he receiv'd
from those of <hi>his own House;</hi> which intimates,
that his quiet and patient bearing of that, was,
of all other, the greatest Proof and Instance of
his Meekness. Those can bear any Provocation,
that can bear it from their near Relations. The
Meekness of <hi>Moses,</hi> as the Patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> was
try'd on all hands. <hi>Armour</hi> of <hi>Proof</hi> shall be
sure to be shot at. It should seem that his Wife
was none of the best humour'd Women; for
what a Passion was she in, about the circumcising
of her Son, when she reproach'd him as a <hi>bloody
Husband,</hi> and we do not read of one word that
he reply'd, but let her have her saying, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.
25, 26. When God was angry, and <hi>Zipporah</hi>
angry, it was best for him to be quiet. The Lot
of his Publick Work, was cast <hi>in the Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the day of Temptation in the Wilderness,</hi>
Psa. 95. 8. But, as if all the Mutinies of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
<hi>Israel,</hi> were too little to try the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Moses,</hi> his own Brother and Sister (and
those of no lessa Figure than <hi>Miriam</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetess,
and <hi>Aaron</hi> the Saint of the Lord) pick
a quarrel with him, speak against him, envy his
Honour, reproach his Marriage, and are ready
to head a Rebellion against him, <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 1, 2. God
heard this, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and was angry, <hi>v.</hi> 9. But <hi>Moses,</hi>
tho' he had reason enough to resent it heinously,
was not at all moved by it, took no notice of it,
made no complaint to God, no answer to them,
and was so little interested in the matter, that we
don't find one word he said, till we find him, <hi>v.</hi> 13.
praying so heartily for his provoking Sister, who
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98022:55"/>
was then under the Tokens of God's Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for the affront she gave him. The less a
Man strives for himself, the more is God engaged
in Honour and Faithfulness to appear for him.
When Christ said, <hi>I seek not mine own Glory,</hi> he
presently added, <hi>but there is one that seeketh and
judgeth.</hi> And it was upon this occasion that
<hi>Moses</hi> obtain'd this good Report, That <hi>he was

Man could have given greater proofs of
Courage, than <hi>Moses</hi> (saith the Learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Hall's Remark. Contemp. l.</hi> 6.) He slew the
<hi>Aegyptain,</hi> beat the <hi>Midianite</hi> Shepherds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his own Court, not fearing
the Wrath of the King; he durst look God in
the Face amidst all the Terrors of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
and draw near to the thick Darkness where God
was, and yet that Spirit which made and
knew his Heart, saith, He was the Meekest,
Mildest Man upon the Earth. Mildness and
Fortitude may well lodge together in the same
Breast, which corrects the Mistake of those
that will allow none Valiant but the Fierce.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Meekness of <hi>Moses</hi> qualified him to be a
Magistrate, especially to be King in <hi>Ieshurun,</hi>
among a People so very provoking, that they
gave him occasion to use all the Meekness he
had, and all little enough to bear their Manners
in the Wilderness. When they murmured against
him, quarrel'd with him, arraigned his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and were sometimes ready to stone him;
he resented these Provocations with very little of
personal Application or Concern, but instead of
using his Interest in Heaven, to summon Plagues
upon them, he made it his Business to stand in
the Gap, and by his Intercession for them, to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98022:56"/>
turn away the Wrath of God from them, and
this not once nor twice, but <hi>many times.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And yet we must observe, that tho' <hi>Moses</hi> was
the meekest Man in the World, yet when God's
Honour &amp; Glory were concern'd, none more warm
and zealous; witness his resentment of the golden
Calf, when in a Holy Indignation at that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Iniquity, he deliberately broke the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
And when <hi>Korah</hi> and his Crew invaded
the Priests Office, <hi>Moses,</hi> in a pious Wrath, said
unto the Lord, <hi>Respect not thou their Offering,</hi>
Numb. 16. 15. He that was a Lamb in his own
Cause, was a Lion in the Cause of God; Anger
at Sin, as Sin, is very well consistent with Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Meekness. Nor can it be forgotten, that tho'
<hi>Moses</hi> was so eminent for Meekness, yet he once
transgress'd the Laws of it; when he was old,
and his Spirit was provok'd, he <hi>spake unadvisedly
with his Lips, and it went ill with him for it,</hi> Psal.
106. 32, 33. which is written, not for Imitation,
but for Admonition, not to justifie our rash An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but to engage us to stand upon our Guard
at all times against it, that he who <hi>thinks he
stands may take heed lest he fall,</hi> and that he
who hath thus fallen may not wonder if he come
under the Rebukes of Divine Providence for it
in this World, as <hi>Moses</hi> did, and yet may not
despair of being pardoned upon Repentance.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>David</hi> was a Pattern of Meekness, and it
is promised, <hi>Zach. 12. 8. That the Feeble shall be
as David.</hi> In this, as in other instances, he was
a Man after God's own Heart. When his own
Brother was so rough upon him without Reason,
1 <hi>Sam. 17. 28. Why camest thou down hither,</hi> &amp;c?
how mild was his Answer? <hi>What have I now
done? Is there not a Cause?</hi> ver. 29. When
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98022:56"/>
his Enemies reproached him, he was not at all
disturbed at it, <hi>Psal. 38. 13. I, as a deaf Man, heard
not.</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi> persecuted him with such an
unwearied Malice, he did not take the advantage
which Providence seem'd to offer him, more than
once, to revenge and right himself, but left it to
God to do it for him. <hi>David</hi>'s meek Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
with the Proverb of the Antients, <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
proceedeth from the Wicked; but my Hand
shall not be upon him,</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 13. When <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s
Churlishness provok'd him, yet <hi>Abigail</hi>'s Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
soon pacified him, and it pleased him to
be pacified. When <hi>Shimei</hi> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

And yet <hi>David,</hi> a great Soldier,
a Man of celebrated Courage,
that slew a Lion, and a Bear,
and a Philistine, as much a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous
Beast as either of them, which shews
that it was his Wisdom and Grace, and not his
Cowardise, that at other times made him so
quiet. <hi>David</hi> was a Man that met with very
many disquieting and disturbing Events in the
several Scenes of his Life, through which (tho'
sometimes they ruffled him a little, yet) for the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98022:57"/>
main he preserv'd an admirable Temper, and an
evenness and composedness of Mind, which was
very exemplary. When upon the surprize of a
fright, <hi>he changed his Behaviour before</hi> Abimelech,
<hi>and counterfeited that madness,</hi> which angry
People realize; yet his Mind was so very quiet
and undisturbed, that at that time he penn'd the
34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                           <hi>Psalm,</hi> in which not only the excellency of
the Matter, and the calmness of the Expression,
but the composure of it <hi>Alphabetically</hi> (in the
Hebrew) speaks him to be even then in a sedate
frame, and to have very much the command of
his own Thoughts. As at another time, when
his own Followers spake of stoning him, tho' he
could not still the Tumult of his Troops, he could
those of his Spirits, for then he <hi>encouraged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Lord his God,</hi> 1 Sam. 30. 6. As to those
Prayers against his Enemies, which we find in
some of his Psalms, and which sometimes sound
a little harsh, surely they did not proceed from
any such irregular Passion, as did in the least <hi>clash</hi>
even with the Evangelical Laws of <hi>Meekness:</hi>

4. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a Pattern of Meekness. Tho'
his natural Temper seems to have been warm and
eager, which made him eminently Active and
Zealous, yet that Temper was so rectified and
sanctified, that he was no less eminently <hi>meek.</hi> He
<hi>became all things to all Men,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
He studied to please all with whom he had to
do, and to render himself easie to them, <hi>for their
good to Edification.</hi> How patiently did he bear
the greatest Injuries and Indignities, not only from
Jews and Heathen, but from false Brethren, that
were so very industrious to abuse and undermine
him? How glad was he that Christ was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
tho' out of Envy, and Ill-will by those
that studied to <hi>add Affliction to his Bonds?</hi> In
governing the Church, he was not led by the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Resolves of Passion, but always deliberated
calmly concerning the use of the Rod of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
when there was occasion for it, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 21.
Shall I come to you with a Rod, or in the Spirit
of Meekness?</hi> That is, shall I proceed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to Censures, or shall I not rather continue
the same gentle Usage I have hitherto treated
you with, waiting still for your Reformation?
wherein the Spirit of Meekness appears more
open and legible, than in the use of the Rod,
tho' that also is very well consistent with it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Many other Patterns of Meekness might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd
in, but the</hi> time would fail me to tell of <hi>Isaac,</hi>
and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joseph,</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> of <hi>Samuel</hi> also,
and <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and all the Prophets and
Apostles, Martyrs and Confessors, and eminent
Saints; who, by Meekness, subdued (not <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
but) their own Spirits; stopped the Mouths
(not of <hi>Lions,</hi> but) of more fierce and formidable
Enemies; quenched the violence (not of <hi>Fire,</hi> but)
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98022:58"/>
of intemperate and more ungovernable Passions;
<hi>and so</hi> wrought Righteousness, obtained Promises,
escaped the edge of the Sword, <hi>and</hi> out of weakness
were made strong; <hi>and by all this</hi> obtained a good
Report, <hi>Heb. 11. 32, 33, 34.—But after all,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Our Lord Iesus</hi> was the great Pattern of
Meekness and Quietness of Spirit. All the rest
had their Spots, the fairest Marbles had their
Flaws, but here is a Copy without a blot. We
must follow the rest no further than they were
conformable to this great Original: <hi>Be followers
of me</hi> (saith <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 1.) <hi>as I am of Christ.</hi>
He fulfilled all Righteousness, and was a compleat
Exemplar of all that's Holy, Just and Good, but
I think in most, if not all, those places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
where he is particularly and expresly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to us for an example, 'tis to recommend
to us some or other of the <hi>Homiletical Graces</hi> of
Christianity, those I mean which tend to the
sweetning of our Converse one with another:
And therefore the Word was made <hi>Flesh, and
dwelt among us,</hi> that he might teach us how to
dwell together in Unity. We must <hi>walk in love,
as Christ loved us,</hi> Eph. 5. 2. <hi>Forgive, as Christ
forgave us,</hi> Col. 3. 13. <hi>Please one another, for
Christ pleased not himself,</hi> Rom. 15. 2, 3. <hi>Be Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the poor, for we know the Grace of our
Lord Iesus,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 9. <hi>Wash one anothers feet,
i. e.</hi> stoop to the meanest Offices of Love, for
<hi>Christ did so,</hi> John 13. 14. Mat. 20. 27, 28. <hi>Doing
all with lowliness of Mind, for it is the same
Mind that was in Christ Iesus,</hi> Phil. 2. 3, 5. and
many other the like: But above all our Lord
Jesus was an Example of Meekness. <hi>Moses</hi> had
this Grace <hi>as a Servant,</hi> but Christ <hi>as a Son,</hi> he
was anointed with it above measure. He is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98022:58"/>
therefore call'd the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> for his Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Patience, and Inoffensiveness, and even
in his Exaltation, he retains the same Character.
One of the Elders told <hi>Iohn,</hi> (Rev. 5. 5.) <hi>That the
Lion of the Tribe of</hi> Judah <hi>would open the Sealed
Book; And I beheld</hi> (saith <hi>Iohn, v.</hi> 6.) <hi>and lo a Lamb.</hi>
He that was a <hi>Lion</hi> for Strength and Courage, was
a <hi>Lamb</hi> for Mildness and Gentleness: And if a
Lion, yet <hi>the Lion of the Tribe of Iudah,</hi> which
the dying Patriarch describes to be a Lion <hi>gone
up from the Prey,</hi> and that is <hi>stooped down,</hi> and
<hi>couched, not to be roused up,</hi> Gen. 49. 9. which
speaks the Quietness and Repose even of this
Lion. If Christ be a Lion, he is a Lion <hi>resting,</hi>
the Devil is a Lion <hi>roaring,</hi> (1 Pet. 5. 8.) But the
Adorations given to Christ by the Heavenly Hosts
speak of him as the <hi>Lamb,</hi> Rev. 5. 8, 12, 13. <hi>Blessing
and Glory—to him that sis upon the Throne;</hi>
they do not say, and to the Lion of the Tribe
of <hi>Iudah,</hi> but <hi>to the Lamb;</hi> tho' he hath a Name
given him above every Name, yet he will be
known by that Name, which speaks his Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as if this were to be <hi>his Name for ever,</hi> and
this <hi>his Memorial to all Generations:</hi> As he that
rides upon the Heavens, by his Name <hi>Iah,</hi> is the
<hi>Father of the Fatherless, and the Iudge of the
Widows,</hi>

him in his Meekness, and are therefore so oft
called the Sheep of Christ. This is that part of
his Copy which he expresly calls us to write af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Mat. 11. 29. Learn of me, for I am meek and
lowly in Heart.</hi> If the Master be mild, it ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Servant to be froward. The Apostle is
speaking of Christ's Meekness under his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
when he saith, <hi>That he left us an example,
that we should follow his Steps,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21.</p>
                        <p>Let us observe particularly the Meekness of
our Lord Jesus, both towards his Father, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Friends, and towards his Foes, in each
of which he is an Example to us.</p>
                        <p>1. He was very meek toward <hi>God, his Father,</hi>
chearfully submitting to his whole Will, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
compleat in it. In his Commanding-will,
<hi>Lo I come,</hi> (saith he) <hi>I delight to do thy Will,</hi> tho'
it enjoyn'd him a very hard piece of Service, yet
it was his <hi>Meat and Drink,</hi> Joh. 4. 34. and <hi>he always
did those things that pleased his Father,</hi> Joh. 8. 29.
So likewise in his Disposing-will, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> acquiesced
from first to last. When he was entring upon that
sharp encounter, tho' Sense startled at it, and said
<hi>Father if it be possible let the Cup pass from me,</hi>
yet he soon submitted with a great deal of Meek,
ness, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> Mat. 26. 39, 42.
Tho' it was a very bitter Cup, yet his Father put
it into his Hand, and therefore he drank it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any struggle or reluctance, when it came to
the setting to, reasoning himself from that To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
into this Compliance, <hi>Iohn 18. 11. The Cup
that my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</hi>
And it comes in there as a reason, why he would
not have a Sword drawn in his defence.</p>
                        <p>2. He was very meek towards <hi>his Friends</hi> that
lov'd and follow'd him. With what remarkable
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98022:59"/>
Instances of Mildness, and Gentleness, and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
did he train up his Disciples; tho' from
first to last, he was <hi>a Man of Sorrows, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Grief,</hi> and where the Nature is
corrupt, such are apt to be peevish and froward
with those about them, yet how meek and calm
his carriage was towards them all along, we
may see,</p>
                        <p>(1.) In his bearing with their <hi>Weaknesses and
Infirmities.</hi> After they had been long under the
Inspection and Influence of such a Teacher, and
had all the Advantages that Men could have for
getting acquaintance with the things of God, yet
how weak and defective were they in Knowledge,
and Gifts, and Graces? How ignorant and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
were they? How slow of Heart to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and believe? And what Blunders did they
make? Dull Scholars it should seem they were,
and very bad Proficients. But their Hearts being
upright with him, he did not cast them off, nor
turn them out of his School, but made the best
of them, rectified their Mistakes, instructed them
in their Duty, and the Doctrine they were to
preach, by Precept upon Precept, and Line upon
Line, and taught them as they were able to bear
it, as one that considered their Frame, and could
have Compassion on the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and on them
that are <hi>out of the way,</hi> Heb. 5. 2. As long as he
was with them, so long he suffered them, <hi>Mark</hi>
9. 19. This, as it is a great Encouragement to
Christian Learners, so it is a great Example to
Christian Teachers.</p>
                        <p>(2.) In his forgiving and passing by their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesses
and Disrespects to himself. He was
not extream to mark, no not what they did amiss
of this kind. When they murmured at the cost
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98022:60"/>
that was bestowed upon him, and call'd it wast,
and had indignation at it, he did not resent it as
he might have done, nor seem to observe how
much what they said, reflected upon him, nor did
he condemn them any other way, than by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the Woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 8, 11. When <hi>Peter,</hi>
and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> the first three of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
were with him in the Garden, and very
unseasonably slept, while he was in his Agony
praying, so little concern'd did they seem to be for
him, and such a grievous slight did they put upon
him; yet observe how meekly he spoke to them,
did not give them any hard Language, but, <hi>Could
ye not watch with me one hour?</hi> And when they
had not a word to say for themselves, so inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
was their fault, he had something to say
for them, and instead of accusing them, he Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizeth
for them, <hi>The Spirit indeed is willing,
but the Flesh is weak,</hi> Mat. 26. 40, 41. When <hi>Peter</hi>
had denied him, and had cursed and sworn he
did not know him, than which (besides the
falshood and perfidiousness of it) nothing could
be more unkind, with what Meekness did he
bear it? It is not said, the Lord turn'd and frown'd
upon <hi>Peter,</hi> tho' he deserv'd to be frown'd into
Hell, but the Lord turn'd and <hi>looked</hi> upon <hi>Peter,
Luke</hi> 22. 61. and that Look recovered him into
the way to Heaven; it was a kind Look, and not
an angry one. Some days after when Christ and
<hi>Peter</hi> met in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and had Dined together
in token of Reconciliation, and some Discourse
past between them, not a word was said of this
matter; Christ did not upbraid him with his
fault, nor chide him for it, nor did there appear
any other Fruit of the falling out of these Lovers,
but only the renewing of their Love with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98022:60"/>
Endearments, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us to forgive and forget the Unkindnesses of
those that (we are satisfied) are for the main
our true Friends, and if any occasion of Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
happen, to turn it into an occasion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
our love to them, as the Apostle expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                        <p>3. He was very meek <hi>towards his Enemies,</hi>
that hated and persecuted him. The whole
Story of his Life is fill'd with instances of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Meekness; while he <hi>endur'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of Sinners against himself,</hi> which was
a constant Jarr, yet he had a perpetual Serenity
and Harmony within himself, and was never in
the least discomposed by it. When his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Miracles were cavill'd at and reproached,
and he himself represented under the blackest
Characters, not only as the <hi>Drunkard's Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
but as the <hi>Devil's Confederate,</hi> with what
a wonderful calmness did he bear it? How
mildly did he answer, with Reason and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when he could have replyed in Thunder
and Lightning? How well satisfied under all such
invidious Reflections with this, that <hi>Wisdom is
however justified of all her Children?</hi> Mat 11. 19.
When some of his Disciples would have had
<hi>Fire from Heaven</hi> upon those rude People that
refused him Entertainment in their Town, he was
so far from complying with the Motion, that he
rebuked it, <hi>Luke 9. 55. Ye know not what manner
of Spirit ye are of. This perswasion cometh not
of him that calleth you, Gal.</hi> 5. 8. The design of
Christ and of his Holy Religion is to shape Men
into a mild and merciful Temper, and to make
them sensibly tender of the Lives and Comforts
even of their worst Enemies. Christianity was
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98022:61"/>
intended to revive Humanity, and to make those
Men, who had made themselves <hi>Beasts.</hi> But
our Lord Jesus did in a more especial manner
evidence his Meekness when he was in his last
sufferings, that <hi>awful Scene.</hi> Tho' he was the
most innocent and the most excellent Person that
ever was, who by the Doctrine he had preach'd,
and the Miracles he had wrought, had richly
deserved all the Honours and Respects that the
World could pay him, and infinitely more, and
tho' the Injuries he received were ingeniously and
industriously contrived to the highest degree of
Affront and Provocation, yet he bore all with an
undisturbed Meekness, and with that Shield
quench'd all the fiery Darts, which his malicious
Enemies shot at him.</p>
                        <p>His Meekness towards his Enemies appear'd,</p>
                        <p>(1.) In what he said to them, not one angry
word, in the midst of all the Indignities they
offer'd him. <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not
again,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 23. When he was buffeted and
spit upon, and abused, he took it all patiently;
one would wonder at the gracious words which
even then proceeded out of his Mouth, witness
that mild reply to him that smote him, <hi>Ioh. 18. 23.

                        </p>
                        <p>(2.) In what he said to God for them; <hi>Father
forgive them,</hi>—so giving an Example to his
own Rule, <hi>Mat. 5. 44. Pray for them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully
use you.</hi> Though he was then deeply
engaged in the most solemn Transaction that
ever pass'd between Heaven and Earth; tho' he
had so much to do with God for himself and his
Friends, yet he did not forget to put up this Prayer
for his Enemies. The mercy he begg'd of God
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98022:61"/>
for them, was the greatest Mercy, that which he
was then dying to purchase and procure, the
pardon of their sins; not only, Father spare them,
or reprieve them, but, <hi>Father forgive them;</hi> the
Excuse he pleaded for them, was the best their
Crime was capable of; <hi>They know not what they
do.</hi> They did it ignorantly, <hi>Acts 3. 27. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 8.
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
                        <p>Now in all these things our Master hath left us
an Example. What is the Practice of Religion,
but the Imitation of God endeavour'd by us? And
what the Principle of it, but the Image of God
renewed in us. We are bid to be followers of
God, <hi>as dear Children.</hi> But this sets the Copy
we are to <hi>write after,</hi> at a mighty distance, for
God is in Heaven, and we are upon Earth, and
therefore in the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ, God incarnate,</hi>
God in our Nature, the Copy is brought among
us, and the transcribing of it, in some measure,
appears more practicable: <hi>He that hath seen me,</hi>
(saith Christ) <hi>hath seen the Father,</hi> John 14. 9.
and so he that imitates Christ, imitates the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Religion which our Lord Jesus came
into the World to establish, being every way so
well calculated for the Peace and Order of the
World, and being design'd to recover the lapsed
Souls of Men from their degenerate State, and to
sweeten their Spirits and Temper, and so to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend
humane Society, and to make it some way
conformable to the blessed Society above, he not
only gave such Precepts as were wonderfully fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to this great end, but recommended them to
the World, by the loveliness and amiableness of
his own Example. Are we not called <hi>Christians</hi>
from Christ, whom we call <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> and
shall we not endeavour to accommodate our
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98022:62"/>
selves to him? We profess to rejoyce in him, as
our Fore-runner, and shall we not run after him?
To what purpose were we listed under his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but that we might follow him as our Leader?
We have all of us reason to say, that Jesus
Christ is very meek, or else we that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
him so much and so often, had been in <hi>Hell</hi>
long ago: We owe it to his Meekness to whom
all Judgment is committed, that we have not
e're this been carryed away with a swift Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and <hi>dealt with according to the desert of
our sins,</hi> which, if duly considered, one would
think should tend greatly to the mollifying of
us. The Apostle fetcheth an Argument from
that Kindness and Love to us, which we our selves
have experienced, who were Foolish and Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
to perswade us to <hi>be gentle, and to shew
all Meekness,</hi> Tit. 3. 2, 3, 4. and he beseecheth the
<hi>Corinthians by the Meekness and Gentleness of
Christ,</hi> as a thing very winning and of dear and
precious account, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 1. Let the same mind
therefore be in us,</hi> not only which was, but
which, as we find to our comfort, <hi>still is in Christ
Iesus,</hi> Phil. 2. 5. That we may not forfeit our
Interest in his Meekness, let us tread in the steps
of it; and as ever we hope to be like him in Glory
hereafter, let us study to be like him in Grace, in
this Grace now. It is a certain Rule, by which
we must all be tried shortly, <hi>That if any Man
hath not the Spirit of Christ,</hi> (that is, if he be
not Spirited, in some measure, as Christ was spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited)
<hi>he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. And if we be
not own'd as his, <hi>we are undone for ever.</hi>

to which the <hi>Scripture</hi> applies this general Rule.</p>
                        <p>1. We must give Reproofs with Meekness. It is
the Apostles Direction, <hi>Gal. 6. 1. If a Man be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in a fault, (i. e.</hi> if he be surpriz'd by a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and overcome, as the best may be, if God
leave them to themselves) <hi>ye which are spiritual,
restore such a one in the Spirit of Meekness.</hi> By
the Spiritual Man, to whom he gives this Rule,
he means not Ministers only, as if none were spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
but they, tho' they perhaps are chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
because they are, as the Prophet speaks,
<hi>Isa. 29. 21. Reprovers in the Gate; i. e.</hi> Reprovers
by Office, yet doubtless it is a Rule to private
Christians; all that have opportunity must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
and all that reprove must do it with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<hi>Ye that are Spiritual,</hi> if you would approve
your selves so indeed, acted by the Holy Spirit,
and minding the things of the Spirit, be careful
in this matter. Especially let those that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of the highest Form, that excel in Grace,
and Holiness, and the best Gifts, (such are call'd
<hi>Spiritual</hi> in distinction from the Babes in Christ,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1.) Let them look upon themselves as obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
in a more peculiar manner, to help others;
for where God gives five Talents, he expects the
improvement of five; the strong must <hi>bear the
infirmities of the weak,</hi> Rom. 15. 1. Do you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>restore such a one, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98022:63"/>
a broken Bone is for the present painful to the
Patient, but it must be done, and it is in order to
the making of <hi>broken Bones to rejoyce.</hi> Now
this you must do with the Spirit of Meekness,
with all the candor, and gentleness, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Evidences of Love and Kindness that can be.
The three Qualifications of a good Surgeon, are
very requisite in a Reprover, <hi>viz.</hi> to have an
<hi>Eagle's Eye,</hi> a <hi>Lion's Heart,</hi> and a <hi>Lady's Hand;</hi>
that is, that he be endued with a great deal of
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>Meekness.</hi> Tho' some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is needful to reprove with warmth, yet
we must never reprove with Wrath, <hi>for the
Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteousness of
God,</hi> Jam. 1. 20. There is an observable Difference,
but no contradiction betwixt the Directions <hi>Paul</hi>
gives to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and those he gives to <hi>Titus</hi> in
this matter. To <hi>Titus</hi> he writes to <hi>reprove sharply,</hi>
Tit. 1. 13. and to rebuke <hi>with all Authority,</hi> Cap. 2.
<hi>v.</hi> 15. To <hi>Timothy</hi> he writes <hi>not to strive,</hi> but <hi>to be
gentle,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 24. to reprove <hi>with all long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi>
Chap. 4. 2. The Reason of which may be
taken either, [1.] From the different Temper of
those they had to deal with. <hi>Timothy</hi> was among
the Ephesians, a tractable complaisant People,
that would be easily managed, and with them he
must always deal gently. <hi>Titus</hi> was among the
Cretians, that were head-strong and rough hewn,
and not to be wrought upon, but by sharper
methods. Thus in reproving, a difference must be
made: Of some we must have compassion, and
others save with Fear, but never with Anger,
plucking them out of the fire, <hi>Iude, ver.</hi> 23. Or,
[2.] The Reason may be taken (as <hi>Gregory,</hi> one
of the Antients, assigneth it) from the different
Temper of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus. Titus</hi> was a Man
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98022:63"/>
of a very soft and mild Temper, and he had need
of a Spur to quicken him to a needful Acrimony
in his Reproofs; but <hi>Timothy</hi> was a Man of a
more warm and sanguine Temper, and he had
need of a Bridle to keep him from an intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
heat in his Reproofs; and then it teacheth us,
that those who are <hi>naturally</hi> keen and fervent,
should double their Guard upon their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
when they are reproving, that they may
do it with all Meekness. Christ's Ministers must
be careful while they display God's Wrath, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
their own, &amp; be very jealous over themselves,
lest sinful Anger shelter it self under the Cloke of
Zeal against sin. When Reproving (whoever be
the Reprover) degenerates into Railing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling,
and Opprobrious Language, how can we
expect the desir'd success? It may provoke to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and every evil Work; but it will never
provoke to Love, and to good Works. The work
of Heaven is not likely to be done by a Tongue
<hi>set on fire of Hell.</hi> Hath Christ need of mad Men?
or will you talk deceitfully and passionately for
him? A Potion given too hot s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and doth more hurt than good, and so many a
Reproof, good for the matter of it, hath been
spoiled by an irregular Management. Meekness
hides the Lancet, gilds the Pill, and makes it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable;
dips the Nail in Oil, and then it drives the
better. Twice we find <hi>Ionathan</hi> reproving his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for his rage against <hi>David;</hi> once he did it with
Meekness, and it sped well, 1 <hi>Sam. 19. 4, 5. Let
not the King sin against his Servant,</hi> [<hi>against Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>]
and 'tis said, <hi>v. 6. Saul hearkned to him.</hi> But
another time his Spirit was provok'd, and he did it
in a heat, <hi>Cap. 20. 32. Wherefore shall he be slain?</hi>
and the issue of it was ill. <hi>Saul</hi> was not only im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>patient
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98022:64"/>
of the Reproof, but enraged at the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and <hi>cast a Iavelin at him,</hi> v. 33. Reproofs are
then likely to answer the intention, when they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
evidence <hi>the good will of the Reprover,</hi> and
are made up <hi>of soft Words and hard Arguments.</hi>
This is to restore with the <hi>Spirit of Meekness,</hi> and
there's a good reason added, <hi>considering thy self;

                        <p>2. We must receive Reproofs with Meekness.
If we do that which deserves Rebuke, and we
meet with those that are so just and kind to give
it us, we must be quiet under it, not quarrelling
with the Reprover, nor objecting against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
nor fretting that we are touch'd in a sore
place, but submit to it, and laying our Souls under

of it; nay, if indeed we be altogether innocent of
that which we are reproved for, yet the Meekness
of Wisdom would teach us to apply the Reproof
to some other fault, which our own Consciences
convict us of: We would not quarrel with a real

which you are to pay a <hi>Deference,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> which

could have broke them as easily as a bruised
Reed, and extinguish'd them as soon as one could
quench the <hi>wiek</hi> of a <hi>Candle</hi> newly lighted, yet
he will not do it, till the day comes when he
shall bring forth <hi>Iudgment unto Victory. Moses</hi>
dealt with a very obstinate and stiff-neck'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>And yet my Doctrine</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall drop as
the Dew, and distil as the small Rain,</hi> Deut. 32. 2.
'Twas not the Wind, nor the Earthquake, nor the
Fire that brought <hi>Elijah</hi> into Temper, (for the
<hi>Lord was not in them</hi>) but the <hi>still small Voice</hi>
did it, when he heard that, he <hi>wrap'd his Face in
his Mantle,</hi> 1 Kin. 19. 11, 12, 13. In dealing with
Gain-sayers, a Spirit of Meekness will teach us
to consider their Temper, Education, Custom, the
Power of Prejudice they Labour under, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of others upon them, and to make Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
accordingly, and not to call (as passionate
Contenders are apt to do) every false Step, an
Apostacy, every Errour and Mistake, nay, every
Misconstrued Misplaced Word, a Heresie, and
every Misdemeanor, no less than <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belion;</hi>
Methods of Proceeding, more likely to
irritate and harden, than to convince and reduce
Gain-sayers. I have heard it observed long since,
<hi>That the Scourge of the Tongue hath driven many
out of the Temple, but never drove any into it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. We must make Profession of the <hi>Hope that
is in us, with Meekness. 1 Pet. 3. 15. Be ready
always to give Answer,</hi> (to make your Defence
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98022:66"/>
or <hi>Apology,</hi> so the word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>)
whether judicially or extrajudicially, as there is
occasion, <hi>to every Man that</hi> (soberly, not scoffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in derision) <hi>asks you a Reason,</hi> or an Account
<hi>of the hope that is in you, i. e.</hi> of the Religion
you profess, which you hope to be saved by,
<hi>with Meekness and Fear.</hi> Observe, it is very well
consistent with Christian Quietness, to appear in
the Defence of Truth, and to avow our Christian
Profession, when at any time we are duly call'd
to it. That is not Meekness, but base Cowardise
that tamely betrays, and delivers up any of
Christ's Truths or Institutions, by silence, as if
we were ashamed or afraid to confess our Master.
But the Office of Meekness at such a time is to
direct us how, and in what manner to bear our
Testimony, not with Pride and Passion, but with
Humility and Mildness. Those that would suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfuly
confess the Truth, must first learn to deny
themselves; And we must give an account of our
Hope, with a Holy Fear of missing it in such a
Critical Juncture. When we give a Reason for
our Religion, we must not boast of our selves, or
of our own Attainments, nor reflect Contempt
and Wrath upon our Persecutors, but remember
that the <hi>present Truth,</hi> (so 'tis call'd, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12)
the Truth which is now to be asserted, is the
same with <hi>the Word of Christ's Patience,</hi> Rev. 3. 10.
<hi>i. e.</hi> the word which must be patiently suffered
for, according to the Example of him, who with
invincible Meekness, (<hi>before Pontius Pilate) wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
a good Confession,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 13. A great <hi>Abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>Diffidence</hi> of our selves may very well
consist with a firm <hi>Assurance</hi> of the Truth, and
a profound <hi>Veneration</hi> for it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:98022:67"/>
In lesser things, wherein wise and good Men
are not all of a mind, Meekness teaches us not to
be too confident that we are in the right, nor to
censure and condemn those that differ us, as if
we were <hi>the People, and Wisdom should die with
us,</hi> but quietly to walk according to the Light
that God hath given us, and charitably to believe
that others do so too, waiting till God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
either this to them, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15.) or that to
us. Let it in such cases suffice to <hi>vindicate our
selves,</hi> which every Man hath a right to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Magisterial Sentencing of others; why
should we be many Masters, when we are all
Offenders, (<hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 1, 2.) and the <hi>Bar</hi> is our place,
not the <hi>Bench?</hi> Meekness will likewise teach us
to manage a singular opinion, wherein we differ
from others, with all possible deference to them,
and suspicion of our selves, not resenting it as an
Affront to be Contradicted, but taking it as a
Kindness to be better inform'd. Nor must we be
angry that our Hope is enquir'd into, even such a
trial of it, if we approve our selves well in it,
may be <hi>sound to Praise, and Honour, and Glory,</hi>
to which our Meekness will very much contribute,
as it puts a lustre upon, and a convincing Power
into the Testimony we bear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we then walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the <hi>vocation wherewith we are called,
when we walk in all lowliness and meekness,</hi>
Eph. 4. 1, 2.</p>
                        <p>5. We must bear Reproaches with Meekness.
Reproach is a branch of that Persecution which
<hi>all that will live godly in Christ Iesus,</hi> must
count upon; and we must submit to it, behaving
our selves quietly, and with a due <hi>decorum,</hi> not
only when <hi>Princes sit and speak against us,</hi> but
even when the <hi>Abjects gather themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98022:67"/>
against us,</hi> and we become the Song of the
<hi>Drunkards.</hi> Sometimes we find it easier to keep
calm in a solemn and expected Engagement, than
in a sudden Skirmish, or a hastly Rencounter, and
therefore even against those slight Attacks, it is
requisite that Meekness be set upon the Guard.
If we be nick-named, and slandered, and have all
manner of Evil said against us falsly, our Rule
is, <hi>Not to be disturbed at it,</hi> nor <hi>to render Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Railing,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 9. but tho' we may, as we
have opportunity, with Meekness deny the <hi>Charge,</hi>
as <hi>Hannab</hi> did when <hi>Eli</hi> overhastily censur'd her
for a Drunkard; <hi>No, my Lord, I have drank neither
Wine nor strong Drink,</hi> 1 Sam. 1. 15. Yet when
that is done, we must without meditating any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
quietly commit our Cause to God, who
will sooner or later, clear up our <hi>Innocency as
the Light,</hi> which is promised, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 5, 6. and
therefore <hi>fret not thy self, but wait patiently,</hi> v. 7.
<hi>cease from Anger, and forsake Wrath,</hi> v. 8. Mr. <hi>Dod</hi>
was wont to charm his Friends into silence under
Reproaches, with this, <hi>That if a Dog bark at a
Sheep, the Sheep will not bark at the Dog again.</hi>
We do but gratifie our great Adversary, and do
his Work for him, when we suffer the Peace and
Serenity of our Minds to be broken in upon, by the
Reproaches of the World: For me to disquiet
my self, and put my self into a Passion, because
another abuseth me, is as if I should scratch up
the Skin of my Face, to fetch off the Dirt which
my Adversary throws in it. When reproaches
provokes our Passions, which put us upon rendring
Bitterness for Bitterness, we thereby lose the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
and forfeit the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reward,</hi> which
the Divine Promise hath annexed to the <hi>Reproach
of Christ,</hi> and shall we suffer <hi>so many things in vain?</hi>
                           <pb n="126" facs="tcp:98022:68"/>
We likewise thereby give occasion to those who
had spoken evil of us <hi>falsly,</hi> to speak evil of us
<hi>truly;</hi> and perhaps our Religion suffers more by
our <hi>Impatience</hi> under the Reproach, than by the
Reproach it self. What have we the Law, and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
and Promise of Christ for, but to calm our
Spirits under Reproaches for well doing? Truly
those can bear but a little for Christ, that cannot
bear a hard or a foul word for him. If we either
faint, or fret in such a <hi>Day of Adversity,</hi> 'tis a
sign our <hi>Strength</hi> is <hi>small</hi> indeed. May it not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
us, that by our Meekness and Quietness
under Reproaches, we engage God for us, who
hath promised, that he will <hi>with Righteousness
judge the Poor,</hi> the poor in Spirit, <hi>and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
with equity for the meck of the Earth,</hi> Isa. 11.
<hi>v.</hi> 4. He that hath bid us <hi>to open our Mouths for
the Dumb,</hi> Pro. 31. 8. will not himself be silent,
<hi>Psa.</hi> 12. 5. And shall we not learn at last, instead of

to be exceeding glad,</hi> Mat. 5. 11, 12. when we suffer
thus for Righteousness sake? May we not put
such Reproaches as Pearls, in our Crown, and be
assured that they will pass well in the Account
another day, when there will be an advantagious
Resurrection of <hi>Names,</hi> as well as <hi>Bodies,</hi> in the
prospect of which, we have reason to rejoyce,
<hi>That we are counted worthy to suffer shame for

which we are govern'd by, and act

corrupt <hi>Principles,</hi> which angry froward People
are guided by; such as these, <hi>That the forgiving

                              </gap>.</note> whereas it often qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies
an Adversary; or if otherwise, the forgiving
of one Offence, will enable us to bear the next
the more easily. And that <hi>we must have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
given us for every wrong done us,</hi> whereas
if we have not <hi>Satisfaction for it,</hi> yet if it be not
our own Fault, we may have <hi>Satisfaction under
it,</hi> and that's as good. And, <hi>That there's no living
in the World without buffing, and hectoring, and
frightning People; Oderint dum metuant;</hi> whereas
to live continually in that Element, is to live in
a Hell upon Earth; mutual <hi>Indignation</hi> and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<hi>Fear</hi> perhaps contributing to the Torment
of Devils and damned Spirits: But, in opposition
to these and the like ill Principles, shall we
treasure up these few good Truths, chosen out of
<hi>many</hi> which might be mentioned proper for this
purpose, and make use of them, as there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion?</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>That he hath the sweetest and surest Peace,
who is the most Master of his own Passions.</hi> The
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98022:69"/>
comfort that a Man hath in governing himself, is
much greater than he could have in having Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to serve him, and Nations to <hi>bow down</hi> to him.
It is certain the worst Enemies we have, if ever
they break loose and get head, are in our own
<hi>Bosoms.</hi> Enemies <hi>without</hi> threaten only the <hi>evil
of pain; they can</hi> but <hi>kill the Body,</hi> and no great
hurt in that to a Child of God, if they do not
provoke the Enemies <hi>within,</hi> our own irregular
<hi>Passions,</hi> which if they be not kept under, plunge
us in the <hi>evil of sin,</hi> and that's the much greater
evil. An <hi>Invasion</hi> from Abroad doth not so much
disturb the Peace of a Kingdom, as an <hi>Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
at Home doth; and therefore it concerns
us to double our Guard, where our danger is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
and above <hi>all keepings,</hi> to keep our Hearts,
that no Passion be allowed to stir without <hi>a good
reason</hi> to be given for it, and a good use to be
made of it; and then if we be <hi>troubled on every
side, yet not distressed, perplexed, yet not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,</hi>
2 Cor. 4. 8, 9. <hi>Offended</hi> by our Fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
but not <hi>offending</hi> our Master; reproached
by our Neighbours but not by our own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
this is like <hi>Zion</hi>'s Peace, <hi>Peace within the
Walls,</hi> Psa. 122. 7. We have need to pray as one
did, <hi>Liberame à malo isto homine, meipso;</hi> Lord
deliver me from that ill Man, mine own self, and
then I am safe enough. The <hi>Lusts that war in
our Members,</hi> Jam. 4. 1. are the <hi>Enemies that war
against our Souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 11. If this War be
brought to a good issue, and those Enemies sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
whatever other Disturbances are given, Peace
is in the Soul <hi>with Grace and Mercy from God,
and from the Lord Iesus. Nehemiah</hi> was aware
of this, as the design of his Enemies, when they
hired a pretended Prophet to give an Alarm, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98022:69"/>
to advise him meanly to shift for himself, it was
(saith he) <hi>Neh. 6. 13. That I should be afraid and
do so, and sin.</hi> Whatever we lose, we shall not
lose our Peace, if we do but keep our Integrity;
therefore instead of being solicitous to subdue
our Enemies that lay Siege to us, let us double
our watch against the <hi>Traitors</hi> within the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,</hi>
from whom especially our danger is; since
we cannot prevent the shooting of the <hi>fiery Darts,</hi>
let us have our <hi>Shield</hi> ready, wherewith to quench
them. If we would not <hi>hurt</hi> our selves, blessed
be God no Enemy in the World can hurt us. Let
us but keep the Peace within, by the governing
of our own Passions, and then whatever assaults
may be made upon us, we may therein, with the
<hi>Daughter of</hi> Zion, <hi>despise them, and laugh them
to scorn, and shake our Head at them,</hi> [allud.] <hi>Isa.</hi>
37. 22. Let us believe, that in hurrying and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
times, <hi>our strength is to sit still,</hi> in a holy
Quietness and Composure of Mind; <hi>This is the
rest, wherewith you may cause the weary to rest;
and this is the refreshing,</hi> and it is enough, <hi>Isa.</hi>
28. 12.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>That in many things we all offend.</hi> This truth
we have, <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 2. and it comes in as a reason
why we must not be <hi>many Masters, v.</hi> 1. It would
help to subdue and moderate our Anger, at the
Offences of others, if we would but consider,</p>
                        <p>[1.] That it is <hi>incident to humane Nature to
offend.</hi> While we are in this World, we must
not expect to converse with Angels, or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of just Men made perfect; no, we are oblig'd
to a Communication with Creatures that are
foolish and corrupt, peevish and provoking, and
who are all <hi>subject to like Passions;</hi> such as these
we must live among, else must we <hi>needs go out
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98022:70"/>
of the World.</hi> And have we not reason then to
count upon something or other, uneasie an dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
in all Relations and Conversations. The
best Men have their roughnesses and unevennesses
in this imperfect state; those that are savingly
enlightned, yet knowing but <hi>in part,</hi> have their
<hi>blind side;</hi> the <hi>Harmony,</hi> even of the Communion
of Saints, will sometimes be disturbed with <hi>jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
strings; why then should we be surpriz'd
into Passion and Disquiet, when that which gives
us the Disturbance, is no more than what we
look'd for? Instead of being angry, we should
think with our selves, thus; Alas! what could I
expect but Provocation, from corrupt and fallen
Man? Among such foolish Creatures as we are,
<hi>it must needs be, that Offences will come;</hi> and why
should not I have my share of those Offences?
The God of Heaven gives this as a reason of his
Patience towards a provoking World, that it is
in their Nature to be provoking, <hi>Gen. 8. 21. I will

Creatures, but sinful, and bent to backslide. <hi>Do
Men gather Grapes of Thorns? I knew that thou
wouldst deal treacherously, for thou wast called a
Transgressor from the Womb,</hi> Isa. 48. 8. And should
not we, much more, be qualified by the same
consideration? <hi>If thou seest the violent perverting
of Iudgment and Iustice in a Province,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what a provoking Creature sinful Man is,
and then thou wilt not <hi>marvel at the matter,</hi> Eccl.
5. 8. The consideration of the common Infirmity
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98022:70"/>
and Corruption of Mankind, should be made use
of, not to excuse our own Faults to our selves,
which doth take off the edge of our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and is the poor Subterfuge of a deceived
Heart; but to excuse the faults of others, and
so take off the edge of our Passion and Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,

For <hi>oftentimes also thine own Heart</hi> (which is
instead of a thousand Witnesses) <hi>knoweth that
thou thy self likewise hath cursed others.</hi> The
penitent remembrance of that former guilt, would
greatly help to curb the passionate Resentment of
the present <hi>Trouble.</hi> When the undutiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Son (in a Story that I once read) drag'd
his Father by the Hair of the Head to the House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door,
it qualified the Anger of the old Man, to
remember, that just so far he had drag'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

that he was now treated no otherwise, than he
had formerly treated others, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                        <p>3. That <hi>Men are God's Hand:</hi> So it is said,

Lord,</hi> or rather, <hi>Tools,</hi> in thy Hand, so <hi>v.</hi> 13. which

that whatever it is that crosseth us, or is
displeasing to us, at any time, God hath an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
hand in it. <hi>David</hi> was govern'd by this
Principle, when he bore <hi>Shimei</hi>'s spiteful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
with such an invincible Patience, <hi>So
let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto
him, Curse</hi> David, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10. and <hi>v. 11. Let
him alone, for the Lord hath bidden him.</hi> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
will not only silence our Murmurings
against God, [the Author] but all our Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
with Men, [the Instruments of our Trouble
and Vexation. Men's Reproaches are God's
Rebukes, and whoever he be that affronts me,
I must see and say, that therein my Father cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
me. This quieted the Spirit of <hi>Iob,</hi> in
reference to the Injuries of the <hi>Caldeans</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans,</hi>
though he dwelt as a <hi>King in the Army,</hi>
chap. 29. 25. and his Power and Interest seem to
have been <hi>unstain'd,</hi> when those Rapparees first
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98022:71"/>
made that inroad upon him, and so he could
not but see his help in the Gate, yet we find
him not meditating any Revenge, but charming
the Disturbances of his own Soul, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of God's Sovereign disposal, overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Instruments of his Trouble, thoughts
of which would but have mingled <hi>Anger</hi> (the
more disquieting Passion) with his <hi>Sorrow;</hi> this
therefore sufficeth to still the storm, <hi>The Lord
gave, and the Lord hath taken away, Blessed be the
name of the Lord,</hi> chap. 1. 21. When his Brethren
stood aloof from him, his Kindred and his Friends
looked scornfully upon him, <hi>as an Alien,</hi> and
instead of Oil pour'd Vinegar into his Wounds,
so that his <hi>Eye continued in their Provocation,</hi>
yet even in that part of his Trouble he owns the
hand of God, <hi>Chap. 19. 13. He hath put my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
far from me.</hi> It is a very quieting Truth,
(the Lord help us to mix Faith with it) That
<hi>every Creature is that to us, and no more, that
God makes it to be;</hi> and that while many seek the
Ruler's Favour, and more perhaps fear the
Ruler's Displeasure, <hi>Every Man's Iudgment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from the Lord.</hi> Would we but more
closely observe, and readily own the Hand of
God, in that which disquiets and provokes us,
surely, though we regarded not Man, yet if we
had any fear of God before our Eyes, that would
reconcile us better to it, and suppress all intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
and undue Resentments. In snarling at
the Stone, we reflect upon the Hand that
throws it, and lay our selves under the Woe
pronounced against him, <hi>that strivos with his
Maker,</hi> Isa. 45. 9. We know it is interpreted,
<hi>a taking up Arms against the King,</hi> if we take
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98022:72"/>
up Arms against any that are commissioned by
him.</p>
                        <p>4. That <hi>there is no Provocation given us at
any time, but, if it be skilfully and graciously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
there is good to be gotten by it.</hi> If we
have but that Wisdom of the Prudent, which is
<hi>to understand his way,</hi> and all the Advantages
and Opportunities of it, doubtless we may,
quite contrary to the intention of those that tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
against us, gain some <hi>spiritual,</hi> that is,
some <hi>real</hi> Benefit to our Souls, by the Injuries
and Offences that are done to us, for even these
are made to <hi>work together for good to them that
love God.</hi> This is a Holy and a Happy way of
opposing our Adversaries, and resisting evil.
'Tis an ill Weed indeed out of which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<hi>Bee</hi> cannot extract something profitable,
and for it's purpose. Whatever Lion roars
against us, let us but go in the Strength and
Spirit of the Lord, as <hi>Samson</hi> did, and we may
not only <hi>rend it as a Kid,</hi> so that it shall do
us no real harm, but we may withal get <hi>Meat
out of the Eater, and Sweetness out of the
Strong.</hi> As it turns to the unspeakable Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of many that they look upon Reproofs as
Reproaches, and treat them accordingly with
Anger and Displeasure; so it would turn to our
unspeakable Advantage, if we could but learn
to call Reproaches <hi>Reproofs,</hi> and make use of
them as such, for our Conviction and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
and thus the Reproach of Christ, may
become true Riches to us, and greater than
the <hi>Treasures of Aegypt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We are told of an Imposthume that was
cured with the thrust of an Enemies Sword, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98022:72"/>
of one that was happily converted from
Drunkenness, by being called, in Reproach, a
<hi>Tipler.</hi> It is very possible we may be inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or humbled, or reformed, may be brought
nearer to God, or weaned from the World, may
be furnished with matter for Repentance, or
Prayer, or Praise, by the Injuries that are done
us, and may be much furthered in our way to
Heaven, by that which was intended for an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front

angry at the Man that meant us ill, we should
rather be thankful to the God, that intended us

kept <hi>Ioseph</hi> in that good Temper towards his
Brethren, tho' he had occasion enough to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with them, <hi>Gen. 50. 20. You thought evil
against me, but God meant it unto good.</hi> This
satisfied <hi>Paul,</hi> in reference to the <hi>Thorn in the
Flesh, i. e.</hi> the Calumnies and Oppositions of
the false Apostles, which touch'd him more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
than all the Efforts of persecuting Rage;
that it was intended to hide Pride from him,
<hi>lest he should be exalted above measure, with the
abundance of Revelations,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 7. and
there seems to be an instance of that good

                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:98022:73"/>
We should be apt to think too highly of
our selves, and too kindly of the World, if we
did not meet with some Injuries and Contempts,
by which we are taught to cease from Man. Did
we but more carefully study the <hi>Improvement</hi> of
an Injury, we should not be so apt to desire the
<hi>Revenge</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>That what is said and done in haste, is likely
to be matter for a deliberate Repentance.</hi> We
find <hi>David</hi> often remembring with regret, what
he <hi>said in his haste,</hi> particularly one angry
word he had said in the day of his Distress
and Trouble, which seem'd to reflect upon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
and indeed upon all that had given him
any Encouragement to hope for the Kingdom,
<hi>Psal. 116. 11. I said in my haste, All Men are
Liars;</hi> and this hasty word, was a grief to him
long after. <hi>He that hasteth with his Feet sinneth,
Prov.</hi> 19. 2. When a Man is transported by
Passion, into any Indecency, we commonly
qualifie it with this, that he is a little <hi>hasty,</hi> as
if there were no harm in that, but we see there
is harm in it; he that is in haste may contract
much guilt in a little time. What we say or
do unadvisedly when we are hot, we must
unsay and undoe again when we are cool, or do
worse. Now who would wilfully do that, which
sooner or later he <hi>must</hi> repent of? A Heathen that
was tempted to a chargeable Sin, could resist the
Temptation with this consideration, That he
would not buy Repentance so dear. Is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
such a pleasant Work that we should so
industriously <hi>treasure up unto our selves wrath
against the day of wrath,</hi> either the day of
God's Wrath against us, or our own against
our selves. You little think what a Torrent
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98022:73"/>
of Self-affliction you let in when you let the
Reins loose to an immoderate ungovern'd Passion.
You are angry at others, and reproach them,
and call them hard Names, and are ready to
abhor them, and to revenge your selves upon
them, and your corrupt Nature takes a strange
kind of Pleasure in this. But do you know that
all this will at last rebound in your own Faces,
and return into your own Bosoms? Either here
or in a worse Place, you must repent of all
this, that is, you must turn all these Passions
upon <hi>your selves,</hi> you must be <hi>angry</hi> at your
selves, and <hi>reproach</hi> your selves, and call your
selves <hi>Fools,</hi> and <hi>abhor</hi> your selves, and smite
upon your own Breasts; nay, and if God give
you Grace, take a Holy Revenge upon your
selves (which is reckoned among the Products
of <hi>godly sorrow,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 11.) and what can be
more uneasie than all this? You take a mighty
Liberty in chiding those that you have under
your Power, and giving them very ill-favoured
Language, because you know they dare not chide
you again; but dare not your own Hearts smite
you, and your Consciences chide you? And is it
not easier to bear the Chidings of any Man in
the World, (which may either be avoided, or
answered, or slighted) than to bear the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of our own Consciences, which, as
we cannot get out of the hearing of, so we
cannot make a light matter of; for when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is awake it will be heard, and will tell
us home, wherein <hi>we are verily guilty concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
our Brother,</hi> Gen. 42. 21. Let this Thought
therefore quiet our Spirits, when they begin to
be tumultuous, that hereby we shall but make
work for Repentance; whereas, on the contrary,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98022:74"/>
as <hi>Abigail</hi> suggested to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 30, 31.
The bearing and forgiving of an Injury, will be
no trouble or grief of Mind afterwards. Let
Wisdom and Grace therefore do that which
Time will do however, cool our Heat, and take
off the Edge of our Resentment.</p>
                        <p>6. That <hi>that is truly best for us which is most
pleasing and acceptable to God, and that a meek
and quiet Spirit is so.</hi> No Principle hath such
a commanding influence upon the Soul, as that
which hath a regard to God, and wherein we
approve our selves to him. It was a good hint
which the Woman of <hi>Tekoah</hi> gave to <hi>David,</hi>
when she was sueing for a Merciful Sentence,
2 <hi>Sam. 14. 11. I pray thee, let the King remember
the Lord thy God:</hi>—Nor could any thought
be more mollifying than that. Remember how
gracious, and merciful, and patient God is, how
slow to anger, how ready to forgive, and how
well pleased he is to see his People like him:
Remember the Eye of thy God upon thee, the
Love of thy God towards thee, and the Glory
of thy God set before thee. Remember how much
it is thy concern to be accepted of God, and to
walk worthy of thy relation to him, unto all well-pleasing,
and how much Meekness and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Spirit, doth contribute to this, as it is
consonant to that excellent Religion which our
Lord Jesus hath establish'd, and as it renders the
Heart a fit Habitation for the blessed Spirit, <hi>This
is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
to lead quiet and peaceable Lives,</hi> 1 Tim.
2. 2, 3. It is a good evidence of our Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
to God, if we be cordially reconciled to
every cross Providence, which necessarily includes
a meek Behaviour towards those who are any
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98022:74"/>
way Instrumental in the Cross. Very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
doth St. <hi>Austin</hi> express it (in <hi>Psal.</hi> 122.)
<hi>Quis placet Deo? cui Deus placuerit.</hi> Those
<hi>please</hi> God that are pleased with him, and with
all he doth, whether immediately by his own
hand, or mediately by the Agency of provoking
injurious Men. This is standing compleat in all
the Will of God, not only his commanding, but
his disposing Will, saying it, without Reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy,
<hi>The Will of the Lord be done.</hi>—He
that acts from an Honest Principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to God, and sincerely desires to stand
right in his Favour, cannot but be in some
measure adorn'd with that meek and quiet
Spirit, which he knows to be in the <hi>sight of God
of great price.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such as these are softning Principles, and as
<hi>many as walk according to these Rules, Peace shall
be upon them, and Mercy,</hi> and no doubt it shall
be upon the <hi>Israel</hi> of God.</p>

1. <hi>Sit loose to the World, and to every thing
in it.</hi> The more the World is crucified <hi>to</hi> us,
the more our corrupt Passions will be crucified
<hi>in</hi> us. If we would keep calm and quiet, we must
by Faith live above the <hi>stormy Region.</hi> It is
certain, those that have any thing, or have any
thing to do in the World, cannot but meet with
that every day from those with whom they
deal, which will cross and provoke them; and
if the Affections be set upon these things, and
we be fill'd with a prevailing Concern about
them, as the <hi>principal</hi> Things, those Crosses
must needs pierce to the quick, and enflame the
Soul, and that which toucheth us in these
things, toucheth us in the <hi>Apple of our Eye.</hi>
If the <hi>Appetites</hi> be carryed out inordinately
towards those things that are pleasing to
Sense, the Passions will be to the very same
degree, carry'd out against those that are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing.
And therefore (Christians) whatever
you have of the World <hi>in your Hands,</hi> be it
more or less, as you tender the Peace as well
as the Purity of your Souls, keep it <hi>out of
your Hearts,</hi> and evermore let out your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
towards your Possessions, Enjoyments,
and Delights in the World with a due Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Disappointment and Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which probably you will meet with in
them, and let that restrain and give check to
their Inordinacy.</p>
                        <p>It is the excellent Advice of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we take a pleasure in, to consider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing, and to proportion our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
accordingly: <gap reason="foreign">

If thou art in love with a <hi>China-Cup,</hi> or a <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice-Glass,</hi>
                           <pb n="141" facs="tcp:98022:75"/>
love it as a piece of brittle Ware,
and then the breaking of it will be no great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
nor put thee into any disturbing Passion,
for it is but what thou didst expect. Those that
Idolize any thing in this World, will be greatly
discomposed, if they be cross'd in it. The
Money which <hi>Micha</hi>'s Mother had, was her
God, (it is Bishop <hi>Hall's</hi> Note) before it had
the shape either of a Graven or a Molten
Image, else the loss of it would not have set
her a cursing, as it seems it did, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. 2.
Those that are greedy of Gain, trouble their
own Hearts, as well as their own Houses, <hi>Pro.</hi>
15. 27. They are a burthen to themselves, and
a Terror to all about them. They that will be
rich, that are resolved upon it, come what will,
cannot but fall into these <hi>foolish and hurtful
lusts,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 9. And those also that <hi>serve their
own Bellies,</hi> that are pleased with nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be wound up to the height of Pleasure-ableness,
that are like <hi>the tender and delicate Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that would not set so much as the Sole of her
Foot to the Ground, for Tenderness and Delicacy,</hi>
lye very open to that which is disquieting, and
cannot, without a great Disturbance to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
bear a Disappointment: And therefore
<hi>Plutarch</hi> (that great Moralist) prescribes it for
the Preservation of our Meekness, <q> Not to be
curious in Diet, or Cloaths,<note place="margin">Ne quare molliane tibi contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant dura. Phurant.</note> or Attendance;
for <hi>(saith he)</hi> they who need but few things,
are not liable to Anger, if they be disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of many.</q>

                        <p>Would we but learn in these things to cross
our selves, we should not be so apt to take it
heinously if another crosseth us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Method of the Lessons in Christ's
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98022:76"/>
School, is first to <hi>deny our selves,</hi> and then to
<hi>take up our Cross,</hi> Matth. 16. 24. We must also
mortifie the desire of the <hi>Applause</hi> of Men, as
altogether Impertinent to our True Happiness.
If we have learnt not to value our selves by
their <hi>good word,</hi> we shall not much disturb our
selves for their <hi>ill word.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> bore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
with so much Meekness, because he
did not build upon the Opinion of Man, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it a small thing to be <hi>judged of Man's day,</hi>
1 Cor. 4. 3.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Be often repenting of your sinful Passion,
and renewing your Covenants against it.</hi> If our
rash Anger were more bitter to us in the <hi>Reflection,</hi>
afterwards we should not be so apt to <hi>Relapse</hi>
into it. <hi>Repentance</hi> in general, if it be sound
and deep, and grounded in true Contrition and
Humiliation, is very <hi>meekning,</hi> and disposeth
the Soul to bear Injuries with abundance of
Patience. Those that live a <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi>
(as we have every one of us reason to do) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but live a quiet Life; for no body can
lightly say worse of the true Penitent, than he
saith of himself. Call him a <hi>Fool</hi> (an Affront
which many think deserves a Challenge) the
humble Soul can bear it patiently with this
thought, <hi>Yea, a Fool I am,</hi> and I have call'd my
self so many a time; <hi>more brutish than any Man;
I have not the Understanding of a Man,</hi> Prov.
30. 2. But Repentance doth, in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
dispose us to Meekness, when it fastens upon
any irregular inordinate Passion, with which we
have been transported. <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> for our
former Transgressions in this matter, will <hi>work
a carefulness</hi> in us, not again to Transgress. If
others be causelesly or excessively angry with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98022:76"/>
me, am not I justly requited for the like or
more indecent Passions. Charge it home there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with Sorrow and Shame upon your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
aggravating the Sin, and laying load
upon your selves for it, and you will find that
<hi>the burnt Child,</hi> especially while the pain is
smarting, <hi>will dread the Fire;</hi> compare <hi>Iob</hi> 42. 6.
with ch. 40. 46.</p>
                        <p>With our Repentance for our former unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we must engage our selves by a firm Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
in the strength of the Grace of Jesus
Christ to be more mild and gentle for the future.
Say, <hi>You will take heed to your ways that you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
not,</hi> as you have done, <hi>with your Tongue;</hi> and
be often remembring that you said so, as <hi>David</hi>
doth, <hi>Psalm 39. 1. Resolution</hi> would do much
towards the conquering of the most rugged Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the quiet bearing of the greatest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;
it would be like the <hi>Bit and Bridle to
the Horse and Mule, that have no Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
It may be of good use every Morning to
renew a Charge upon our Affections to <hi>keep the
Peace,</hi> and having welcom'd Christ in Faith and
Meditation, let no rude unruly Passion <hi>stir up or
awake our Love.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Keep out of the way of Provocation, and
stand upon your Guard against it.</hi> While we
are so very apt to offend in this matter, we have
need to pray (and to practise accordingly)
<hi>Lord, lead us not into Temptation.</hi>—Those
are Enemies to themselves and to their own

and dig up Mischief; but meek and
quiet People will on the contrary, studiously
avoid even that which is justly provoking, and
will see it as if they saw it not. Those that
would not be angry, must wink at that which
would stir up Anger, or put a favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
upon it. The Advice of the Wise Man
is very good to the purpose, <hi>Eccles. 7. 21. Also
take no heed to all Words that are spoken, lest
thou hear thy Servant curse thee;</hi> and 'tis better
for thee not to hear it,<note place="margin">Non vis esse iracundus? ne sis curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osus Sen.</note> unless thou couldst hear
it patiently, and not be provoked to sin in the
hearing of it. 'Tis a common Story of <hi>Coty's,</hi>
that being presented with a Cupboard of curious
Glasses, he return'd his Thanks to his Friend that
sent them, and gratified the Messenger that
brought them, and then deliberately broke them
all, lest by the casual breaking of them severally,
he should be provok'd to Passion. And <hi>Dion</hi>
relates it, to the honour of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s Cabinet of Letters coming to his hand,
he would not read them, because he was his
Enemy, and he would be likely to find in them,
that which would increase the Quarrel; and
therefore (as Dr. <hi>Reynold</hi>'s expresses it) he chose
rather to make a Fire on his <hi>Hearth,</hi> than in his
<hi>Heart; De non existentibus &amp; non apparren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus
eadem est ratio:</hi> Keep the Injury out of
sight, and it will be out of mind.</p>
                        <p>But seeing <hi>Briars and Thorns are with us,</hi> and
<hi>we dwell among Scorpions</hi> (so the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
2. 6.) and it must needs be, <hi>that Offences will
come,</hi> let us be so much the more careful, as we
are when we go with a Candle among Barrels
of Gunpowder, and exercise our selves to have
Consciences <hi>void of Offence,</hi> not apt to offend
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98022:77"/>
others, nor to resent the Offences of others.
When we are at any time engaged in Business or
Company, where we foresee Provocation, we
must double our Watch, and be more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
circumspect. <hi>I will keep my Mouth with
a Bridle,</hi> (saith <hi>David) i. e.</hi> with a particular
actual care and diligence, <hi>while the Wicked is
before me,</hi> and frequent Acts will confirm the
good <hi>Disposition,</hi> and bring it to a <hi>Habit. Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
adviseth, <q>To set some time to our selves
for special strictness: So many Days or Weeks
in which, whatever Provocations do occur,
we will not suffer our selves to be disturbed
by them.</q> And thus he supposeth, by degrees,
the Habit of vicious Anger, may be conquer'd
and subdued. But after all, the <hi>Grace of Faith</hi>
hath the surest influence upon the Establishment
and Quietness of the Spirit: Faith acted upon
the <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Meekness</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the
<hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Commands</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi>
the <hi>Promises</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi>
and <hi>Quietness</hi> of the upper World; this is the
approved <hi>Shield,</hi> with which we may be able <hi>to
quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked one,</hi> and
all his wicked Instruments.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Learn to pause.</hi> It is a good Rule, as in
our Communion with God, so in our Converse
with Men, <hi>Eccl. 5. 2. Be not rash with thy Mouth,
and let not thine Heart be hasty to utter any thing.</hi>
When we are at any time provok'd, Delays may
be as <hi>advantagious,</hi> as in other cases they are <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
The discretion of a Man deferreth his Anger,</hi>

When we begin at any time to be froward and
unquiet, we must lift up a Prayer to him that
stilleth the Noise of the Sea, for that Grace
which establisheth the Heart. When <hi>David</hi>'s
Heart was hot within him, the first word that
broke out was a Prayer, <hi>Psa.</hi> 39. 3, 4. When we
are surprized by a Provocation, and begin to be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98022:78"/>
in a ferment upon it, it will not only be a present
Diversion, but a Sovereign Cure to lift up an
Ejaculation to God for Grace and Strength to
resist and overcome the Temptation: <hi>Lord, keep
me quiet now! Let your Requests in this matter,
be made known to God; and the Peace of God shall
keep your Hearts and Minds,</hi> Phil. 4. 6, 7. You are
ready enough to complain of unquiet People
about you; but you have more reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of unquiet Passions within you; the other
are but Thorns in the Hedge, these are <hi>Thorns

Lord, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. with Faith, and
Fervency, and Constancy, you shall receive <hi>Grace

                        </p>

you have made in Meekness. Provocations
recur every day, such as have been wont perhaps,
to put you into a Passion, these give you an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to make the Trial. Do you find that
you are less subject to Anger, and when angry,
that you are less transported by it than formerly,
that your apprehension of Injuries is less quick,
and your Resentments less keen than usual? Is
the little Kindom of your <hi>Mind</hi> more quiet than
it hath been, and the <hi>discontented Party</hi> weakned
and kept under? 'Tis well if it be so, and a
good sign that the <hi>Soul prospereth, and is in
Health.</hi> We should examine every Night, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we have been quiet all Day? we shall sleep

Routs, and Breaches of the Peace,</hi> aud let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Psal. 18. 23. And yet if the Children of
God bring forth these Fruits of the Spirit <hi>in old
Age,</hi> when commonly Men are most froward
and peevish, it shews not only, that they are
upright, but rather <hi>that the Lord is upright,</hi> in
whose strength they stand, that he <hi>is their Rock,</hi>
in whom they have cast Anchor, and there <hi>is no
unrighteousness in him,</hi> Psal. 92. 14, 15.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Delight in the Company of meek and quiet
Persons. Solomon</hi> prescribes it as a preservative
against foolish Passion, <hi>to make no Friendship with
an angry Man, lest thou learn his way,</hi> Prov. 22.
24, 25. When thy Neighbours Heart is on fire,
it's time to look to thy own. But Man is a soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creature, and cut out for Converse; let us
therefore, since we must have some Company,
chuse to have <hi>Fellowship with those that are meek
and quiet,</hi> that we may learn their way, <hi>for it is
a good way.</hi> The Wolf is no Companion for the
Lamb, nor the Leopard for the Kid, till they
have forgot to hurt and destroy. Company is
<hi>assimilating,</hi> and we are apt insensibly to grow
like those with whom we ordinarily converse,
especially with whom we delight to converse,
therefore let the quiet in the Land, be the <hi>Men
of our choice,</hi> especially into standing <hi>Relations</hi>
                           <pb n="149" facs="tcp:98022:79"/>
and <hi>Bosom-friendship.</hi> Observe in others, how
sweet and amiable <hi>Meekness</hi> is, and what a
Heaven upon Earth those enjoy that have
the command of their own Passions; and
study to transcribe such Copies.—There
are those that take a pleasure in huffing and
hectoring Company, and are never well but
when they are in the midst of Noise and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
sure Heaven would not be Heaven to
such, for that is a calm and quiet Region;
no noise there but what is Sweet and Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi>Study the Cross of our Lord Iesus.</hi>—Did
we but know more of Jesus Christ, <hi>and
him crucified,</hi> we should experience more of the
<hi>Fellowship of his Sufferings.</hi> Think often <hi>how,</hi>
and in what manner he suffered; see him <hi>led as
a Lamb to the Slaughter,</hi> and arm your selves
with the same <hi>Mind.</hi> Think also <hi>why,</hi> and for
what end he suffered, that you may not in any
thing contradict the design of your dying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
nor receive his Grace in vain. Christ
died as the great Peace-maker, to take down all
<hi>Partition-Walls,</hi> to quench all threatning <hi>Flames,</hi>
and to reconcile his Followers, not only to God,
but one to another, by the <hi>slaying of all Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
Eph. 2. 14, 16. The Apostle often prescribes a
believing regard to the sufferings of Christ, as a
powerful allay to all sinful and intemperate
Heats, as <hi>Eph. 5. 2. Phil. 2. 5, &amp;c.</hi> Those that would
<hi>shew forth the meek and humble Life of Christ, in
their mortal Bodies,</hi> must <hi>bear about with them
continually the dying of the Lord Iesus,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 10.
The Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, in which we
shew forth the <hi>Lord's Death,</hi> and the <hi>New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
in his Blood, must therefore be improved
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98022:80"/>
by us for this blessed end, as a <hi>Love-feast,</hi> at which
all our sinful Passions must be laid aside, and a
<hi>Marriage-feast,</hi> where the <hi>Ornament of a meek and
quiet Spirit</hi> is a considerable part of the <hi>Wedding-Garment.</hi>
The forgiving of Injuries, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
to our Brother is both a necessary
Branch of our Preparation for that Ordinance,
and a good evidence and instance of our profiting
by it. If God hath there spoken Peace to us,
let not us go away and speak War to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
The <hi>Year of Release</hi> under the Law, which
put an end to all Actions, Suits and Quarrels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun

the <hi>Iubilee-Trumpet</hi> sounded.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi>Converse much in your Thoughts with the
dark and silent Grave.</hi> You meet with many things
now that disturb and disquiet you, and much ado
you have to bear them; think how quiet Death
will make you, and how uncapable of resenting
or resisting Injuries, and what an easie prey this
Flesh you are so jealous for, will shortly be to
the <hi>Worm,</hi> that shall feed sweetly on it. You
will e're long be out of the reach of Provocation,
there where the wicked cease <hi>from troubling,</hi> and
where their Envy and their Hatred is for ever
<hi>perished.</hi> And is not a quiet Spirit, the best Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
for that quiet State? Think how all these
things, which now disquiet us, will appear when
we come to look Death in the Face; how small
and inconsiderable they seem to one that is step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
into Eternity. Think, what need is there that
I should so ill resent an Affront or Injury, that am
but a Worm to day, and, may be Worms Meat to
morrow. They say, <hi>when Bees fight, the throwing
up of Dust among them, quickly parts the Fray.</hi>

The <hi>Iews</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> a place of Learning and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
thought themselves more <hi>knowing</hi> than the

to suppose that <hi>the Chief</hi> of the Jews there who
had the greatest Advantages of Education and
Correspondence, were the most intelligent: It
might also be justly expected that upon the first
notices of the Gospel, the <hi>Iews</hi> should have been
of all People most ready to acquaint themselves
with a Religion which was so much the Honour
and Perfection of <hi>their own:</hi> And yet it seems,
the <hi>Iews,</hi> the <hi>chief</hi> of the Jews at <hi>Rome</hi> knew no
more of Christianity but this, that it was a <hi>Sect

But we find <hi>v.</hi> 24. that it prov'd otherwise;
after all, there were those that <hi>believed not,</hi> and
the Text intimates the reason of their Infidelity,
they came to hear the word under a <hi>Prejudice;</hi>
They had already imbib'd an ill opinion of the
way, which right or wrong they resolved to

Divine Grace got over this stumbling Block,

the way which they call Heresy,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
Acts 24. 14.) <hi>so worship I the God of my Fathers,—The

Acts</hi> 24. 5. it's call'd <hi>this way, Acts.</hi> 9. 2. and
<hi>that way, Acts</hi> 19. 9. as if it were a <hi>By-path</hi> out

Godliness is still look'd upon by many as a <hi>Sect</hi>
that is a Party-business, and a piece of affected
<hi>singularity</hi> in Opinion and Practice tending to
promote some carnal <hi>Design,</hi> by creating and
supporting invidious <hi>Distinctions</hi> among Men.
This is the proper notion of a <hi>Sect,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Masters and Maintainers of Sects are
justly in an <hi>ill Name,</hi> as Enemies to the great
Corporation of <hi>Mankind;</hi> but there is not the
least colour of Reason to put this invidious and
scandalous Character upon the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
However, it may be mistaken and misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
it is very far from being really a
<hi>Sect.</hi> There were Sects of Religion among the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98022:87"/>
Jews; we read of the <hi>Sect of the Sadducees,</hi> Acts
5. 17. which was built upon <hi>peculiar notions,</hi>
such as overturn'd the foundation of <hi>Natural</hi>
Religion, by denying a future state of <hi>Rewards</hi>
and <hi>Punishments:</hi> There was also the <hi>Sect of the
Pharisees,</hi> Acts 15. 5. the <hi>straitest Sect</hi> of their
<hi>Religion,</hi> Acts 26. 5. which was founded in the
observance and imposition of <hi>singular</hi> Rites and
Customs, with an affected <hi>separation</hi> from, and
<hi>contempt</hi> of all Mankind: These were <hi>Sects:</hi>
But there is nothing of the Spirit and Genius
of these in the Christian Religion, as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by its great Author.</p>
                  <p>1. True Christianity establisheth that which
is of <hi>common</hi> concernment to all Mankind, and
therefore is not a <hi>Sect.</hi> The <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi>
of the everlasting Gospel are perfective of and
no way repugnant to the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Religion. Is that a <hi>Sect</hi> which gives such
mighty Encouragements and Assistances to those
that <hi>in every Nation fear God and work Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi>
Acts 10. 34. Is that a <hi>Sect</hi> which tends to
nothing else but to reduce the revolted Race of
Mankind to their <hi>Ancient</hi> Allegiance to the great
Creator, and to renew that <hi>Image</hi> of God upon
Man which was his <hi>Primitive</hi> Rectitude and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity?
Is that a <hi>Sect</hi> which proclaims God in
Christ <hi>reconciling the World unto himself,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
it from that degenerate and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
State into which it was sunk? Is that a Sect
which publisheth Good-will towards Men,<note place="margin">Luke 2. 14.</note> and
Christ the <hi>Lamb of God taking away the Sins of the
World?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 29. 3. 16.</note> Surely that which <hi>concurs</hi> so much with

the <hi>Vniting</hi> of the Children of Men, and the <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering</hi>
of them <hi>together</hi> in <hi>one</hi> and therefore is

                  <p>1. Let us take heed left our Profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
degenerate into any thing which may
make it look like a <hi>Sect. Christianity</hi> as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by Christ is not a <hi>Sect,</hi> let not <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
then be <hi>Sectaries.</hi> We make our Profession
of Religion a <hi>Sect</hi> when we monopolize the
Church and its Ministry and Sacraments, and
spend that zeal in matters of <hi>doubtful Disputation</hi>
which should be reserved for the <hi>weightier matters
of the Law.</hi> When we place our Religion in
<hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17, 18.</note> which should be placed in

Ghost.</hi> When we profess Religion with a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>
of our selves, and a <hi>Contempt</hi> of others, and
with any Wordly secular Design; when we sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
the common Interests of Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to the particular Interests of a Party, and
in a word, when our Profession is tainted with
the <hi>Leaven of the Pharisees,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 12. 1.</note> which is both <hi>sowring</hi>

us therefore adhere to the <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>large Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and be acted by a Principle of Love to,
and so maintain Communion with <hi>all that in

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 2.</note> and under every Denomination, <hi>call

of a <hi>Sect,</hi> let us not be moved at it, but say
as <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam. 6. 22. If this be to be vile,
I will be yet more vile.</hi> If the Practice of Piety
be branded as a <hi>Sect,</hi> it is better for us to come
under the <hi>reproaches</hi> of Men for following it,
than under the <hi>Curse</hi> of God for neglecting it.
It is a <hi>very small thing to be judged of Man's</hi> Day,

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 3, 4.</note> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Primitive Christianity was industriously
put into an ill-name: it was call'd emphatically
<hi>The Atheism,</hi> because it overthrew Idolatry, and
undermin'd the false Gods, and worships that
had so long obtain'd. This was the Out-cry at

                  <p>I come now in the <hi>Second Place</hi> to enquire
<hi>what's the Reason</hi> that so Holy and Excellent a
Religion as Christianity is, meets with such hard
usage, and is thus spoken against, <hi>every where
spoken against:</hi> When we hear such an Out-cry
as this made against Christianity, it is natural
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98022:96"/>
to us to enquire, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did when such a Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
was raised against its Author, <hi>Why, what
evil hath it done?</hi> Truly we may say concerning
it as <hi>Pilate</hi> did concerning him, <hi>We find no fault
in it.</hi> Which of all its Opposers convinceth it
of Sin or Error? It invades no Man's Right,
breaks in upon no Man's Property, is no Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the Peace, no Enemy to the Welfare of
Families and Societies, is no Prejudice at all to
the Interests of States aad Princes, but to all
these highly Beneficial and Advantageous: <hi>Why
then is it</hi> thus accused, condemned and <hi>spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst?</hi>
We will endeavour to find out the <hi>true</hi>
Reason of it, though it is impossible to assign a
<hi>justifiable</hi> Reason of that which is most <hi>unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The Adversaries of Religion speak against
it <hi>because they do not know it.</hi> Sound Knowledge
hath not a greater Enemy in the World than <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</hi>
Our Lord Jesus was therefore despised
and hated by the World, because the World
<hi>knew him not, Iohn 1. 10. If they had known</hi> the
Dignity of his Person, the Excellency of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and the gracious Design and Purpose of
his coming into the World, certainly they <hi>would
not have Crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 8.
They that did it,<note place="margin">Acts 3. 15, 17.</note> did it <hi>through Ignorance,</hi> and
<hi>knew not what</hi> they did. Thus they who <hi>say to the
Almighty,</hi>

                     <hi>Depart from us,</hi> could not say so if
they did not at the same time studiously decline
<hi>the knowledge of his ways.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 21. 14.</note> No Man will speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Religion and the Power of it, that hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seriously weighed the Proofs and Evidences
of it, or impartially tried the Comfort and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of it.<note place="margin">John 4. 10.</note> If they <hi>knew this Gift,</hi> this inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98022:96"/>
they would covet it earnestly as the best Gift.
He that looks at a distance upon Men <hi>Dancing,</hi>
would think them to be mad: (It was <hi>Peter

himself with a distant and transient view

thoughts of it, but a better Acquaintance will

                     <head>Now for the APPLICATION of
this DOCTRINE.</head>
                     <p>Let us see what good Use we may make
of this Observation concerning the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Wicked in speaking so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Religion and Godliness, and what is our
Duty in reference hereunto.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Let us admire the Patience and Forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the God of Heaven, in that he bears
so much, and so long, with those that thus speak
against Him and his Holy Religion.</hi> The
<hi>Affront</hi> hereby given Him is very great, and
(we would think) <hi>intollerable,</hi> even Hard <hi>Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
that reflect upon an Infinite Majesty,
have in them a kind of Infinite Malignity.
He <hi>hears</hi> and <hi>knows</hi> all that which is said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Him, and against his Truth and VVays,
and as a Jealous God <hi>resents</hi> it. He hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>Power</hi> in his Hands to punish the prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of his Enemies, nor would their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Ruine be any <hi>Loss</hi> to him, and yet
<hi>Sentence against</hi> these <hi>Evil Words</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> is
<hi>not executed speedily:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 11.</note> Be astonished O Heavens,
at this, and wonder O Earth! that those wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
which rebel against the Beams of such
Light and Glory, which spurn at the Bowels
of such Love and Grace, are not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made the visible Monuments of Divine
VVrath and Vengeance, and like, <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrah,</hi> set <hi>forth for an Example!</hi> That the
Blasphemers and Scoffers of these last Days
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98022:99"/>
are not instantly struck <hi>Dumb,</hi> struck <hi>Dead.</hi> That
He who hath so much said against him, yet doth
himself <hi>keep silence,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 50. 12.</note> and doth not answer all
these Reproaches and Contradictions (as he easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
could) in Thunder and Lightning. Though
his Silence and Forbearance is turn'd to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
even by those that have the Benefit of it,
who therefore think him <hi>altogether such an one as
themselves,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 3, 4.</note> and take occasion from his <hi>Patience</hi> to
question his <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> and challenge his <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
saying, <hi>Where is the Promise of his Coming?</hi>
Yet he bears, and his Patience is stretched out
even to Long-suffering,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> because he is <hi>not willing
that any should perish,</hi> nor that any means should
be left untried to prevent their perishing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he bears with Sinners, because this is the
Day of <hi>his Patience,</hi> and of <hi>their Probation.</hi> The
<hi>Wrath of God is reveal'd from Heaven</hi> in the
<hi>Word</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18</note> that we might be aw'd by <hi>Faith,</hi>
more than in present <hi>Providences,</hi> which would
be an aw to <hi>Sense.</hi> But there is a Day coming,
a dreadful Day,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 3.</note> when our <hi>God shall come,</hi> and
shall no longer <hi>keep silence,</hi> a Day foretold in the
early Ages of the VVorld,<note place="margin">Jude 14. 15.</note> by <hi>Enoch the seventh
from Adam,</hi> when Judgment shall be executed
upon ungodly Sinners <hi>for all their hard Speeches,</hi>
which Day he will not anticipate, for <hi>he knows it
is coming,</hi> Psal. 37. 13. It is agreeable to the
regular course of Justice, that all Judgments be
adjourn'd till the <hi>Iudgment-Day,</hi> and all Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
defer'd till <hi>Execution-Day:</hi> And therefore
now he condescends to <hi>reason</hi> with those that
speak against him, for their Convicttion, as he
doth by the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 25, &amp;c. where he
fairly debates the Case with those who said, <hi>The
way of the Lord is not equal,</hi> That every Mouth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98022:99"/>
may be stopped with an unanswerable <hi>Argument</hi>
before it be stopt with an irreversible <hi>Sentence,</hi>
and those who have spoken against him may be
sent <hi>speechless</hi> to Hell.<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 12.</note> He <hi>keeps silence</hi> now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when he doth speak <hi>he will be justified.</hi> When
our Lord Jesus was here upon Earth, with what
an invincible Patience did he <hi>endure the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of Sinners;</hi> when so many ill things were
witnessed against him he was silent,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 63.</note> to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
answered not a word to all their unjust Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
and Accusations,<note place="margin">Joh. 19. 9.</note> but at the same time
he <hi>bound them over</hi> to the Judgment of the great
Day by that awful word, <hi>Mat. 26. 64. Hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right
hand of the Power,</hi>—and still he <hi>bears</hi> in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of that same Day.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 13.</note> He doth not take
Vengeance <hi>presently</hi> because he hath an <hi>Eternity</hi>
before him for the doing of it.</p>
                     <p>And by the way, we may infer from hence,
That those who would be like their Heavenly
Father, must <hi>bear Reproach</hi> and Contradiction
patiently. When any thing is said against <hi>us,</hi>
reflecting never so little Disparagement upon
us, or our Families, our Resentments of it are
very sensible, and we are apt to take it hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
nay, and to say we <hi>do well to be angry,</hi> for it
is not a thing to be endur'd; not to be endur'd!
O think how much God bears with the Contempt
and Reproach cast upon his <hi>great Name,</hi> and
that will surely qualify our Resentments of any
indignity done to our <hi>little Names!</hi> Who are
we that we must not be spoken against? Or
what are our Sayings that they must not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted?
Such Affronts as these we should
learn to bear as <hi>David</hi> did when <hi>Shimei</hi> cursed
him,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 10. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>So let him Curse;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 23.</note> and as the Son of <hi>David</hi>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98022:100"/>
did when his Enemies reviled him, <hi>Blessing them
that Curse us,</hi> and <hi>Praying for them that this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
us, that we may be the Children of our Father
which is in Heaven.</hi> God adjourns his Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the great Day, and then surely we may
<hi>adjourn</hi> ours to that day as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth his,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Let us acknowledge the Power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace, in keeping up the Christian Religion in
the World, notwithstanding the universal Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Opposition it hath met with.</hi> One would
think that a way thus spoken against every where
should have been long ere this lost and ruin'd,
and the Christian Name cut off, to be no more
in remembrance;<note place="margin">Ps. 83 3, 4.</note> which its Adversaries have so
industriously endeavoured; if it had been of Men,
it had certainly come to naught quickly,<note place="margin">Acts 5. 38.</note> though
they had let it alone, but being <hi>of God,</hi> it was to
admiration Victorious over all oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ition. A
Sect, a Cheat could never have supported it self
against so much Contradiction; no Human Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or Policy could have kept it up, nor any
thing less than an Almighty Arm. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the Christian Religion in the world to
this day is a standing <hi>Miracle</hi> for the Conviction
of its Adversaries,<note place="margin">See this excellently enlarged upon by the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> de <hi>v. R. C. l.</hi> 2.</note> and the Confirmation of the
Faith of those that adhere to it. VVhen we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what a mighty Force was raised by the
Powers of Darkness against Christianity when it
was in its Infancy, how many they were that
spoke against it, learned Men, great Men, Books
were written, Laws were made against it; those
that spoke for it, how few were they? and how
mean and despicable! the <hi>foolish things</hi> of the
VVorld, and the <hi>Weak,</hi> and yet we see the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98022:100"/>
                        <hi>Word</hi> of God mightily growing and prevailing.
Must we not needs say,<note place="margin">Acts 19. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>this is the Lord's doing, &amp; it
is marvellous in our eyes?</hi> The several false Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of the Heathen with their various Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions
and Idolatries, though they gave very
little Opposition one to another, but agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
well enough, yet having no foundation in
Truth they all wither'd away, and dwindled to
nothing, and after the mighty sway they had
born, and all means possible us'd to support 'em,
at length their Day came to fall, their Oracles
silenced, their Altars deserted, and the Gods
themselves were <hi>famished, (Zeph.</hi> 2. 11.) and <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
from the Earth,</hi> according to that Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 11. which is put into the mouths
of the Captiv'd Jews, to retort upon their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting

Hena,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 18. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>and</hi> Ivah, those obscure and petty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities?
But where are the Gods of <hi>Babylon</hi> and
<hi>Aegypt, Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the illustrious names
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter, Iuno</hi> and <hi>Diana?</hi> where

worshipped bofore they received the
Light of the glorious Gospel? Are they not all
forgotten as dead Men out of mind, and their
names written in the dust? But Christ's Holy
Religion, though for some Ages it was utterly
destitute of all Secular Supports and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and was assaulted on all hands by the most
vigorous Attacks of its daring and most impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Enemies, yet it hath strangely <hi>weather'd its
point,</hi> and is in <hi>being,</hi> and, thanks be to God, in
some places in a <hi>flourishing</hi> state to this day: Its

                        <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 3, 4.</note> but never a <hi>baffled</hi> cause: Let

and to conquer—</hi>That which was every where
spoken against Christianity,<note place="margin">Acts 28. 3.</note> was like the <hi>Viper</hi>
which fasten'd upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hand, it gave
people occasion to think very ill concerning it,
and to look for its speedy fall, as the barbarous
people concerning him whom they concluded to
be a Murtherer, and expected that he should
have <hi>swollen,</hi> or <hi>fallen down Dead.</hi> But it hath in
all Ages shaken those venomous Beasts into the
Fire, and taken no harm, and so hath prov'd its
own Divine Original. <hi>Let</hi> us herein acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> Jesus,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note>
who hath so firmly built his Church <hi>upon a Rock</hi>
that the <hi>Gates of Hell,</hi> i. e. all its Powers, and
Policies, and Numbers could never <hi>prevail against
it. Mahomet,</hi> though he industriously adapted
his Religion, to the Sensual Appetites of Men,
whose <hi>Reason</hi> only, and not their <hi>Lusts,</hi> could
object against it,<note place="margin">See the learned Dr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux's</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Life of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> lately published.</note> yet he obtain'd no strength, nor
interest at all, till by a thousand Artifices he had
got the Power of the Sword, and with it forbad
any upon pain of Death to <hi>speak against</hi> him or
his Doctrine; charging his first Followers, who
were to propagate his Religion, if they met
with any that objected against it, not to <hi>dispute</hi>
with them, but to <hi>kill</hi> them immediately: By
which means that grand Imposture in a little
time got some footing in the world; and by the
same Barbarous and Inhumane Methods, it hath

To affect us herewith, let us consider,</p>
                     <p>1. The great <hi>Dishonour</hi> hereby done to our
God in the World. They that reflect upon his
Truths and Ways, his Word and Ordinances,
reflect upon him, He that <hi>toucheth</hi> these <hi>toucheth
the apple of his eye;</hi> If therefore we have any love
to God, or concern for his Honour, and have
cordially espous'd the Interests of his Kingdom,
what is an <hi>Affront</hi> to him, will surely be a <hi>Grief</hi>
to us. It cannot but be a very melancholly
Thought to every sensible Soul, That the God
that <hi>made</hi> the World is <hi>made</hi> so <hi>light</hi> of in the
World, That he who doth so much <hi>Good</hi> to the
Children of Men, hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That the Lord Jesus, who <hi>so loved the
World,</hi> is so much hated and despised by the
World. The <hi>Reproaches</hi> of them who thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
our Master, if we be his faithful Servants
we should feel as <hi>falling upon us.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psa. 69 10. Mat. 25. 45.</note> And if he take
what is said and done against his People, as said
and done against himself, much more reason
have they to find themselves aggrieved in that
which is said and done against him. If we pray
heartily that God's <hi>Name</hi> may be <hi>hallowed,</hi> as we
should do every day, we should grieve heartily
that his <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>dishonoured,</hi> as we see it is every
day. And our resentments of the Reproach
cast upon God and Religion, we should make a
humble and pious <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of before God in
Prayer, as <hi>King</hi> Hezekiah <hi>spread</hi> Rabshakeh's
blasphemous Letter <hi>before the Lord,</hi> with that
tender and affectionate Request, <hi>Lord bow down
thine ear and hear: Open, Lord, thine eyes and see,</hi>

plead, <hi>chap. 7. 9. What wilt thou do unto thy great
Name?</hi> And with what a concern doth the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
in the name of the Church insist upon this,
<hi>Psal. 74. 10. O God, how long shall the Adversary
reproach? Shall the Enemy blaspheme thy Name for
ever?</hi> And <hi>v. 18. Remember this that the Enemy
hath reproached, O Lord, and that the foolish People
have blasphemed thy Name.</hi> And how earnestly
doth he beg, <hi>v. 22. Arise, O God, plead thine own
Cause.</hi> Thus should the Honour of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

                     <p>2. Consider the <hi>miserable Condition</hi> of <hi>those</hi> that

such Matters of <hi>doubtful Disputation,</hi> that it is

those that profess it, give some occasion, but
their <hi>Immoralities</hi> much more.</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Imprudences</hi> of Christians often turn to
the Reproach of Christianity. There may be
such over-doing even in Well-doing, as may
prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ndoing. When more stress is laid than
ought to be upon some instances of Religion, to
the justling out of others, and the Exercises of
Devotion are either mis-timed, or mis-placed,
or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>oportion'd, Religion is hereby mis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
or look'd upon to disadvantage.
Rash and indiscreet Zeal may give occasion to
those who seek occasion to speak against all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Zeal.<note place="margin">Col. 4. 5.</note> Therefore <hi>walk in Wisdom towards
them that are without.</hi> Religion is a most sweet
and pleasant and amiable thing: Let not us by
our Indiscretion make it a <hi>Task</hi> to our selves, and
a <hi>Terror</hi> to others. The more the Children of
God are <hi>Children of Wisdom,</hi> the more they <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi>
it,<note place="margin">Luk. 7. 35.</note> and its ways. Christian <hi>Prudence</hi> is very
much the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> of Christian <hi>Piety.</hi>
Though it will secure the welfare of our
own Souls if we walk in our Integrity, yet it
is necessary for the preserving of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of our Profession,<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 8.</note> that we walk <hi>in Wisdom,</hi>
that <hi>Wisdom of the Prudent</hi> which is to <hi>understand

                     <p>2. The <hi>Immoralites</hi> of those who profess Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
turn much more to the reproach of that
Holy Religion; when those that are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
are griping and covetous, and greedy of
the World, when they are false and deceitful,
and unjust in their Dealings, sowre and morose,
and unnatural to their Relations, turbulent and
unquiet in Societies, when they are froward and
passionate, proud and haughty, hard-hearted and
oppressive, loose and intemperate. When they
are found guilty of Lying and Cheating, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness
or Uncleanness. When it appears that
they keep up some secret <hi>Haunts</hi> of Sin, under
the cloke and covert of a specious Profession,
when they that profess the Christian Faith lick
up the vomit of Heathen, and allow themselves
in those things that are contrary to the Light
and Law even of Natural Religion. This is
that which opens the mouths of the Adversaries
to speak reproachfully of that Religion, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of which is made to consist with such vile
Practises, which cannot possibly consist with the
<hi>Power</hi> of it. This makes People ready to say as
that <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prince did, when the <hi>Christians</hi>
had broke their League with him, <hi>O Iesus, are
these thy Christians?</hi> Or as the complaint was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

these are not to be call'd Professors of the Gospel.
If Ministers <hi>give offence in any thing,</hi> not they
only,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 3</note> but their <hi>Ministry</hi> will <hi>be blamed.</hi> Nay, if

the Government they are under,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1.</note> the <hi>Name of
God, and his Doctrine,</hi> is likely to be <hi>blasphemed.</hi>
Let us therefore who profess Relation to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
God, and Dependance upon the Blessed
Jesus, and a Regard to the Holy Scriptures, as
we tender the Reputation of our Religion, <hi>walk
worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing.</hi>

we are call'd by so <hi>good</hi> a Name, let us not dare
to do an <hi>ill</hi> thing. The Disciples of Christ
are as a <hi>City upon a Hill,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 14.</note> and have many eyes
upon them, and therefore have heed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have

and to <hi>abstain from all appearance of evil.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Thes. 5. 12.</note>
Let us not do any thing that is unjust, or
unbecoming, us, nor allow our selves in that

by no means allow of, lest <hi>we</hi> be to answer
