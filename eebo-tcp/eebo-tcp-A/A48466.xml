            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> Printed Paper ſpread abroad, in City and Country, with the Name of <hi>Thomas Curtis</hi> to the firſt part of it, and <hi>B. C.</hi> to the latter; wherein one of them pretends to give an account of the grounds upon which he intended to ſhut up the Publick Meeting-Houſe Door, of the People called Quakers in <hi>Reading,</hi> and the other endeavours by certain Reaſons to juſtifie and defend the doing thereof; We held our ſelves engaged in Chriſtian duty to give an Anſwer thereto, for the Clearing of the Truth we profeſs, Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelves in the profeſſion thereof, and Undeceiving all ſuch as through the falſe Inſinuations in the ſaid Paper either already are, or may be in danger to be deceived thereby.</p>
            <p>The Paper ſays, <hi>It is publickly known in this Town</hi> (Reading) <hi>that a Difference is amongſt the People call'd Quakers, as very frequently at our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meeting-Houſe doth appear, to the diſhonour of Almighty God, ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the Weak, and grief of many tender hearted, that</hi> W. L. I. B. &amp;c. <hi>do from time to time ſtir up Strife, by endeavouring the defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ancient Friends, rendering them to be departed from their firſt Principles, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which we anſwer in Truth and Plainneſs, that what <hi>T.</hi>

               </gap> here charge upon us is indeed that which they themſelves are guilty of, for it is too well known, that many Scandalous and Reproachful Books and Papers, have of late Years been Written, and Publiſhed in Print to the World by ſome of their party (as namely <hi>W. Rogers, F. Bugg, Tho. Criſp, S. Aldridge)</hi> greatly tending to the defamation of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Friends in Truth, and rendering them to be departed from men firſt Principles, &amp;c. This is too plain to be denyed, their Books and Papers being in Print, to be ſeen, and <hi>T. C.</hi> and others of party with him, being in too great meaſure gone into, &amp; joyned with the ſame evil ſpirit of defamation, as thoſe oppoſers of Friends and Truth are in,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95119:2"/>
have received, owned, diſperſed or ſpread aborad thoſe Books and Papers or ſome of them, of which we have often with grief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to them, before we appeared in that Teſtimony againſt them, of keeping on our Hats (which ſo much diſturbs them) but could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no ſatisfaction from them, although we plainly declared unto them, that if they continued in that ſpirit of Diviſion, and to own and ſpread thoſe ungodly ſcandalous Books, we ſhould be neceſſiated to diſown their Teſtimonies in our Meetings; ſo that indeed and in truth it is they that have endeavoured to defame the ancient Friends of Truth (and that publickly in Print) rendering them to be departed from their firſt Principles; it is they that in thus doing have ſtirred up Strife to the diſhonour of Almighty-God, ſtumbling of the Weak, and grief of many tender hearted, and this before we appeared in that Teſtimony of keeping on our Hats at their Prayers, whereby we think it evidently appears that it is they that have cauſed the Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Offences contrary to the Doctrine which we have learned; and ſince the Apoſtle plainly ſays (as in their Paper is recited) <hi>They that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> We think it concerns them well to conſider what ground they now have to claim a right to a part of the Miniſtry of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, ſince none that do not ſerve our Lord Jeſus Chriſt can have a right to a part of his Miniſtry. And whereas their Paper intimates, <hi>As if we had denyed that it is fit they ſhould acknowledge to Almighty God in the Congregations of his people thoſe Mercies and Bleſſings that he is gratiouſly pleaſed from time to time to beſtow on them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We anſwer that in the wording of this Paſſage they have rather uſed Art to beguile the Reader, then Plainneſs to ſet forth the true ſtate of the matter, for as they have expreſſed it, ſome may be miſled to think that we are againſt acknowledging to Almighty God in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his people the Mercies and Bleſſings by him beſtowed, and ſupplicating at the Throne of his Grace for a future ſupply; whereas indeed we believe, and hold that every one that is right ſenſible of the Mercies and Benefits received from God, and of his own Inabillity, ought in that ſence, and in the moving of the holy Spirit, to make ſuch acknowledgments and ſupplications; yet we planly declare we hold it not fit for any who are gone out from the Unity and Communion of Gods people, and have publickly defamed and diſowned them as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates</hi> and <hi>Innovators</hi> (which thoſe have done the faithful Friends of Truth) to take upon them to make any ſuch Acknowledgments, or put
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95119:2"/>
up any ſuch Supplications in the Congregations of Gods people, as the mouth, or in the name and behalf of thoſe Congregations which ſuch are gone out of the unity of; &amp; when any ſuch do take upon them ſo to do, we do not believe there is any obligation upon thoſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Gods people, or any Members thereof, to joyn in outward appearance with ſuch who in Spirit are departed from the fellowſhip of the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus, but rather that ſuch an outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with that which in Spirit they have not unity with (but the contrary) would be but an effect of Hypocriſie and Deceit, for <hi>T. C.</hi> ſaid to <hi>I. B.</hi> (before the Meeting-Houſe door was ſhut up) <hi>That the Difference between them and us</hi> (meaning Friends) <hi>was not only in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, but it was now in the heart and ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus endeavoured to clear ſome paſſages wherein we and our Friends have been miſ-repreſented, we now proceed to the reſt of the Paper, and firſt we take notice that the reaſon given for the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Paper is, <hi>That a Copy of it was read publickly in the Meeting, and there tendered to ſome of them that were concerned, but they would not take it.</hi> To which we anſwer, that this is alſo unfairly repreſented; for tho it be true, that the Copy of that Paper (or ſome ſuch) was read, and tendered in the Meeting, and not then received, not thinking fit at that time to meddle with it, our Spirits being then engaged in the worſhip and ſervice of God, which <hi>B. C.</hi> in the ſecond reaſon of their Paper ſays, <hi>Ought to be performed with great Seriouſneſs and Reverence;</hi> yet ſince ſome of us concerned did within the time in their ſaid Paper per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ix'd go to them to ask for the ſaid Copy, but were denyed to have it, and one of them put off with Flouts, we think the not taking it at that inſtant, when it was tendered (to divert us from the great Seriouſneſs and Reverence which the Worſhip and Service of God (Friends were then engaged in) ought to be performed with) can by no meanes be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for a plain and juſt ground of putting it and us in Print.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T. C.</hi> pretends in his Paper to a Power and Authority of ſhutting up our Meeting-Houſe door, and keeping us out there, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcore of his being the chief Proprietor, as he is pleaſed to call himſelf, and <hi>B. C.</hi> alſo calls him; we anſwer we know not upon what juſt ground <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or any other of the Proprietors, ſhould claim a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, or chiefship of propriety in the Meeting-Houſe, which was Built by common conſent and agreement (tho <hi>B. C.</hi> in his fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaith, without diſtinction, <hi>T C.</hi> Built it) and at the common charg of the Friends of <hi>Reading,</hi> and other places, with what came out of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95119:3"/>
publick Stock and Rents, for if in common and publick Works and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices joyntly undertaken &amp; performed by any Chriſtian Society or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for their common and publick Chriſtian uſe, &amp; ſo declared and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by and amongſt them, the greateſt Contributor ſhould afterwards challenge to himſelf a power and right of diſpoſing the whole; this were indeed a ready way to introduce a Gentile like Lordſhip and Uſurpation over one another, but would be altogether unlike the Diſciples and Followers of Jeſus; but if <hi>T. C.</hi> did repute himſelf the chief Proprietor upon the account of his being the largeſt Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, yet ſince he well knows, that after the Meeting-Houſe was Built and Finiſhed, he did (becauſe the Leaſe of the Ground whereon it was Built was taken in his Name) paſs over and legally convey his particular and perſonal Right and Property therein to certain Friends in Truſt, then agreed on by the whole, to receive and keep the ſame for the whole, he might both in Reaſon and Modeſty have foreborn now to ſtile himſelf the cheif Proprietor, and much more from taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as ſuch, to ſhut up the Meeting-Houſe door, and keep others of the Proprietors out, his telling the Juſtices that he was chief Proprietor doth not make him ſo, no more then it did regain the Houſe from the Souldiers that had entered into it; and if it had never been regained, the loſs had been occaſioned by him, and his adherence, inaſmuch as that Meeting for which the Houſe was ſeized on, was ſet up by them, without and againſt the Conſent and Unity of Friends. And whereas <hi>He bids the Impartial Reader judge whether in Reaſon and Equity he ought to look upon himſelf engaged to hazard his Eſtate to pay Fines for a Meeting-Houſe, for ſuch as publickly do diſown him and his Friends.</hi> We ſay, that although ſome of us have been fined becauſe of the Preaching of ſome of them who diſowned us, yet we never deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>T. C.</hi> or any other particular of them ſhould hazard their Eſtates on our accounts; if <hi>T. C.</hi> expoſed himſelf or Eſtate to any hazard in that reſpect, it was his own doing, neither deſired conſented to, nor approved of by us, yet we offered to ſecure him from any danger that ſhould come upon him, if he left the Meeting-Houſe to us. To his offer of reimburſing any that were diſſatisfied becauſe of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving disburſt ſome Mony on the Premiſes, &amp;c. We ſay we had not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to receive the Money again which we had freely giving and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Service, knowing that we had given it with an upright and conſcientious regard to God, neither were we willing to conſent to, or help forward the Seperation, which we ſaw was deſigned and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95119:3"/>
intended thereby, yet becauſe we ſawſome of them uneaſie, and to take off from them all occaſions of Complaint, that they might ſee we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired not to enjoy what they had any Share or Intereſt in againſt their minds without making allowance to them; therefore we did offer to make them reaſonable Satisfaction for what Money they had laid down upon the Premiſes, &amp; we ſaw not, nor yet ſee any juſt ground they have to expect that we ſhould be more obliged to part with our Intreſt then they with theirs; therefore in truth of Heart and plainneſs of Speech we do ſincerely declare, that we do believe <hi>Tho. Curtis</hi> hath no right nor juſt power in Equity, or in Law to do as he hath done, in ſhutting up the Meeting-Houſe Doors, and keeping out thoſe that both in Law and Equity have a right thereto: That the Propoſitions he mentions in his Paper are Arbitrary and Penal, Arbitrary becauſe they depend only upon his and other mens Wills and Humours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Right and Reaſon; for what Right or Reaſon can he pretend for tying us to give him our Anſwer to this Paper of his by next 6th. day at fartheſt, after he had cauſed it to be Read amongſt us on the firſt day before, or to bind us to claim our Money in one Months time: And that it is Penal appears in this, that in caſe his Propoſals were not complyed with, he declared in his Paper he did intend to faſten up the Doors, as he did accordingly, for on the 7th. day following the 6th. day <hi>B. C.</hi> came to <hi>W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> and told them <hi>That if they had any thing to offer for Reconciliation they might come, but</hi> W. L. <hi>came not, ſo the Doors that Evening were faſtened up;</hi> ſays <hi>B. C.</hi> in his 9th. Reaſon, but in this as in other parts he writes unfairly, ſtating it as if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſhutting up the Doors that evening was becauſe <hi>W. L.</hi> came not, &amp;c. whereas <hi>W. L.</hi> being hindred by neceſſary occaſions deſired <hi>J. B.</hi> to go, who accordingly did go, and offered ſuch terms both in his own and <hi>W. L.</hi> Name as they in Truth judged moſt expedient for a right Reconciliation.</p>
            <p>And that the Reader may ſee how ready we have been to comply with any reaſonable and juſt Propoſals for a right Reconciliation, (however we have been miſrepreſented in that reſpect) we will here for brevity give one particular Inſtance, and leave it to the Impartial Readers Judgment; In the firſt Month 1685, 86. <hi>J. O.</hi> a Friend of <hi>London</hi> (an ancient Acquaintance both of theirs and ours) came to this Town, and deſired, and had a Meeting with <hi>T. C.</hi> and ſome others of thoſe that ſhut us out of the Meeting-Houſe, and ſome of us that were ſhut out, where he ſignified to both them and us, that the Friends
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95119:4"/>
               <hi>London</hi> having heard that they had ſhut up the Meeting-Houſe doors, whereby Truth might ſuffer, and Friends were kept out, and expoſed to the Cold and Rain, and were very much concerned about it, and had deſired him to enquire the Reaſons of it; and when the Reaſons they gave (being moſtly ſuch as <hi>B. C.</hi> hath now Publiſhed) were not Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to <hi>J. O.</hi> he propoſed ſeveral ways to them and us joyntly to refer the matter to ſome Friends to be Indifferently choſen on both Parties, to deſide the matter between us, which we willingly agreed to, but they refuſed. By which the honeſt Reader may judge how little ſincerity there is in all their talk of terms of Reconcilement, Accommodation, &amp;c. who had ſet up their own wills for a Law, and would admit no Judges but themſelves in their own Cauſe.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>B. C</hi>'s Reaſons, although being much of the ſame nature with <hi>T. C</hi>'s part of the Paper, they either deſerve no Anſwer, or no other then what is already giving to that, yet to take from him all pretence of Boaſting that he is not particularly Anſwered, we ſhall here annex the Anſwer that was ſome time ago ſent him by another Friend in writing, while they were only in writing, which notwithſtanding the Alterations <hi>R. C.</hi> hath ſince, made in ſome of his Reaſons, will yet, we do not doubt appear, to be a ſufficient Anſwer to them.</p>

            <head>Poſtſcript to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THeſe things are not pleaſant to us, but rather a grief that we have cauſe on this wiſe to appear in Publick upon ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, eſpecially, againſt them who were once our Friends and Familiers, that we muſt cry out againſt them as <hi>Job</hi> did againſt his Friends (who oft ſpoke good words, as theſe may do) yet ſaid he, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I cry out of Wrong, but I am not heard, I cry aloud, but there is no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> So that notwithſtanding their good words, their Ear was ſhut to the cry of the Wronged, &amp; though he cryed aloud, there was no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; &amp; now may not we well thus complain, who are kept out of our Right (which we have called for) and our Bodies expoſed to the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the great hazard of our Healths, and endangering of our Lives, yet our cry of wrong cannot be heard, and tho we cry aloud there is no Judgment. Oh that it ſhould be thus with any profeſſing the equal Truth to do (in ſome meaſure) too like <hi>Ahab,</hi> who did not not cover, and preſently take, but proffered firſt a better Vinyard ther it, or would have given <hi>Naboth</hi> the worth of it in Money; but when this would not do, the Woman <hi>Jezabel</hi> contrives or lays a Plot againſt <hi>Naboth,</hi> through whoſe crafty Means &amp; ſubtil. Contrivances, Innocent &amp; Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entions <hi>Naboth,</hi> who ſcrupled to ſell the Inheritance of his Father, was deprived of his Life and Vinyard too, and as we are now deprived of our Property, ſo may we be of our Lives, by reaſon of the hardſhips we are expoſed too, if the Lord by his power and goodneſs doth not preſerve us, who have been Conſcientiouſly concerned not to let go our Right, and give way to that which is Wrong, as <hi>Naboth</hi> was.</p>
            <p>And what ſhall we ſay to ſuch, but as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſee 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 5. Is there not a wiſe man among you, no not one, that you may be able to Judge, that you refuſe a Reference;</hi> if ſo, then follow <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, (if ye account your ſelves of Chriſts Church) and ſet them that are leaſt eſteemed in the Church to Judge; for ſaid <hi>Paul, There is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a fault among you, for you Wrong and Defraud, and that your Brethren.</hi> So that it appears there were ſome ſuch that were Cloaked under the name of Chriſtians, and yet did Wrong and Defraud even their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Therefore, let none think it ſtrange, if ſome now under the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95119:5"/>
name of Quaker, yea ſuch as account themſelves THE CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIAN QUAKER, are found in that which is wrong; neither let any think it ſtrange if there be ſome from among us that are unrule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for there were ſuch among the Primitive Believers, whom the Apoſtle exhorted the Chriſtians to warn, ſee 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 14. yea, there was alſo a falling away, ſee, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. And the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 18, 19. I hear, there be Diviſions among you, and I partly believe it, for there muſt be Hereſies among you,</hi> and the Reaſon he gives is, <hi>That they which are Approved may be made manifeſt among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So to that divine Light that lighteth every man, are we willing to bring our Deeds, knowing that what is reproved is made manieſt by the Light, in which our Deſires are, that all may have their minds exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, that ſo they may have a true Diſcerning, and right Judgment in theſe and all things, and may not be ſtumbled at what of this kind hath or may happen, but may live and walk in that Light where no occaſion of ſtumbling is.</p>
            <p>For had thoſe of whom we complain, walked in this Light, they had kept in the Unity of the Spirit of Truth, and in the Fellowſhip of the Goſpel of Peace, and Saints in Light, and had not given offence to <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> or the <hi>Church of Chriſt.</hi>

               <salute>Benjamin Cole,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have received thy Paper given (as thou ſayeſt) as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why the Meeting Houſe Doors were ſhut up; which for my part I look upon as no good or ſufficient Reaſons at all, neither can any good or ſufficient reaſon be giving for us (or indeed for a any people) to take away or detain one anothers Rights from them, or to do one another any Wrong or Injury, which is wholly out of the way, and inconſiſtant with the Truth which leads to overcome Evil with Good, and ſuch who walk in the path of it, their Weapons are not Carnal, but Spiritual, and can do no violence to any mans Perſon, State or Intereſt, neither forcibly or unjuſtly detain either of them, which are the effects of the Carnal, and not the Spiritual.</p>
            <p>And now as to thy <hi>firſt</hi> pretended Reaſon, whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>you could not enjoy peaceable Society, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay, your riſing up againſt your Brethren, and juſtifying and ſpreading the Scurrillous, Clamorous, Falſe, Scoffing, Unſavory and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious Books, of <hi>William Rogers, Thomas Criſp</hi> and <hi>Francis Bugg,</hi> who joyned together, and publiſhed their Books to the World, endeavouring to ſtir up Perſecution, and to ſet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and Profane, as far as they could, atop of us, to tread us down (which might be, together with ſome things within your ſelves of like nature) could not but break the Society or Fellowſhip betwixt you and them. And ſo I know they have born againſt you in their Teſtimonies, and ſo have you againſt them, which if this be the Oppoſition, they may likewiſe ſay, that <hi>Tho. Curtis</hi> &amp; you did oppoſe them; Though I am ſatisfied,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95119:6"/>
that if they had been in the poſſeſſion of it (as it ſhould ſeem you were) they would have abhorred to have ſhut you out of the Houſe, though I ſee not but that they might as juſtly and as honeſtly have done it, as what you have done, their right being as real and as juſt as yours, though its probable not ſo much.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That the Worſhip of God is to performed with Seriouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi> is not denyed, but if you could charge any of them with being light, and not ſerious, and out of love in their ſervice, ſuch after due admonition are to be left to the Lord to deal with; and not to take away or keep them out of their rights, that is not the way to make them Serious, or to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Love, but rather to harden them; and indeed its too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that you are but talkers of Love and Charity, which bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, and thinketh no Evil, that are ſo full of Jealouſies and evil ſurmiſings againſt ſo many ancient, ſerviceable and honeſt Friends; and do not all thoſe clamorous ſcandalous Books, ſpread about the Country by you, tend to bring Friends into Confuſion, and ſet them one againſt another; and now keeping your Brethren out of their Propriety; theſe are the effects of Strife and Envy on your parts, and anſwers that Scripture which thou haſt made uſe of, <hi>Where Envying and Stife is, there is Confuſion and every evil Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Though where Contention is, and a Meeting divided, cannot be profitable, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay ſuch who hold the Truth in the love of it, will bear and ſuffer till the Lord make the deciſion, which your contrary unfruitful work of faſtening up the Meeting-Houſe Doors againſt your Brethren ſufficiently ſhewes (to any that are in any true meaſure of it) that you are too far out of it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95119:6"/>
IV. I doubt not-but when the Houſe was built <hi>Tho. Curtis</hi> and they were in one mind, and unanimous in building of it, and to good ends, for the Service of God to be performed in, and not for Strife, which I could wiſh your were clear of your ſelves, though you would altogether charge it on them, though the effects manifeſt too much the contrary, and though the end hath been too often perverted for which it was built, and therefore thou ſayeſt, <hi>its not reaſonable it ſhould be continued,</hi> Then it ſhould be with conſent of both Parties; ſeeing both are concerned in it; but if it be therefore reaſonable for one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to take it away from the other, then ſuch who are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of it may take it away from the moſt innocent, and moſt likely ſo to do; for be ſure, ſuch as keep in the innocent Truth cannot do any ſuch thing, its nature being to lead other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, into Patience, Quietneſs and Contentedneſs of Mind, committing their Cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Tho. Curtis</hi> his ſtanding engaged for the Houſe, its no ground at all for him or you to take it away, or keep your Brethren out of that wherein they have a right, he might have let it alone when it was forth of his hands; and ſince, I doubt not, but upon reaſonable terms he may be clear of that danger, if there be any.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The endeavouring to have innocent Women keep their Meeting in ſo ſitting a place for them to do and perform thoſe things that God hath concerned them in, is no reaſon, nor part of any reaſon for you to take it away, I think no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man can judge ſo; and for Friends keeping on their Hats when you have Prayed, when they have no Unity with you, nor you with them, is like the other; and it had been better, and more fairer-dealing for you to have kept yours on, when they Prayed (and ſo have ſignified to your Brethren that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95119:7"/>
you had no Unity with them) then to put them off, and afterwards call them <hi>Image-makers, ſetters up of Idols and Roods</hi> publiſhing them <hi>Apoſtates, Popiſhly Principled,</hi> and ſuch like, to the World.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. As for your endeavouring for Peace; I have heard them ſay as much, and that they have had croſs and abuſive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage from you, and in this caſe the Lord who knows both your hearts, is to make the deciſion as aforeſaid, and ſuch who are of him, can truſt him till that time.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>When no accommodation nor reaſonable ſatisfaction can be had, and perſons will not agree, except others will ſubmit to their wills, or give them the Houſe, &amp;c.</hi> Your taking of it away ſhews you to be too much in your wills. And I do not believe that they did ſeek or deſire that you ſhould give them the Houſe, for theyhave offered to give you your Money that you laid out for it, as far as reaſonable, which alſo ſhews that they have not in that refuſed to make a bargain with you; though in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or things of another nature, they might refuſe to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with you, and if you think it reaſonable that they ſhould take their Money, or otherwiſe you may keep it wholy from them, then is it not as reaſonable that you ſhould take your Money from them, and moſt reaſonable, for they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented it ſhould have been continued as it was, and you were the diſatisfied Perſons; and ſeeing you call your ſelves the <hi>Christian Quakers,</hi> and us <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> how do you herein anſwer the Doctrine of Chriſt? who ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever you would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye the ſame unto them, for this is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> which if you are ſhort of, beſure you are ſhort of him; and ſo I think underſtanding men will not judge, that becauſe you are pleaſed to leave off to meet in the Houſe, that therefore you ſhould keep them out, nor yet becauſe you are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95119:7"/>
the greateſt Proprietors, that therefore you may juſtly take away the leſſers Right, and ſo you have great reaſon to fear you ſhould be counted Perſecutors, whatever thou ſayeſt. And how it can be ſaid that any have no right in it, that it was given and ſetled upon by Act and Deed for a publick Houſe to meet in? for my part I cannot ſee, nor yet for any after ſuch gift and ſettlement, how they can juſtly take it away or detain it from them.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>That they have another Meeting-Place, or Place to Meet in, &amp;c.</hi> I know no other, but what they have by permiſſion from the Owner. But if they had an other publick Meeting-Houſe wherein ſeveral of them were concerned as Proprietors that's no reaſon for you to take away their right in that, and that they meet on purpoſe to oppoſe and diſquiet you, I do not in the leaſt believe, nor that their practice did at all manifeſt it; being fully ſatisfied that they are not perſons of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Spirits, but if they were ſuch as thou art pleaſed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, as ſome ſuch have been amongſt us, as <hi>Temperance Taylor</hi> in your Town, and many at <hi>London,</hi> and other parts, yet it was never Friends way, who abode in the Truth, to deal in that nature, or after that manner with them; but to ſtand over them, and judge them down in Gods Authority, and alſo patiently to bear and ſuffer when the Lord ſhould pleaſe to exerciſe them under their Spirits, who hath pleaded with many of them, and will in his time with all others that are of their Spirit: And if any through theſe things, that are fallen out among you, are gone back to the Steeple Houſe, that is not the way to bring them back again (or at leaſt to the Truth) for you to do ſuch unreaſonable things, as aforeſaid, which are ſo contrary to the Truth.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. By thy laſt it ſeems, <hi>That the Doors were ſhut up by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95119:8"/>
and concluded on by ſeveral of you.</hi> Then it was not wholly <hi>T. Curtis</hi> his act, though I cannot ſee but it muſt needs be contrary to his Act and Deed to the Truſtees, of which I know not how you will clear him of the breach of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, who as I am informed made it over by a Deed of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to four Friends, for a publick Meeting-Houſe, for the People called Quakers at <hi>Reading,</hi> and there abouts, and though three of them did unworthily relinquiſh their Truſt, yet <hi>William Lambole,</hi> who was one of them refuſed ſo to do: So what was done in relation to that muſt needs ſtand effectual to him, and what you have done in taking it away, muſt needs be contrary to that Engagement, ſeveral of them, with himſelf, being by you ſhut out of Doors, and cannot have the benefit to keep their Meeting in it accordingly, and for which end ſeveral of them gave conſiderable ſums of Mony; ſure ſuch dealings would have been abhorred by you many years ſince the beginning, which you are very forward to talk of, but too far degenerated from.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Benjamin,</hi> one of my ancient Acquaintance in that place, what ſhall I ſay unto thee, or what could I not do if the ancient Love and Society among you in that place may be again revived? ſurely it cannot be as things ſtands, and therefore I could wiſh that a deep and narrow ſearch may paſs through every heart that is concerned among you. And now as things ſtands you have outwardly ſeparated your ſelves from your Brethren (indeed an inward Separation was before) and you have left the Meeting-Houſe, and keep them out alſo; I deſire thee, and all of you to be like men, and let true reaſon have place in you, and let them in again, wherein they have a right and propriety, and let not breach of Covenant reſt upon your ancient friend <hi>Tho. Curtis,</hi> nor injuſtice nor wrong doing upon any of you. Or if you would not be counted Perſecutors, nor examples to Perſecutors, I ſay let them meet in the Houſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95119:8"/>
again, and not keep them forth any longer; for though you are the greateſt Proprietors, yet they have a conſiderable ſhare in it, ſufficient to anſwer the uſe of the Meeting-Room twice or three times a Week, and you alſo may meet or forbear as you pleaſe; &amp; for that which thou liveſt in, and the reſt of the Buildings belonging to it, you may do as in reaſon ſhall be ſeen meet. And ſure what I here offer is according to that true and right reaſon that God hath endued me with, and I doubt not but will anſwer Gods witneſs in all unbyaſſed Friends, and innocent wel-wiſhing People, and I can truly ſay is in love to thee, and all of you. And is from your wel-wiſhing Friend.</p>
