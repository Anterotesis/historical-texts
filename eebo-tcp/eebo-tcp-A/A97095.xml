            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Good counſell to all thoſe that heartily deſire the glory of God, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the good of all vertuous men.</head>
            <p>YOu are moſt earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to take notice, and to be warned of a moſt peſtilent and dangerous deſigne lately practiſed by ſome helliſh Polititians, tending to the dividing of the honeſt party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, thereby to weaken them, and to give advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the Common Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:169459:2"/>
The ground of their deſigne is, The difference of judgement in matters of Religion amongſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious well minded people, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion being taken from thence to make them not only to deſpiſe and hate one another, but as odious to the generality of good men as are theeves, murderers and harlots.</p>
            <p>The means they uſe to promote their deſigne, is principally to broach ſome groſſe and fooliſh er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and then to father them on all thoſe that are called Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Antinomians, Browniſts, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts or Independents:</p>
            <p>Perſwading and poſſeſſing the people:</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, That they hold all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Commonweale to bee
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169459:2"/>
unlawfull; which you are to know is moſt pernicious deluſion, for they approve of, and doe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto all government that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on by common conſent in Parliament; and diſapprove only of arbitrary and tyrannicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, uſurpations and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances in Magiſtrates and Officers; and have disburſed their monies and hazarded their lives as freely for their juſt government, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of this Nation, as any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doe hold, that a Beleever may live as he liſt! even in all licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe: which is moſt groſſely falſe: there being no Scripture more frequent in their mouthes then this, namely, <hi>The love of God bringing ſalvation to all men hath
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169459:3"/>
appeared, teaching us to deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe and wordly luſts, and to live righteouſly and godly, and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this preſent world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Browniſts, Separation and Independents doe hold that all other Proteſtants are in a damnable condition, who doe hold fellowſhip, Church ſociety, and communion with groſſely, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and wicked perſons: which alſo is moſt notoriouſly falſe: for they doe not ſo judge of any; but doe judge that themſelves having (to their apprehenſions) grounds in Scripture, proving the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of ſuch mixt communions, may not, nor dare not ſo commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate: And as concerning others they judge (as themſelves would be judged) that they exerciſe their Religion in that way which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169459:3"/>
to them moſt agreeable to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>When theſe ſowers of diviſion have poſſeſt the people, that theſe and the like abſurdities are held by them: Then they adviſe them to flye from them as from Serpents, and not to heare them or diſcourſe with them, as they tender the ſafety of their ſouls; &amp; make them glad &amp; rejoyce when they heare any of them are impriſoned or ſilenced; or their bookes (though ſlightly and abſurdly) anſwered: and when they heare that many of them are forſaking the Kingdome, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking themſelves to the Weſt-Indies and other places for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their Conſciences (as void of all remorſe) they cry out, Let them goe, a good riddance, it will never bee well in England
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169459:4"/>
(ſay they) ſo long as theſe Sects are permitted to live amongſt us; nor untill the Parliament do ſet up one expreſſe way for exerciſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and compell all men to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thereunto, and moſt ſeverely to puniſh all ſuch as will not.</p>
            <p>But you will finde that this is the very voice of Prelacie, and the authours thereof to bee the very ſame in heart, what ever they are in cloaths and outſide—And that it is not the voyce of the Apoſtles, who required that every man ſhould be fully perſwaded in his owne minde of the lawfulneſſe of that way wherein he ſerved the Lord; and that upon ſuch a ground as no authority on earth can ever diſpence withall, namely, That whatſoever is not of faith (or full aſſurance of minde) is ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:169459:4"/>
Our Saviour Chriſt did not uſe the Sadduces in ſo unkinde a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and yet they held more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opinions then any that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed in our times; for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that there was no reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that there was neither Angell nor Spirit; though they came to him in a kinde of inſolent confidence in theſe their opinions, which he knew ſufficiently, He, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe both heard and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them gently; he did not revile them with reproachfull language, telling them that they were not worthy to live in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; nor did he warne others to diſcourſe with them; hee did not command their perſons to be impriſoned, nor declare their lives to be forfeited: It is likely they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved quietly, and (in all civill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) according to the loves of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169459:5"/>
the Country, and were honeſter men then the Scribes and Phariſees who were hypocrites: and ſo, as the true authour of his Apoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he allowed them to be fully perſwaded in their owne mindes, uſing no meanes but argument and perſwaſion to alter or controle their judgements: He knew that men might live peaceably and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly together, though they differ in judgement one from another: Himſelfe was compoſed of love, and eſteemed nothing ſo pretious as love; His ſervant and Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was of the ſame minde alſo, affirming that though hee had all faith and al knowledge, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all myſteries, though he could ſpeak with the tongues of men and of Angels, and have not love, he is nothing, a meere ſounding braſſe or tinckling ſymball: he deſires that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169459:5"/>
who are ſtrong in the faith, ſhould beare with thoſe that are weak, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth him that eateth that hee ſhould not condemne him that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not: where one obſerved a day to the Lord, and others not (though a matter of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) yet he alloweth every one to be fully perſwaded in his owne minde: Now if our Saviour and his Apoſtle, that could infallibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what was truth, and what was error, did nevertheleſſe allow every man to bee fully perſwaded in his owne minde, and did not command any man upon their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to doe any thing againſt judgement and conſcience—What ſpirit are they of, whoſe Miniſters are they, that would have all men compelled to ſubmit to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities and doubtfull determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:169459:6"/>
The Apoſtle perſwadeth thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he inſtructed to try all things: Theſe allow not things to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, they take liberty to ſpeake what they pleaſe in publike againſt opinions and judgements, under what nick-names they thinke fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to make them odious, and write and Print, and licence the ſame, wreſting and miſapplying the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to prove their falſe aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but ſtop all mens mouthes from ſpeaking, and prohibit the Printing of any thing that might be produced in way of defence and vindication; and if any thing bee attempted, ſpoken or publiſhed without authority or licence, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuivants, fines and impriſonments, are ſure to wait the Authors, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and publiſhers.</p>
            <p>And though experience of all times under Popery and Prelacie,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169459:6"/>
have proved this a vaine way to bring all men to be of one minde, yet theſe men are not yet made wiſer by the folly of others, but ſuffer themſelves to be outwitted by the devilliſh policies of thoſe that put them on in thoſe compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and reſtrictive courſes, as knowing it to be the only meanes to obſtruct the truth, to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply opinions, and cauſe diviſions, without which they know they ſhould in vaine attempt the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or deſtruction of the honeſt party.</p>
            <p>Be you therefore wiſe in time, and ſpeedily and freely unite your ſelves to thoſe your brethren, though reproached with never ſo many nick-names, and uſe all lawfull meanes for their eaſe and freedome, and for protection from reproach, injury or violence, that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169459:7"/>
they may be encouraged to abide in, and returne unto this our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed country, and to contribute their utmoſt aſſiſtance to free the ſame from the bloudy intentions of the common enemies, and give them aſſurance of a comfortable freedome of conſcience when a happy end ſhall be given to theſe wofull times: you cannot deny but that they are to bee truſted in any imployment equall to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men, not one of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proved falſe hearted or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous in any publike employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſticke you therefore cloſe to them, they will moſt certainly ſticke cloſe to you; which if you doe, all the Popiſh and malignant party in the world will not be able to circumvent you: but if you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your ſelves to be ſo groſſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded as to deſpiſe or renounce
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169459:7"/>
their aſſiſtance and aſſociation, you ſhall ſoone perceive your ſelves to be over-growne with malignants (the taking of a Covenant will not change a blackamore) your bondage will be ſpeedy and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: The ground upon which you renounce them is ſo unjuſt and contrary to the word of God, that God cannot proſper you; you have therefore no choice at all; but if you joyne not; you periſh: Your deſtruction is of your ſelves. (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of none elſe) your pride and diſdaine of them will be your ruine.</p>
            <p>Thus have you the faithfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of him who is neither Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt, Antinomian, Browniſt, Separatiſt or Independent: But of one that upon good ground (as he conceiveth) holdeth fellowſhip and communion with the Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
