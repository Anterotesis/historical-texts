            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthoughe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vsage of dedicating bookes, is to require the defense of some woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye personage of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge or authoritye for the thing that it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: yet the maiestie of the matter in thys boke, is such, that it rather defendes than sekes defence, and thexample of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, whych wrytes it not to one, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, suffers me not to sende it, to any one sorte of menne particularly, but general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to all that should vnfeinedly promote the encrease of Gods glory, bicause all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of men do owe a dutye to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, of this gods house. And if anye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be taken (as God knowes, none is purposelye giuen) the defence of manye is greater than of a fewe, and that authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye or credite, which one manne alone can not bring to passe, al iointly together shal more easely obtaine. The Prophet is sent from God to the Prince, the highe Priest


<pb facs="tcp:5314:3"/>
and the people: so I speake to the rulers, the ministers and comminalty. The cheef intent of his Prophecie, is to stirre all to the spedye buildinge of Gods house, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they had so long neglected: my labour is to bring some of euery sort (for al is not possible) to an earnest fortheringe of gods true religion, of late most mercifullye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored vnto vs, which not long agoe, most cruellye was persecuted, of manye yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of euery man almost now to cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye folowed and practised. But if this Prophecy were read and depelye conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with such a hungry desire of gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, as the Prophete spake and wrote it, and I for my parte and pore abilitie, haue declared it: I doute not, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good should be stirred by gods spirit, more earnestly to seke gods glory, &amp; the froward shuld be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed of gods plague, &amp; ashamed stubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely to striue against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually.</p>
            <p>The state of religion in these our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable dayes, is much like to the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som time that this Prophet liued in: God graunt that after many greuous stormes it may take like roote in vs, as it did than in them. After the long captiuity of gods people in Babilon, god gaue them gracy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous king Cyrus, which set them at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">

house: So after our longe Romish slaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, God raysed vs vp good kynges which restored vs gods booke that long had bin buried, and loused vs from the bondage of straunge gods, forreyn powers, cruell hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and wicked Idols. And as after that short fredome vnder good Cirus, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the crueltye of Hamman, for negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently handling gods buildinge: And not long after milde Ester,<note place="margin">

               </note> came blouddy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus for their falling from god: So for our talking gospel, and not worthely wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nor folowing it, vnder our gracyous late Iosias,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Macha. i.</hi>
               </note> crept out a swarm of Romish waspes, stinging to death all that would not worship their Gods, nor beleue their doctrine.</p>
            <p>God for his mercies sake, grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that now for our vnthankful coldnes in gods cause vnder our myld Ester, burst not out again bloudy Antiochus with his whelpes, iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to auenge our cold slacknes in gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and insensible dulnes.<note place="margin">

Therefore as after a

This firste part of the similitude hays two argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of their cruelnes in it, and it is asmuch as though he should haue sayd thus to them. If theues shoulde come in the day time to spoyle thee, or robbers in the night season thou coulde not haue holden thy peace, but woulde haue called and cried for helpe of thy neighbours, thou woulde haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared thy self to haue foughten with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to haue withstande them, too haue defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thine owne goods, and to haue taken or killed theym that thus violently came on thee, but whan these destroiers shall come, thou shall not be bolde too whisper, to crie, to call for helpe, or els if thou crie neuer so loude, it is but vaine too defende thy selfe, or rescew thy goodes, but fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully like a shepe lie stil, and like a coward let them doe to thee what they please: it shalbe fulfilled in thee that God thretens to the brekers of his lawe,<note place="margin">

they shalbe afraide at the fall of a leafe.
<q>Or if we rede thus (so the Ebrewe woorde signifies both wayes:) how shuld thou haue ben destroied?</q> than this is the meaninge: that although theues and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers woulde haue destroied them, yet that destruction should haue ben like to this: so extreme a plage should this be to them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these other were not worthy to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared vnto it.
The later token of their greate destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that the Babilonions, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come should deale wors with theym than theues or robbers would: for theues whan they come thei doe not take all, but the best thinges thei finde, lest they shuld not flee fast ynough awaye, or be bewraid by many thinges whan they shoulde bee knowen. And agayn they vse not to tarye longe in robbinge a house, for feare lest some shoulde espie them, and come vppon theym sodenly: but the Chaldees shoulde not be afraid of any company of men wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shoulde ouerrunne them, nor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a few thinges, but destroye all after them, and that which thei could not cary awaye, they would vtterly marre by some meanes, that they shoulde haue no good of that, which was left.

<pb facs="tcp:5314:215"/>
not haistly runne awaye for feare of any helpe cominge too rescow them, but they woulde without feare spoile &amp; tary theyr leasure, searchinge all corners, not caring who shall espie them. And that whiche is more meruailous: theues althoughe they come sodenly vpon a man, geuing no war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ninge that a man might prepare him self to stande in his owne defence, shoulde not doe so much harme as the Assirians shuld, cominge not sodenly vpon them, nor they vnprepared, but beinge prepared, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they knew of their coming, &amp; had all kinde of weapons to defend them self withall, yet thei shall not be able nor bold to defende them selfes or their countrye, but shoulde vtterly perish, be robbed, spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and destroied.</p>

He wonders at the vtter destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them whan he says: <q>how haue thei searched and ranseckt the secretes:</q> as if he shoulde saye, it shalbe vnlike vntoo all other doinges, no reason woulde thinke what great crueltie in searchinge &amp; spoile shalbe shewed vnto thee, it shalbe so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, so contrari to mens loking for, &amp; so farre vnlike too all that hais ben shewed to any other people.
