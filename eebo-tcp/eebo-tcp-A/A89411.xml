            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For he did not offer to God that which coſt him nought, but gave up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to the Miniſtry of the Word and Prayer, and the Lord was with him: Who did not only (as he ſaid) lay it on but with a warm hand rub it in. I have ſometimes thought (when I have come into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation) that the Church-meeting-place was filled with the ſmoke of Gods preſence; ſuch a power there was that went along with the word: for he firſt did, then taught, and taught and did again. <hi>Acts 1.

His ſtyle did <hi>(piſcatoriam ſimplicitatem olere)</hi> ſavoured of Fiſher-like ſimplicity, (as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſaid) he did not ſore aloft in high expreſſions, ſhooting over his hearers, but did condeſcend to the capacities of the meaneſt, which is an excellence in any: A gariſh attire doth not become a chaſt matron, neither doth the affectation of humane eloquence become a grave ſober Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt; as much affection as you will, but no affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for nothing affected affects, <hi>nihil affectationum afficit; aeger non querit medicum eloquentem ſed ſanan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſay of a Diamond, <hi>quicquid abſconditur perditur,</hi> whatſoever is hid of it is loſt; thoſe Rethorical flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes are like the painted glaſs in the windows, that make a fair ſhew, but hinder the light: therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.) becauſe the Goſpel is glorious, we uſe plainneſs of ſpeech.</p>
            <p>But that which was the glory of all in this our dear Brother, was this (I may boldly ſay) his labours were crowned with the converſion of many ſouls; which is an evident ſign of the truth of the Miniſtry by which they were converted: He was ſweeteſt (as Chriſt) towards his latter end, for he was not as a ſtaff behind the door, but being planted in the Houſe of God, and enjoying Communion with many precious Saints, he grew faſt: whereas many with <hi>Thomas, Joh,</hi> 20. 24. ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting themſelves, have fallen ſhort of that intimate Fellowſhip and Communion with Chriſt they might have attained to. But he was not like <hi>Joſhuah's</hi> Sun that

            <p>My Lords, I preſent to your ſerious view, this piece of this our dear Brother, tranſcribed by his beloved Conſort, which (though it hold forth the ſtate of the Virgin-Church to come in the latter daies) yet is it very ſuitable to the preſent times, in which you may ſee, like <hi>Peters</hi> Cock, he claps his wings, and calls upon <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 26.</note> others to waken out of their drunken ſleep.

And ſo will the word of this our dear Brother faſten upon many a ſoul (if not to his ſalvation) certainly to his eternal deſtruction, who if he were alive again, would he not ſpeak as now (though dead) in this preſent diſcourſe he ſpeaketh? Oh! reſt not ſatisfied with the Lamp of profeſſion, but get the oyl of ſaving grace into the veſſels of your hearts, and go forth to meet the Bride-groom, that when he cometh, whether at midnight, cock-crowing, or at the dawning of the day, you may not be found ſleeping, but may enter in with him. Its ſaid of <hi>Arrius,</hi> that as his errour, with the ſad effects thereof, ſpread after his death, ſo his torments were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in hell; for the Lord will render to every man not only according to his doings, but according to the fruit of his doings: If ſo (as I believe it is a truth) O then! would we add to this our Brothers Crown, and make it more maſſie, and fuller of thoſe choice pearls another day, let us remember, and forget not what by him was done and taught; but ſay, (as ſhe ſaid) Lord lay up this for me, that whenever I have occaſion to make uſe of it, (as when not) I may ſo remember it, as that I may practiſe, and be bleſſed in my deed.</p>

            <p>Concerning the Author, he was (according to his years) of an exact judgement; which appeared,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the choice of apt Subjects, with reſpect to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and times wherein he lived; as he aimed at the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Chriſts intereſt and the welfare of his people, ſo he ſingled out arguments anſwerable, upon the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof he ſpent his beſt thoughts: as might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in theſe and ſeveral other pieces of his.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In all his undertakings he laboured to diſcover to poor creatures the vileneſs of ſin, Gods free Grace, yet ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the prejudice of Goſpel-obedience: in the promoting
<pb facs="tcp:115245:6"/>
whereof he laboured very much, knowing the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactancy of fleſh and blood thereto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His wiſdom appeared in his care and tenderneſs, in that with the diſcovery of ſin he always joyned the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mercy: as he caſt down with one hand, ſo he raiſed up with the other: a Bonerges, and yet a ſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation: <hi>and oh how tender and humble towards poor troubled doubting ſouls!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In the healing and preventing of breaches among Brethren, he was admirable: the Lord gave him wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom above his years.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) As he was exact in judgement, ſo was he full of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: how warm were they, lying in the very boſom of his Maſter, which appeared in his melting frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ordinarily, and in his thirſt to draw down notions, that floated in the brain, to the heart and feeling, wherein he was exceedingly ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) As for converſation, he was not only ſpotleſs, but active in good, in his ſtudies a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dlabours, wherein as he was abundant and unwearied (which probably helped to ſhorten his life, that when his body came to conflict with the diſeaſe, he had not ſtrength to overcome) at all other times doing or receiving good; of whom it may be truly ſaid, that he did <hi>Epilcopum agere &amp; vivere</hi> act and live a true Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt: bleſſed <hi>Bradford</hi> connted that hour loſt wherein he did not ſome good with his tongue, pen or purſe. It was the commendation of bleſſed <hi>Hooper,</hi> that he was ſpare of Dyet, ſpare of Words, and ſpareſt of Time.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being committed to another hand, we ſhall forbear; the ſcope of this Epiſtle being to acquaint thee with the grounds of publiſhing theſe Sermons, and to intreat thy candid interpretation and acceptance of our endeavours therein.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:115245:6"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſatisfying of the longing deſires of ſeveral, ſome of whom eminent not only in Place, but Piety, that their hearts may be refreſhed, &amp; their memories ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reading what they formerly heard with much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <p>2. The general acceptation of the Author, even with all ſorts in thoſe places where he lived or was known.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſeaſonableneſs of the Subject: it being an Antidote againſt the raigning of that moſt dangerous evil of the times, Formality: the moſt ſatisfying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the bare Lamp of Profeſsion, not regarding the want of oyl in their veſſels: and the beſt too apt to be nodding when the cry is made: and with the Apoſtles, moſt ſleep when it moſt concerned them to be watching; which renders this Subject, not only of preſent, but laſting uſe and benefit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The manner of handling, which is ſolid and ſpiritual, ſo that the ingenuous Reader may find in this Lamp, not only light to direct him, but heat to warm him when he is a cold, and a Cry to awaken him, when he is aſleep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Authors exactneſs in penning them: as if Providence, contrary to his approved modeſty, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them for publick view, which thou haſt here, as they were left in his own private notes: and you know, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That writing and ſpeaking have their ſeveral Graces, they were publikely delivered with much advantage. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> They are ſet forth after his death, and you know cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is due to Orphans: the Authors more then ordinary growth in a few years, aſſures us, that had he lived to have reviſed this Work, it would have been much more digeſted and refined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Being left in Characters, in the tranſcribing

whereof, by the moſt diligent and exact, ſome miſtakes are almoſt unavoidable, ſo that theſe may challenge allowance, being tranſcribed by the Authors deareſt relation, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the knowledge of his Character after his death.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we intreat thee good Reader to bear with what might have eſcaped upon that, or our own accompt, which we ſhall willingly own, judging it our duty to prefer the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and eternal good of ſouls to our own names, for whoſe ſake as the Pretious Author beſtowed much of his oyl in the trimming of this Lamp, ſo we have ſet it up in view, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching the Father of Lights, to bleſs and own it with like ſucceſs and entertainment in the hearts of thoſe that ſhall read it, as he did when it was at firſt preached: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining (Chriſtian Reader)</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Deſign in theſe few lines to thee, is not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the work that is here preſented to thy view; I ſuppoſe it will ſufficiently commend it ſelf. And if it ſhould be otherwiſe, it is not I, nor any other, who by a bare teſtimony can add to the Merit of it. For though I muſt ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſs, that ſince it was left with me, I have not had time to read it exactly, nor could I keep it longer in my hands, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſelf that way, without ſome injury, having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in my retaining of it with me, to a certain time. Yet ſo far as I read, I have obſerved, that with much ſatisfaction to my ſelf, which I judge may be acceptable to others, both to inſtruct them, as alſo to awaken, quicken, refreſh, &amp; comfort them; ſo that thoſe who are wiſe, and will diligently obſerve what they read, may be greatly edified thereby. My intent is rather to ſpeak of the man, (that precious ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Murcot,</hi> who now is taken to his reſt, in that near Communion which he enjoyes with, and in his bleſſed Head) then of any particular work of his. I firſt knew him when he lived in <hi>Wirral,</hi> near <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and there was reaſon that I ſhould be familiarly acquainted with him, at that time, both becauſe he was Preacher at a place, and alſo to a people there, to many of whom my ſelf in former times ſtood related, till the violence of the then prevailing Prelates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed
<pb facs="tcp:115245:8"/>
me thence; and alſo becauſe he took to wife from among us, Mrs. <hi>Heſter Marſden,</hi> well reputed of by us, and who now ſurvives him, a ſerious Mourner, under the heavy loſs of him. He was while he lived there, the glory of that Countrey. A very quick, and lively, and powerful Preacher he was, and mighty in prayer. Eminent for piety, gravity, and holy innocency: warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and heating the hearts of the Saints by his doctrine and life; a conſiderable part whereof, he ſpent in holy Communion with them: And over-awing and ſilencing the reſt of men where he lived, by his wiſe, grave and harmleſs converſation. Dearly loved he was by ſome, and greatly reverenced by others. But in <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſpecially in the chief City thereof, <hi>Dublin,</hi> (to which place he went, when he left <hi>Wirrall,</hi> and where he ended his daies) he became like <hi>Jonah</hi> his Gourd, he ſprung up as it were in a night, his growth was wonderful in that place: he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that City, (I may ſay in ſome ſenſe) that Land, with his ſhadow: his fame went abroad through the whole Countrey, and reached to many parts of this Nation alſo. And when the Providence of the Lord carried me over thither (which was about twelve moneths ſince, and about ſix moneths after he had finiſhed his courſe, though my ſtay there was but for a little moment, yet) I met with the ſweet ſavour of his precious name, which was like an oyntment poured forth in all places where I travelled. God was (doubtleſs) very remarkably with him, for a great work was done by him in a ſhort time, as it is clearly witneſſed by all good people that live there. He ſpake the Word of God, as one who was much with God, and indeed he had alwaies much inward cloſe Communion with God in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, before he revealed any thing of him or from him openly. He ſtudied the peoples diſtempers, and found out, that formality was the great epidemical diſeaſe among profeſſors, as indeed ſo it is every where in this declining age: And he was wiſely guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the choice of ſuch ſoul-ſearching Scriptures, by which he might then ſeparate the Sheep from the Goats, the wiſe Virgins from the fooliſh, which will be Chriſts work hereafter. In a word (for prolixity is not ſo ſuitable for one who now preſents all upon report, there being all the while he lived there, a Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and me) he was a moſt induſtrious vigilant Paſtor, and a moſt auſtere and ſelf-obſerving Chriſtian. And this Crown
<pb facs="tcp:115245:8"/>
of glory the Lord put upon him, which few others have had the honour to wear; he was like a riſing Star, ever to his death in a riſing State, increaſing in ſpiritual height and ſtature every day, and grew more eminent and excellent in his gifts, graces, labours, uſefulneſs and profitableneſs continually; and he lived, not to be at a ſtay, much leſs to decline, but when he was neareſt heaven, the Lord carried him thither. He may be reckoned among the Lords Worthies, of whom the world was not worthy. The Lord hath taken him, but his remembrance will not be ſo ſoon gone. He will live while any that knew him ſhall live; and afterwards alſo, if the Lords bleſſing ſhall accompany the rehearſal of his life and death, and his Sermons Printed, in ſuch ſort as his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hath attended the paſſing and ſpending of his life, and his dying, and in the preaching of ſuch Sermons: All which were greatly ſanctified to the people that beheld and heard them.

He was but a little while in the world, but he lived long, elſe he had never yielded true Materials for ſo long a Hiſtory of his Life. The following Parts of the Book are vertually ſo, I mean the Picture of his better Part, or the image of his mind: in which, though dead, he yet ſpeaketh, and breatheth through every Page and Line, Truth and Holineſs, Zeal for God, and Compaſſion to the Souls of men, his own Taſts that the Lord is Gracious, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is longing Deſires to make others partake of the ſame Grace, which himſelf had taſted. Read the Book, and therein you have the Soul of a faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel copied out.</p>
            <p>It is an amazing Providence to ſee many unprofitable Drones, Idol Shepherds, blind Guides, Men whoſe Graces are not at all diſcernable in their lives, and whoſe gifts are ſapleſs, Spiritleſs, and upon the matter uſeleſs in their Miniſtery, live to old age, and wither upon the Stalk; while others of ſhining Graces, of lively Gifts, and of unwearied Induſtry in the Lords Vineyard, are cropt off in the very blooming, and as ſoon as ſhewed to the world, called out of it. <hi>But who may ſay to God, what doſt thou? He is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his Soul deſireth, even that he doth. He performeth the thing that is appointed for us, and many ſuch things are with him.</hi>

But though we have nothing to ſay <hi>to God, the moſt wiſe God,</hi> about this diſpenſation; yet this ſaith much to <hi>Man.</hi> This ſaith much to <hi>Ireland,</hi> whither God ſent this burning and ſhining light; Have not they much cauſe to conſider how they prized it, how they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it, ſeeing God put it out ſo quickly, and gave them ſo ſhort a ſeaſon to rejoyce in it? <hi>That he preached ſo few years to them, ſhould be to them an everlaſting Sermon.</hi> And this queſtion ſhould come thick upon the heart of that Church there, which was the Candleſtick in which God placed this light; why was it ſo? why was it ſo? why hath the Lord removed our Teacher into a Corner (the very Grave) ſo that our eyes cannot ſee our Teacher (who was alſo a Paſtor after his own heart) any more? Was he enough in our hearts? or was he too much there? We may forfeit our enjoyments by too high, as well as by too low an eſteem of them; and by looking too much upon means, provoke God to hide it from us. But whatever moved the Lord to take him from you, it well becomes you to be thankful that you had him (though but for a ſhort ſeaſon) in perſon among you, and that ſo much of him (this mant le which fell from him as he was aſcending) is gathered up, and left with you and other Churches, as his Monument and Memorial for ever.</p>

A flower may ſmell ſweet after it is cropt, and a way made for the Sun to ſhine after it is ſet.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>John Murcot,</hi> (the Hiſtory of whoſe life is now to be related) was born in the antient Town of <hi>Warwick,</hi> of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents conſiderable for their Extraction, more for their ſhining and pious converſation.</p>
                  <p>His Fathers name <hi>Job Murcot,</hi> who applyed himſelf to the ſtudy of the Law, which brought him in a competent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſubſiſtence, though ſince humbled by the calamitous inconveniences of theſe diſtracted times, whoſe various revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have occaſioned a waſting and undoing unto many.</p>
                  <p>His mothers name before her marriage with his Father, was <hi>Joan Townſend,</hi> of raiſed parts, and eminent piety, the happy mother of an hopeful ſon, the renowned Root from whence apppeared and ſprouted up this fair and flouriſhing Branch, planted by the Rivers of water, who brought forth his fruit in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>His Parents were conſcientiouſly careful of his education, made it their buſineſs to ſeaſon him with ſound and ſolid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in his young and tender years, which he greedily ſuckt in, as having an early thirſt after God; and he, who erſt while hung on his Mothers breaſt for milk, now hangs on her lips for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>His Parents perceiving in this their young <hi>Timothy</hi> an ardent deſire to be intimately acquainted with the Scriptures, and in order thereunto, with Academical learning were very prone to contribute their endeavours towards the ripening of theſe hopeful Buddings and promiſing Beginnings, and therefore in the firſt place committed him to the care and tuition of an able and godly School-maſter, Mr. <hi>Dugard,</hi> who inſtilled inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both with his lips and life, deſirous to make him not only a Scholar, but a Chriſtian; Its hard to ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> which was more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and induſtrious, the Maſter in teaching, or the Scholar in learning. Time was not miſpent and prodigally expended
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115245:19"/>
in the eager purſuite of childiſh vanities; he ran at his firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and did not lazily loiter when he ſhould be minding his work; yea, when other boyes would be ſporting and playing, he would be ſtudiouſly retired, ſolitarineſs and meditation being unto him inſtead of recreation.</p>
                  <p>Being competently furniſhed for the Univerſity, his Father ſent him to Oxford, where he continued his former diligence in his ſtudies, under the conduct and overſight of Mr. <hi>Button,</hi> his faithful and religious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tutor in <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge. About two years after his thriving abode there, the Kings Forces poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Oxford,</hi> put all things into an hurry, and ingaged the ſtudents in ſuch perplexing ſnares, that Mr. <hi>Murcot,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intangle himſelf out of theſe uncouth inconveniences, fled from <hi>Oxford</hi> diſguiſed, and repaired to the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> of <hi>Budworth,</hi> an antient, grave, able and learned man, and Miniſter of that place; and there ſtudied hard both day and night, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing himſelf but four hours for ſleep, ſo intent was he upon his Book, and ſo wholly taken up with religious Exerciſes. The cloud being blown over, he repaired the ſecond time to the Univerſity, and his former diligence which cauſed the eyes of many to fix and faſten on him, as perceiving ſomething more then ordinary in him, and expecting more than ordinary from him. Though means and maintenance were now very ſhort, yet it did not diſcourage and cauſe him to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Having taken his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he returned to his old friend Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> and was ſeveral waies uſeful to him, who now called upon him to appear in publike, which he did not without much fear, and trembling, as being conſcious to himſelf of his own inabilities for ſo pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous an employment, and loth to put to his ſhoulders, leſt he ſhould ſink under the burden.

                  <p>The Lord was pleaſed to own him in his firſt attempts and endeavours, giving him a ſeal unto his Miniſtry, by the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of two eſpecially, who being awakened by his ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſmart expreſsion, and powerful delivery, ſadly bemoaned themſelves and mourned over their loſt condition, even in publike.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Aſhbury</hi> (a call being cleared up) he removed to <hi>Eaſtham</hi> in <hi>Woral,</hi> and gained mightily upon the affections of many, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the godly, whoſe hearts began betimes to be knit unto him, and here likewiſe the Lord was pleaſed to water his labours with the dew of his bleſsing.</p>
                  <p>But me thinks I ſee a black cloud ariſing; this bright ſtar, who ſhined full clearly, and comfortably unto others, is now himſelf eclipſed, and He, who was a skilful Pilot to direct others through the ſplitting Rocks and ſwallowing Gulphs, is now himſelf plunged into the great deep; the Lord perſecutes him with his tempeſt, and makes him afraid with his ſtorm, all his waves, and his billows go over him.

                  <p>It was a common Practiſe in thoſe parts; to have Ales, as they called them, <hi>alias</hi> Good-fellow meetings, in which the night was conſumed in rioting and drunkenneſs: the creatures abuſed, God moſt ſhamefully diſhonoured, and men and women there met together, drawn into ſingular inconveniences, which diſorders were a ſword in the bones, and a ſharp thorn in the tender eye of this waking watchman.</p>

Though the ſickneſs at that time was comfortably abated, and the family to which he related, not in the leaſt tainted, yet, this man is very ſhortly after viſited, and by that ſignal ſtroak from the hand of the Lord, hurried out of the Land of the living.</p>

                  <p>Drawing near to the Bar of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which as yet had not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough to warrant a ſafe paſſage over it; a ſmall veſſel which was there at Anchor weighs, as fearing a ſurpriſal, and flies, when none purſues.

In the conteſt ſome powder is fired, ſeveral Paſſengers are blown up into the air, and fall into the Sea, both Elements, as it were, conſpiring their ruine, the one by ſcorching, and the other by ſuffocation.

                  <p>The Lord hath more work for Mr. <hi>Murcet</hi> to do, and therefore he ſhall not dye, but live, and declare the Name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Arriving at <hi>Dublin,</hi> he is hoſpitably and kindly entertained by Sir <hi>Robert King</hi> in his own houſe, who conduced much towards his coming over.</p>
                  <p>A while after, obſerving with a ſtrict eye the Church at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and approving its ſoundneſs in doctrine, and ſeverity in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, he aſſayed to joyn himſelf unto them, and was readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,

they unanimouſly and chearfully giving unto him the right hand of fellowſhip.</p>
                  <p>And now like a ſlip placed in a rich ſoil, he ſprouted up apace, which appeared by a viſible increaſe of Gifts and Graces. His leaves were not only broad and beautiful, but his fruit was fair and full, and of proportionable dimenſions. His Spikenard ſent forth the ſmell thereof to the refreſhing of many, and his ſmell was as the ſmell of a Field that the Lord had bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Preaching on a Faſt-day before the Commiſſioners of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he got cold, and by a dangerous Feavour was brought to the brink of the Pit. Being in a very great and ill-portending ſweat, his Phyſitians gave him over, as thinking that his life and ſweat would expire and ceaſe together, but the Lord had mercy on him, and therein on many others, eſpecially his abſent wife, who was not yet come to him. The means of his Recovery this: His Nurſe ſeeing him in ſuch a deplorable condition, reſolved to try her skill, and commit the ſucceſs unto God; wherefore mingling ſome Sack with his broth, ſhe gave it him to drink, with which his waſted ſpirits are refreſhed, his ſweat leaves him, and with it his diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The Commiſſioners of Parliament having occaſion to go into the Weſt, take him along with them, as knowing that he would be of uſe to them, and to the ſeveral places through which they were to paſs; and indeed ſo he was, leaving a ſweet ſavour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him upon the ſpirits of many.</p>
                  <p>Being at <hi>Cork,</hi> his continuance and fixing there was deſired and requeſted, eſpecially by the godly, who afterwards employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Walter Cooper</hi> (whoſe affairs called him up to <hi>Dublin)</hi> by him made a ſolemn addreſs to the Church, and importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated a ſupply out of their ſtore. The matter is debated, the Lord ſought in the thing, but no inclination appears of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him. But above all, Mr. <hi>Murcot</hi> addreſſeth himſelf in private to a more ſerious and penetrating conſideration of the matter. Some few of thoſe many particulars which he ſpread before the Lord, and weighed in the Ballance of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, are here preſented, for the reſt are unhappily loſt.</p>

                  <p>The reſult of all is briefly this, a Reſolution to continue ſtill at <hi>Dublin,</hi> unleſs taken off by a clearer Call then this.</p>
                  <p>Some time after <hi>Joſeph Eyres</hi> came out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Youghall</hi> upon the account of his own perſonal concernments, and roſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after the expiration of ſome moneths to return to <hi>London,</hi> but preaching occaſionally at <hi>Cork,</hi> the inhabitants deſire his ſtay and exerciſe of his Miniſtry amongſt them, and ſo much the rather, becauſe at that time the Miniſters of the County of <hi>Cork</hi> were generally articled againſt. A Petition was preſented to the Authority there, which to the ſadning of the ſouls of the righteous, met not with a deſired compliance. However Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> was ingaged to continue there, till addreſſes ſhould be made to the ſuperiour powers at <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order hereunto, a Faſt is appointed, Dr. <hi>Worth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> preached and prayed, the product of which was, an unanimous Reſolution in the people to ſend Mr. <hi>Mark Taylor,</hi> (a man of known integrity, zeal for God, and love to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115245:26"/>
the Truth) to <hi>Dublin,</hi> with a Petition to the Commiſſioners of Parliament, the tenour of which was an humble requeſt, that they might have Mr. <hi>Murcot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſettled amongſt them. The Commiſſioners are more inclinable to Mr <hi>Murcots</hi> removal then the Inhabitants of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who are loath to part with a clear and ſteady light in times of diſtraction, confuſion, and doleful defection from the Truth. Wherefore the City Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Authority for his ſtay, yet are willing to ſpare him for two moneths; ſo that Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> hath his company down to <hi>Cork,</hi> and the people of that and other places the benefit of his Miniſtry; whoſe doctrine dropping as the rain, and diſtilling as the dew, cauſed a greenneſs, and verdure to appear upon ſome parched mountains of Pride, Vanity, Prophanneſs, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flouriſhing in ſuch precious plants, as were now in a languiſhing condition, for want of theſe refreſhing ſhowers, which after a time of drought, were the more welcome to them, and the more fruitfully improved by them.</p>
                  <p>During the time of his abode at <hi>Cork,</hi> and viſible ſucceſs there, an unhappy Accident fell out, whereby the minds of the attentive people, (who now began to look about them, and to mind the things belonging unto their peace) were wofully diſtracted, and the free progreſs and paſſage of the Goſpel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded, and that was his engagement with Dr. <hi>Harding</hi> about Infant-Baptiſm, an account whereof take under his own hand, ſent in a letter to a friend in <hi>Dublin.</hi>

                              <p>
                                 <hi>FOrmerly. Dr.</hi> Worth <hi>and ſome others, had a conference with Dr.</hi> Harding <hi>and ſome others touching infants Baptiſm, and being not ſatisfied herewith, Dr.</hi> Harding <hi>did provoke Dr.</hi> Worth <hi>to a further debate about it. And to omit many other paſſages not worth the mentioning, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon</hi> Thurſday, May' 19. <hi>after my Sermon at</hi> Peters, <hi>Dr.</hi> Harding <hi>publikely produced a Queſtion, (which before he had ſent to Dr.</hi> Worth) <hi>and bore the people in hand; he was willing to diſpute it with Dr.</hi> Worth, <hi>and that Dr.</hi> Worth <hi>was unwilling; though indeed the Queſtion was ſuch a confuſed heap, that it is no wonder if neither Dr.</hi> Worth, <hi>nor any other rational man would undertake it:</hi> viz. <hi>Whether the practiſe of Dr.</hi> Worth <hi>and other pretended Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt in</hi> England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>in ſprinkling of Infants, were according to the mind of Chriſt, and ſo be proved and approved by the Primitive Churches; or to this purpoſe I am ſure for all the ſubſtantials of it. If Dr.</hi> Worth <hi>undertake this, then every rational man ſees; what confuſion he is involved in; if not, then the people muſt believe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines diſputing with him. It is doubtful Dr.</hi> Harding <hi>did not much matter which way it had gone, he had his ends either way. I conceive Dr.</hi> Worth <hi>declined his Queſtion as ſtated by himſelf, and offered to diſpute upon either of theſe two:</hi> viz. 1. <hi>Whether any Infants ought to be baptized, holding the Affirmative. 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons duly baptized in infancy, ought to be rebaptized, when adult, holding the Negative. Dr.</hi> Harding <hi>refuſed both, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſerve him but his confuſed heap of Queſtions in one; A known fallacy. After much conteſt</hi> Pro <hi>and</hi> Con: <hi>I was griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee ſo little Candor, as I conceived in Dr.</hi> Harding, <hi>and took the boldneſs to requeſt of him to ſatisfie the Congregation; that to the firſt of the two, he would ſay I or no. When Dr.</hi> Worth <hi>preſt him to it many times, he would not anſwer, no ſooner had I ſpoken, but he ſaid, To Mr.</hi> Murcot <hi>he would ſay No, that is, That no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115245:27"/>
were to be baptized; And to ſatisfie the Congregation, would maintain it againſt me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though not againſt him. This much troubled me, it being ſo beſide my intention, and againſt my reſolution, to turn aſide from the main work to any thing of this nature; And indeed it did, I doubt, (through the ſubtilty of the wicked one) put that Sermon put of the Peoples minds, and prevent them of another the next week; I did long refuſe it, telling him, He did but now chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all men, and why not undertake Dr.</hi> Worth <hi>as well as me, except he fought for Victory more then Truth? but at laſt I yielded to undertake it, with Dr.</hi> Worth, <hi>though I muſt be the Forlorn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The next</hi> Thurſday, <hi>that is,</hi> May 26. <hi>as I remember, was ſet for it, the Queſtion was agreed upon then a week before, and the manner of managing it, by way of Syllogiſm, not long diſcourſes, which lead peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into a maze. The time came, and yet (notwithſtanding former agreements in the face of the Congregation) there was ſo little can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſhewed, as that two hours I am confident were ſpent before I could bring him to agree to the Queſtion and manner of diſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Having (though with ſome reluctancy at firſt) taken upon him the overſight of the Flock of God, he led them forth into green paſtures, by the ſides of the pleaſant waters, and fed them, not with husks (as many do) but wholſom food: Careful he was to preſerve the poor Lambs of Chriſt from infection, &amp; depredation.</p>

                  <p>The Lord having fixt him in the Firmament of the Church, he proved not a wandring ſtar; his regular motion kept others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in compaſs. He was not a cloud without water, as appeared by the flouriſhing growth of many Chriſtians, who ſate under the honey drops that diſtilled from his lips.</p>
                  <p>How did he thirſt after the ſalvation of ſouls, and how anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inquiſitive after the ſucceſs of his labours? It did not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him that the ſeed was ſown, fruits muſt appear, or elſe his heart is mightily troubled within him, and little comfort taken in the comforts of this life.</p>
                  <p>It was an heart-breaking unto him, that the hearts of ſinners
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115245:31"/>
were no more boken; their dry eys would cauſe his to overflow with briny tears.</p>
                  <p>The Lord did not give up his Miniſtry to the curſe of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying womb and dry breaſts. He was able to ſay, Lo here am <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 13.</note> I, and the children whom thou haſt given me.</p>
                  <p>Surely in labours he was more abundant then many others, <note place="margin">2 Car. 11. 23.</note> as his Cloſet, Pulpit, beſides many other places can well teſtifie. Recreations he declined, ſo loath was he to be accounted a loyterer, or idler in Gods Vineyard. Having put his hand unto <note place="margin">Luke 9. 61.</note> the Plough, he did not at any time ſtand ſtill he looked not back he ſate not down in the cool and gentle ſhade, but was always in an erect poſture, and continually preſſing forward, contented to bear the burthen, and the heat of the day, as knowing that the time of refreſhing was ſhortly to come from the preſence of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>So eagerly bent was he upon his work, that when ſeriouſly ſetled to it, his neceſſary and appointed food was frequently neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, wife, children, and other Relations not taken notice of. If any refreſhing was urged, he would ſay, This is not the way to get my Fathers work done.</p>
                  <p>The Subjects that he pitcht on were uſually adapted and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the temper of the Times and his own condition, as Preaching both to others and himſelf. It did not ſatisfie him that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Truth was Preached, unleſs it were ſeaſonable and ſuitable. The Sermons that he Prcached, he throughly digeſted before hand, and made them his own by a deep impreſſion of them, not only on his memory, but affections; ſo that he ſtill ſpake from the heart to the heart. They, who beheld him in a Pulpir, with a ſpiritually diſcerning eye, thought the place to be (as it were) filled with ſmoak, and ſignal expreſſions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence.</p>
                  <p>The growing and prevailing Corruptions of the Times he ſtrongly oppoſed. Errors, though countenanced by great Ones, were not baſely baulked, and paſſed by in ſilence. The miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of thoſe in high Places were ſure to meet with a ſevere and ſharp rebuke.</p>
                  <p>He often bewailed, and greatly mourned for the evil, and dangerous conſequence of corrupt men called to the Miniſtry, who daub with untempered morter, and ſlightly heal the wound that is made with a faithful hand.</p>

                  <p>He would cheerfully chirp, and ſweetly warble out his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained Notes, when (with the Swallow) neer Gods Alta; but would mourn like a Dove, and chatter like a Crane, when the waters of the Sanctuary were dammed up, and did not freely flow forth; he would droop and hang the wing, though under the broad ſpreading guords of carnal contentments.</p>
                  <p>He abridged and cut himſelf ſhort in the uſe of the warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contentments of the preſent life. He was unwilling to launch out too far, leſt he ſhould loſe the ſight of his Harbor, and a ſtorm ariſe ere he got in again.</p>
                  <p>He was loath to ſwallow down large morſels for fear of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ſurſeit, and diſmal dolefull diſtempers that might thence ariſe. He knew that the faireſt full-blown Roſe was not without its grieving thorn, and that a ſcratching Bryer lay lurking under the blooming leaves, and therefore he paſſed over the moſt flowrie and fragrant walk with an haſty and trembling foot.</p>
                  <p>He was none of thoſe whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, that mind earthly things. His work was his wages. His deſign was not to <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note> ſpread his roots in the earth, and to ſecure a carnal intereſt by corrupt compliances. His mouth was not gagg'd with a wedge of gold, or his lips ſown up with the ſilken thread of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</p>
                  <p>Being poſleſſed of the pearl of price he thought himſelf rich enough; and having food and raiment he was therewithall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. If any thing conſiderable were providentially caſt in, it <note place="margin">3 Tim. 6. 8.</note> was not greedily gaped after, and extorted by much preſſing importunity and incroaching crouching attendances.</p>
                  <p>The things which he poſſeſſed, he was ignorant of, as not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to intermiddle at all in the matters of the world, that ſo he might in a more ſerene way and maner have his converſation <note place="margin">Phil. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

him, all other enjoyments, though ſwelling to a mountanous bulk, were but motes and molehills. He admired not the beauty of any Roſe, ſave that of <hi>Sharon.</hi> The flower-planted without hand was lovely in his ſight, and ſweet unto his ſmell.</p>
                  <p>He taſted ſuch ſurpaſſing and heart-raviſhing ſweetneſs in communion with Chriſt, that the edge of his appetite to the things of the world was exceedingly blunted and rebated.</p>
                  <p>The love of God being ſhed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghoſt, he valued not the favor or the frowns of the children of men. Whilſt others had their beilies cleaving unto the duſt, he almoſt loathed to touch it with his feet; ſo far was he from panting after the duſt of the earth.</p>
                  <p>He preferred grave contentments, and ſolid delights before the fleeting and tranſcient titillations of the exterior ſenſes. How much better are the wholſome ſeverities of Religion, then the fulſome ſatisfactions of the fleſh?</p>
                  <p>His heart and hands were mightily inlarged in a way of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable contribution, even to conſiderable ſumms, when the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous condition of others called for ſpeedy ſuccours and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 2.</note> What he gave was not grudgingly, but of a ready mind.

                  <p>His meekneſs was remarkable, as knowing it was his glory to paſs by an offence; the reproaches of rayling <hi>Rabſhak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He was not eaſily ſtirred up to anger, but had a ſweet calm in his ſpirit, though ſometimes blown upon by the ſurly winds of unhandſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations. Paſſionate expreſſions fell not from him though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally of an harſh and haſty temper. He would not ſay I will do unto the man as he hath done to me, but choſe rather to <note place="margin">Prev. 24. 29. Rom. 12. 20, 21.</note> do good for evil, and melt (rather then exaſperate) his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, by heaping up coals of kindneſs upon their heads.</p>
                  <p>Humility is not without cauſe ſtiled the grace of graces, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which adds a luſtre to them, and makes them the more orient, and reſplendent.

ſulley, cloud our otherways laudable endowments; it is that worm which makes the greeneſt gourd to wither, and the faireſt flower to loſe its native beauty.

                  <p n="1">1. His mean thoughts of himſelf, though his gifts, graces, performances rendred him conſiderable, yet the eſteem which he had of himſelf was very ſmall. His face did ſhine as that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the dazling of others eys, yet he ſaw it not himſelf, nor could endure to be told by others that it did ſo, but would cry out of a ſnare.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His high thoughts of others gifts and graces, though poſſibly coming ſhort of his.

His temptations to pride and puffings up, were not a few, having the high and boſome reſpects of great and ſmall; the applauſes, commendations, gratulations of the generality of the people, and great ſucceſs of his labours. When others would be lifting him up, he ſtill croucht. and lay low. He was none of thoſe whom a freer acceſs, and a more open boſome, a kinder glance, and a more favourable nod from great men, ſwell with ſelf-conceit and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He was none of thoſe Court-preachers, whoſe extraordinary ſpruceneſs, gay apparrel, and bridling deportment are ſhrewdly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115245:33"/>
ſuſpected to be nought elſe but the frothy ebullitions of a proud and vain ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>He was no Borderer upon Religion, dwelling only in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields, and confines of godlineſs, but was admitted into its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour, and ſecret receſſes. Religion indeed was his buſineſs, which he proſecuted with all his might. The world had but a ſmall portion of his time and a very ſlender intereſt in his affections. He was grown as dexterous in the exerciſe of grace, and in the ſucceſsful promoting, and carrying on of the holy life, as others are in growing rich, greatning themſelves, and providing for Poſterity. He was afraid of digging in the earth, leſt a cold damp ſhould ariſe to dimm his light, and ſuffocate his celeſtial comforts. His conſtant commerce was with heaven, and ſurely that trade which he drove was for rich commodities.</p>
                  <p>He adventured his all, and was bleſſed with daily returns, to his unſpeakable advantage</p>
                  <p>Though he were a ſtranger in this earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he was not ſo to his Saviour, or himſelf, which will plainly appear, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what his daily practiſe was for ſome years before his death.</p>
                  <p>He kept an exact Diary of his own life, in which he was very curious and methodical; in one Column, or ſide of the page he would ſet down the <hi>Good,</hi> in the other, oppoſite againſt it, the <hi>Evil.</hi> His intention doubtleſs was, never to make, either the whole or any part of it publick, yet judicious Chriſtians appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that ſeveral Paſſages in it may tend very much to the edification of others, ſome choice flowers growing here and there in this ſpacious and odoriferous garden, I have pickt up, made into a Poſie, and do here expoſe them to publick view.</p>

At even the people being come together, he accompanied the Corps unto the grave, into which he was obſerved to look very wiſhly, as if he had been curioſly looking for a reſting, place for himſelf, ſhortly to lye down in, and had thus beſpoken his dead <note place="margin">2 Sam. 2. 23.</note> child, I ſhall ſhortly come to thee, but thou ſhalt not return to me.</p>
                  <p>Coming home, he was very raiſed and chearful, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his wife, with this ſaying among many others; Come love, he has but got the ſtart of us.</p>
                  <p>It being my work to track him, and tread upon the print of his heels. I muſt follow him, even through the valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, which was not ſo frightful to him in its approach, as to me uncomfortable in its deſcription.</p>
                  <p>The time of his departure is at hand, and no wonder; He was ripe betimes, and therefore gathered, and taken into Gods Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.

He cannot be far off from his center, becauſe of the ſwiftneſs of his motion.</p>
                  <p>He was alwaies much upon the wing, but towards his latter end, he was wont to ſoar very high, and took many a turn in Paradiſe every day, and would be often hovering about the Caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Star-chamber; which having delightfully peept and pryed into, he came down again, though not without much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and grief, yet ſolacing himſelf with this conſideration, that he ſhould ſhortly meet the Lord in the air, and then be ever with the Lord.</p>
                  <p>During the time of his pilgrimage, and abode in the Lords Vineyard, he ſerved his God, and his Generation with all his might. He ran faſter then others, and was therefore ſooner out of breath. He ſcrewed up the peggs ſo high, that the ſtrings of his ſeveral faculties crack, and can hold out no longer. He did with ſo much vehemency and contention of ſpirit, continually ſtir up himſelf to take hold on God, and followed ſo hard after him, that he ſunk under the burden of his own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>

it ſelf on the Lords day in his forenoons Sermon, which (after his return from the Congregation) he laboured to conceal from his wife, by endeavouring to eat, though it were much againſt his ſtomach: ſhe perceiving ſome alteration in his countenance, and carriage, ſaid, You are not well, pray preach not again; to whom he replyed, away, away, hinder me not: Whereupon he retired to his ſtudy, and adventured to preach again in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, though with ſome difficulty, and apparent ſymptoms of ſickneſs in his very viſage.

                  <p>At even, the people (according to their accuſtomed manner) came crouding and thronging to Repetition. His wife in vain perſwaded him to diſmiſs the Aſſembly: in repeating his Sermons, Singing and Prayer, he ſpent about two hours time.</p>
                  <p>At Supper he did eat a little with his wife, and that chearfully, yet complained of an unuſual heavineſs in his head, and ſoreneſs in his eys, when endeavou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A day of Thankſgiving in private for his own return from <hi>London,</hi> and his wives late ſafe delivery, was deſigned to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated about this time; the conſideration of which occaſioned ſome ſadneſs, whereupon to his wife he ſaid, This is ſad love, this looks as if the Lord would not accept of an Offering of praiſe from our hands: And then he called for the Notes of a Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Sermon, preached long before by Doctor <hi>Jones</hi> on that paſſage of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Who rendred not unto the Lord accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">2 Chro. 32. 25.</note> to the benefit.</p>
                  <p>The third day, as a choice Chriſtian friend, who came to viſit him, was diſcourſing with his wife, he fell afleep, and two or three hours after awaking, he called for his wife, who coming to him, and kneeling down upon the beds ſide, he fixed his eys

                  <p>About the fifth day, in letting blood he fainted, and with a low voyce ſaid, What means this? it was not thus with me at Sir <hi>Roberts Kings.</hi> To his wife looking upon him, he ſaid, Now Love; it is a weaning time. He was more careful of Gods Service then of his own attendance, cauſing the ſervants to leave him, that ſo their duty to God in ways of worſhip might not be neglected.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh day, being the Sabbath, he inquired who carried on the work, and ſeemed to affect retirement, and ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God upon his own day.

                  <p>The thirteenth day in the morning, being Saturday, his pains were very violent for an hour and half, and extorted from him that doleful complaint, Lord how long? Ah, my bowels, my bowels, I have grieved bowels, this ſpeaks much; I have wanted bowels, I have not been ſo pittiful towards others.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor being ſent for, and ſtaying longer then was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, he ſaid, Lord give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man.

                  <p>Paper being brought, he began thus; I reſign my ſpirit into the hands of the Father of Spirits, and into the boſome of my dear Lord, &amp;c. To this there were but three or four lines more added, for he was in haſte and longed to be at home.</p>
                  <p>To his wife (having in a very ſhort ſpace diſpatched his Will) he ſaid, Bury me in ſilence, without Funeral Sermon, I will have no manner of pomp; but was perſwaded to yeild to the intreaties of his wife, as to a Sermon.</p>
                  <p>As his children were called for, Doctor <hi>Winter</hi> came in to

viſit him, who unexpectedly ſeeing death in his face, ſaid, with a loud and lamenting voice, Brother <hi>Murcot</hi> are you leaving us? who with unaltered countenance, ſaid, Yes, and deſired him to pray quickly. His children being brought, he ſaid to his eldeſt, Will <hi>Heſter</hi> be a good child and ſerve the Lord? His ſon being preſented, he expreſſed himſelf thus, The Lord break thy ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born heart. When the little one hanging on the mothers breſt was expoſed to his ſight, he lift up his hands, and ſaid, The Lord bleſs thee. Being put in mind of his ſervants, he affectionately and even ſmilingly looked up upon one, whom he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to convert, and ſaid, <hi>Beſs</hi> hath a better Maſter, the Lord be with thee <hi>Beſs.</hi> The children being taken away, and his wife coming to take her laſt leave and final farewel of him, he alone lift up himſelf and kiſſed her. Dr. <hi>Winter</hi> deſiring an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in his prayers, he ſaid, The Lord ſtrengthen you for the double work that now lies on you, and withal deſired him to pray with him; which he did in a moſt pathetical and doleful manner, groaning out his requeſts unto God. The people, though deſired, are loath to leave the chamber, and hang ſo thick on the curtains, bed-poſts, hangings, doors, having not the power to leave their dear and departing friend, ſo that he is in danger of being ſmothered, and dying before his time.</p>
                  <p>Drawing near his end, his ſiſter ſaid to him, Are you in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with all the Lords people, though differing from you? Who lifting up his eyes affectionately, ſaid, Yes; She deſiring him to manifeſt it by his laſt requeſt, he lifted up his hands and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all the Lords people might be one, as his way was one.</p>
                  <p>Then ſtretching out his arms, and lifting himſelf up, he ſaid with a loud and ſhrill voice, Lord Jeſus draw me up to thee: which ſweet expreſſions, by a frequent and fervent repetition waſted his ſpirits, ſo that afterwards he lay in ſomewhat a ſilent poſture, waiting for his change, which was now neer at hand.</p>
                  <p>About nine of the clock he breathed out his ſoul into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of Chriſt, and quietly ſlept in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following, being the appointed time of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment, great was the confluence of people, who attended the corps unto the grave. The Lord Deputy <hi>Fleetwood</hi> followed the

The Body being brought unto the place of burial, the ſadned ſpectators and ſtanders-by ſighed him into his grave, and mingling his duſt with their moiſt tears, depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and left him in his bed of reſt.</p>

                  <p>And firſt to you, my Brethren in the Miniſtry, I addreſs my ſelf, and earneſtly intreate you in the bowels of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord to remember, That you are not only Church-Officers, but Chriſtians. Spend not your whole time in reading books, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying other men; you will do well to ſtudy your ſelves, and to be acquainted with the frame of your own hearts. The way which you point out unto others, walk in your ſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly practiſe the duties which you pangatively preſs.

Let not your own cloathes be full of duſt, when you are bruſhing other mens backs. Its not handſom for us to be alwaies ſweeping before the doors of others, and picking up the leaſt offenſive ſtraw, whileſt huge heaps of dunghil filth lie before our own doors unremoved. It <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 4.</note> opens the mouths of oppoſites, when we are taken notice of, to bind heavy burdens on other mens ſhoulders, we in the mean time refuſing to touch them with the leaſt of our fingers.

We have more reaſon to rejoyce in having our names written in the <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 20.</note> Lambs book of Life, then in having the Devils ſubject to us. O whileſt we paſsionately endeavour the ſalvation of others ſouls, let us have an eye of tender regard unto our own. One hint more at parting,—We cannot be too often put in mind of that which is our proper work, and doth moſt neerly concern us to be buſied about: <hi>viz.</hi> Reading, Exhortation, Doctrine. Let <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13.</note> not our Sabbath-daies diſcourſes ſavour of the tireſom diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the preceding week; giving the People occaſion to ſay, That if we were leſs earthly and carnal, our diſcourſes would be more heavenly and ſpiritual. The ingrateful world many times puts us to our ſhifts to get a ſubſiſtence, yet let us take heed of too deep and unneceſſary engagements in matters ſecular, that are heterogeneal and excentrical to our employment. Its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and gives occaſion of diſguſt to be ſeen ſo often in the ſtreets, and found ſo ſeldom in our ſtudies. It ſhould not ſatisfie that ſomething is done by us on the Lords day, to ſtop the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of conſcience, and the Congregation. It becomes not thoſe who ſhould ſerve God with all their might, to offer unto him that which coſt them nothing. The more pains we take in private, the more rational and methodical ſhall we be in publike. Thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are moſt affectionate, and melting, that are written with ſweat and tears as well as Ink. Sapleſs and ſucceſsleſs uſually are thoſe diſcourſes, that are the bluſtring inforcements, and yawning exactations of luſty lungs, and not the clear and elaborate diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of a judicious, and working brain. A loud ſound of words may make the ears to tingle, and cauſe a blind, and confuſed agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the affections to little purpoſe; but the Underſtanding and Reaſon are not captivated but by clear and ſolid arguments. As for diſgorging that which lies uppermoſt, on the top of a ſquezy ſtomach, under the notion of the immediate, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted dictates of the Spirit; that hath been ſufficiently explod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by able pens, as being apparently repugnant to ſound Reaſon and Religion.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians, I would likewiſe caution and adviſe in a few words.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:115245:41"/>
1. Flatter not your ſelves with fallacious and ungrounded hopes of being ſaved upon eaſie terms. Religion knows no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without a preceding work. Expect not to ride in a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Chariot, unleſs you firſt tumble in ſweat and duſt. Lazy Lozels ſhall be ſcourged, when conquering combatants ſhall be crowned. Chriſt hath told you, that the way is narrow, and the Gate is ſtraight; and therefore turn the deaf ear to the contrary <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 14.</note> ſuggeſtions of thoſe, who would fain perſwade you, that the way is broader, and the Gate wider then Chriſt hath made it. The Saints of old took no more pains then was neceſſary, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſerved God day and night, in order to obtaining the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <note place="margin">Acts 26 7.</note> and purchaſed inheritance. Our way is up-hill, no coming thither without panting.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be not diſcouraged becauſe of the unavoidable difficulties of Religion. Let not the high hills, and the ragged rocks over which you muſt climb, fright you into a benumming deadneſs, and irreſolution. Lay not aſide your Oars, though the wind and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p n="3">3. Though I propoſe the exemplary life of this holy man, as worthy your imitation, yet I would have you look higher: Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him no farther then you ſee him following Chriſt. It was a laudable height, and pitch in Religion which he attained unto, and which the generality of Profeſſors come ſhort of; Yet I do not urge you to ſail after him, and ſteer the ſame courſe, with the neglect of your Compaſs. Let your eye be upon the never-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rule of the word. The moſt Seraphical, and beſt of Saints on this ſide heaven, have ſome droſs mixed with their gold, ſome water with their moſt ſparkling and generous wine. I would not have you to be holy only, as this or that man is holy, whom you conceive to be more then ordinarily excellent, and one of thoſe who are in the higheſt form of the School of Chriſt. Let Chriſt alone be Pattern, which you will exactly imitate, and the Copy that you will write after. He was a Copy without blot, and a Lamb without ſpot.</p>
                  <p>The moſt ſhining and ſpiritual part of Mr. <hi>Murcots</hi> life, is taken out of his Diary, or daily account of himſelf in writing: The like Practiſe I would paſsionately perſwade. Its numerous
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115245:42"/>
advantages will recompence the preſent toyl. Me thinks ſuch Arguments as theſe ſhould be cogent, and conſtraining.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Self-acquaintance. A prime point of wiſdom is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans ſelf. If he be accounted wiſe, who is well verſt in State-affairs, and hath in his mind formed characters of the moſt noted men of his times: If he be reputed wiſe, who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nature of Angels, and elementary Bodies; who knows the myſterious motions, and influential operations of the ſtars, and can give a deſcription of the ſeveral birds that flie in the air, of all ſorts of beaſts that move upon the face of the earth, and of the unnumbered kinds of Fiſhes that ſwim in the great and wide Sea; then much more wiſe muſt he needs be, who by much ſearching hath acquired the knowledge of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The benefits of this ſelf-acquaintance would be deſervedly conſidered.
<q>
                        <p n="1">1. Its of conſequence to know what our condition is, as to life and death, and upon what terms we ſtand in order to ſalvation. Being daily weighed in the Ballance of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, we ſhall find whether or no we are too light. Its good to prevent thoſe miſtakes, which being not diſcovered, may prove the loſs of our ſouls.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When thou findeſt luſt prevailing, with apparent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caies and declinings in grace, here's an occaſion adminſtred for godly ſorrow to vent it ſelf, by pouring forth penitential tears before the Lord.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If thou ſeeſt the pleaſant plant of grace to thrive, and flouriſh, and overtop the ſtinking weeds of thy corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions; and if thou feel the Sun-ſhine of Gods favourable face in Chriſt, warming and chearing thy heart; here's fewel laid in for the fire of thy joy to burn and blaze. Theſe rare expreſſions of mercy, provoke thee to thankſulneſs, and to ſing aloud of Gods goodneſs.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prevention of evil. The conſideration of this, that the evil which falls from us muſt be recorded by us, and that for this end, that we might thence take occaſion to loath and abhor our ſelves in duſt and aſhes, will lay a reſtraint upon us, and be as a bridle in our mouthes, to check the inſolency of unruly luſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Accounts leſs confuſed when we come to dye. He that makes even with God every day, will find his death-bed work to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115245:42"/>
be comfortably lightned and leſſened. He that delaies and puts off the remembrance of his waies; and calling himſelf to an account till he come to be tormented with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong pain, will find himſelf in an unmeet poſture for a work of that nature. If our ſickneſs be not ſuch, as to extort loud out-cries and hideous exclamations, yet it will be ſure to oppreſs, and bow down with a dull and heavy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chearfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Self-examination is a ſolitary duty, and requires a calm, and undiſturbed retirement. Now the curtains of a ſick-bed are often opened, and the languiſhing Patient ſeldom at reſt. The weeping wife, lamenting children, ſorrowful ſervants, buſie Phyſitian, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling viſitants, muſt all be heeded and hearkened to, and anſwers returned to their enquiries; ſo that our time is taken up in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on our pain, and relating it to others. Doubtleſs, health and a cloſet are moſt convenient for ſelf-reflexions, which if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinated till the laſt period of our lives, are rarely attended with a real converſion, and turning to God in truth and ſincerity. How ſeldom are dying men new-born? and they added to the Church, that are going out of the world? The ſins of departing ſouls come crouding and thronging in ſo thick upon them, ſo that a diſtinct conſideration of them cannot be taken; and now mens former golden dreams of heaven, and high-flown hopes of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, vaniſh like ſmoak, and leave behind them in their ſtead, deſpair, deſtraction, confuſion, conſternation, and a certain fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation, and looking for of fiery indignation to devour.</p>
                  <p>O that men were wiſe, that they would remember their latter ends, and whileſt the light ſhines, provide for the daies of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for they are many.</p>
                  <p>The Devil hath a jealous eye upon all Engines that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably batter his Kingdom, looſen his hold, and weaken his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: beſides, the fleſh loves to be abundantly favoured, and therefore I expect that objections againſt this courſe, of calling our ſelves to account daily, will be multiplied.</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>The work ſeems to be attended with many thorny, and inextricable difficulties; hence mens loathneſs to take it up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He that withdraws his neck from the yoak of Chriſt becauſe of its pinching weight, is unworthy of Chriſt. In vain do men hope to be ſaved, who provide for their own eaſe, when
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115245:43"/>
Chriſt is calling upon them for ſervice. Never expect to look him with comfort in the face, unleſs you reſolve to be indefatigable in his work.</p>
                  <p>2. Do not men upon a worldly ſcore take abundance of pains in caſting up their accounts? Will not the practiſe of many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants riſe up in judgement againſt themſelves, and others at the laſt day? They can riſe early, &amp; ſit up late, and immure themſelves in their cloſets and counting-houſes, and there at large ſet down their receipts, and disburſments. Marriners, when at Sea, ſet down in their Diurnals, every turn of the wind, and when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, how many hours, nay minutes the ſhip ſailed ſuch a point of the Compaſs, and how many another; yea, though they ſleep but half the night, yet they muſt find time to do this, becauſe their lives lie at the ſtake, and the ſafety of the whole is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. How come ſouls trow to be at ſuch a low and cheap rate, that the ſafety and welfare of the Body ſhould be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them?</p>
                  <p>3. It is better to take pains then to run the hazard of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternal pains.</p>
                  <p>4. The greateſt part of the difficulty lies in the Porch: when you are once entred into the Houſe, you will not repent of the pains you have taken, but find encouragement to take more. A clear diſcovery of a mans condition hath in it much of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>Multiplicity of unavoidable worldly occaſions by ſome may be pretended for their omiſſion of this duty: they have not time; and leiſure enough to do as others do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. One thing only is neceſſary, other things are but convenient. Its neceſſary that you have grace, and be ſaved; not ſo that you be rich, and advanced to an high degree in the world.</p>
                  <p>2. Leſſen your buſineſs, and contract your occaſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a narrower compaſs. Have leſs to do in the world, that ſo you may have more time to ſpend in a devout retirement.</p>
                  <p>Believe it Chriſtians, Time is a precious Talent that muſt be reckoned for: See therefore that you husband it to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Be ſure you reſerve the morning, and evening for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, and communing with your own hearts, not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting a watchful jealouſie over your ſelves all the day.</p>
                  <p>Religion is not a little obſtructed by unneceſſary viſits, frothy
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115245:43"/>
diſcourſes, unſaint-like gamings and Paganiſh paſtimes. Take heed of being late abroad out of your own houſes. It becomes not thoſe who profeſs they look for, and haſt unto the coming of the Lord, to come ſtumbling home, and to be groping for their doors at midnight, when they ſhould rather be in the ſecret chamber, dreſſing and making themſelves ready againſt the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Supper of the Lamb.</p>
                  <p>I am bold to affirm, that reading the Scriptures, inſtructing our families, praying to God, and ſinging praiſes to his name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make ſweeter muſick in his ears, then the ratling of Tables, and the ſhuffling of Cards, the <hi>bane</hi> of great mens houſes, and it were well if the infection had not diffuſed it ſelf to multitudes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour families.</p>
                  <p>The plain truth of it is, men and women for the generality of them, chuſe not God for their chiefeſt good, they make not him the object of their delight, their rejoycing is not in Chriſt Jeſus; Religion is a ſapleſs, yea a ſour thing unto them, and hence it is that they turn aſide to vain ſports, and ſenſible delights.</p>
                  <p>If you find your hearts averſe to the practiſe of a Diary, yet let me intreat and ingage you to make tryal of it for a few daies; do not obſtinately decline a courſe which you have no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of.</p>
                  <p>But if you are reſolved through grace to take up, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in the practiſe of the duty propoſed, beware that it do not degenerate into a cuſtomary and empty formality. Reſt not in the bare doing of the thing, but proſecute the work in order to its ends, which are ſpiritual and of unſpeakable advantage.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle in this Chapter, according to his manner, doth build upon the faith in Chriſt Jeſus to juſtification, the Doctrine of good works, and a holy converſation, and matters of morality. In this Chapter he devideth that his Doctrine, as I may ſay, into <hi>Ethicks,</hi> and <hi>Oeconomicks,</hi> rules more generally concerning the framing, the converſations of all; and rules more ſpeciall and particular to Family ralations: This he had begun in the former Chaprer, ver. 17. <hi>This I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and teſtifie, that ye walk not as other</hi> Gentiles <hi>walk, in the vanity of their mind.</hi> The Apoſtle deſcends to many Particulars in that Chapter, and carrieth on the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Chapter wherein our Text is: The general Propoſition ſtill being ſuppoſed, That the Saints ought to be adorned with all manner of vertue, and to keep themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted of the world; he exhorts them to a freeneſs of pardoning
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115245:45"/>
one another, wherein thy had the Example of God, and it would declare them to be his dear children, in the firſt verſe of this Chapter: then to love; and walking in love, not in heart only, but it muſt be expreſſed actually, as Jeſus Chriſt expreſſed his love to us in giving up himſelf for us; then he dehorts them from ſeveral vices, as fornication uncleanneſs, covetouſneſs, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, fooliſh ſpeaking and jeſting, which are not convenient; yea, theſe are things will exclude from the Kingdom of heaven. Let no man deceive you with vain words, as if there were no ſuch danger in ſuch a looſe walking; thoſe are vain words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>For theſe things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of diſobedience,</hi> therefore it is no light matter I deal with you about; therefore the Apoſtle concludeth, <hi>be not therefore partakers with them;</hi> partake not of the ſins of the children of diſobedience, leſt you taſte of the wrath which cometh upon their heads for theſe their iniquities. The Apoſtle goeth on to back this his Admonition, that they be not drawn away with the error of the wicked, with many arguments. As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now their condition was changed, they were men of other principles; no marvel if heretofore, while they were darkneſs, they walked as children of darkneſs, and did work and had fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs; but now they were children of the light, and therefore muſt walk as they were; and they were fruits of the Spirit now they muſt bring forth; they were goodneſs righteouſneſs and truth; beſides, it is the part of godly men, and good children to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God, and ſubmit to him in all things; beſides; the works of darkneſs are unfruitful, and ſhameful; it is a ſhame to ſpeak of the things they do in ſecret: they were ſuch in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and they will at laſt be revealed to the confuſion of the authors of them; to all which he addeth a teſtimony from Scripture, that God doth generally every where call upon men to ariſe from their ſleep and death in ſin, and he is ready to enlighten them; he ſpeaks no more but what the Scripture of old did ſpeak; ſome difficulty is in this Verſe, but it is beſide our purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Now the words of the Text are, as I may ſay, a Repetition, and re-inforcing the general Propoſition, <hi>That the Saints ought to have their converſation adorned with every vertue, or grace,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115245:45"/>
and the fruits of them, and to keep themſelves pure and innocent, and free from the corruption of the world:</hi> From all the former Arguments, he laies down by way of Inference and Concluſion this charge in <hi>v.</hi> 15. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Without any further ſtay in the Porch, let us now enter the Houſe, and view ſome of the rooms of it; there are many things note-worthy in the words; the firſt that I ſhall take up at this time is this; <hi>It is a duty Chriſtians are ſtrictly charged with, to walk circumſpectly.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it will be requiſite to enquire what is meant by this <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect walking;</hi> and then Secondly, to make it good, that it is a duty ſo ſtrictly charged upon the Saints; and Thirdly, why it is ſo; and then Fourthly, Apply it.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, What it is to <hi>walk Cirrumſpectly:</hi> Here we have the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter and the Manner of a Chriſtians converſation; the Matter that is expreſſed, by a Walking, which indeed doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the actions of a Chriſtian life, in conformity to the Law and Will of Jeſus Chriſt, which is the Way; nothing more ordinary then to expreſs a Chriſtian courſe by a walking, and ſometimes by a running in a race: but by a walking here it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1. 2 Kin. 20. 3. Pſal. 1. 1, 2.</note> and indeed this doth include all a mans actions; his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual actions towards the Lord, they are a part of this walking, their praying, meditating, hearing, receiving, conferring, living by faith, all theſe are his ſpiritual actions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly A mans civil converſation alſo cometh under this walking; for the Rule and Will of Chriſt hath an influence over that, to bound it, and limit it. There is no calling which is lawfull but a man may therein abide with God, if it be never ſo mean; and this is another part of the walking: while men are diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployed in their particular Callings, out of obedience to his holy command, they are in their way, and walking to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115245:46"/>
heaven as well as when they are in the ſpiritual part of the walk, and ſo much the more, while they have ſpiritual hearts in this walk, ever and anon taking a turn in heaven, and having <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> their civil converſation in heaven, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, even mens natural actions are a part of this way alſo; of the Matter of this walking as eating drinking ſleeping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 16.</note> &amp;c. when they are uſed with moderation, and an end to befit us only for our ſpiritual and civil converſations; when men eat and drink for ſtrength, and not for luſt, for drunkenneſs, and eat in due ſeaſon, as to whet when the Sythe is dull; ſo that even theſe actions are a part of the walk alſo, and that it is to be taken in this latitude, will appear, if we conſider the particulars the Apoſtle preſſeth them too here, as parts of that walking.</p>
                  <p>Now to walk, you know, ſpeaks a motion; it is oppoſed to ſtanding, or lying, or ſitting ſtill; the whole world lieth in wickedneſs, and moveth not hand nor foot; they have their grave-cloaths upon them, are bound hand and foot, and are <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 1.</note> melting away in their luſts, and therefore they walk not towards heaven; there is a ſitting in the ſeat of the ſcornful when men have taken up their reſt in ſin, and are at the height, that they ſcorn the Travellers Zion-wards, with their faces thither; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is a contrary walking to this <hi>walking in the counſel of the ungodly, in the way of ſinners,</hi> a walking with ſinners hand in hand, <hi>having fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs;</hi> but that motion is from other principles even the fleſh, and this from the Spirit; and by other rules, the cuſtome of this world, to which they are conformed, the examples of <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 12. R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m. 12. 2.</note> ſinners, the commands of their tyranical luſts, and for other ends, both of the Walk, and the Walker in it; the Walk, the end of thoſe ways is death; there is a way which ſeemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death; and the end of the Walker is to chear his heart, and to ſatisfie his luſts: but this walk we ſpeak of is a contrary motion to that <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 12.</note> of the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> from whence they walk, and that is from ſin, and ſelf, and Satan, and ſinners, and the wrath which <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19. Epheſ. 5. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Cor. 6. 17.</note> is to come; but ſpecially from ſin they walk: this is the ſcope of all their ways, to get above ſin.</p>

3. There is a <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> and that is to God in Chriſt, <note place="margin">Act. 26. 17.</note> as a holy God, and a bleſſed God, that we might enjoy him as ſuch, from hell to heaven; and therefore converſion (when men are firſt turned, their poſture is turned) it is called a turning them from the power of Satan unto God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This motion is a progreſſive motion, that is to ſay, a man goeth forward in it, not round about, as a horſe in a Mill, and is at night, where he was in the morning, but as a horſe or Traveller upon the Road, which rids his ground, he getteth <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1. Pſal. 8. 4.</note> ground every ſtep; and ſo ſhould we go on toward perfection daily, die to ſin daily, get ſomewhat further off it, and to the world, and get nearer to heaven daily; we ſhould ſee to it that we grow from ſtrength to ſtrength.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a conſtant motion, for a man that walks to ſuch an end of a Journey, he giveth it not over until he come to the end of it; ſo ſhould we conſtantly be moving until we come to the end of our faith, the ſalvation of our ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A pleaſant motion to a man that is cured of his lameneſs, and is no longer a Cripple, as by Nature we are; the way is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 17. Matth. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I ſay, by reaſon of this they are weary in the ways of God, yet not weary of them, but they are pleaſant to them, his commandments are not grievous to them; but this is not the thing which I intend to ſpeak to from the words, but rather the exactneſs and circumſpection in walking; <hi>See then that ye walk cicrumſpectly,</hi>

Coloſ. 4. 5. Mat. 10. 16.</note> cannot walk cirumſpectly, and therefore the Apoſtle ſo often preſſeth it upon the Saints, that they ſhould walk wiſely, <hi>Walk in wiſdom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>towards them which are without: be wiſe as Serpents,</hi> ſaith our Saviour: I ſay there muſt be a knowledge of the way of the rule, elſe how ſhall our ſteps be meaſured by it? how ſhall a man tred and keep to the path he knoweth not? and therefore ſottiſh ignorance of the Will and Way of Chriſt, is an ill preparative to this exact walking; can a blind man walk exactly or circumſpectly that cannot ſee which way he goeth? it is an hundred to one but he turneth and goeth another courſe; but this is not all, there muſt be a right application of the rule to our actions; it is not every one that hath his rule, that knoweth how to uſe it; it is a good part of the Architects skill to uſe his Rule well and his Plum, and by them to diſcern exactly the frame of his building, yea, to direct it when he is building; ſo here, there muſt be wiſdom: how ſadly do men and women of lively affections for God miſcarry for want of wiſdom?

                  <p n="2">(2.) Yea, exact walking excludeth alſo the following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Saints any further then they follow Chriſt: and here is yet more need of circumſpection, for when we have ſome eminent Saints perſons in admiration, we are apt many times to be pinning our faith upon their ſleeve, and dancing after their pipe, to take their examples in the groſs, and by it to be led into groſs miſtakes; ſo the weak brethren looking upon the ſtronger, the more knowing, as fit to be their guides, and ſeeing them eat things offered to Idols, becauſe they knew an Idol was nothing, this incouraged them to do the ſame, though they made a breach upon their conſciences by it: here now through weakneſs they miſtook their way and warped; that might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the ſtrong that might not for the weak, which ſtumbled whether they might eat them or no, yet they would venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, leaning upon the examples of the ſtrong, and ſo they went aſide: &amp; you know what force the example of <hi>Peter</hi> had to draw <note place="margin">Gal 2 12, 13, 14.</note> others in, when he diſſembled, and did not <gap reason="foreign">

alſo am of Chriſt;</hi> now this is exact walking indeed, to follow the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 1.</note> ſootſteps of the flock, of the Saints, both before us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with us; yet where they run out of the way, and <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 8.</note> over the hedge ſet about us, not to follow them, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much circumſpection indeed. This is the third.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Exact walking, is when a man mindeth not only the external part of the rule, but the very inſide and ſpirit of the rule; he mindeth, and eyeth, and endeavoureth to come up to it, and ſo the word in its notion ſeemeth to import, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> from going from the bottome to the top of the rule: <hi>the Law is ſpiritual,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: It <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> is ſpiritual brethren, reaching the very inwards of our ſouls, the frame and diſpoſition of our hearts, all the very firſt motions of the ſoul, before any tickling by them, or conſent to them; thoſe come under this rule; and therefore a man that walks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, he labours to anſwer the Law in this, and he is labouring <note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 5. Rom. 12 8. Gal. 6. 1.</note> with his heart to bring it to ſuch a frame as this, and therefore he ſetteth not up his reſt, as moſt do, in an outward conformity to the Law of Chriſt, except he can get his heart framed by it, nor will an inperfection in the frame of his heart ſatisfie him, and therefore nothing but the reſurrection of the dead will be his reſt, this is to walk exactly, accurately indeed; and ſo in duties, to mind not only the matter, but the manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; it is not enough to work righteouſneſs, except he rejoyce and work righteouſneſs; to give, except he do it with ſingleneſs of heart, ſimplicity and chearfulneſs: it is not enough to pray, except he do it in the Spirit, and with affection, and faith, and fervor of Spirit: it is not enough to admoniſh, reprove, except he do it in ſeaſon, with bowels of compaſſion, and Wiſdom, and diſcretion, ſo tempered as that it may not miſcarry through ſuch a defect in them. O this is to walk exactly indeed.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To walk exactly then, is to carry an even courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heaven, not to walk at peradventures; and by fits and ſtarts, making many balks in our obedience; it is to follow God, and to follow him fully; when we will not leap over an hedge to avoid a foul ſtep, but keep to the way that is ſet before us, ſo in the <hi>Proverbs, Turn not to the right hand nor to the left;</hi> the meaning is not, that no man walks exactly if he live not without <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 27.

                  <p>Sixthly, He that vvalks exactly, doth make it his work ſo to vvalk; if a man be taken up vvith other things in his mind, and it be intent upon them, how unevenly doth he vvalk? he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon this ſide, and then upon that ſide of the vvay, up and down, and many times loſeth his way, and heedeth it not; but now if a man make his Journey his buſineſs, he is intent upon it, and looks about him at every turn, and every turning, leſt he ſhould go vvrong: ſo to vvalk exactly then, doth imply a vvatchfull eye, a trembling heart fearing at every turning, leſt he ſhould miſs h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now for the ſecond thing to make it good, that it is a duty ſo

ſtrictly charged upon the Saints; me thinketh this Scripture it ſelf is a full teſtimony, there needeth no further proof but yet a word or two more: you find in that of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> the Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, make ſtraite paths to your feet, ſtraite ſteps, or make <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 13.</note> ſtraite, paths with your feet, which may appear to others that are to follow you, as you follow Chriſt; tread with a ſtraite foot, and by a ſtraite rule; and in that of the <hi>Proverbs, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be eſtabliſhed;</hi> weigh <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 25.</note> your ſteps before you take them, weigh them every grain and ſcruple in the ballance of the Sanctuary: walk you <hi>Suſpenſo pede, Look before you leap,</hi> look, and look again, this is the way to have your goings eſtabliſhed; and here in the Text, ſee how it is charged upon them <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſee to it, it is a word of ſtrict charge, as we uſe to ſay to men, Well, ſee you do ſuch a thing, ſee you fail not then: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, ſee to it, <hi>that you walk</hi>

                  <p>The third thing is, why this duty is thus charged upon the Saints, to walk ſo exactly, circumſpectly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they are children of the light, and therefore ſhould walk as children of the light; they ſhould walk exactly, without rowling out of the way, without ſtumbling in the way, becauſe they have light; they that are in the darkneſs, and know not whither they go, no marvell, if at any time they ſtumble into the way of God, yet they as eaſily ſtumble out again; it is but ſuitable to them not to keep their way; but now ye are in the light, and therefore ſee that you walk accurately; you have a light to your paths, and a lanthorn to your ſteps, therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ſteps aright, make them ſtraite; therefore ſaith <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> he well ſaith <hi>videte,</hi> becauſe nothing is ſeen in the dark but; <hi>Beza</hi> thinketh this is more ſubtilly then need.</p>

Secondly, Becauſe their ſteps are more eyed and taken notice of then other mens, both by God himſelf and by other men; firſt, the Lord himſelf; his eye runs to and fro, beholding the evil and the good, but ſpecially in his own people, he takes notice of them how they carry it, and he takes notice of the moſt inward ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all part of their hearts; of the frame of their hearts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them look to it, walk circumſpectly in regard of him. Secondly, In regard of men, (1.) There are many out of the malignancy of their hearts, do ſeek ſome advantage againſt the people of God, they watch for your halting, as the Prophet <note place="margin">Ier. 20. 10.</note> ſpeaks, they would have ſomewhat to accuſe the brethren with, to beſpatter Religion with, and therefore like their father the Devil, if they cannot be <gap reason="foreign">

Some of the Saints they are ſcandalized, that is to ſay, there is a ſtumbling block laid in their way whereat they ſtumble, either thereby they are incouraged and imboldened to follow their ſteps, though they ſin againſt the Lord, and ſo they fall: and this is <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 32.</note> ſad, (though a child of God cannot ſure be ſo wicked as to intend the falling of others, or drawing others into ſin) but his example (as <hi>Balam</hi> did) who put a ſtumbling block wittingly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before <hi>Iſrael,</hi> taught the King of <hi>Moab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Secondly, Not only good men, but evil men are indangered to be ſcandalized by it, and to be prejudiced againſt the ways of ſtrictneſs and exact walking with God, becauſe they that profeſs <note place="margin">Col. 4.</note> it, do ſo miſerably miſs it: we ſhould walk wiſely towards them that are without, left we fright them away from Chriſtianity, as the Papiſts by their Idolatry are an offence to the <hi>Iews</hi> to keep them off from coming in to Chriſt, becauſe they are exceeding tenacious now of the ſecond Commandment (God having purged that iniquity from them by a ſeventy years captivity, and much longer ſince) and ſo by their cruelty to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> where they go to convert them, they are an offence to them; and little doth a child of God know, if he fall, as <hi>David</hi> did, how many may ſtumble upon him, and fall head-long into hell, never come to Jeſus Chriſt upon this account.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe we have all of us erring hearts, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we love to wander; and if the Lord have healed that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that now it is wrought out of us, yet we are apt to wander, therefore ſo often compared to ſheep, <hi>I have gone aſtray like a loſt ſheep; O ſeek thy ſervant, &amp;c.

                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:115245:51"/>
Fourthly, becauſe there are ſo many by-paths whereinto they may ſtep awry; truth is one, but falſhood is manifold, there is error on the right hand, and error on the left, and but one ſtraite path before them, therefore it is two to one but they miſs it, and therefore they had need to uſe double diligence, and be preſſed to it, to walk circumſpectly, to ſee they be exact in their ways.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Uſe then; Firſt, it is to ſhew us, that among the <note place="margin">

                  <p>The ſecond Uſe, and that I will a little inſiſt upon, ſhall be a word of Reproof, and that of divers ſorts; and as the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth his rebukes for ſin at his own Houſe, <hi>Judgement begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at the houſe of God;</hi> ſo will I firſt give the alarm to them, a word of Reproof to them: Alas! how far ſhort do the people of God come of this duty? it is intollerable pride in the Papiſts, that ſtand upon their tiptoes, and talk of their works of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errogation, as if they had done more then God had commanded; and it is wretchleſs careleſneſs in us, that we keep not nearer to what he hath commanded; I ſpeak not now of the many errors the moſt vigilant and cloſe walking Chriſtian will, alas, to his grief, find himſelf guilty of, when he maketh a diligent meaſuring of his actions by that rule, but I ſpeak of the careleſneſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti ans walking, wherein doubtleſs they might come up nearer to God, if they did but ſtir up themſelves ever and anon, but we are idle, we are idle, and make many an idle complaint to God that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115245:51"/>
of Chriſtianity, and therefore juſtly are we to be reproved; if men would a little better caſt their occaſions; and husband their time, they need not be in ſuch ſtraits, ſo often to neglect, or ſlubber over their prayers. And for civil things, do you walk circumſpectly as you might, if you made it your work and ſtudy in things lawfull: might not Chriſtians have more regard then they have to the conveniency or inconveniency? I am ſure the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12.</note> Apoſtle had, and therein he followed Chriſt, and therein he is to be our pattern, and ſo what is of good report and praiſe worthy; me thinketh it is ſad when there is no care unto our hearts of theſe things: might not Chriſtians walk at a cloſer ſcantling in point of offence? the Apoſtle would deny his liberty <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 13.</note> in things lawful (and haply we would think neceſſary too) as the eating of fleſh, rather then offend his weak brother; and we many times care not, ſo we may have our wills, how many we offend: and ſo in natural things, eating, drinking, ſleeping. Chriſtians, I doubt we generally too much indulge the fleſh, even to the loading of our minds, and dulling our ſpirits for higher things; how cometh it to paſs Sabbaths are ſpent ſo ſleepily, but becauſe ſome wil not allow themſelves nor theirs competent reſt; the world incroacheth upon God, or elſe they load themſelves with the creatures, ſo that they cannot hold up their heads, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are over-worked, or over-charged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs, doubtleſs, this is reducible to thoſe great evils; well, the Lord reprove us for it, for we are very guilty, we walk very looſely in compariſon of the examples of ſome of the Saints; yea, I do verily think there is many a poor blind Papiſt will riſe up in judgement againſt many of us that are Profeſſors, that have more light then they.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a word of Reproof of another ſort, that inſtead of walking exactly with God, following him fully, their hearts are devided; ſome there are that have the name of Chriſtians, and yet altogether neglect the honeſt and harmleſs converſation among men, and are altogether taken up with ſome ſmall duties of Worſhip and ſhews of Religion; as the Proverb hath it, Angels in the Church, and Devils in the Houſe, Devils in their Callings, ſuch were the Idolatrous <hi>Iews;</hi> the Prophets with one voyce do teſtifie againſt them, for this thy cried, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, are theſe,</hi> &amp;c. but conſidered

                  <p>Again ſecondly, There are others that are all for morality and honeſty of converſation, they give every one their own, they are not injurious, they are no extortioners with the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, they are no drunkards; but for the worſhip of God, they know nothing what it meaneth, to worſhip in Spirit and truth; this is not an exact walking with God, theſe things you ſhould <note place="margin">Luke 18. 11.</note> do, and not leave the other undone, elſe you follow not God fully; indeed there is many a Moraliſt, that is rather an Atheiſt then a Chriſtian; but I will not ſtand upon this: <hi>Pour out thy, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Again thirdly, There are a ſort that neither fear God, not <note place="margin">Ier. 10. 25.</note> reverence man, and yet will not indure but to be called Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; for the worſhip of God, if they come at it in the publike, there are their bodies, but their hearts are gone; they come to ſee, and be ſeen, to mind faces and faſhions, and ſo ſin and trifle away the Ordinances of God; in their houſes nothing but hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs, all their words full of deceit and poyſon, their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents are oaths, it is all the emphaſis and grace they think of; their ſpeech, their lives, what are they but rottenneſs, and fraud, and pride, and over-reaching? they have no regard to right or wrong, good report; or evil report, all actions are alike to them, being paſt feeling, and under a reprobate ſence; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge of good or evil, but call evil good, and good evil.

                     </gap>, to walk uprightly, exactly? Ah ſurely brethren, if it be exactneſs, it is of the devils coyning; when men teach their tongues to ſpeak falſly, as in Shops many do, and make nothing of it, and teach their hands to work deceit and wickedneſs, this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115245:52"/>
is to walk exactly with the devil, to walk as other <hi>Gentiles</hi> do, whoſe hearts the God of this world doth mightily work to their <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 17.</note> own deſtruction: the Lord rebuke this power of ſin where ever it is.</p>
                  <p>Again, It may ſerve to reprove another ſort, and thoſe are they who are ſo far from walking circumſpectly or exactly, <note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 12. Gal. 4 29. Gen. 21 9.</note> that there is nothing more the object of their ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt then this, it is the drunkards ſong, as <hi>David</hi> was; and ſo preciſeneſs and ſtrictneſs of walking is ordinary; the world cannot bear the burning and ſhining converſations of ſome of the Saints; they are ſo cuttingly reproved by them, that with thoſe Heathens, they curſe the Sun, that by its ſhining doth ſcorch them. It is no new thing, the ſeed of the Serpent did alway perſecute the ſeed of the Woman; and he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuteth him that was born after the Spirit; even ſo it is now, ſaith the Apoſtle: and ſo it is now may we ſay: <hi>Iſmael mocked Iſaac,</hi> and is it not ſo ſtill? or if it be not ſo bold a ſin as formerly, it is becauſe the times, not ſinners hearts are changed; they malign them ſtill, watch for their halting; report, ſay they, and we will report it: well, remember this. you that are ſcorners at ſtrictneſs, and circumſpect and exact walking with God, you are ſet down in in the ſcorners chair, the Lord <note place="margin">Ier. 20. 10.

I may not deſcend to particulars: but do not your hearts ſmite you for looſeneſs of ſpirit towards God? hanging back often, neglecting, ſhuffling and cutting with God, putting him off with any thing? and is not this a curſed thing, to do Gods work negligently? to bring a

                     </gap>f Direction, which you may look upon as an Appendix of this Uſe, or elſe as a diſtinct Application of this Point.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Motive, Conſider that the way wherein you walk is all overſpred with ſnares and nets to trap you, and that your ways. (1.) To trap you in ſin. (2.) To trap you for ſin. Firſt. To trap you in ſin; had not the Bird need to he wary and heedfull, and make good uſe of her ſences to diſcover where ſhe may light without danger, when every place is full of Limetwigs? is there an hook under every fair baite, and had not the fiſh need to take heed how ſhe biteth or nibleth, leſt ſhe be taken? this is the caſe, there is a truth, and a great one in it; there is nothing we have to do with, either towards God, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, or towards our ſelves, but there are many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations accompanying it, and particular conditions have their particular temptations; and if we be not very circumſpect and exact, it is a thouſand to one but we miſcarry, we are ſnared and taken, and carried away captive to ſome vain imagination, to ſome high thought, to ſome baſe luſt, and there kept in ſtrong holds, and it may coſt us ſomewhat before we be releaſed again; the world was never more full of ſnares then now brethren; for beſide the ordinary ſnares in our trading, profeſſion, or way of gaining; Lord, how many ſnares are there? it would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite work to trace them through in all our relations. Snares, they are apt to ſteal away our hearts, if lovely and deſirable, or elſe to occaſion much ſin another way, if otherwiſe; in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion never ſo many, never more ſeandall by the falls of eminent Profeſſors, never were there more various pretences to the Truth, more falſe ways, and every one pretending to the Truth, ſo that it is ſomewhat difficult to find a ſolution for that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115245:53"/>
Queſtion, what is Truth? never was the world more full of witche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries then now, more powerful in its enticements then now; it is hard to bear the frowns of it upon the truth, but more hard to avoid the imbraces of it, and the ſmiles upon error and falſhood; if they think it be the way to thrive, to be of this or <note place="margin">Ier. 44. 16.</note> that opinion, men to whom gain is godlineſs, they will rather burn incenſe to the Queen of heaven, and tell the Lord to his face, that his Prophet is a lying Prophet to ſpeak againſt their way of worſhip, which brought them in ſo much; they had their corn, and wine, and oyl then, and therefore they would not be beaten off by a <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi> to the contrary; will the Silver Smiths let <hi>Diana</hi> go upon eaſie terms? and will <note place="margin">Acts 19. 24.</note> not men ſtickle for a way of falſhood, if thereby come in their gain and preferments? and will not all the world follow that way almoſt? had we not need to walk exactly then, to take heed where we tread? beſides, if there were nothing but our own hearts, they are as ſnares and nets to us; how eaſie is it for us to be intangled in the cords of our own ſins, our own pride, and ſelf-confidence, and ſelf-love, doting upon our ſelves, and a world of iniquities, each of them being a ſnare? Oh brethren, if you did walk among pits, and pits covered from your eys, if men did walk upon a bog ready to ſink every ſtep, how would they walk <hi>Suſpenſo gradu?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The neceſſity of it to the end; if we would reach the end of our faith, the ſalvation of our ſouls, it muſt be by an exact walking, it is not a little form of godlineſs without the power, ſpreading it ſelf through your lives will do it, elſe thoſe in the 7. of <hi>Matthew</hi> had had a ſufficient plea for themſelves; elſe the Phariſees had not been much out, when they under a <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 24. Mat. 23. 14.</note> pretence of long Prayers devoured widdows houſes, but they were miſerably miſtaken. Dear friends, be not deceived; let no man deceive you with vain words, and tell you the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is broder then it is; it is a narrow way, and it is up the hill, and if you will come to heaven, you muſt not think that any by-path will bring you to it; that there is any nearer cut then the Lord hath made, <hi>Many ſhall ſeek to enter, and ſhall not be able,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 13. 24.</note> and what if that prove any of our caſes, who never were ſenſible of ſuch a duty, in ſtrict, cloſe, exact, circumſpect walking, how w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ful will our conditions be? men ſeek to enter, but they will
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115245:54"/>
not ſtrive, they will walk hand in hand with the people of God' but they will not walk exactly, they will take a liberty to their ſpirits, though their ſouls periſh by it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly The difficulty of the way ſhould put us upon exactneſs; it is a narrow way: there is a neceſſity, you heard before, if you <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 13.</note> miſs it, you ſink and periſh; but men think it is eaſie to find and keep, but this is ignorance; our Savio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur ſaith it is a ſtraite way, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an afflicted way, or a way cruſhed cloſe together: a man cannot tell almoſt how to miſs the way to hell, he may wink, and walk thither, he needeth no light to his feet; the way of the wicked is as darkneſs, and while they are in that darkneſs, they may be ſure they are in the way to deſtruction; and he that is but a fool &amp; bungler at the ſervice of ſin, is not ingenuous, may make a ſhift to come thither; how eaſily to tumble down the hill? but to recover a mans ſelf, to get up the hill, this is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour indeed. It is narrow, and then it is not ſuch a beaten path, and therefore not ſo eaſie found: ſome track there is, but it is <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 8.</note> not ſo beaten and beautified with the feet of the ſhining Saints, as to be eaſily diſcerned, but it is rather a way in the ayr, and indeed none can ſee it untill he be in it, and therefore there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of exactneſs, circumſpection in walking; if a man have a hard way to find, be upon a great plain, or a waſte howling Wilderneſs, where there is no way beaten, and among enemies, in danger to be deſtroyed, this man had need look well about him, to walk exactly indeed.</p>
                  <p>A third Motive may be becauſe <hi>Iniquity abounds, the love of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>many waxeth cold:</hi> and therefore from hence it is that there are ſo many offences, ſo careleſly given and ſo eaſily taken; if <hi>Peter</hi> and the men of Knowledge have no more love then to walk ſo <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 13. and 14.</note> offenſively, have no more tenderneſs of others, what need had the weak then to walk wiſely, circumſpectly, leſt you be drawn away with the diſſimulation of a <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>Barnabas</hi> was, he looked not ſo well to his ſteps as he ſhould: as on the other hand, if you ſlip and fall, and walk not wiſely, if thy foot ſlip and thou ſtumble, there are few that are ſo ſpiritual and full of love, as with the ſpirit of meekneſs to reſtore thee again; it is too too apparent even in the eminenteſt Saints; they are rather <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> ready to a withdrawing, a caſting off communion, and fellowſhip, and therefore thou hadſt need, who ever thou art, to walk
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115245:54"/>
wiſely and circumſpectly, elſe thou wilt be in danger of giving offence to ſome of the little ones, and woe be to him by whom offences come; or elſe thou maiſt be inſnared and ſtumble upon others miſcarriages and ſo thy ſoul be deſtroyed, or in danger of it, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; will not that man walk warily that <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> hath ſtumbling block upon ſtumbling block, is in a rough way? and if he tread aſide, is in danger to put out a joynt, or break his bones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo it is here.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, How much honour hath God by a circumſpect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation? hereby is my Father glorified, if ye bring forth much fruit, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your father which is in heaven;</hi> hath he <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 8.</note> put ſo much honour upon all the Saints, as to make them one with himſelf through his Son, make them ſons and daughters, Kings and Princes in all lands, heirs apparent to the Crown of glory, and ſhall not we honour him? Oh how ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable a condition is it, when the ways of God are well ſpoken of by reaſon of any of us? and how uncomfortable when they are evil ſpoken of by reaſon of any of our uneven walking? O be tender of the Name of God, and be at ſome pains the more to look to your ways, that he may be lifted up, and exalted by you: O therefore cut off hereby all occaſions from them that ſeek occaſion, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelf, therefore he would abridge himſelf of his liberty ſomewhat; and the Goſpel is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified much by ſuch a circumſpect walking; an Art or Science is then honoured, vvhen a man is perfect and exact in it; ſo is the Goſpel, which teacheth this holy walking; vvhen vve come up to <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 12.</note> it, we honour the Rule vvhereby vve vvalk, that ſhining ſpeaks the beauty of the Rule, that ye may a dorn the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, You may by thismeans draw others to a liking of the vvays of God; the beauty of holineſs, the more viſible it is, the more attractive; vvhat maketh ſinners think ſo vvell of their own condition, and ſo meanly of Religion, vvhen preſt upon them? they ſee nothing more in the Saints then in others they are as careleſs of thir ſteps, make as many balks as others, keep no ſtricter a vvatch over the door of their lips, have no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their tongues then others, there appears no more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, ingenu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty, ſelf-denial then in others, but viſibly as griping, covetous, peeviſh, revengeful as others; this is not the way to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115245:55"/>
vvin any; this is the vvay to drive away the Roes and Harts that are looking towards a vvay of God, but quickly frighted away. What knoweſt thou, O vvoman, but thou maiſt by thy heavenly converſation, ſtrict circumſpect vvalking gain thy husband? and thou husband thy vvife, and parents your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and children your parents, and maſters your ſervants, and ſervants your maſters, and one neighbour may gain another; and vvill not this add to the vveight of your crown? O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 16. 1 Pet. 3. 2.</note> I beſeech you, vvill you reſolve upon it.</p>
                  <p>Now in the next place, a vvord of Direction, vvhat courſe to take; alas, vve are like children, muſt be taught to go, vve know not vvhat foot to ſet forward in this great vvork. I ſhall therefore in the firſt place give you a vvord of direction. Firſt, beg of God to mix this vvord vvith faith in your ſouls, that you may believe it to be ſo great, vveighty, important a duty; labour to get a heart ſenſible of your vvandrings, uneven vvalkings, how far you have been vvide of this narrow vvay, both before and ſince you have vvalked Zion-ward, and ſo to be humbled under them; for you muſt here plough up before you plant; your courſe will hardly hold if you ſet forward with a purpoſe to walk more exactly, except you be ſenſible how great the evil of turning aſide, or looſe walking hath been: well then, begin at the right end, and ſee how you have (it may be) for a long time, <note place="margin">Ier. 14. 10. Pſal. 95.</note> not only wandered from the way, but loved to wander; you have not only erred, but you have erred in heart; you have had the Law of error in your heart, as the Saints have the Law of Chriſt in theirs; and this indeed is the height of Rebellion and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward walking; it is frowardneſs indeed this provoked the Lord to ſhut them out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yea, he, ſwear they ſhould never enter; and if it hath not been ſo with thee, for this very cauſe, O how ſhould this abounding grace which hath made the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, melt thy heart to pieces before the Lord! and that would be a good preparative to a circumſpect walking for the future; the Wormwood and the Gall remembred how evil a thing and bitter it is, that you have ſo departed from the Lord; and the ſtraite path will be a notable help to keep you cloſer to him for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Set your ſelves always as in his preſence, ſo the <note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 8.</note> Pſalmiſt did walk as in his ſight; if ever the Scholler will write
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115245:55"/>
exactly, it is while his Maſter is looking on; or the ſervant work exactly, it is when the Maſters eye is upon him. O if we could but have our eye ever up to the Lord upon all occaſions, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, how circumſpect would it make us? the eye of a <note place="margin">Pſal. 25. 15.</note> holy ſevere man, how would it awe us? we would not entertain ſuch thoughts, ſuch ends as we do, if men were but privy to them; why, now vve forget the Lord; O therefore brethren, be you vvith God, abide with him in your hearts and converſations <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 24.</note> what ever they be; and if we be vvith him, he vvill be vvith us, and this is the vvay to vvalk uprightly, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Thirdly, Let the Word of God dwell richly in you, in all vviſdom and underſtanding; It is not enough to have the <note place="margin">Col. 3. 6.</note> Scripture in your houſes, except you have the Word hid in your hearts, that you might not ſin againſt God; vvithout light a man cannot diſcover the ſtumbling blocks, or the turnings and vvindings of his way, but it is a thouſand to one but he miſſeth it: a man cannot be an exact dealer, if he have not the rules of his art, or trade exactly; men would be ignorant of nothing therein, leſt they ſhould be over-reached and deceived; and yet how contented are we to be ignorant here of much of Gods mind, without which we cannot keep his way, nor walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly. I hope you do, many of you, ſtudy as well as read the Scriptures, and hide it in your hearts, for this end, that you may be filled with a full aſſurance of underſtanding: this is another: how often do we ſtep out of the way and know it not? and how <note place="margin">Col. 2. 2.</note> often do we ſtand pauſing, and loſe much time? when we ſhould walk and work, we are then to enquire, and to learn, and know not which way to turn, to the right hand or the left, and all becauſe we have not our ſences exerciſed, by reaſon of uſe, to <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 14.</note> diſcern between good and evil.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If you would vvalk exactly or circumſpectly, you muſt often apply the Rule to your vvays, to ſee what ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is between them, how they correſpond? it is not a meaſuring at the firſt ſetting out vvill ſerve your turn, you muſt be often meaſuring, as an Architect, he vvill often uſe his Plum-Line

                  <p>Fifthly, In every ſerious undertaking, enquire of God, ſeek his face, in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths; but indeed here is the miſery of it, we will firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve what we will do, and then go and enquire of God, which <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 6.</note> is to mock him to his face. <hi>David</hi> went among the Philiſtians of his own head, without inquiring of God, and what came of it we ſee; he was gotten out of the way, and many a ſna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sixthly, Be ſure we look to our humility, to keep our hearts low before the Lord, for thoſe are they he will teach his way; <note place="margin">Pſal. 25.</note> the more humble a man is, and the lower thoughts he hath of himſelf, the more circumſpect will he be; this humility is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to that confident rage of ſome men; <hi>A prudent man looks well to his goings; but a fool rageth and is confident: This I ſay,</hi> ſaith <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 16.</note> the Apoſtle, <hi>that every one of you think of himſelf not more highly then he ought to think, but to think ſoberly, according as God hath</hi>

                  <p>Seventhly, Take heed of Squint eyed ends, for they will draw aſide the heart, the affections, the feet of the ſoul; if we look not ſtraite before us, but alway looking on one ſide, it is not likely we ſhall make ſtraite ſteps to our feet; therefore ſaith the Wiſe

man, <hi>Let thine eys look ſtrait on; and thine eye-lids look ſtrait before thee;</hi> to the mark of the price, as the Apoſtle aimed at that; look <note place="margin">Prov. 26. 27.</note> ſtrait before you, to the ſtrait rule, it is to walk before you, and this is the way to keep your ſelves right in the way, this is the way, not to turn to the right hand nor to the left; they were <hi>Jehu</hi> his ends which drew himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aſide: afterward, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſet up the ſame Idolatry which he himſelf had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or elſe to continue ſome Idolatry, though he deſtroyed ſome.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Take heed of halting between two, of going to a kind of neutrality, as the Jews were guilty much in this kind; <hi>If God be God, follow him, and if Baal be God, follow him;</hi> little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 21. Heb. 12. 13.</note> were they that vvould reconcile us and the Papiſts together by a commiſſion, for this haltingwill draw us out of the vvay by degrees; make ſtrait ſteps to your feet, leſt that which is lame be driven out of the way and not healed; away then with comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the times and parties, vvhoſe vvays vve judge to be falſe, any further then the Law of Chriſt, the Law of Love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth us to own them, vvalk vvith them.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Forecaſt vvhat temptations and ſnares you may meet vvith in the vvay of God, leſt if you meet vvith more then you <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 20.</note> expected, you be overtaken by them; therefore our Saviour tells the man vvhat he vvas like to truſt to, <hi>The Son of man had not where to lay his head;</hi> you muſt forecaſt to meet with many tribulations in the way to heaven: if you dream of a vvay ſtrewed vvith Violets and Roſes, and find Briers and Thorns, what a ſore diſcouragement vvill this be, and a temptation to forſake the vvay, to turn aſide from following the Lord? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect then that you may be aſſailed by the frowns, yea, and ſmiles of the vvorld, vvhich is more dangerous of the two; that you may loſe friends, relations, the love of all, and be hated of all men, for the name ſake of Chriſt, the more exactly you walk; for the vvorld cannot bear too great a luſtre and glory of holineſs in any; expect this, it vvould be no ſtrange thing to you then, no more then you look for, and then it vvill not be ſo dangerous to thruſt you aſide from following the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Labour to arm your ſelves vvith a ſtrong perſwaſion of the Al-ſufficiency of God, to keep you in, and deliver you <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> from the threatning evils you may meet vvith in your vvays, and

of the Al-ſufficiency of his goodneſs, to be your exceeding great reward, though you have but little with righteouſneſs here in this world; and then brethren, you will hardly be drawn to the right hand, or to the left; what is the reaſon that fear turns many men aſide? and it is very ingenuous to find out <hi>diverticula,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith; and as you ſee in the caſe of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he lyed to ſave his wife; and ſo <hi>David</hi> when he ſpake untruly to <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Prieſt firſt; and then afterward to <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of <hi>Gath,</hi> as you have it in the Story, in the firſt Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> his fear overwhelmed him, he had forgotten his rock, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah: and ſo for God, would men be ſo full of ſelf-ſeeking as they are, if they did believe that God were able to make an abundant recompence to them, though they had little in the world for their ſervice of him? it is a very plain caſe, <hi>Abraham</hi>

                     </gap>if men were of this ſpirit of faith in Gods al-ſufficiency, the ſmiling world would very little prevail to draw any aſide to the thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſide, or opinion, as I doubt it is; well then, labour for this perſwaſion, and you ſhall find it a wonderfnl ſupport to keep us upright in our goings, which is a great part of this circumſpect walking.</p>
                  <p>Alas, But you vvill ſay, this is a difficult duty indeed to walk thus exactly, and as I may ſay in a frame; and if this be ſo, who then can walk the ways of God, if there muſt be this ſtrictneſs? To this I anſwer.</p>

He will give the Spirit to them that ask, and he keepeth the feet of his Saints, and ſuch as have no might he will renew their ſtrength, and they ſhall run and not be weary, and walk <note place="margin">Iſa. 35. 8.</note> and not faint, and the way-faring man (though a fool) ſhall not err therein in this way of God, which is caſt up; you let theſe precious Promiſes lye dead; why do you not improve them, plead them with the Lord? Say then with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>O that my ways were directed to keep thy Statutes:</hi> ſay to him, Lord, thou requireſt a circumſpect, an exact walking before thee; <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 5.</note> there are ſo many ſtumbling blocks and ſnares within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and I am ſo fooliſh and weak, I am ignorant of Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, I cannot order one of my ſteps to avoid them thy promiſe is, the fooliſh ſhall not wander; thy Promiſe is to give ſtrength to them that have no might; I am the poor creature that hath no might, to will is preſent, I would fain walk thus circumſpect, but how to perform it I find not. O ſee if the Lord do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to take you by the arm, and to teach you to go, and to keep you cloſe to himſelf in his ways, and in every reſpect be as good as his word to you, and at the end, himſelf be your exceeding great reward for your ſo walking before him.</p>
                  <p>We have done with the Apoſtles Exhortation to walk wiſely, now we come to the Argument he enforceth it with; <hi>Not as fools, but as wiſe; Sapientia prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I ſhall endeavour to prove this by ſome Scripture, and then ſhew in ſome particulars how it is apparently wiſdom thus to walk, and then make ſome Application of it.</p>
                  <p>For the proof of it, there are many Scriptures which make it appear: walk wiſely toward them which are without, redeeming <note place="margin">Col. 4. 5.</note> the time: where exact and circumſpect walking towards them which are without, leſt we offend them, drive them away from Chriſt, prejudice them againſt the ways of Truth, is called a walking wiſely; there is great need of wiſdom then to all other parts of this circumſpect walking; it is of the like force with that of the Spouſe, <hi>I charge you by the Roes and Harts of the field that you ſtir not my beloved before he pleaſe;</hi> ſtir him not by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 7.</note> importunity, nor by any provocation drive him away, for if you do, this will be offenſive to the Roes, creatures eaſily frighted away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are wild, and but beginning to be tamed; now this is wiſe walking; and that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, The</hi>

                  <p>For the further confirmation of this Doctrine, take theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is wiſdom to propound a right end, to chuſe the chief good for his chief end, is a principal part of wiſdom: the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens profeſſing themſelves wiſe, they became fools; they <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 22.</note> thought they were able by the creatures to run up to the firſt being, and ſo the firſt and chief good; but wofully they were miſtaken. A fool he is that works for no end, as many men do, they bowl away the greateſt part of their lives, without any mark that they aim at that is good; this is the folly which is <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13.</note> bound in all mens hearts; it is wiſdom then to have a mark whereat men aim in all their actions, and to have this mark the chief good, the right end whereto all ſhould he directed, to make him who is the <hi>Alpha</hi> the <hi>Omega;</hi> it is no ſmall peice of wiſdom; The eys of a fool are in the ends of the earth, but <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 24.</note> wiſdom is before him that hath underſtanding; here, and there, and every where, vvhen they ſhould be fixed upon ſome mark or ſtop to which all ſhould be directed, as the Apoſtles vvere, he had his mark in his eye ſtill, and they ſhould let their eys look right on; this is wiſdom indeed. Now this is one, peice of exact walking and a main one too, thus to eye the firſt and chief good, that is to ſay, God himſelf for our laſt end, to propound him to <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 25.</note> our ſelves, as the center of our ſouls, wherein alone we can reſt with ſatisfaction; <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth I deſire in compariſon of thee;</hi> this was a wiſe man <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 25.</note> indeed: this is the firſt: Wiſdom conſiſts in the proviſion of the end.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To provide and make uſe of the right means to this end in general, is another piece of this Wiſdom; the wiſe mans eys are in his head; if a man have never ſo good an end, and yet

                  <p>Fourthly, It is vviſdom for a man to ſuit and ſhape his courſe according to the exigence of his condition: Ye are, ſaith our Saviour, ſent as Sheep among Wolves, therefore be wiſe as Serpents; that is a vviſe Sheep, that being among many Wolves, <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16.</note> ſo carrieth it as to eſcape their mouths and cruelty; the people of God do vvalk among Lyons, their vvay is full of Lyons, roaring Lyons, ſeeking vvhom they may devour.

                  <p>Fifthly, It is Wiſdom for a man to do that in its ſeaſon or time, which if neglected, he will afterwards wiſh had been done; and to omit that, which aftterward, he will wiſh had not been done. It is a great part of Wiſdom, to know the ſeaſon for an action, <hi>For every thing is beautiful in his ſeaſon:</hi> there is not a man that now liveth and heareth <note place="margin">Eccleſ 12. 1.</note> this word, but would when he cometh to die, wiſh he had remembred his Creator in the days of his youth: much ſin had been prevented then, ſome proviſion had been made for his eternal ſtate; do you think the young men that chear themſelves in their own vanities, when they come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſtand before the conſuming fire, ready to burn them up as ſtubble, they will not wiſh, O that they had fled youthful luſts, O that they had lived more by rule then by luſt! but alas, then it is too late: now is it not great Wiſdom, while men have the day, to work and walk? becauſe the night cometh, <note place="margin">Ioh. 9. 4.</note> wherein no man can work: <hi>Stultorum eſt dicere non putaram:</hi> I had never thought that my day was ſo near to an end, as now I find it; now the circumſpect walker he hath the light; and maketh uſe of it while he hath it, becauſe he knoweth he ſhall not alway have the light to work by, nor walk by; <hi>He that gathereth in harveſt is a wiſe ſon;</hi> that is the ſeaſon for gathering; for a man to neglect that time, and let winter <note place="margin">Prov. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> come on, which will ſpoil all his harveſt, and to ſay, I had not thought this year had been ſo far ſpent, is very groſs folly: well, this is another.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It is wiſdom to go through ſtitch with a work, if it be a thing worth the while: what thine hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might, (that is to ſay) not by halves, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly: what folly is it for a man to take ſome pains for an end, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10.</note> and for want of a little more to loſe all? a man draweth the

bow, ſeemeth to take aim, but for want of a little more care and exactneſs, miſſeth the mark and loſeth all: this is the caſe of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, they take much pains for heaven, they ſeem to run as faſt as any, and keep as much ado in the way of God as any, they pray often and much, and hear, and receive, and for want of a little more, they fall ſhort and periſh, becauſe they look not to the frame of their hearts, their uprightneſs before God in it, and diſallow not themſelves in their halting, and therefore they loſe all, and their ſouls, and all, is not this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? who did more then the Phariſees for Heaven, and thoſe in the ſeventh of <hi>Matthew?</hi> But they wanted one thing more, they buſied themſelves about many things, but the one thing more they neglected, and therefore miſcarried; for a man to run, and wreſtle, and ſtrive, and yet to miſs the prize for want of a litle care, to ſtrive lawfully, a little exactneſs and acurateneſs in the manner as well as the matter of their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is folly: alas, how many are there that ſeek to enter, as the fooliſh Virgins, but becauſe they add not a little more, and ſtrive to an agony, therefore they are not able thus to ſeek; this is to loſe all their labour.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Another Argument is this: It is Wiſdom that takes a courſe for the fulleſt enjoyment of the laſt end, the chiefeſt good; there are, it is believed degrees of Glory in Heaven; all the Saints ſhall ſhine, but ſome like Stars, ſome like the Sun, one Star differs from another in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; every one ſhall have a manſion, and unſpeakably <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 41.</note> Glorious, but they are not every one that ſhall ſit on the right hand, and on the left hand of Chriſt in his Kingdom.

Now what wiſe Maſter of a Ship would come into his harbour tattered, and torn, full of leaks, and ready to ſink, if he might come in with the ſails filled, in a gallant manner, which he may do by an acurateneſs of ſtearing a right courſe to avoid the rocks and ſands? who would chuſe to go through a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row wicket, as it were, hard and ſharp, when he might have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115245:62"/>
a wide door opened to him? O brethren, it is wiſdom to make your calling ſure, every man in diſtruſt will tell you ſo, and when you come to die and look death in the face, your ſouls will ſay, that it is wiſdom indeed then to have aſſurance: well, an exact walking with God is that way to procure it: let men ſay what they will of peace and aſſurance, while they walk looſly they muſt give me leave to ſuſpect all that I know, that ſin will undo our peace, if we careleſly fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>

Well, the fooliſhneſs of God (as you count it) is wiſer then men; you think it is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs to ſpend ſo much time in the ſervice of God, leſs ado would ſerve the turn, as the Heathen <hi>Seneca</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, It may be a word of retortion, and ſerve to faſten the folly then upon the wiſdom of the World; Wordlings think the people of God fools for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs, but the Saints know them to be fools; will ye believe when the Lord ſpeaks? do not harden your hearts now, and ſay, thou ſpeakeſt falſly in the name of the Lord.

                  <p>Firſt, It is folly for men to pitch upon a wrong end, to place their happineſs in any thing but the chief good indeed; now this is evident enough, too plain, that men of the world they do place their happineſs in worldly things, they have their god to worſhip as well as the Saints; The luſts of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and pride of life, <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 16.</note> to which the Apoſtle reduceth all that is in the World, their pleaſures, their riches, their honours, theſe are

their ends, to which they drive on all their deſigns, and here they reſt and ſit down, and look no farther many of them; now is not this a groſs miſtake and grievous fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to end ſo low as the earth, and what the would can afford? which will appear, if we conſider, 1. That <note place="margin">Luke 12. 20.</note> none, nor all theſe things will run parallel with the ſouls to eternity; therefore if they could make a man happy as long as he enjoyed them, yet afterward they would then encreaſe his miſery, when they leave him, <hi>fuiſſe faelicem miſerum;</hi> It is periſhing bread, uncertain <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 27.</note> riches, many times they make wings, and are gone, even he himſelf outlives them; a miſerable happineſs that a <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17.</note> poor mortal creature can out-live; if not, yet the ſoul out-lives them; he can carry nothing away with him, ſaith the Text; the poor ſoul muſt appear in its nakedneſs before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As they continue not, ſo while a man can keep them, they cannot, they do not ſatisfie the ſoul; if any man could, <hi>Solomon</hi> might have pickt out an happineſs out of them, when he had ſo much wealth to procure them, ſo much wiſdom to improve them, ſo gave himſelf to find out; but the ſum is, vanity of vanities; not only vain, but vanity; and vanity of vanities, and all is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; the greateſt vanity, they are empty, there is no ſubſtance in them, they will not ſatisfie the ſoul; there is no ſutableneſs between ſuch earthy things and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual being, nor equality between their greateſt vaſtneſs and the largeneſs of a ſoul; they can never fill it, and therefore it can never reſt, but the more a man hath, the more he <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 22.</note> would have ſtill; drinking doth but increaſe their thirſt; and therefore well might the Pſalmiſt bebeaſt and befool himſelf for ſetting ſuch an eſteem upon them.

                  <p>Secondly, If they ſhould, or do propound a right end, yet they miſerably miſcarry in the means towards this end; For, Firſt, There are ſome that are wiſe to do evil: but to do good, they have no knowledge at all; and if men make God and Heaven their end, is this <note place="margin">Ier. 42. 22.</note> the way to it? will the way to the devil, and the way to hell bring a man to Heaven? and yet this is the courſe that moſt men run, as if men would be ſaved by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and were Chriſtians by antiphraſes, becauſe they are moſt unchriſtian; ſurely Brethren, the Spirit of God and the Scriptures every where hath determined ſin to be folly, and calleth ſinners fools, therefore we read of working folly in Iſrael ſo much now; if one part of Wiſdom be to aim at the right end, ſurely Wiſdom agreeth notwith it ſelf, if this be another part of Wiſdom, the Wiſdom to do evil, which indeed is improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called wiſdom; but it is a curſed skill and ingenuity which men have, whereby they are more induſtriouſly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this is ſo far from Wiſdom, that it is the very height of folly.</p>
                  <p>Again, Secondly, It is the Wiſdom of the World to get a name of Chriſtianity, and therewith ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; take the power who will, ſo they have the name, and paſs for Saints; gain is their godlineſs, and when they have gotten the gain by it, the Godlineſs they care not to walk in, but in their pleaſures of ſin; the <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 5.</note> ſhew of Religion is profitable, but not the reality, it is burthenſom; is not this folly with a witneſs? can the Shadow be profitable, and not the Subſtance? the Shell and Husk, and not the Kernel? can that be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, whoſe Praiſe is of men, and not that whoſe praiſe is of God?</p>
                  <p>Again, As the top, and crown, and quinteſcence of their folly; they are wiſer in their own conceit, then ſeveral
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115245:64"/>
men that can render a reaſon, as he ſpaaks of the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; and ſuch are all thoſe that will not be at pains for <note place="margin">Prov. 26. 16.</note> God and for Heaven: if men might devote all the flower of their youth, the ripeneſs of their age and ſtrength to ſin, and when they come to die, have Heaven drop in their mouthes, many would be ſaved; but if they muſt be at ſuch pains for it, walk ſo circumſpectly, ſtrictly, in a frame, by rule thus, and be exerciſed in morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, renewing their repentance, ſo much ado with ſearching and trying their ways, they think the wiſeſt courſe is to ſit ſtill; it is better ſleeping in a whole skin, and ſeven men that can give a reaſon, are not ſo wiſe <note place="margin">Verſe 12.</note> as they; let Miniſters ſay what they will, they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve but they are the wiſer men of the two; O he that is thus wiſe in his own conceit, there is more hope of a fool, then of him; well then, if the world paſs for fools, they are the fools indeed in grain; and when Saints and ſinners, the ſtrict walker with God, and the formal Hypocrite ſhall appear before the Lord at the laſt day; then (if before you will not believe) you ſhall know who were the wiſe men, and who were the fools.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then let Wiſdm be juſtified of her children;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11. 19.</note> you that are the true ſons of Wiſdom, and not baſtards, and pretenders, juſtifie Wiſdom then, though all the world run a contrary courſe, and count it folly to walk thus circumſpectly; do you count it your Wiſdom, as the Lord counteth it, to be ſtrict and exact in your walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; no matter though the world ſtigmatize you for fools, that you neglect your concernments other wayes ſometimes, to gain a nearer approach to Chriſt, if the Lord judge you wiſe men; the argument is very ſtrong: for what man can bear the imputation of folly; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every man would be wiſe, <hi>Vain man would be</hi>

Chriſt, though it may be not all of you, in truth you would be wiſe, though you walk not circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſhall I beſpeak you in the Prophets words, how ſay you, we are wiſe, and we have the Law, &amp;c. when you <note place="margin">Ier. 8. 8.</note> walk not by this rule; Ah take heed you prove not fooliſh Virgins when all is done: it is not Wiſdom to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Religion and with God, he will not be mocked.

                     <hi>David,</hi> but a little folly in a <hi>David,</hi> what a blemiſh it caſts upon it, and what a reproach and blemiſh upon the beautiful way of holineſs?</p>
                  <p>O then, I beſeech you Brethren, Labour to ceaſe from your own Wiſdom: for indeed this is folly, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Wiſdom of God; <hi>He that hearkneth to counſel, is wiſe:</hi> It is a ſad thing when the People of God are not <note place="margin">Prov. 12. 15.</note> adviſable, are ſo full of ſelf-will and ſelf-wiſdom that they cannot ceaſe from it; ſo <hi>David</hi> in numbering the people, he had good counſel given him, though by a man far enough inferiour to himſelf in ſpirituals, but was not adviſable, and what a blot did he bring upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? <note place="margin">2.

Again, Then beg this Spirit of Wiſdom more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, greater meaſure of it, for it is he that giveth Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to walk exactly; this Wiſdom from above, which is pure, and peaceable, and gentle, and eaſie to he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, ſo that a child may lead ſuch a man or woman, if <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 16.</note> he preſent any thing of light and God to them: And then Brethren, when you have the Spirit, walk in the Spirit, in the Power of this Spirit of Wiſdom, let it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over your own wils, and your own opinions of your own ways, ſubject all to him, and you ſhall find that he will guide you by his counſel, and afterwards receive you to Glory.

                        <p>And five of them were wiſe, and five were fooliſh.</p>

This is the general ſcope, which being underſtood, we muſt know that <hi>every particular is not to be ſqueezed too ſore,</hi> leaſt it give blood in ſtead of milk.

                  </p>
                  <p>Herein <hi>is held forth to us</hi> the relation and <hi>mutual deportment</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt to his Church, and his Church to him, both <hi>in this life</hi> which is the <hi>way,</hi> and at death and Judgement which is the end; and therefore that which <hi>concerneth</hi> him, and that which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Church towards him; being even as the warp and wafe of the <hi>parable,</hi> we will conſider them a little apart, and run each of them apart to their end, as far as the Lord enables us, and not confound the conſiderations of them.</p>
                  <p>Only <hi>before I proceed</hi> to that, we muſt know, that the <hi>parable</hi> or <hi>ſimilitude is taken from</hi> the manner of ſolemnizing <hi>Nuptial</hi> rites, which it ſeemeth by ſome very learned to have been thus carried on, that is to ſay, When two perſons were eſpouſed, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And <hi>there is ſomewhat ſeemeth</hi> to favour this of their meeting of him in his return, in that place of <hi>Luke, Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning,</hi> and <note place="margin">Luke 12. 25.</note> ye your ſelves <hi>like unto men that wait for their Lord when he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the wedding;</hi> that when he comes and knocketh, <hi>they may open to him immediately;</hi> there is a Simile of men waiting at night with loins girded and lamps burning, that <hi>when their Lord cometh from</hi> the wedding, to return home, <hi>to bring his Bride</hi> with him, they may be ready to open when he knocks; a little difference there is from this here, The Syr. and the vulgar Lat. <hi>here do add the Spouſe, to the Bride-groom;</hi> that they met her as well as him, and ſome <hi>others have ſo read it,</hi> and of great name alſo; and if ſo, that would more make for this underſtanding of the manner of the marriages among thoſe people, whereto there is a reſpect in this Similitude. <hi>I will not ſpend time about that,</hi> though others do conceive that otherwiſe, they <hi>went to meet the Bridegroom accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the Bride,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.

                  <p>But that <hi>I may the more methodically</hi> open it, (leaving <hi>the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of it to be taken in, in the uſes of ſome of the Doctrines, from the words) I <hi>will begin with that</hi> which is ſpoken of Chriſt himſelf: And then that which is ſpoken of the Church, and as briefly as I can, paraphraſe it as I go, that I may reach ſome point to be handled at this time.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the <hi>Bridegroom Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is ſet forth by that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Verſe 2.</note>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Concerning him, it is ſaid that he tarried;</hi> came not ſo ſoon happily as ordinary. <hi>It is likely that their</hi> marriages were before midnight, uſually the beginning of the night; and to that, there may be a reſpect in this expreſſion, he <hi>ſtayed ſomewhat longer,</hi> for it is ſaid, <hi>the cry was at midnight, v.</hi> 6.

                     <hi>off.</hi> And therefore they affected not them much, except a man could <hi>preach, as if Chriſt</hi> in <hi>flaming fire</hi> to render vengeance, were at their backs, <hi>it affecteth them not</hi> at all: All <hi>things continue with you ſinners</hi> as they were, and where is the <hi>promiſe of his coming?</hi> A <hi>promiſe to the people</hi> of God, a <hi>threatning to ſinners</hi> and hypocrites <note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now ſinners they are bold, <hi>to eat</hi> and drink with the drunken, <hi>until he</hi> come and ſweep the ſecond world away with fire, as the firſt was drowned with water; this is the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>the cry that goeth before his coming,</hi> which <hi>Calv.</hi> ſaith <hi>is metaphorically</hi> put for the ſuddenneſs and unexpectedneſs of his coming, becauſe when any great thing cometh upon a people <hi>at unawares,</hi> they uſe to make <hi>a cry for tumult,</hi> and it may be ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that then being <hi>unready they cry out,</hi> as when people <hi>are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized</hi> by an enemy, they cry out, <hi>O arm; arm, make ready,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meet them; <hi>but thinks</hi> it rather is a <hi>Voice that goeth</hi> before the Bridegroom, which <hi>indeed is a quickning</hi> to them that are his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115245:69"/>
indeed, that were not ready altogether, and it cryeth, make ready, prepare, for he is coming; and <hi>this may be interpreted divers waies.</hi> Whether there <hi>were any ſuch thing</hi> in the rites of their marriages, I know not, but for that it is not much material; the compariſon holds in the main.</p>
                  <p>(Firſt) Then <hi>there is a cry by the Meſſengers</hi> of Chriſt: <hi>they cry, prepare the way of the Lord;</hi> prepare your hearts to <hi>meet the Lord.</hi> We are exhorted, commanded <hi>to cry, and cry aloud,</hi> that <note place="margin">Matth. 3. Iſa. 58. 1.</note> we <hi>may awaken ſinners,</hi> for that is the caſe here, as afterward you will find. Cry with <hi>a Stentors</hi> voice, <hi>ut Stentora vincas,</hi> ſaith <hi>Trap</hi> upon it. Alas all will not raiſe lazy ſinners, we <hi>may cry our hearts out, but who believeth our report?</hi> we tell you, <hi>the Judge ſtands at the door, Chriſt is at hand,</hi> it is not long before you muſt appear before him, and if you be not ready, you are like to be ſhut out; you believe it not.</p>
                  <p>(Secondly) A Cry of <hi>Affliction,</hi> eſpecially that viſitation which is the fore-runner or <hi>harbinger</hi> of death: that cry from the <hi>Rod hath a voice,</hi> and that voice <hi>is Gods voice, he ſpeaks in it,</hi> and it is <hi>not an ordinary voice, but a crying voice;</hi> the word, <hi>it whiſpers,</hi> the loud <hi>crying of the word, is but a whispering,</hi> in compariſon <hi>of the voice of God in</hi> the Rod: it cryeth, hear the Rod and who hath <note place="margin">Mica. 6. 9.</note> appointed it: Mind it, <hi>if a Judgement be upon a City,</hi> (is there any evil in a City, and he hath not wrought it?) it cryeth to the whole City louder then <hi>Jonah</hi> did, repent, repent, for you may periſh and come to the tribunal within leſs then 40. daies, or hours: <hi>So every diſeaſe</hi> in a family cryeth to the family, cryeth to the perſon, prepare, make ready, that we need not ſuch a meſſage as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> brought to <hi>Hezek. the voice of God</hi> in the Rod cryeth, <hi>prepare, make ready,</hi> for he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; here is a blow that the Tabernacle of Clay is ready to tumble, and <hi>then ſoul,</hi> where wilt thou appear, if thou be not ready? Or elſe,</p>
                  <p>(Thirdly,) <hi>by cry, it may be meant,</hi> as <hi>Chryſoſt. Theophyl. Jer. Hilary, Aret.</hi> and others underſtand it, <hi>of the laſt trump of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>arch-Angel,</hi> Ariſe ye dead, and come to Judgement: this will be ſuch a cry Brethren, as will make all the world ring of it indeed; that will pierce to <hi>the bottom of the deep,</hi> to make it give up its dead, <hi>to the bowels of the earth,</hi> to make it give up its dead. Then <hi>ſhall all ariſe,</hi> the <hi>dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.</hi> Well this cry go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115245:70"/>
before, or accompanyeth this coming of the Bride-groom.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Then he cometh.</hi> For the heavens now muſt contain him <hi>until the Conſummation of all things, and then he will come to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the time of the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things.</note> 
                     <hi>judge quick and dead;</hi> he that ſhall come, <hi>will come; though</hi> he ſeem long to the people of God, he that ſhall come will come: then mockers ſhall know where the promiſe of his coming is, <hi>they ſhall know</hi> their Judgement lingers not, nor damnation ſlumbereth not. <hi>He will come</hi> ſoon enough for all, too ſoon for many poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: the Lord grant none of us be found in our ſinful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The time is at midnight:</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> have <hi>a tradition,</hi> that the coming of <hi>Chriſt to Judgement will be at midnight;</hi> and <note place="margin">Verſe 6.</note> hereupon the Primitive Chriſtians, it ſhould ſeem, did uſe to watch all night the <hi>Eve of the Paſſ-over,</hi> expecting his coming, as <hi>Jerom</hi> reports, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> but to be wiſe above what is reaſon, you ſee whether it leads men in the dark, for what is more directly againſt our <hi>Saviour his own</hi> words; Of <hi>that day and hour know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 24. v. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>no man; no not the Angels</hi> in heaven, but my father only. At midnight, with reſpect to the ſolemnity of the marriage, that is to ſay, <hi>later</hi> then uſually, and therefore unexpected, when all was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>nocte intempeſtâ;</hi> when deep ſleep uſeth to ſeize upon men. <hi>The man of the houſe, at midnight his eyes are ſealed</hi> up with ſleep, and <hi>when he leaſt dreameth of the thief,</hi> then he cometh, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizeth him. <hi>So the Lord Jeſus,</hi> like a thief in the night, when <note place="margin">Chap. 24. v. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> men uſually are leaſt aware, moſt uncompoſed, and unfit for his coming for the moſt part.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of his actions in this Parable, will come in under the other part, which is the Church, for you have in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</p>
                  <p>(Firſt) the <hi>ſubject</hi> of this compariſon, the <hi>Kingdom of heaven,</hi> and what that is I ſhall not need here to ſpeak much of, it hath various expreſſions in Scripture; It is not I conceive here taken <hi>for the Kingdom of glory,</hi> for there are no fooliſh Virgins mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Kingdom: No, <hi>nor the Kingdom of grace which is within the Saints,</hi> for the ſame reaſon. Nor yet for the <hi>Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Kingdom,</hi> as ſometimes it is taken; But it is taken here, <hi>for the viſible Church</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, wherein ſome are wiſe, ſome are fooliſh. Some hold out, ſome fall <hi>ſhort of heaven,</hi> and the glory
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115245:70"/>
of God, and ſome are crowned, enduring to the end; and thus much for the opening of that expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>(Second) <hi>thing in general</hi> to be noted, is, <hi>the time:</hi> Then ſhall the Kingdom of heaven be likened, compared or ſhall be like; then, when? even <hi>when the Son of man</hi> ſhall come, Brethren, to <hi>ſolemnize the marriage</hi> with ſuch as he hath here eſpouſed to himſelf; then, when <hi>we come to appear</hi> before him all together, it ſhall moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear to be ſo. But in a ſort, it is ſo in every mans parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judgement <hi>at his death, or diſſolution,</hi> there is a <hi>Specimen</hi> given to the <hi>truth of this parable;</hi> and this appears from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi> of this Chapter with the former; the laſt ver. of the former Chapter he <hi>ſpeaks of cutting in ſunder</hi> that <hi>evil ſervant,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon <hi>the Maſters delay,</hi> ſhould beat his fellow-ſervants, and eat and drink with the drunken; he ſhall cut him in ſunder, <note place="margin">Chap. 24. ver. 51.</note> and give <hi>him his portion with hypocrites;</hi> where is <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth for ever: Then ſhall the Kingdom of heaven be likened to ten Virgins.</hi> And though then the ſpirits of many <hi>juſt men be already made perfect, and many hypocrites already in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chains of darkneſs;</hi> yet becauſe they have been <hi>members of the viſible Church</hi> in a ſort, all ſuch may come under ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, at the great and terrible day <hi>of his appearing,</hi> when the <hi>ſheep ſhall be ſet upon his right hand, and the goates on his left hand,</hi> as you have it in the latter end of this 25. Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Now for <hi>the Church viſible,</hi> compared to ten Virgins: There are two ſorts brethren in a viſible Church, ſuch as are Saints indeed, and do <hi>enjoy the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and have that Kingdom of God, even righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy-Ghoſt within them; and ſuch as are only ſo, <hi>nomine tenus,</hi> they go for ſuch with men, who cannot ſearch the heart, ought not to judge the heart immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but <hi>tenderly,</hi> and alway with the greateſt favour, to judge of men: Now <hi>ſuch is this Kingdom</hi> of heaven here mentioned: And therefore we will conſider what is ſaid of them two waies; caſt it two waies, haply <hi>it may appear the more</hi> clearly and diſtinctly to our underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>(Firſt,) <hi>We will conſider</hi> what in the parable is <hi>common to them both,</hi> to Hypocrites, and Formal Profeſſors, with real Saints, who poſſeſs and enjoy Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>(Secondly) We will conſider <hi>what is peculiar to either</hi> of them, and ſet <hi>contraria juxta ſe,</hi> they wil give light each to other, and this briefly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115245:71"/>
                     <hi>Firſt then for the things wherein they agree,</hi> or which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Saints indeed, with Saints in appearance only, or ſeeming and real Saints. They are <hi>all of them called Virgins,</hi> not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of virginity, as <hi>Jerom</hi> did childiſhly conceive, as <hi>Calvin</hi> noteth. <hi>But to Virgins</hi> they are compared, either only becauſe in the <hi>marriage ſolemnity</hi> the Virgins uſed to go forth to meet the Bridegroom, and bring him to his Chamber; So here they muſt go forth to meet the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Or elſe there is more in it,</hi> and I know not but we may conſider Virgins according to their ſtate and condition here. Now the Church is ſo called, or compared to Virgins, not in reſpect of their glorious <hi>unconquered outward</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as <hi>ſometimes in Scripture,</hi> even ſtrange Nations, yea Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are called Virgins, as <hi>Zidon,</hi> thou <hi>ſhalt no more rejoyce</hi> O thou <note place="margin">Iſa. 23. 12.</note> oppreſſed Virgin daughter of <hi>Zidon,</hi> ariſe paſs over to <hi>Chittim,</hi> there alſo ſhalt thou have no reſt. So <hi>Babel, Come down and ſit in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 47. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>the duſt</hi> O Virgin daughter of <hi>Babylon;</hi> thou that as a Virgin haſt hitherto abode in thy fathers houſe in a glorious beautiful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thy pomp and glory now come down. And ſo <hi>Egypt,</hi> go up to <hi>Gilead</hi> and <hi>take balm</hi> O Virgin daughter of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in vain ſhalt <note place="margin">Jer. 46. 11.</note> thou uſe many medicines, <hi>thou ſhalt not be healed;</hi> (though the Papiſts make this a note of the Church, the glory and outward <hi>ſplendor</hi> of it; that is quite croſs to that of our Saviour, in the world ye ſhall have tribulation, and how often have they been ſcatterd by Perſecution.)</p>
                  <p>Nor <hi>yet are they called Virgins</hi> becauſe of <hi>their priding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſetting</hi> forth themſelves, as Virgins <hi>with their Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor <hi>yet in reſpect of the firſt Conſtitution</hi> of the Church of Chriſt, when they were all, <hi>or moſt of them Virgins.</hi> There were 12. and but one of them a Devil: But I conceive, <hi>It reſpects the condition</hi> of the viſible Church, as then it ſhall be <hi>ſpecially.</hi> And what is that? how are they compared to Virgins? <hi>Specially in theſe two things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(Firſt) Becauſe all <hi>that profeſs the Lord Jeſus</hi> and become vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>, they profeſs <hi>to renounce their Idols;</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle ſaith, that he turned them from Idols to the living God.</hi> Now Idolatry in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 9.</note> is counted you <hi>know, whoredom,</hi> if they have <hi>been married to</hi> the Lord, owning his Covenant; or elſe fornication, nothing more ordinary; it is enough to hint it to you, and therefore when there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115245:71"/>
is a renouncing of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> there the Scripture looks upon them as Virgins; So when <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> had played the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,</hi> that is to ſay, had worſhipped and ſerved Idols, God chargeth their ſpiritual whoredom upon them. But when they <hi>reformed, as Judah did;</hi> you know in many Kings daies <hi>Jehoſhaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 19. 21.</note> &amp;c. And <hi>in the daies when Sennacher.</hi> came up againſt them and blaſphemed them; the <hi>anſwer the Lord gave to Hezek.</hi> by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was this, the <hi>Virgin daughter of Zion hath deſpiſed thee;</hi> now having renounced her Idols, he ſo <hi>calls her,</hi> and having betaken her ſelf to the <hi>ſhaddow</hi> of his wings alone, from thence, from the hole in the rock, <hi>ſhe deſpiſed the Aſſyr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And (ſecondly) <hi>Becauſe alſo, now taking upon them</hi> the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note> of Chriſt, they eſcape <hi>and forego the pollutions of</hi> the world, then groſs ſcandalous ſins <hi>they forſake, even Hypocrites</hi> as well as others, in which reſpects they may be called Virgins, though their hearts be not right with God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>they had all of them Lamps;</hi> they took their <hi>Lamps,</hi> ſaith the text; they have all of them a Profeſſion of Chriſt, they make a ſhew before men. The <hi>Lamps</hi> I cannot take for any thing inward, but <hi>meerly</hi> ſomewhat <hi>outward,</hi> appearing unto men, they <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10. Mat. 5. 16.</note> are Chriſtians <hi>outwardly</hi> all of them: Even thoſe really, believers with the heart they do <hi>confeſs Chriſt</hi> with the mouth to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are not aſhamed to own him before men, and <hi>their light</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim 3. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>of good works and knowledge ſhines before men,</hi> that <hi>the world may ſee it,</hi> there is the light of the <hi>Lamp.</hi> And truly herein hypocrites may go far; they have <hi>a form of godlineſs,</hi> and as glorious a form as any others, and they do as <hi>many good works,</hi> materially good <hi>as others</hi> do; and ſo they have <hi>a light ſhining before men</hi> as well as others. So the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> you know they made as many prayers, did as much <hi>Alms, faſted as often as others,</hi> made a glorious ſhew, here are Lamps.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>their lamps it ſeemeth were burning</hi> all of them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the wiſe Virgins there need be no Queſtion of it. But for the fooliſh, I think it will be gathered from that where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that their <hi>Lamps were gone out, extinguiſhed;</hi> though it is <note place="margin">Verſe 8.</note> true, they were not fed with <hi>a right principle,</hi> and therefore they went out, yet they did burn, they made a ſhew of heat and light alſo before men, as <hi>Jehu</hi> you know did, he ſeemeth to make a greater blaze in his zeal for God, then <hi>Elijah</hi> himſelf did; And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115245:72"/>
ſo for light alſo, knowledge <hi>aboundeth many times</hi> brethren in an hypocrites head, <hi>a clear head,</hi> and a muddie heart, <hi>a ſound head,</hi> as the notion, and a rotten heart may be together; well, this is the third, I haſten.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>They all took them and went forth to meet</hi> the Bride-groom; they all have <hi>their faces Zion-ward,</hi> heaven-ward, to meet Jeſus Chriſt, only the hypocrites they have faces one way, and row another way, as the Mariners do; this I take to be their ſeeming <hi>to make for heaven all of them,</hi> and the one to be as fair for it as the other, for they go as it were hand in hand to <hi>meet the Bridegroom,</hi> yea a hypocrite may go far indeed in <hi>externals,</hi> as far as a child of God, as afterward <hi>we ſhall have occaſion</hi> to ſay; you may have your faces <hi>Zion-wards,</hi> and ſeem to go forth to meet the Lord Jeſus, and yet miſcarry.</p>

                  <p>Seventhly and laſtly, <hi>They trimmed their Lamps.</hi> Some ſay only the wiſe Virgins trimmed their <hi>Lamps,</hi> for the fooliſh had only dead <hi>Lamps, ſuch as gave no light,</hi> ſhining before men, but why then <hi>are they ſaid to be extinguiſhed</hi> or to be gone out?

It ſhould ſeem, Brethren, that <hi>hypocrites may make as fair a ſhew</hi> and deceive themſelves, or being <hi>deceived by their own hearts,</hi> even very long, <hi>to the very laſt,</hi> they <hi>thought now to ariſe with Sampſon,</hi> and ſhake themſelves, when they have been ſleeping upon the lap of their <hi>Dalilah,</hi> but alas their <hi>Lamps were out,</hi> they trimmed them, and ſtirr'd them up to ſee if <hi>they would burn any longer,</hi> but <hi>they were gone out,</hi> or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out as ſome render it. <hi>A ſad thing, Brethren,</hi> for us to <hi>deceive

your ſelves</hi> even to the very laſt caſt until there be no remedy. O what treacherous hearts have we!</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>They agree alſo in the number,</hi> here in <hi>the Parable,</hi> five were wiſe, and five were fooliſh, for this we muſt remember what was <hi>premiſed,</hi> that every particular is not to be <hi>ſqueezed</hi> and preſt too ſore; nor can we conclude from hence an equal number <hi>of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Saints,</hi> or painted hypocrites in the Church, no more then where there are <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. three <hi>evil ſorts of ground,</hi> and but one <note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> good; we can cònclude <hi>that there are three to one</hi> unſound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors <hi>who receive the word,</hi> to one honeſt <hi>and good heart,</hi> which bringeth forth fruit to perfection, there may be more, there may be leſs, our Saviour <hi>in the general tells us,</hi> many are called, but <hi>few</hi>

                     <hi>are choſen;</hi> he might therefore here haply have ſome reſpect to the number of Virgins which <hi>might accompany the Bride; which ſome ſay were five,</hi> becauſe the number conſiſts of the firſt equal, and the <hi>firſt unequal number,</hi> even two and three, becauſe in a marriage, a <hi>ſuperiour and inferiour,</hi> male and female are joyned together, but that is a nicity; <hi>however this we may</hi> take up from it <hi>in the general,</hi> that there are ſome <hi>which are not what they</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ſome are fooliſh, and ſome are wiſe in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>I come to ſpeak ſomewhat</hi> to that which is diſtinguiſhing in the Parable, between formal and real profeſſors of Jeſus Chriſt in this Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>then in the general, the one are fooliſh, and the other are wiſe;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 2.</note> all are not wiſe that are within the Church, there are ſome fools. Why, but is it folly then for any man <hi>to proſeſs Chriſt?</hi> No, it is <hi>not folly ſimply</hi> conſidered in it ſelf, <hi>but a duty</hi> to confeſs him, and hold him out before men; but to <hi>ſtick here is folly,</hi> as we ſhall ſee <hi>more hereafter,</hi> bleſſed be the Lord that there are ſome wiſe, though there be many fooliſh, ſome that will not <hi>be put off with forms</hi> nor ſhadows, but muſt have the <hi>ſubſtance, the bread of life;</hi> and not husks, they will not ſatisfie them. O that we were every one of us ſuch, Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The fooliſh, they took no oyl in their veſſels,</hi> though their Lamps burned, &amp; afterward were <hi>extinguiſhed,</hi> when they ſhould <note place="margin">Verſe 3 and 4.</note> ſtand them in ſtead to enter with the Bridegroom, they had no oyl: <hi>What is meant here by oyl,</hi> and what by <hi>veſſels?</hi> for the firſt ſome ſay one thing, ſome another, ſome as the Papiſts, ſay good works is the oyl which is <hi>the life of faith,</hi> without which it is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115245:73"/>
dead, which is as if a man ſhould call the flame of a Lamp, the oyl that <hi>feeds</hi> it; therefore, Brethren, according to the Scripture expreſſion, elſewhere, by oyl <hi>I underſtand the ſaving grace of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> true juſtifying faith, repentance, <hi>never to be repented of, and love out of a pure heart;</hi> unfeigned faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned <note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 20. And many other places.</note> repentance, unfeigned love, and indeed all the graces of the ſpirit. Theſe are they that <hi>feed the flame</hi> in the <hi>Lamps</hi> of the Saints; whatever <hi>hypocrites have</hi> which maketh a <hi>flame,</hi> and their <hi>Lamps</hi> do burn by it, of which more afterward, becauſe I would not ſtay you too long in the opening of it, this they wanted, they cared not to make ſure of this, to have this true ſaving grace; ſo they <hi>had but as much as</hi> would make a blaze among men, that they might be ſeen to have <hi>Lamps</hi> burning and ſhining as well as others, the reſt they cared not for.</p>
                  <p>(Secondly,) <hi>For the veſſels;</hi> ſome ſay the <hi>Lamps</hi> they had no oyl in them; but me thinks the Text <hi>diſtinguiſheth between the Lamps</hi> and the veſſels, they took no oyl with their <hi>Lamps,</hi> he doth not ſay in them, but with them; and the next verſe, the wiſe took oyl in their veſſels with their <hi>Lamps,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is of a large extent, but it ſignifieth, ſomewhat believed, the Lamp: It is likely they had ſome veſſels they carried about <hi>with them, full of oyl,</hi> that when the <hi>Lamp</hi> needed, they ſupplyed it ſtill, elſe it would go out, ſo here, the veſſel may be <hi>meant the heart,</hi> brethren; a truly <hi>contrite heart, is the veſſel</hi> into which the Lord <hi>pours the oyl</hi> of his grace and ſpirit, and hence there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſupply, <hi>like the oyl</hi> in the Cruſe it fails not. <hi>Now this</hi> the fooliſh they cared not for, <hi>but they had ſomewhat</hi> at preſent that would make their Lamps burn; for <hi>holding</hi> out, they forecaſt not for that, therefore provided no oyl in their veſſels, no true ſound, ſaving, durable grace, in their hearts; the Lord grant, Brethren, <hi>this be not the caſe</hi> and condition, of many a glorious profeſſor among us, our age hath given, as <hi>large</hi> a teſtimony to this truth, as ever time did.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>When the cry came, and they went</hi> to trim their Lamps all of them, <hi>the fooliſh Virgins Lamps were gone out, verſe</hi> 8. The wiſe, their <hi>Lamps had need</hi> of triming, as the <hi>Lamps</hi> of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> were to be trimed every day, <hi>every morning</hi> they gather ſome droſs and filth which would dim the light, but now the <hi>others they were quite gone out,</hi> when they had moſt need of them,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115245:74"/>
they failed them: And indeed, <hi>ſuch a thing is an empty profeſſion,</hi> it will not carry a man through all conditions, as we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak afterward.</p>
                  <p>O how ſad a condition will every hypocrite be in, when he falls under ſuch a diſappointment of his hope, then which to a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature, there cannot be a greater vexation, he thought he was as fair for heaven as another, and yet when all cometh to all, <hi>in the hour of need, the Lamps quite extinguiſhed,</hi> put out in <hi>obſcure</hi> darkneſs, the beginning <hi>of that utter</hi> darkneſs where their portion is like to be for ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The fooliſh Virgins then are</hi> on the <hi>begging hand,</hi> and the wiſe on the <hi>denying hand,</hi> and they ſend them to buy of them that ſell: Here I know not, that we are to preſs every particular; as <hi>if the fooliſh</hi> were ſo fooliſh as to beg grace of the wiſe, to have a part of others, <hi>except the Papiſts,</hi> who will have no other Church of Chriſt but themſelves by no wiſe, and <hi>then that, to go to</hi> their <hi>Merit-mongers</hi> and <hi>Indulgencers,</hi> and the Church-treaſure for righteouſneſs, rather then to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Nor is it any harſhneſs,</hi> if the Saints deny them, for alas brethren, it <hi>is not in them to</hi> give, leſt <hi>they have not enough</hi> for themſelves and them alſo; there is no <hi>ſuper-erogating</hi>

                     <hi>I ſhall give a few Arguments</hi> to conſirm it, and then Apply it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The underſtanding is very dull in many:</hi> though there be ſom it may be more acute, to whom it may be <hi>a dulling</hi> to beat their earsoften with the ſame things; yet for the moſt part, Brethren, we are <hi>dull</hi> of underſtanding, childrens <hi>capacities</hi> we have; you know the <hi>Diſciples</hi> were ſo, our <hi>Saviour</hi> upbraideth them with it, and yet <hi>they were good men,</hi> do you <hi>not yet underſtand;</hi> are ye <hi>alſo yet</hi>

                     <hi>without underſtanding?</hi> And when he was riſen from the dead, he expounded the Scriptures, the Prophets concerning his death and reſurrection; <hi>alas until he opened their underſtanding,</hi> though he had <hi>often told them this,</hi> had preached it to them <hi>again and again,</hi> and even before his death <hi>immediately,</hi> and alas, <hi>yet they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not, until he opened their minds. But you</hi> will ſay, this <hi>was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115245:76"/>
the pouring out of the ſpirit,</hi> there was more need then, but that <note place="margin">Luke 24. 45.</note> unction, that teacheth us all things, was given in ſo large a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, It is true the <hi>ſpirit is given now in a larger meaſure,</hi> and therefore the greater ſhame is the dulneſs of our <hi>capacities</hi> many of us, I ſpeak not of all, Brethren, <hi>neither of them that</hi> are ſtrong men and women in Chriſt, nor yet of ſuch as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural incapacity is a great hindrance to. But were we not many of us, <hi>much wanting</hi> to our ſelves in reading, <hi>meditating</hi> on the word of truth, we might be much more apprehenſive then we are; <hi>we are in a ſtrait</hi> indeed, for ſome are ſo acute, that we can ſcarce touch lightly enough upon things, leaſt they <hi>nauſeate,</hi> others are ſo dull, we <hi>cannot dwell long enough upon them</hi> almoſt, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 1, 2.</note> to make them underſtand ſomething. Well this is the firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe men are exceeding ſlow to believe things. O fools, ſaith our Saviour,</hi> and <hi>ſlow of heart to believe</hi> the things which <note place="margin">Luc. 24. 25.</note> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c.

And this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſtand good againſt the acuteſt hearers, though they <hi>may out-run</hi> the ſpeaker haply in apprehenſion, they may be ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paced enough in believing. Now it is true, it is not all our <hi>incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating</hi> and <hi>preſſing the ſame truths upon men,</hi> that can work their hearts to believe, until the arm of the <hi>Lord be revealed</hi> to them; <note place="margin">Iſa. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Alas</hi> Brethren, <hi>our memories are ſuch leaking veſſels,</hi> we are full of <hi>chinks, hac illac difluxerimus,</hi> and therefore <hi>as from thence</hi> the Apoſtle infers, we ſhould <hi>give the more diligent</hi> heed to the things which are ſpoken, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>us are even high-way ſeed hearers!</hi> The word is gone from us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are out of theſe doors, or <hi>the moſt part of it.</hi> So the fowls of the Aire, the evil ſpirits, they ſteal away the word from us; ſo that we had as much need to hear it again, as when we came.

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is requiſite becauſe our</hi> affections are ſo <hi>dull;</hi> they <hi>had need to be often quickned,</hi> therefore <hi>whet the word upon your, children:</hi> It is not one whet, that will edge a dull knife, but over and over with it <hi>again and again,</hi> as many times in Scripture a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of a thing</hi> (in prayer, in preaching) ſpeaks the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him that delivereth it, ſo it ſtirs the affections of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4. ſaith the Apoſtle, rejoyce in the <hi>Lord alway, and</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>again</hi> I ſay rejoyce, is that a <hi>tautology,</hi> or a vain repetition? no, ſure the <hi>Apoſtle was not guilty</hi> in that kind, but <hi>it was needful,</hi> to ſtir the affection to the duty; our <hi>hearts</hi> indeed are <hi>like ſo many dead Seas,</hi> and it is not a little breath once upon us, that will move, but when the wind <hi>paſſeth often, and ſtrongly</hi> over us, then it may affect us haply; the word is therefore <hi>compared to the words of the wiſe, which are like goads, not the words of fools,</hi> who are no ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ſenſleſs, and know not what belongs to the Art of ſpeaking rightly, <hi>but the words of the wiſe are like goads,</hi> ſharp, and they are to be often uſed, <hi>we are like oxen in duty,</hi> creatures that will often need <hi>to be pricked up,</hi> therefore the metaphor is uſed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 11.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I put you in remembrance</hi> of the <hi>things you knew before, and were eſtabliſhed in, even to ſtir you up;</hi> there is <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 13.</note> need of quickening the affections; a man may deliver the ſame truth haply more ſtirringly, one time then another, and the ſpirit
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115245:77"/>
may breath in it, one time more then in another, and then the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ſtirrd indeed to purpoſe; that is a fourth: <hi>Gutta cavat lapidem non vi ſed ſaepe cadendo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>becauſe of the unconſtancy of our hearts,</hi> if we be a little affected with a truth at one time, <hi>how long doth ſuch a frame</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue upon us? <hi>David was ſenſible how fleeting</hi> the frame of our hearts are: And therefore though himſelf, and his people, were in <hi>as ſweet a frame</hi> as any we read of almoſt, when they <hi>offered with a perfect heart,</hi> willingly, and ſo willingly, as that <hi>David re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in it,</hi> and bleſſed the Lord <hi>for it, that they had hearts ſo to do;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 18. Ver. 9. and 17.</note> this was a precious frame indeed, yea <hi>David</hi> rejoyced at the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs of others, <hi>not envied at it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the Lord would keep this frame</hi> for ever, Keep this upon the <hi>imagination, or figments</hi> of their hearts <hi>for ever.</hi> Alas if he keep it not, it is gone preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>now upon Eagles wings</hi> ſoring, by and by, with our bellies <hi>cleaving to the earth, Pſal.</hi> 119. 24. thy teſtimonies are my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and 25. <hi>v.</hi> my belly cleaveth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the duſt. And therefore, <hi>the words of the wiſe, they are as goads</hi> and nails, nails to take hold, <hi>and faſten things together,</hi> that <hi>they may abide,</hi> and if they <hi>be driven to the head,</hi> yet how quickly may it be <hi>looſened again,</hi> is there not need of the ſame hammer to faſten it again, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, though you be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth already,</hi> yet <hi>I Judge</hi> it meet to <hi>ſtir you up,</hi> by <hi>putting you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 13.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>becauſe we are ſo ſlow to do what</hi> we know, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the main thing, we do <hi>but build Caſtles in the Aire,</hi> Brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, if we hear and do not, and yet who is clear in this point? yea how often <hi>may we</hi> hear a practical truth, preſt upon us, before we practiſe it? yea when <hi>we are convinced</hi> to do it, and <hi>reſolved we will,</hi> and yet with the <hi>Son in the Goſpel,</hi> I go Sir, but he went not; now this <hi>is the Learning indeed,</hi> a man hath never learned a leſſon <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>in Muſick,</hi> or learned a Copie, until he hath practiſed it, and can do it. Ah dear friend, do not <hi>our hearts bluſh ſometimes,</hi> when we conſider how often we have <hi>had this watchfulneſs</hi> preſſed upon us, and yet how little have we done to bring our hearts to it? And ſo <hi>for weanedneſs</hi> from the world, for <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> for any other duty almoſt; and therefore it is requiſite, Brethren, that the ſame things, ſhould be <hi>repeated and inculcated;</hi> but ſo much for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  <p>Another Caution <hi>ſhall be this, to take heed of that humour which reigns in abundance</hi> among us all, <hi>affecting novelties.

                     <hi>Apoſtles Doctrine even to the Romans</hi> themſelves, he <hi>brought no new Goſpel</hi> but what was from the beginning.

                  <p>And laſtly, <hi>brethren, it is neceſſary that the ſame things</hi> be thus <hi>inculcated</hi> upon us, then ſurely we may hence learn, that there is <hi>ſomewhat more for us</hi> to learn ſtill in every truth <hi>we hear, it may</hi> be often we have heard <hi>ſuch a duty</hi> preſſed, ſuch a ſin <hi>deſcried,</hi> there <hi>is ſomewhat in it,</hi> that God meeteth thee, it may be everywhere with the ſame <hi>meſſage,</hi> they <hi>ſpoke with one mouth</hi> the ſame thing to thee; Is there not cauſe to fear?

                     <hi>doubtleſs</hi> it is, to ſuch a one as this, when death is even preſent to her, before her face, is ready to be turned off the Ladder, and now, an offer cometh, O if you will but <hi>Marry the Prince you ſhall be ſaved, though before ſhe refuſed,</hi> and the Argument had not ſuch force in it, becauſe the thing was at a diſtance, yet now <hi>you would think</hi> her deſperate indeed, that ſhould refuſe it.

For this brethren remember, It is not the back-ſlidings of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that can undo the match made between him and them, did <hi>not Iſrael go a whoring after other Gods, and is not that the breach of the Marriage-Covenant,</hi> he ſpeaks there of that Church, <hi>a man will not receive his wife again,</hi> likely in ſuch a caſe, <hi>yet return again to me, ſaith the Lord, and I will receive you.</hi> If that the Lord had not foreſeen <hi>thoſe back-ſlidings in his people, it had been ſomewhat, if Chriſt had not fully ſatisfyed the father for them</hi> as well as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins, it had been ſomething, if upon this <hi>account, there were not forgiveneſs,</hi> laid up in ſtore enough with God for theſe things it were ſomwhat indeed.

                  <p>
                     <hi>But if any will think</hi> or ſay this is <hi>not a ſure bottom</hi> to build ſuch a truth, or point upon: <hi>becauſe the virgins,</hi> here are not conſidered as virgins; <hi>but as perſons</hi> accompanying the Bride, going forth to meet the Bridegroom: I ſhall firſt ſay,</p>
                  <p>That as they are not onely <hi>conſidered as virgins,</hi> ſo neither is the conſideration of their virginity to be waved, for as in the <hi>ſimilitude uſually,</hi> they were thoſe virgins which did <hi>accompany the Bride,</hi> ſo I ſuppoſe in the <hi>Apodoſis</hi> now of the compariſon, we are to look for ſomewhat which may anſwer that virginity, <hi>And you finde it</hi> in Scripture to be anſwered by thoſe things I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that is to ſay, <hi>their forſaking Idolatry,</hi> turning to the true God, and their renouncing their former prophane converſation.

                  <p>For in the <hi>ſecond place beſides that they are called Virgins, or compared to virgins,</hi> they are alſo ſaid to take <hi>their Lamps,</hi> and ſurely if we muſt expound what is meant by the <hi>Lamps:</hi> we <hi>can underſtand and nothing</hi> leſs by it then a viſibility of <hi>Saintſhip.</hi> But if this <hi>will not carry it neither,</hi> methinketh the</p>

There are many <note place="margin">Iſa. 35. 8. Izek. 44. 9.</note> Scriptures will ſpeak fully to the proof of this. Some prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies there are, as that in the <hi>Prophet Iſaiah;</hi> there he ſpeaks <hi>of a high-way</hi> ſhal be caſt up, and <hi>the unclean ſhal not paſs over it; Again none uncircumciſed in heart or fleſh ſhall enter into his Sanctuary;</hi>

this applyed, not only to the times of their returning from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> but to the Goſpel-times; What can it ſpeak leſs then this Brethren? that <hi>no viſible,</hi> unclean creature, ſhall ever enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of Chriſt?

is all one to him, or if he have the means, and uſe them not, or not aright, and ſo in any other thing whatſoever, I briefly wrapt up the other two in this place. <hi>Now</hi> to this great end the enjoyment of God, the means what are they but more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt by faith in his blood, for he is not received but in Jeſus Chriſt, nor to be enjoyed but in him and through him, Now ſince we have loſt the image and glory of God, it would not prove good to us to enjoy him, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us ſo to do, that is to ſay it would not be ſuitable to us as we are corrupted, heaven would be hell to a wicked man, if he could enter into that holy place a while. And therefore there <note place="margin">Eph. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12.</note> is a neceſſity, that we cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt that in him we may be brought near, being reconciled through the blood of his croſs and the enmity ſlain that is in our hearts againſt God, and a new nature put upon us, the heart changed and made conformable to <note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note> God, that image, and likeneſs reſtored, which conſiſted in knowledge, righteouſneſs and true holineſs, that now to enjoy God in the fulneſs and holineſs and joy, it is ſuitable to this new man wrought in us by Jeſus Chriſt; ſuitable to that ſpiritual <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 24.</note> Chriſt which is founded in us, and ſo is good to us, therefore this is the great means, I ſay the cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and reconciliation and holineſs, that heaven may be ſuitable unto us, that we may alſo by him be changed, and made fit, and able to bear the weight of glory which is there to be put upon us. More mediately and remotely: now the means of grace, the Goſpel and ordinances thereof, wherein God is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt, therein he is revealed for righteouſneſs for holineſs, he is preached therein in the Covenant, and that ſealed up to us in the other ordinances, And all the means of grace are helpful for this end. Well, now before I go any further, Let us ſee the wiſdom and folly of a pretender, and a real Saint, that is a virgin <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> indeed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then for the end, though miſerable man would be happy, yet we miſs it in the end, and if we miſs the end, all our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are nothing: <hi>Now a child of God,</hi> his end is God, as he is <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 25.</note> a glorious God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as he is a good God, and here is wiſdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that is to ſay, he aimeth at this, to glorine God, to exalt him, that he may be glorified in him, as well knowing, that the glory of the Lord is that wherein his own good, and ſalvation is

Alas, they ſeek a poor empty ſelf, they would have a name, they would have their zeal for God ſeen, they would have their ends ſatisfied, it is the way to flouriſh. What pains did they take to follow Jeſus Chriſt up and down, and all was for the loaves? a poor end. Suppoſe the end be a little ſtopping the mouth of a clamarous conſcience for the preſent, a poor end. Is not this folly, to ſhoot ſo high and aim ſo low? But happily it will not be ſo eaſie to convince hypocrites that they miſs it in the end, though for my part I think it is that which we ordinarily miſs it in; <note place="margin">Ezek 7. 5.

pains to come to the journeys end, but alas it never will bring him thither, he is out of the way, Jeſus Chriſt is the way, as wel as the life, now there are falſe Chriſts which men make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; there is much bad like to good, and much error like to truth, one man he thinketh a drunken Chriſt will ſerve his turn; a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man, he thinketh Chriſt and his ſecret luſts will ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though his profeſſion and open ſinning will not ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he thinketh he may have Chriſt in his heart and ſin regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, though he cannot have holineſs in his profeſſion an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it, an open prophaneſs there, as if ſin would bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agree with Chriſt, then his profeſſion. Some think they have a Chriſt made up all of pardons, no matter for holineſs at all, let them live as they liſt, no matter for walking in him, yet he is ſo merciful, if they can but cry have mercy it will do the deed, though they wallow in their uncleanneſs all their lives, ſome they are on the other hand, that make to themſelves a holy Chriſt, not minding his pardoning mercy, O if they can but do this and that, they walk uprightly with men, they ſerve God, none more conſtant at the ordinances then they, private and publike, and therefore ſurely Chriſt is theirs; <hi>not remembring with</hi> Nehemiah, <hi>the Lord ſpare me according to thy great mercy,</hi> or multitude of mercy, even when he had done ſo eminently for God.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>He that foreſeeth not an evil</hi> coming upon him, is not ſo wiſe as he ſhould be, <hi>the prudent man foreſeeth the evil, and hideth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> this providence is a great part of prudence, for a man to ſee <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 3.</note> a miſt no further then under his feet, like the beaſt, is a great folly, a wiſe man hath his eye in his head; do you think that man that <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 24.</note> buildeth his houſe upon the ſand, did foreſee the ſhowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a houſe they muſt have, ſomewhat to ſhade them from the weather; but here is the folly, to build upon ſuch a foundation, not foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is like to befall it, <hi>O that my people were wiſe, that they</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. It is folly, rather to run a hazard of a greater evil that is future though certain, then to undergo a much leſs evil, though preſent: as for inſtance a man would rather venture his life una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably, then he would take ſuch a bitter potion; the <hi>young</hi> man in the Goſpel that went far, he would notwithſtanding venture his ſoul, rather then his eſtate? and is not this the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of many formal Profeſſors? Alas brethren! if a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or perſecution for Chriſts ſake come, and the way of Chriſt be a diſgraced way, they count the riches of <hi>Egypt,</hi> greater treaſure, then their ſouls and heaven, and therefore ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all upon it: O this is folly!</p>

of Chriſt to <hi>ſlumber, and ſleep all of them, both wiſe and fooliſh.</hi> Some have underſtood it of <hi>the ſleep of death, that they al dyed, good</hi> as well as <hi>bad,</hi> but this cannot be ſo, for it is not true, underſtand the coming of Chriſt which way you will, If for his coming to the univerſal judgement; it is not true, for all ſhall not ſleep, but ſome <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 51<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If we underſtand it of his particular coming, to ſummon us to appear before him: It is leſs true, for when the ſummons cometh, it is before we dye. Death indeed is his Meſſenger, or Serjeant; and therefore they are not dead, before he cometh to fetch them, beſides it is not ſo uſual to ſet forth death by a double expreſſion, of ſlumbring and ſleeping, but rather ſleeping onely. Beſides this ſlumbring, and <note place="margin">Mark 13. 35, 36.</note> ſleeping here, is noted as a failing in the wiſe virgins as well as the fooliſh, if I underſtand it aright, for it is the privation of that <hi>watchfulneſs,</hi> which is injoyned, and wherewithall is wound up in the cloſe, and by this parable he ſheweth us the ſad inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of <hi>ſleeping and ſlumbring,</hi> and the incidency of it to us; and therefore exhorts us to watch. Now ſure, to dye is not any fault, when we are called to it, but an appointment of God for us to dye, to ſubmit to which, to be willing to which is a grace, and not a ſin. Again, in this parable there ſeemeth to be ſome time for the getting of oyl, or at leaſt for them to uſe ſome endeavours to get it though it be in vain, which may be indeeed after a ſummons to death, there may be ſome little time which a hypocrite may think to improve to get grace, though it proſper not, but after death, there remaineth nothing but judgement. The particular firſt, and afterward the general.</p>

                        <hi>The time</hi> of their <hi>ſleeping</hi> is conſiderable indeed, and that is it ſeemeth to be <hi>juſt a little before their Lord cometh,</hi> the L.

Or whether we make that coming of Chriſt, and the end of the world all one; It ſhould ſeem this is to be referred to the anſwer, to the <hi>third, the end of the world, as it was in the days of Noah, they were eating and drinking,</hi> and never minded, were careleſs, and aſleep, until the world was in a <hi>flood</hi> about them; <hi>note here, in the end they ſhall be aſleep, alike ſecure and drowſie,</hi> and as little look for the end of the world until all be on a flame about their ears. And Satans letting looſe after <note place="margin">Rev. 20. 7.</note> the thouſand years being impriſoned, ſeemeth to ſpeak ſad work he will make among men, immediately before the laſt end. Or if we underſtand it diſtributively of each Saint, as ſometimes in the ſame Scripture the H.

I ſay it is alike conſiderable, and may give us ground of a note of obſervation by and by. It is true indeed ſome underſtand that in the beginning <hi>they went forth to meet the Bridegroom,</hi> by a Prolepſis, or Anticipation, as if they did not go forth at all to meet him <hi>until after the cry was made,</hi> but I cannot ſee the reaſon of it. They would have it, <hi>that Chriſtians are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to be ſleepy</hi> in the beginnings of their faith, and work of faith which indeed may be ſo: but methinks that doth not ſo well ſuit with the time of firſt-love, which the Scripture often mentioneth, men are uſually moſt forward then, and moſt watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wakeful then. Nor do I know any inconvenience but <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 4.</note> they might ſleep in the way in their journey going forth to meet the Bridegroom; and methinks the tarrying of the Bridegroom being interpoſed between their ſetting forth towards him, and their ſleep doth plainly argue it, if we may argue from theſe things, but they will argue as much for the one way as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that I would rather take it thus.</p>

they were as a garden incloſed; therefore the beſt conſidered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of others, and yet you find how often our Saviour endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſtir them up to watchfulneſs; <hi>What I ſay to you, I ſay to all; watch, watch and pray.</hi> And how much in theſe chapters, ſurely it argues they were lyable to ſleep, they were prone to it, elſe that leſſon would not have rung ſo much in their ears. Or would <hi>David</hi> have come over ſo often with that, <hi>quicken me O Lord according to thy word, quicken me according to thy word;</hi> but that he found himſelf going, <hi>napping</hi> and <hi>nodding.</hi> But if we will <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 25, 37. &amp; 40.</note> go to the <hi>Chriſtian of Chriſtians, the flower in the garden incloſed,</hi> there were three Diſciples that were favourites, it ſeemeth that the Lord Jeſus took with him as witneſſes of his <hi>transfiguration</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now to his paſſion and Agony; yet notwithſtanding, theſe <hi>favourites,</hi> when they ſhould watch with Chriſt, <hi>they fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,</hi> their ſouls were aſleep in a great part; and therefore their <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 40.</note> bodies alſo were aſleep. However our Saviour ſaith, the ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak; the ſpirit is in part weak, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing; elſe if perfect, it would have kept them awake, there is a willingneſs, and unwillingneſs; and for an act the unwillingneſs <note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 18.</note> may prevail againſt the willingneſs, as in this caſe: <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be <hi>carryed whether he would not, and yet ſure he would;</hi> there his willingneſs prevailed: but I will not ſtand any longer, onely note you here brethren: one thing farther is this; that they fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep the ſecond time, and the third time after they had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for it again and again, and that ſharply that they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay; <hi>they knew not what to ſay,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, and yet they fell to it again; if theſe were ſo apt to fall aſleep, ſure then much more ſuch poor weaklings as we are in compariſon of them.</p>

                     <p>Not to ſpeak of <hi>that vindicative hand of God</hi> upon ſome, when in vindicative juſtice <hi>he ſendeth upon men a ſpirit of ſlumber, and of ſleep;</hi> for I hardly think that is competent to the Saints, though <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 8.</note> to hypocrites, it may; yet thoſe are not they, I am mainly to ſpeak to in this diſcourſe, but of other cauſes, And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A cauſe of it may be this, <hi>ſloathfulneſs</hi> it caſts men into a deep ſleep: It is ſo in naturals, and it is ſo in ſpirituals; <hi>a ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

upon his bed, Labour and pains taking, it diſpels the vapours, ſcatters them, and ſo they clear up, ſo it is here: a <hi>ſloathful ſpirit</hi> is the immediate forerunner of <hi>this ſleep;</hi> therefore the Apoſtle exhorts them, <hi>not ſloathful in buſineſs, fervent in ſpirit, ſerving</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord.</hi> And you ſhall finde brethren, when he that had one talent given him, he improved it not; the Lord calls him a <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> and <hi>ſloathful ſervant:</hi> Alas, his ſoul was aſleep, and his talent laid toſleep in a Napkin; well this is one cauſe, if we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities in our hands to do good, and we do it not, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 26, 30</note> exhorts us to do; we are <hi>ſloathful.</hi> A man that is <hi>idle,</hi> ſhall have very much ado to <hi>keep himſelf from ſleeping;</hi> a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Iudg. 4. 21.</note> brethren, if we be not all aſleep, we have ſo many opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to do good, ſuch talents put into-our hands, <hi>ſome of us, moſt of us,</hi> and yet do ſo little with them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Another cauſe of ſleeping may be wearyneſs,</hi> you know <hi>the ſleep of the labouring man is ſweet;</hi> ſo you ſee <hi>Siſera,</hi> after he <note place="margin">2.

                     <p>Thirdly, Another <hi>Cauſe</hi> may be <hi>the falſe queſtions which men make, the miſtaking of things, a man miſtaking the day for the night;</hi> he ſlumbers it may be, and thinketh it is night; or the day is not at hand he ſleepeth; this is clear I think in the preſent caſe; <hi>What made the virgins thus to give ſleep to their eys, and ſlumber to their eye-lids?</hi> they thought their Lord would not come yet, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed his coming, and likely they thought he would do ſo ſtill; and therefore thought they might ſleep, or elſe atleaſt they might think, while he delayed his coming, it was no great matter whether they ſlept or waked, it would be of little availment to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115245:140"/>
them; and therefore they even laid them down formally to ſleep; <hi>O how eaſily are we lulled aſleep with ſuch miſtakes as theſe!</hi> now how <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> falſe was this in the mean time, for there is much to be done while he tarryes, <hi>to wayt for him;</hi> to have our <hi>lights burning,</hi> our <hi>lamps trimmed,</hi> our <hi>ornaments ready,</hi> to wait for him until he come; for we ſhall be paid for our wayting, as well as for our our working, <note place="margin">Luke 12. 35, 36, 37.</note> and then we ſhould be ready to open to him whenever he comes: this another.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Another cauſe or occaſion at leaſt of this ſleeping, what is it but a letting down our fear and care; if we ſerved the L. continually with a holy trembling as the Pſalmiſt cals upon us, we ſhould hardly ſleep, a man that hath a trembling heart, ſleep paſſeth from his eys; or a man that hath his head f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Jonah his ſin</hi> was very great, <hi>running away from God to Tarſhiſh, when he ſent him to Niniveh,</hi> and who more ſleepy then he in the veſſel? <hi>up, why ſleepeſt thou, thou ſleeper,</hi> ſaid they; alas the poor Mariners lookt upon themſelves as loſt men, he feared nothing, he was aſleep, <hi>Conſcience aſleep, Soul aſleep, Fear aſleep,</hi> he was benummed with that great blow he had given his ſoul, he was more ſleepy, and heavy then natural men themſelves; their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences were ſooner awaked by the hand of God then his was, a fearful condition.

                     <p>But not onely ſo, <hi>But let us all take notice of, and be humbled for our great proneneſs to ſlumber, and ſleep. Water the root</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: If we be awake, and have not lately been overtaken, yet remember <hi>we have the root within us,</hi> water that with our tears, be humbled before the Lord for it, yea labour we to walk continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humble before the Lord for the ſight and ſenſe of it; it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how apt we are to fall aſleep, if we conſider that whatever our condition is, we are apt to it. <hi>For a proſperous ſtate,</hi> this is like a rocking, and ſinging to the ſoul; how quickly did the Church fall aſleep in <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his days, in his lap, and the child in the mothers lap, <hi>Outward proſperity,</hi> inward proſperity.

                        <hi>Iob, I ſaid I ſhould dye in my neſt;</hi> what not onely when he had an outward flouriſhing condition, but when he had ſuch a ſtrength of grace, as to inable him to do much for God, to walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, to be fruitful in good works, <hi>then, I ſhall dye in my neſt, I ſhall multiply my days as the ſand,</hi> he was even going then: O this is matter of humbling indeed brethren, that when we ſhould be putting forth the fruits of his love unto our ſouls, we ſhould drop aſleep!</p>
                     <p>But then a man would think this is more natural now, to fall aſleep in the Sun ſhine, and in the midſt of the ſweet refreſhings of the ſpirit of God, <hi>as muſick and delightful things,</hi> which do <hi>mulcere,</hi> they do perſwade ſleep, if we have not ſomewhat to keep awake.

Yet methinks this ſhould ſo much the more have quickned their ſpirits; But alas brethren, we are even ſo prone to ſleep, that if the ſpirit of the Lord do not watch with us continually to keep us awake, we ſhall ſleep, if it be on the top of a Maſt: <hi>Little dream men!</hi> And this is the caſe of us all, as you ſee in <hi>Ionas;</hi> O that this were much upon us, that God would humble us for this, the very inclination of our hearts to ſlumber, and ſleep, and lazineſs, whereby he is robbed of his glory, and our ſouls much of our comfort, and the profit we might gain, as will afterward appear.</p>
                     <p>A little further to amplifie this Uſe: Surely brethren, <hi>It is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great mourning to look upon the ſad effects of mens ſleeping among us,</hi> look without us, look within us, look into the <hi>Church,</hi> look into our <hi>Families,</hi> look into our own <hi>hearts,</hi> and do you not finde brethren, that generally there hath been a ſleeping, O <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 30.</note> the Lord reprove us for it, and ſhame us out of it, as he did his own Diſciples!

                        <hi>Firſt, Then remember this: Sinners at the beſt, and Hypocrites at the beſt, their hearts are aſleep,</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> at the worſt, <hi>their hearts are awake;</hi> indeed in naturals we uſe to ſay, when a perſon is ready to drop <hi>aſleep,</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>aſleep</hi> already, but it is not ſo in Spirituals with the people of God: <hi>Judas</hi> when he was at the beſt that ever he was, before he diſcovered his covetouſneſs in the buſineſs of the poor, he was unſound at the <hi>heart,</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> was dead, indeed it is a <hi>dead ſleep</hi> that is upon their <hi>hearts;</hi> and <hi>yet</hi> he walkt up and down, as men in a deep <hi>ſleep</hi> ſometimes will do in a ſtrange manner, but his <hi>heart</hi> was <hi>aſleep;</hi> Now <hi>Peter</hi> he he fell aſleep too in the matter of his denial of Chriſt, but his <hi>heart</hi> was awake: though the <hi>ſenſes</hi> were cloſed up for a time, yet when the <hi>Son of righteouſneſs</hi> broke forth upon him, lookt upon him, you ſee he preſently waked; <hi>ſo</hi> the <hi>Church, I ſleep, but my heart wakes;</hi> in the deepeſt <hi>ſleep</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> is <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 2.</note> awake, there are divers apprehenſions of this; Some underſtand it thus, <hi>I ſleep, but my heart wakes,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is as the <hi>heart</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>ſeal of life, and vital ſpirits, he wakes,</hi> or elſe taking the <hi>Church Collectively, ſhe ſleepeth,</hi> but the <hi>heart waketh,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>ſhe</hi> may miſcarry in ſome leſſer matters as <hi>External,</hi> but in the <hi>main,</hi> the <hi>fundamentals,</hi> the <hi>heart of religion,</hi> in <hi>that</hi> ſhe never fals altogether. But we ſhall ſpeak to it as it reſpects par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons as wel as the general, as doubtleſs it doth: <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh: the Church was Lazy, and drouſie, ſlumbred and ſlept,</hi> but <hi>yet</hi> not ſo: but that the <hi>heart</hi> was awake, it was not a dead <hi>ſleep,</hi> and this will appear if we conſider two or three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Church then hath a Conſcience not altogether paſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in fome meaſure awakened: and then 2.

but alas hath not power to <hi>obey:</hi> for <hi>ſleep</hi> hath ſo overcome them, ſecurity hath ſo ſeized upon them, that though they hear, yet they do not, as me thinks in that very buſineſs of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhai,</hi> which I have thought ſtrange of, when his <hi>Conſcience</hi> was awake, he would hear the <hi>voice</hi> of the Lord: in <hi>Micah,</hi> he <note place="margin">1 King. 22. 29.</note> thought all the reſt of the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> were falſe, he would have the Word of the Lord from the mouth of a true Prophet; a man would have thought now he ſhould have done it preſently, being an upright hearted man alſo, no: yet if you read the text, you ſhall find he went with <hi>Ahab</hi> notwiſtanding: <hi>here</hi> he had a <hi>Conſcience awake</hi> plainly, but yet he did not obey: he was ſo far engaged now to <hi>Ahab,</hi> not only in affinity, but his word was out, and his honour at ſtake: and though Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience likely might <hi>check</hi> him for the thing, as well as put him on to enquire of a true Prophet, <hi>yet</hi> thoſe Luſts now, <hi>love</hi> to his own honour, and carnal intereſt, and affection laid him <hi>aſleep,</hi> he went up notwithſtanding, well this is the caſe in this place. <hi>Can</hi> we not many of us ſet our <hi>ſeals</hi> to this truth? how often in a fit of ſecurity have we had Convictions and Checks? we have heard the voice of Chriſt: <hi>open to me my love,</hi> let my word have roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſcience</hi> is ſo awake uſually in the people of God, as to <hi>tell them they are aſleep,</hi> they have ſomewhat ſecretly whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the <hi>ears,</hi> that they are not in the <hi>right way,</hi> they are ſlothful or ſluggiſh. <hi>David</hi> I think was in a deep <hi>a ſleep,</hi> as any that we read of, yet I can hardly think but <hi>David</hi> had this within him ſome grudgings and miſgivings, that all was not well with him at that time: But becauſe happily this may be common to <hi>them with Hopocrites</hi> except they be very faſt <hi>aſleep,</hi> indeed, therefore I will rather inſiſt upon the third.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Yet</hi> 2. I will not ſay, but the <hi>Will</hi> of a Child of God may be in fault ſometimes in part too, and how great a part is hard to ſay: as the <hi>Church</hi> ſhe lies <hi>ſleeping</hi> upon her bed, it appears <hi>her Will</hi> was too blame: for ſhe did as <hi>as I may ſay,</hi> ſet her ſelf to <hi>ſleep</hi> compoſed her ſelf, as men uſe to do that would <hi>ſleep, lye down, put off their cloaths, ſeparate themſelves from thoughts</hi> which might diſturb them, <hi>wink with the eyes,</hi> they would <hi>ſleep:</hi> ſo the <hi>Church</hi> here had put off her Clothes, and <hi>waſhed</hi> her <hi>feet, that</hi> was a cuſtom in the <hi>hot Countries.</hi> before they went to reſt, and lay upon the bed: Now by this it appears that ſhe was <hi>willing to ſleep: yea,</hi> when the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> called upon her to <hi>ariſe,</hi> ſee how many frivolous excuſes ſhe had, as if ſhe could not put on her Clothes again, and could not defile her <hi>feet</hi> again, as if it would be a defilement to her to come to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Some think it is meant of ſome declining from the doctrine of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115245:146"/>
by Chriſt only, <hi>She had waſhed her ſelf,</hi> and now to come to Chriſt only, would be a defiling of her. But happily it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodated to the ſimilitude: A Boy when he is Ioth to riſe, how many excuſes will he have; he wants this, and that, and twenty things; ſo very ingenious are we, when the will ſetteth the underſtanding a work indeed, to find out excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: <hi>ſo</hi> the <hi>People</hi> of God how loth they are to come to it, through the hypocriſy of the heart: when God had rouſed <hi>David,</hi> he had a <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.</note> mind to ſleep ſtill, he was loth to come to confeſs his ſin: but God would not let him alone, prickt him up, until he was ſo ſore galled and wounded, he cryeth out <hi>in the diſquietneſs of his ſoul,</hi> and yet would not up: I ſay the Children of God may be <hi>faulty in his will</hi> in a great part, <hi>yet</hi> afterward uſually it coſts them heart ſmart for it; as it did the <hi>Spouſe</hi> here, of which afterward. Now an Hypocrite his will is fully engaged uſually, though he may have ſome <hi>Convictions</hi> of Conſcience, <hi>yet</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> is to ſin: <hi>Yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleep,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> he ſtriveth not againſt it, but yieldeth up to <hi>ſleep,</hi> and is againſt them who would awake him out of it, rather then againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ſleeping. And though a Child of God, that is but in part willing to ſleep, may at preſent not take it ſo well, until he be throughly awaked, of a man that ſhould rouſe him up, yet afterward he will count ſuch a man his greateſt friend: well then, <hi>here</hi> is the firſt thing, <hi>Hypocrites at the beſt their hearts are aſleep;</hi> as the Saints are not, but at the <hi>beſt</hi> they are <hi>lively,</hi> their <hi>Wills</hi> are-<hi>ſtirring:</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> at the <hi>worſt,</hi> their <hi>hearts</hi> are <hi>awake</hi> more or leſs, though the <hi>Hypocrites hearts</hi> be <hi>aſleep</hi> So then, the <hi>Hypocrites ſleep</hi> when he ſleepeth, is a through ſleep, <hi>ſenſes, and heart,</hi> and all, inward and outward and all: the <hi>Saints,</hi> their ſleep is but outward, they have ſomewhat alive within, <hi>the ſeed of God abideth within them,</hi> which keepeth them from ſuch a deadly ſleep. <hi>Hypocrites</hi> can ſleep no further then <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 9.</note> they were awaked before, and that they do uſually altogether: now their hearts were never awaked throughly: but the Child of God doth not ſleep ſo far as he was awaked, that is to ſay, all that was awaked doth not fall aſleep again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Difference may be this; <hi>The one ſleepeth not, until he hath gotten the main work in ſome meaſure made ſure,</hi> gotten <hi>oyl</hi> in the <hi>veſſel:</hi> the <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> would not ſleep until
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115245:147"/>
they had <hi>oyl</hi> in their <hi>veſſels;</hi> then happily they might think, though they ſhould nap a little, they had that <hi>Cruſe</hi> of <hi>oyl</hi> which would not fail, their <hi>Lamps</hi> would not go out in obſcure darkneſs, which yet was dangerous preſumption. But now the <hi>fooliſh Virgin</hi> ſleepeth, and ſoundly too, though ſhe had no <hi>oyl</hi> at all in the veſſel: <hi>Ah dear friends!</hi> that is a ſad ſign, when a man can fall faſt <hi>aſleep,</hi> and knoweth not but that he is in the hands of his enemy, and before he awakes, a ſword may be in his bowels; when men can give ſleep to their eyes, and <hi>ſlumber</hi> to their eye-lids, I mean, be as deep in ſecurity, and lazy, and liſtleſs as any, though they have no <hi>Chriſt in them the hope of glory, but in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity,</hi> this is a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Now a Child of God happily may at the beginnings of <note place="margin">Acts 2. 16.</note> grace <hi>nap</hi> and <hi>nod,</hi> and happily ſometimes fall <hi>aſleep,</hi> I will not ſay it cannot be ſo, but I think ordinarily it is not ſo: for you have it in the Scripture all along, when once thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and the <hi>Jaylor</hi> were awaked, and ſaw where they were, even in their blood, did they ſleep again, until they had ſome aſſurance of their Conditions? <hi>No:</hi> O they run up and down as men in a trembling frame, <hi>O what ſhall we do? what ſhall we do? is there no hope for us? no healing by this Jeſus whom we wounded? no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by this Jeſus whom we have made away?</hi> and uſually, truly Brethren; I do think that as it is with <hi>ſin,</hi> the <hi>weaker</hi> it is when it ſtruggles for life, (as it is with all other things) and hath little life in it, is ready to dye, it ſtriveth and ſtrugleth ſo ſtrongly as if it were nothing but life, <hi>morſus morientium:</hi> ſo when life is little and weak, it is ſo earneſt for the increaſe of it ſelf, and ſtrengthening it ſelf, that it appears to be all life, and none more vigilant and lively uſually then <hi>young Chriſtians;</hi> their life is little and <hi>young,</hi> and therefore as <hi>young</hi> Children, they would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be alway at the breaſt. So it is here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> another difference may be this, <hi>that though both their ſleeping may be alike diſhonourable to Chriſt among men who take notice of it, yet the one is not ſo dangerous as the other:</hi> this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth upon the former, which may indeed rather ſerve as to prick, to ſtir and rouſe up men then, as a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>to judge of our ſleeping.</hi> The Hypocrite maketh as glorious a profeſſion as the <hi>Saint,</hi> ſeemeth to be as active, and ſtirring, and vigilant as any, as who ſeemed more awake then <hi>Judas</hi> when he pleadeth for the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115245:147"/>
poor, <hi>yet</hi> alas, God knew the bottom of the buſineſs: but I ſay, <hi>they making</hi> ſuch a profeſſion now when they fall aſleep, it is as much to the diſhonour of God, as if a real Saint do fall <hi>aſleep,</hi> as now for inſtance, ſuppoſe two, <hi>one wiſe, one fooliſh,</hi> they fall into ſome <hi>giddy opinion</hi> of the times, O <hi>let him that thinketh he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth take heed leſt he fall!</hi> or elſe both grow worldly, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, griping, or vain, indeed caſt off the ways of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the great Apoſtacy of our times. Now I ſay, this is alike diſhonourable to God: but it is not alike <hi>dangerous,</hi> for the one he ſleepeth, and his ſleep proveth the <hi>ſleep of death,</hi> as the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> did; for though they were rouſed with the <hi>Cry,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was a waked it may be, <hi>yet</hi> their <hi>hearts</hi> were never rouſed up out of their ſleep; they were <hi>dead-hearted</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſo they remained: <hi>they never did ariſe from the dead, that Chriſt might give them life:</hi> the one when he waketh, hath <note place="margin">Ep heſ. 5. 14.</note> neither <hi>oyl</hi> nor <hi>Lamp,</hi> neither <hi>reality</hi> nor <hi>profeſſion,</hi> the other hath both; though the <hi>Lamp</hi> want triming, there is not that <hi>lively expreſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their <hi>Converſations</hi> as ſhould be, and therefore the <hi>light</hi> needeth <hi>ſnuffing; the</hi> one hath the root under ground: but the other neither root, nor branches: ſo that you ſee there is a difference between the ſleeping of the Child of God, and the ſon of Satan, the <hi>wiſe,</hi> and the <hi>fooliſh Virgins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of the Doctrine may be this; If ſo be the <note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> people of God may thus ſleep; <hi>Then</hi> brethren, It may be a <hi>warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> word to us all, to <hi>take heed</hi> of it, to avoid it, if it fall upon us, I mean the people of God, it will prove bitterneſs in the latter end. Do you believe this, that you are lyable as well as others to ſleep? that you have the ſeed within, you have thoſe Luſts, ſuch foul hearts, which with their ſteam, are in danger to benight you every morning, every day: do you believe this? and do you believe it is a part of folly, the folly of the <hi>wiſe Virgins,</hi> to ſleep? what need more to be ſaid to you concerning theſe things? will not you avoid that which you judge evil?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But becauſe we have to do with poor ſleepy Creatures, whoſe ſouls it may be are roady to drop aſleep, even when they are hearing this,</hi> let me a little ſot it on, the Lord make the impreſſion by his own ſpirit, and bore your ears, &amp; ſeal inſtruction to all our hearts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Then conſider brethren,</hi> that <hi>if once we fall aſleep, we loſe our

diſcerning between good and evil</hi> in a great meaſure: the Saints that are of experience; <hi>they have their fenſes exerciſed to diſcern between</hi>

                        <hi>good and evil:</hi> you may happily wake in your ſleep, but your eyes are ſhut, brethren, and it is a wonder of mercy, if you do not daſh your ſelves to pieces upon this rock of offence, or that rock of offence, this ſtone of ſtumbling, &amp;c. as men in their ſleep ſometimes will get up, and climb indeed to the top of the houſe, and are they not in great danger of breaking their necks? would you not pitty ſuch a man? O ſuch is the Condition of a Child of God that hath a ſleepy ſoul, a ſoul in a deep ſleep: <hi>thou wilt be ready to judge evil good; and good evil: Jonah</hi> his ſoul was <note place="margin">Ionah 49.</note> aſleep, that ſin of his laid him aſleep, though a good man: and do you not know how ſadly he miſſed it? <hi>I do well to be angry, yea even to the death:</hi> what could <hi>Gain</hi> almoſt have ſaid worſe then he did, in this fit? A man in a ſleep cannot diſcern light from darkneſs, neither of taſts, nor ſmels, all is one to him; when once <hi>Peter</hi> was aſleep, he could deny and forſwear the Lord-Jeſus: <hi>David</hi> in a ſleep he cannot diſcern between the chance of war<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and down-right murther; between ſhewing kindneſs to his faithful ſervant, one of his worthies in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and making his Neighbour drunk, a ſad Condition! <hi>Aſa</hi> in ſuch a time when he was aſleep, as appears clearly a little before, his <note place="margin">2 Chron. 16. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>ſaith</hi> was lively, and he could relie upon God for the ruin of the <hi>Ethiopians, Lybians,</hi> yet now he relies upon <hi>Benhadad,</hi> King of <hi>Syria;</hi> to help-him againſt the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even <hi>Baſha</hi> he was aſleep ſure, that forſakes God to relie upon an enemy, and takes ſuch an evil Courſe to wiſh him to break his Covenant. <hi>Then</hi> the Lord ſent <hi>Hanani,</hi> the Prophet telling him plainly he had done very fooliſhly, he would not bear it; he would not be rouſed out of his ſleep, brought to repentance: Claps the Prophet in Priſon, oppreſſeth the people: O what will a man ſtick at, brethren, when he cannot diſcern between good and evil: where the ſenſes are cloſed? what will not a blind man run upon, and yet a good man alſo? and this leads to a ſecond.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When a man is once aſleep, alas brethren, <hi>the paſſages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween head and heart, they are obſtructed, that nothing almoſt that he heareth will awake him.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> when he was aſleep, you ſee how ſadly he carryed it; he went to the Ordinances queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the houſe of God from time to time, or likely he did ſo,

and yet he lay in that condition for all that, alas the word of God ſunk not with him at all; you know you may call upon a ſleepy perſon that is faſt, many times, again and again, and and he anſwers not: or if it move him a little, or ſtir him, alas he underſtands it not, he heareth a ſound which troubles him, but he underſtands it not, and ſo returneth to his reſt again, this is the very caſe of a poor ſoul aſleep: you hear indeed, but as if you heard not; as a man that hath his mind taken up with another thing, he heareth, but he heedeth not: ſo a poor ſoul aſleep goeth from Ordinance to Ordinance, from Sermon to to Sermon, and heareth: but the word ſticks in the ear, it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the heart ordinarily, and is not this ſad, brethren?

                        <hi>We are apt to ſleep, when we had moſt need to be awake.</hi> This is raiſed from the <hi>circumſtance of time,</hi> or the ſeaſon, if I may call an unſeaſonable time a ſeaſon; <hi>when they-ſlept,</hi> it was juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cry came, which ſummoned them to meet the Bride-groom coming, and wakened them at once. The Propoſition is univerſal you ſee, the ſubject is univerſal, and ſo is the predicate: for the ſubject, the Saints, the real Saints are apt to ſleep, the Text it ſelf proveth it beyond contradiction; for it is ſpoken of the wiſe virgins, which is comprehenſive of all the Church of Chriſt, except the fooliſh; <hi>the fooliſh they ſlept,</hi> and no marvel, but all the queſtion would be of the <hi>wiſe,</hi> ſpecially at ſuch a time as this: but the Parable plainly holds it out, <hi>they all ſlumbred and ſlept,</hi> and if they did it actually, ſure there was an aptitude, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it; I know none can plead exemption, except they can be of the Church of Chriſt; and yet not come under the notion of fooliſh or wiſe Virgins. But the difficulty, and indeed all that will be worth the time to prove, will be the univerſality of the Predicate, they are apt to ſleep, when they had moſt need to wake; that is to ſay, whenſoever they had more need to awake, then at another time, then they are apt to ſleep. This I know not how to prove better, then by an Induction of particulars, here is one in the Text, and there is the like aptitude found of their ſleeping at all other times of need; therefore we conclude it ſo general, that they are apt to ſleep, when they had moſt need to awake.</p>
                     <p>For this time in the Text, I think hardly any will queſtion it: for men to be ſleeping when they ſhould be making ready, and ſtand ready for the appearing of their Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Is to be ſleeping when they have greateſt need to be awake: the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind indeed will be ready to ſing a <hi>requiem</hi> to it ſelf, and ſay it is no matter, ſo we have but a warning a little before he come, that we may have time to trim our Lamps before he come, though we be found ſleeping; but ſurely brethren the ſpiritual part will judge otherwiſe, that there is great need to be waking at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the race, when they ſhould lay hold on eternal life; <hi>Now</hi>

And truly brethren, ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth us, ſome of us I believe, that in the ſpecial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of grace wherein Jeſus Chriſt is held out Crucifyed, held out in his lovelineſs and glory; there our hearts are moſt apt to he aſleep and drowſie, and much ado, to keep them up to any thing.

At the Dedication of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and of the <hi>Temple,</hi> the glory of God <hi>filled them,</hi> and I cannot believe, but there was a wonderful, glorious preſence at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of this Ordinance, if I may call it ſo; <hi>well</hi> then, after ſuch <hi>diſcoveries</hi> of Chriſt, brethren ſuch warnings, to lie down and <hi>ſleep,</hi> how dangerous is it to <hi>catch</hi> cold after ſuch a heat? how will it grieve the Lord to ſee ſo much grace laid out in vain upon us in a great part, if we be ſleeping ſo quickly again? And it appears, that <hi>Peter</hi> he had his <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> much heigthned, but here was the miſtake he reſted too much upon it, upon what he had received: O ſaith, he, <hi>though all men forſake thee, I will not deny thee,</hi> &amp;c! <hi>Yet</hi> alas you ſee, when he ſhould have prayed with Chriſt, and ſo the reſt, there in his agony in the <hi>Garden,</hi> he fals aſleep <hi>again,</hi> and <hi>again,</hi> and <hi>again:</hi> ſo dead aſleep, nothing would keep him waking. O how prone are the beſt of men to ſleep, when we had moſt need to wake! after the richeſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Chriſt, when we had moſt need to be moſt lively, to improve the grace we have received, to return <hi>love</hi> for <hi>love,</hi> even then, we fall aſleep, the Diſciples, as eminent as any, did it, ſure then, they were apt to it; And if <hi>they, then,</hi> ſurely then any of the <hi>Saints</hi> are apt to it now.</p>

                           </gap> what this cry was; Behold the Bridegroom cometh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of it in the ſecond place, it was <hi>at midnight. A Cry</hi> was made at his firſt coming, there was a <hi>forerunner,</hi> and that was <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and he was <hi>the voice of one crying in the wilderneſs,</hi> an earneſt, <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 3.</note> zealous, loud ſpeaking, <hi>prepare ye the way of the Lord.</hi> And now at his laſt coming there is a like preparation of his way, <hi>there was a Cry made. Calvin</hi> thinketh the Cry here is put metaphorically for the ſuddeneſs of his coming, or that it may be underſtood ſo, becauſe when any great thing cometh upon a people ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they make a ſtir, a tumult, it diſcompoſeth them. Or as Children, or Scholars, that are all out of their places, and at their ſport, their Father or Maſter cometh upon them ſuddenly; O what a ſtir there is, an out-cry, <hi>the Maſter is coming, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is coming!</hi> Or when an <hi>Enemy</hi> ſurprizeth a place, <hi>cometh</hi> ſuddenly, <hi>beateth up their Quarters,</hi> there is a <hi>Cry; O horſe, horſe, arm, arm,</hi> they are here upon us. But I know not what <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> thus to underſtand it of the ſuddenneſs of his coming, the <hi>Effect</hi> being put for the <hi>Cauſe;</hi> becauſe before the <hi>ſuddenneſs</hi> of his coming is ſet forth in the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> plainly, as hereafter ſhall appear; <hi>he came at midnight.</hi> I rather therefore take this for a <hi>Cry</hi> by ſome <hi>meſſenger of</hi> God, as a <hi>fore-runner of his Sons appearing,</hi> or <hi>coming to his people,</hi> either to take them to the marriage, or ſhut them out of the marriage for ever.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> briefly will be this; <hi>The fore-runner of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                     <p>That <hi>this</hi> is ſo, <hi>the Text it ſelf</hi> is ſo expreſs, I think it not very needful to prove it further by Scripture, but ſhew you that it is his courſe in all his comings to ſend ſome meſſenger before him to prepare his way, to make way for his coming; his coming to particular <hi>Judgments,</hi> as with the old world, he ſent his <hi>harbinger Noah,</hi> a Preacher of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and every blow of the <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> upon the <hi>Ark</hi> was a Cry, and might have been as a <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 5.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>For the coming of Chriſt,</hi> which is the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Cry,</hi> as you heard before, <hi>either it is his coming at laſt to judge the</hi> world, to gather the Saints together, and carry them into the Marriage as one <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> topreſent them to his father, the purchaſe of his deareſt blood which we muſt ſurely underſtand here to be principally meant. And 2. The coming of Chriſt to a particular <hi>ſoul,</hi> or people to gather them <hi>either to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, the aſſembly of the firſt-born, the general aſſembly,</hi> or elſe to

Before the <hi>fooliſh</hi> Virgins might be counted <hi>wiſe,</hi> it may by many as well as the <hi>wiſe, yea</hi> happily the only wiſe, and the <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> the <hi>fooliſh;</hi> but now he cometh to make a difference, and lay it open to the view of all, which are which.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>For the Cry:</hi> It is to be noted, that the <hi>force</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> imports a <hi>ſtrong</hi> voice, ſuch a voice happily as would <hi>Stentora vincere,</hi> there is a <hi>ſtill</hi> voice, and a <hi>loud</hi> voice; a <hi>Cry</hi> is, when the voice is lifted up, when the throat is extended, as I may ſay, when perſons are hard of hearing, <hi>Iſa. 58. 1.

                        <hi>made.</hi> So then, <hi>this</hi> is no ordinary voice or warning, but a <hi>loud Cry,</hi> a <hi>ſhrill</hi> ſound, that is to be the <hi>fore-runner of Chriſt</hi> his coming.</p>
                     <p>But then, <hi>What this Cry is,</hi> that is here ſpoken of, will be the ſubject of a further enquiry? <hi>Why?</hi> ſurely brethren, we muſt underſtand it according, or ſuitable to our expoſition of the <hi>coming</hi> in this place.</p>
                     <p>If we take his <hi>coming</hi> here, to be <hi>his general coming to judge the world, then</hi> the <hi>Cry</hi> may be one of theſe two, and both of them are fore-runners, though the one is more immediate then the other.</p>

                     <p>If we take it here brethren, <hi>of his particular coming</hi> to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſouls, to gather them to himſelf in part before that day; which I know not that it can be excluded from being a part of his meaning, then the voice, the cry, is otherwiſe to be underſtood.</p>
                     <p>1. Then, It may be meant of the warning words which the Lord giveth his people by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel every
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115245:166"/>
where in his Churches: ſpecially indeed brethren, this hath been the voyce of all the Meſſengers of Chriſt ever ſince his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that he will come, and come quickly, his laſt and general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> will be quickly, but his coming to us particularly will be—quickly. Now the importunity of them that call upon us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, to prepare for the coming of Chriſt to our ſouls by death, when we are like to receive our doom for our everlaſting ſtate, <hi>this may be meant, cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voyce.</hi> Or elſe, <note place="margin">Iſa. 58. 1.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Happily ſome Afflictions,</hi> God opens the mouth of ſome rod, ſome heavy viſitation, <hi>the rod cryeth, as it is in that place of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mic. 6. 9.</note> whether it be the affliction, the ſickneſs, or ſtroke whereby the Lord takes men away, this cryeth to men, repent: O prepare to meet the Lord Jeſus, he is coming, he is now even at the door; therefore go forth now to meet him, as <hi>Hilarian</hi> chid his ſoul out, <hi>egredere O anima, egredere.</hi> Sometimes the Lord ſendeth a long and a loud cry, a grievous, and heavy viſitation upon many of us, yea upon his own dear children, as I have known ſome, the Cry hath been, <hi>he is coming, go forth to meet him, make ready;</hi> Or if it be a ſtroke that he removeth again, before we go hence, and we recover ſtrength again: yet the Cry of it is, <hi>Behold he cometh, go forth to meet him,</hi> for we know not whether death be not in the cup of affliction we drink at any time.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Then for the relative conſideration of the Cry, with reſpect to his coming, whereof it is a warning: It is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether it be ſo immediate, yea or no, as there can be no time of preparation after it, which ſeemeth not to ſuit with the parable here. It ſeemeth by the parable, if I may inſiſt ſo much upon theſe particulars, 1. That there was ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the cry and his coming, as there is ſome time between the Harbinger, and the coming of his Lord, whoſe way he prepareth; becauſe the Virgins here ſeem to have ſome time to trim their Lamps, even the wiſe virgins; and for the fooliſh, it ſhould ſeem by the parable they had ſome time to trifle away, in buying, or going to aſſay it; but this I will not preſs, or urge too much, onely ſure it is, that the wiſe virgins being found aſleep, after the warning, had time, and a heart given them to prepare to trim them. And therefore, If we underſtand it of them which ſhall be found alive at the laſt day, remember this: Some it may be will not be ſo aſleep, and yet need ſome preparation too. Some may
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115245:167"/>
be aſleep, and therefore will need ſome preparation. Now it is ſaid, that at the voice of Chriſt then coming with his Trumpet, <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>thoſe that are alive, ſhall not prevent them that are aſleep,</hi> go to heaven before them, <hi>But the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt,</hi> and what time there will be for it, or whether in a moment, I am not able to determine: Or whether they ſhall in a moment be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſoul and body, that are alive, and ſo made ready to enter with him into glory? Or whether there ſhall be time for the working of it, I cannot ſay, but if their Lamps want trimming, their graces want furbiſhing, they ſhall have it. But if by the cry then you underſtand the Goſpel preached, then they may have time enough. 2. If there be time between the cry, and his coming, to take his own to himſelf, it ſeemeth not to be much; but how much, or how little we cannot ſay: If the cry be the ſickneſs, or meſſenger of death which is ſent to them; there is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſome time, and not very much given, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs. And ſo were the word importunately preſt, an awakening word, to rouze the poor ſecure people of God, there may be more or leſs time between this cry, and Chriſt his taking them to himſelf, but ſome time it ſeems there is for their trimming of their Lamps. But ſo much for Explication.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Arguments now, wherefore there is ſuch a cry before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great reaſon is clear here in the Text; <hi>It is becauſe men are aſleep, many of them,</hi> both <hi>real Saints</hi> and <hi>formaliſts,</hi> they are <note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> aſleep, and deep aſleep; and therefore there cometh a cry to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake them, it is not an ordinary voyce will do it, but a Cry. <hi>Some Boanerges, a ſon of thunder;</hi> to raiſe poor ſleepy ſinners, that he may not take them in a ſleep. Let not men think, though now they have a ſtil voyce of the word, and they can make a ſhift to ſleep notwithſtanding, they are Sermon-proof. If this will not awaken, he vvill have another cry that ſhall avvaken them, <hi>he will roar upon them out of heaven, thunder upon them,</hi> but he vvill vvaken them. While men are aſleep, they are not fit to meet the Lord Jeſus in his coming to judgement, whether it be to <hi>acquit</hi> them, or to <hi>condemn</hi> them: If it be in mercy, to take them to himſelf; while they are in a ſleep, they are not fit to meet him
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115245:167"/>
                        <hi>their Ornaments are laid aſide, their Lamps want trimming,</hi> as the Text hath it there; and therefore they muſt be awaked. Beſides, they are not fit to take notice of the infinite, and unſearchable riches of his grace manifeſted therein to them, in gathering them to himſelf; if we ſhould be called for in ſome f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ame that we are in ſometimes, truly we ſhould not be able to take comfort in our meeting with him, nor would he have any glory in our departure; and therefore uſually he doth awake his people, ſtir up their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they may ſhine, and be active when he cometh to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them; and then if he come in judgement, as againſt theſe <hi>fooliſh virgins,</hi> to blow out their Lamps in obſcure darkneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be awake in ſome meaſure, and their Conſciences open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they will not be ſenſible of it; but when the Conſcience of an hypocrite is a little rouzed; O what fearful pre-apprehenſions there will be of the diſpleaſure of Chriſt! they are not fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſentence of condemnation, except their Conſciences were rouzed; and therefore the Lord doth oftentimes, if not alway, awaken the Conſcience; the heart was never awake, but alway aſleep; but the Conſcience hath been aſleep, and now it muſt be awaked, <hi>ut ſentiat ſe mori;</hi> It never troubled the <hi>fooliſh virgins,</hi> though their Lamps were gone out, all the while they ſlept, and if they had dyed in that ſleep, they had as certainly periſhed; but not ſo ſenſibly, nor ſo ſeverely, as <hi>knowing</hi> the terrors of God which belong to them before; and the Lord will have them to lie down in the confuſion of their ſouls, for their folly, in reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves contented with a profeſſion, without the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt; without this oyl in their veſſels.</p>
                     <p>Another ground may be, <hi>for the Majeſty of the coming of Chriſt</hi> that there may be the more reverence, and <hi>awe of his Majeſty,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> therefore he hath a Meſſenger going before his face, as Princes uſe to do; and happily in their Marriages of great perſons, there might be ſome ſuch thing, ſurely this is one reaſon wherefore he cometh at the laſt day, one piece of the glory of his appearing, <hi>the voice of the Arch-Angel, the Trumpet of God;</hi> ſo the cry that goeth before, it is much for his honour and Majeſty, that all the Meſſengers he ſends Either Afflictions, or Miniſters, all their Meſſage almoſt to his people is <hi>to prepare for his coming, to fit them for that appearing.</hi>

                     <p>For the Application:</p>
                     <p>Then brethren let us take notice of the <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>tenderneſs of the Lord</hi> to his own people, in awakening them, though it <note place="margin">

Or his Diſciples
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115245:168"/>
ſleeping, and gone his ways, their condition had been ſad. If death had come upon poor <hi>David,</hi> while under that guilt in the matter of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and in ſo deep a ſleep, how ſad had his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion been? and ſo for <hi>Jonas,</hi> if the belly of hell had been his grave, the belly of the Whale, and he had not been awaked out of that ſleep, what had become of him? he had miſcarryed for ever, or at leaſt he had ſuffered great loſs; and therefore it is much tenderneſs in the Lord to his poor people, that he will not let them ſleep, but he rouzeth them up.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How eaſie ſhould this make, and how ſhould it ſweeten the ſevereſt of Gods dealings with us, to awake us?

                     <p n="3">3. If there be a Cry going before his coming, <hi>Then brethren ſee whether or no you have not had this Cry in part ſounding in your cars, and what uſe you have made of it, hath it awaked you, or not?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, That you be ſure to have your oyl in your veſſels ready,</hi> that we have <hi>grace</hi> in our <hi>hearts. Take heed to your ſelves dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently then in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, that you give not ſleep to your eys, nor ſlumber to your eye-lids;</hi> give not the Lord, nor your ſouls reſt, until you have this Communication of Chriſt to your poor ſouls; how many poor hearts that hear this word, have not a dram of grace? though you have long had a name to be Chriſtians, yet that hath been all, Brethren, What do you mean? can you dye comfortably, hopefully, except you have grace in your hearts, this <hi>oyl,</hi> this <hi>Spirit</hi> of grace dwelling in you? will any thing elſe enable you to lift up your faces before him, but his righteouſneſs and holineſs made over to you, imputed unto you as an <hi>Inner,</hi> and <hi>Outward Garment,</hi> or Cloathing? I have hope of you you would not prove <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> and that you are not ſo careleſs as not to regard whether you be found to have
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115245:175"/>
grace, yea, or no; If there be any ſuch, let me tell ſuch a man, his Condition is next to deſperate; the Lord ſmite ſuch ſinners hearts; but if you do not care, there will come a time when you will care, and every vein in your hearts will ake, when you ſhall find, alas, you have trifled away your time, your day you had to get grace in, and now you have none; Do you think bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to go to heaven without grace? muſt there be a <hi>wedding garment</hi> to his <hi>Supper</hi> here, and muſt not there much more be a <hi>wedding Garment</hi> upon them that come into that neareſt <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> with the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> for ever? Do poor ſinners eat, and drink judgement to themſelves, if they come without grace to the Supper? O brethren! do you think he will endure you to enter, if you have not grace to ſit with him at his Table to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? No: believe it, <hi>Sinners ſhall not ſtand in the Congregation</hi>

                        <hi>of the upright;</hi> O that the Lord would perſwade you!

                     <p>2. <hi>We muſt labour alſo to have our graces, to get and keep our graces in act, in a lively frame,</hi> our hearts flaming towards the Lord continually; the wiſe Virgins they ſlept, and while they ſlept, they could not <hi>watch;</hi> now they had grace in their hearts, but they kept it not in uſe, in exerciſe, as they ſhould have done, and therefore they underwent much inconvenience, as you have heard; and therefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> exhorts us to <hi>watch, to take di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent heed,</hi> that we run not the like hazard with them, no more than with the fooliſh virgins: Therefore labour to get your <hi>graces lively:</hi> how ſhould we think with our ſelves often when we find a liſtleſs f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But alas, you will ſay, how can we do this? we are poor, imperfect creatures, and therefore can we be alway acting our graces? is it likely we ſhould keep them alway in act? that is enough for Angels, and glorified Saints to do, who are therefore called <hi>watchers.</hi>

I anſwer to this; It is true, it is not required we ſhould always be acting of grace, for then we ſhould be able to do nothing elſe; then we ſhould neither ſleep, nor follow the works of ſome of our callings, which require the intention of the mind as well as the labour of the hand, therefore that is not the meaning, nor indeed were we able to do it, our ſpirits would fail us. But how then?</p>
                     <p>Why, <hi>We muſt be acting our graces when we are called to act them,</hi> when ever is a time; <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> eats bread continually at <hi>Davids</hi> table; not that he did nothing elſe but eat, without any <note place="margin">2 Sam. 9. 13.</note> intermiſſion, but at meal-times he did eat continually. <hi>Note</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we ſhould ſee to it, that upon all occaſions we act our <hi>graces,</hi> upon every temptation wherewith we are aſſaulted, we ſhould act our <hi>faith,</hi> upon every tryal our <hi>patience,</hi> upon every manifeſtation of himſelf to us to act our <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> and <hi>thank-fulneſs.</hi>

                     <p>But ſpecially in our drawings nigh to him, then ſee to it that we have our graces in act; which alas, how ſar ſhort do we fall of, as in our daily performances, prayers, publike, ſecret; So, meditating, reading, hearing, receiving the Lords Supper, if we would have them bright, we muſt exerciſe them at theſe times, how ſhould we now renew our repentance, in <hi>waſhing</hi>

                     <p>There are two things mainly noteworthy in the verſe, according to the two ſorts of Virgins, which divide this univerſal; <hi>all thoſe Virgins,</hi> they were <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fooliſh;</hi> ſome of them were Virgins in deed, the other in profeſſion and appearance ſuch; now it is very conſiderable concerning them both. That the Hypocrite ſhould ever ariſe out of ſuch a deep ſleep, conſidering that his heart was never awake, is a matter worth our noting; and that he that had nothing elſe but a Lamp, and that even now wearing out, yet ſhould be trimming of it up for heaven; On the other hand, and it is as obſervable, that the Child of God hath his Lamp to trim now at ſuch a time as this is, when the Cry is come, he is ſummoned to meet the Lord Jeſus, who is near at hand. Accordingly, I ſhall take up a double Obſervation from the words.</p>

                     <p>The firſt of theſe, A Hypocrite may go very far, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion may carry him a great way, and yet fall ſhort at laſt. You ſee here in the Text, God doth not pluck away the vizard at firſt, but letteth them proceed; he could have diſcovered them when he pleaſed: they take up their Lamps, and they go forth to meet the Bridegroom; more then many will be perſwaded to, that will hardly ſtir a foot for Chriſt, they continue ſo doing, until the Bridegroom tarried ſo long beyond their expectation; then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they fell aſleep, then they rowſed again, and trimmed their Lamps. All theſe put together, which are in the Text, will make it appear, that a Hypocrite may go far, and fall ſhort: <hi>A Doctrine</hi> never more need for to be preſſed then now: And therefore though you have heard, not very long ſince much concerning it, and much more then I am able to ſpeak, and better for the matter, yet let me alſo put you in remembrance of theſe things brethren, and the Lord open all our eyes in a thing ſo nearly concerning us all. I ſhall therefore propoſe what I have to ſay by way of proof of the Doctrine in ſeveral heads or degrees whereto a Hypocrite may reach; the Lord give us all underſtanding in them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, a Hypocrite, he may have much knowledge, much light, a head full of notion, and this is one thing neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imported in the Lamps which the fooliſh Virgins had. Some have thought their Lamps were dead, they had no flame, no light, nor heat at all, but I ſee no reaſon of it; for it is ſaid their Lamps were gone out, which argues they were in before; but I think this will hardly be denied, but a <hi>Hypocrite may be a man of much knowledge;</hi> do you not ſee it in the <hi>Phariſees?</hi> were they not men of much knowledge and underſtanding, able to teach others? they had <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair, and ſo the Scriptures, the Doctrine of the Law, men of <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 2.</note>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:115245:177"/>
great knowledge, and yet our Saviour brands them for Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; that is, an <hi>aëry</hi> religion that lies in the head. So the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks to them by way of conceſſion, yielding to them what they had, but ſhewing them where they fell ſhort; <hi>thou art a Jew, and reſteſt in the Law, and makeſt thy boaſt of God:</hi> as <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 17. to 21.</note> we do now, make our boaſt of Chriſt, that we are Chriſtians, and cannot bear it, to be accounted otherwiſe; <hi>and knoweſt his will, and approveſt the things that are more excellent, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed out of the Law;</hi> there is the principle of their knowledge, not a light within them by nature, but to the <hi>Law,</hi> and to the <hi>Teſtimonies;</hi> they had their light from thence, and ſo well grown in knowledge, that they were confident <hi>that they were guides to the blind,</hi> and therefore had no need to be blind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; <hi>a light to them which are in darkneſs, an inſtructer of the fooliſh, a teacher of Babes.</hi> And not only he is confident of it, but the Apoſtle yieldeth it, <hi>that he had the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the Law,</hi> and then he reaſons <hi>ex conceſsis; thou which teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not ſelf?</hi> &amp;c. We glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in theſe days, as much in our light as ever they did; never ſuch times of light, though for my part I cannot ſee but much that paſſeth for light, is groſs darkneſs; but ſuppoſe it be ſo, there may be light enough, a ſhining Lamp, and yet but a fooliſh Virgin; <hi>ſurgunt indocti, &amp; rapiunt coelum, &amp; nos cum doctrinis, &amp;c.</hi> I know it is true, where a people are void of knowledge, they muſt needs periſh; <hi>God will not be merciful to them,</hi> Iſa. 27. <hi>He hath a controverſie, becauſe there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>

alſo, and yet be a fooliſh Virgin when all is done. Let me ſpeak a little to ſome affections, among many others, which they may have. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They may have ſorrow for ſin,</hi> being convinced of it, and what it expoſeth them unto; How doth <hi>Darius,</hi> when he had ſigned the <hi>Decree</hi> againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> and his kingdom lay at ſtake, his people would rebel, if he executed not the <hi>Decree,</hi> he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to deliver him, he was ſorry for what he had done, and he could not reſt, nor ſleep that night, and early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cometh with a lamentable tone to him: <hi>O Daniel, ſervant of the living God, art thou yet alive?</hi> There may be a ſpirit of bondage to fear, or witneſſing to a man that he is in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſtate, which is not ſucceeded with a Spirit of Adoption: <hi>Sinners,</hi> you may have your Conſciences ſo galled ſometimes with the Law, that you cannot reſt, but cry out of ſin; O ſin, ſin, what a bitter thing is ſin; yea ſo far may this ſorrow prevail, that it may make you vomit up your ſweet morſel, make you make reſtitution with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das;</hi> God may ſo fire the Coal, you cannot hold it in your boſom any longer: the fire of Gods wrath upon <hi>Judas,</hi> even melted his pieces, they were too hot for him to hold, and yet but a <hi>Judas</hi> ſtill: And I tell you brethren, this is much, a ſtrong effect of thoſe troubles.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>There may be ſome deſires,</hi> and ſeemingly earneſt deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things really good, and which bring to ſalvation: as thoſe there in that place of <hi>John,</hi> were they not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 44.</note> when they cried out, <hi>Lord evermore give us of this bread?</hi> As very a wretch as <hi>Balaam</hi> was, yet he had his wiſhings and wouldings: <hi>O that I might die the death of the righteous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O how beautiful are his Tabernacles,</hi> &amp;c. he <note place="margin">Num. 23. 10.</note> ſeemeth to be taken with them, or deſires to enjoy that <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with them in their Ordinances: how beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are they? And the <hi>young man</hi> in the Goſpel, had he not good deſires? and is it not ſaid, our Saviour loved him for that good that was in him, though not with that ſpecial love of pitty to ſave him, that we read of? his deſires carried him out far, and yet never reach heaven; I doubt not brethren, but many of us this day have ſometimes ſome good deſires, and you would have it go well with your ſouls; you may cry out ſometimes with the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115245:178"/>
multitude, <hi>O Lord evermore give us this bread,</hi> you would be loath to part with the Ordinance of Chriſt, it is good; but all this may be in you, and yet you may be hypocrites, fooliſh Virgins; O that you could lay it to heart.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There may be alſo ſome hope, we read often in <hi>Job,</hi> of the <note place="margin">Iob 8. 13. 14.</note> hope of the <hi>Hypocrite;</hi> he hath certainly an hope for heaven, elſe he would never be at ſo much pains, as many a Hypocrite is at, as you ſhall hear afterward; would the fooliſh Virgins, think you, have done ſo much as they did, if they had not had a hope? when hope expireth, all endeavour giveth up the ghoſt with it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There may be alſo <hi>a joy and delight in holy things,</hi> as thoſe that kindled a fire of their own, in that place of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſaith the <note place="margin">ſa. 50. 11.</note> Text; <hi>They walk in the ſparks of their own fire,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>they delight themſelves in it.</hi> And ſurely brethren, the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> when they would have pluckt out their eyes for the <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 15.</note> Apoſtle, they had no ordinary rapture upon them; and yet alas, how did they apoſtatize ſome of them? And is is not ſad, to ſee in our days many, that the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath made inſtruments of God to their ſouls, they have been as dear to them as their eyes, and what is it come to with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them? are they not come to caſt off all? what ſhall we think brethren, of ſuch, in ſuch caſes? According to the hope, ſo is the joy; if the hope be ſound, ſo is the joy; if <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 12,</note> the hope be falſe, ſo is the joy which ſprings from it; the Lord hinders it not haply, doth not damp, and overcaſt the ſoul; and O how Satan endeavours to water ſuch a plant as that is! for what more available to lay a ſoul aſleep then this? <hi>he hath joy in holy things,</hi> this is an high attainment indeed, <hi>they take delight in approaching to God.</hi> And we read in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. that ſuch as fall <note place="margin">Iſa. 58. Heb. 6.</note> away, <hi>may have a taſte of the joy of the world to come;</hi> ſuch a <hi>temporary faith,</hi> the light of it doth convince, and ſhew us things worth the rejoycing in, and then a falſe hope of a <hi>title</hi> to them, when it is no ſuch matter; it will raiſe the ſpirit to rejoyce; Well, this is no ordinary pitch of affections, and yet but a Hypocrite; the ſtony ground received the word with joy, and they rejoyced in <hi>John Baptiſts light for a ſeaſon; Thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 13. Ezek. 33.</note> 
                        <hi>as one that hath a pleaſant voice, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. There may not onely be thoſe affections and others, but the fervor of them; a mans affections may ſeem to be boyled up
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115245:179"/>
to a great height: <hi>Zeal for God</hi> ſeemeth to be much, this is <hi>Jehu</hi> his caſe, how hot and zealous was he for God? and ſo <hi>Judas</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Kings 10. 16.</note> ſeemed very zealous of good works, when he would have had the box of oyntment ſpilled. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> ſeemed to have more heat of love then others, to ſell their poſſeſſions to be with the forwardeſt, and yet you ſee what became of them; and ſo may we brethren. Not but that zeal is exceedingly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and lukewarmneſs is the moſt loathſom temper to the Lord, he will ſpue ſuch a man out of his mouth; yet there may be this fire, which is not of Gods kindling. The falſe Apoſtles did zealouſly affect thoſe Chriſtians to whom the Apoſtle writeth, <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 17.</note> they ſeemed to be men of more then ordinary love, and warm affections to their ſouls; but yet they were but falſe Apoſtles, they did it enviouſly, to work the Apoſtle out of their hearts, ſo to hinder this work among them. Well remember this, ſuch as are more forward then others are, there may be heat, as well as light, and yet but fooliſh Virgins, but hypocrites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when all is done.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>An hypocrite, he may be careful in avoiding much ſin;</hi> not only in an imperfect will, which is overcome by an intereſt, ſuch as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> had, who were wretches, though not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly hypocrites; but an hypocrite may go as far as they ſurely, they may forgo their Idolatry and groſs wickedneſs, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> left his Sorceries; and theſe virgins, therefore they are <note place="margin">Acts 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> called virgins, though fooliſh virgins likely, though I will not build much upon it; but yet we ſee the unclean ſpirit may go out of a man for a time, and yet enter again; he may forſake his groſs pollutions, and yet return to that folly again, wallowing in them as the ſwine and the dog, in that ſecond of <hi>Peter;</hi> there is an <note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pet. 2. 20.</note> eſcaping the pollutions of the world, and yet notwithſtanding a returning to them again; he that ſtole, ſtealeth no more: I was a drunkard may ſome one ſay, but now I thank the Lord I am none; I was a filthy wretch, but now I am filthy no more, this is very far, and yet all this may be but hypocriſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a profeſſion and no more, in the end we may appear to be fooliſh Virgins.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>An hypocrite may have conflict within himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſins, that others can take no notice of,</hi> and this is more then the former; there may be an inward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> regretion and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     <p>Fifthly, They may alſo do much, many duties &amp; ſervices, be much in action, not Napkin up their Talent, but act, and act much, as the fooliſh virgins, you ſee they went as far as the wiſe, for ought appears, ſtep for ſtep. Did not <hi>Judas</hi> act as well as the reſt, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chriſt up and down, going forth to preach the Goſpel as well as the reſt? did not <hi>Jehu</hi> act in an high manner for God? <hi>Come and ſee my zeal for God,</hi> he did much more then many would <note place="margin">2 Chron. 24.</note> do.

                        <note place="margin">2 Chron. 11. 4.</note> he had an Army ready to fight with Iſrael when they revolted, 180000 fighting men, and yet when the word of the Lord came and told him it was of God, and bid him ceaſe, he obeys, though a kingdom lay at the ſtake, and he was in ſo fair a poſture for it; and yet he is but a <hi>Rehoboam</hi> ſtill, and one that forſook the Law of <note place="margin">2 Chron. 12. 1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> his God when he was ſtrengthened, though before he made much of the ſervants of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>An hypocrite may have the aſſiſting, inlarging preſence of God with him in his ſervice.</hi> They had preached in the name of Chriſt, his preſence had been with them alſo, and yet you ſee they are caſt out: It is ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> that he had another ſpirit <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 22.</note> given him from that day forward, a ſpirit to gift him for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and when God had rejected him and his ſervice, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit departed from him, and an evil ſpirit vexed him; he had a more then ordinary preſence of God with him, and yet but a <hi>Saul,</hi> a <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And you that are Chriſtians, God may give you a gift of Prayer, a gift in conferring, you may be eminent therein, God may aſſiſt you much therein; It is for his peoples ſakes that he will build up thereby, refreſh thereby, your ſelves may periſh notwithſtanding.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The danger of the cure,</hi> if we be pocrites: Indeed in this reſpect the condition of a prophane man is better then a cloſe hypocrite, his diſtemper is more apparent, and his own conſcience cannot but judge him of many things; but now many times a hypocrite ſeeth not his hypocriſie, though ſometimes he do: it may be at the firſt if he had hearkened to the voice of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience charging him with hypocriſie in this and that, he might have kept it tender; but ſmothering it, at laſt it groweth ſilent and harder ſeared, and the eyes by degrees are blinded, ſo that he ſeeth not his diſeaſe. 2.

If he do ſee his diſeaſe, he is uſually unwilling to have it healed, he liketh it better to keep his luſts, ſecretly to have the delight of them, and pleaſure of ſin ſecretly, and yet the ſhew of godlineſs.

                     <p>Why, but you will ſay, how ſhould a man know then (If a <note place="margin">Object.</note> hypocrite be ſuch an one that may go ſo far) whether he be an hypocrite or no? for it may be you will ſay, for ought I perceive, an hypocrite is gone ſo far that I doubt I ſhall hardly reach it.

It may be a man would think, that the ſin of his conſtitution he may give himſelf a little liberty in, and this is thy plea, <hi>It is my temper,</hi> to be vainly merry, a mans temper to be wanton, to be fooliſhly jeſting, and men will plead their nature for it; why truly ſo might <hi>Job, he made a covenant with his eyes: David, I kept me from mine iniquity,</hi> whether the ſin of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 23.</note> or his preſent condition, that is to ſay, <hi>revenge upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when he had him in his hand.</hi> So the ſins of a mans place, <hi>Job

If men ſhall in any caſe, though they have never ſo urgent temptations, allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any ſin; ſurely ſuch men are hypocrites and no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>an hypocrite will do much,</hi> but he will not do all; he never <hi>hath reſpect to all the commandments of God.</hi> Why but you <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 6.</note> will ſay, No more can the moſt upright man upon the earth do all. <hi>Not Legally, but Evangelically he may, he may aim at all; though the Commandment be exceeding broad, he may ſearch after all, that he may do them, he may endeavour it, though he cannot reach it, I have a reſpect to all; and where he cometh ſhort, that is his burthen, that is matter of mourning to him.</hi> Take it in two or three particulars, that I enlarge not too much.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It may be an hypocrite will be wonderful ſtrict in the duties of the firſt table, which we call ordinarily religious duties, as praying, reading, hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you ſhall find him very ſlight and ſlack in the duties of the ſecond. Thoſe in the 7. of <hi>Matth,</hi> they would Preach and Propheſie in Chriſt his name, but yet they would work iniquity with both hands. <hi>Judas</hi> would pray with Chriſt, Preach for Chriſt, receive with Chriſt, but he would then couzen and defraud, made no conſcience of ſecret thievery. And it is very plain in that firſt of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who were more forward then they in their ſacrifices, abundant in their worſhip, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their burnt-offerings and ſolemn aſſemblies, but in the mean time their hands were full of blood, they made nothing of <note place="margin">

And is it not ſo with ſome of us, we are frequent in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, frequent it as much as others, and yet notwithſtanding make nothing of the duties of the ſecond table, drunkenneſs is nothing, though wine be raging; make nothing of railing, reviling, of covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry; he will hardly make a Covenant with his eyes, as <hi>Job</hi> did: maketh nothing of uncleanneſs, if not outward in act, yet contemplative, of a wandering eye, and wandring heart; and ſo of deceit. O this is dreadful, let not that man deceive himſelf, certainly he is an hypocrite, and though he may go far, yet he will be ſure to fall ſhort.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>An hypocrite in his obedience, he will be much about little incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable things.</hi> Some ceremonious things, or the like, more then
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115245:184"/>
the weighty matters of the Law; ſo the Phariſees, they forſooth <note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 28.</note> would not come into the Judgement-Hall, becauſe it was the preparation to the Paſſ-over, leſt they ſhould be defiled, and not fit for the Paſſ-over; but they made nothing of the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pollution that could be, of falſly accuſing the moſt innocent perſon, and proſecuting him to the death, this they made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of: and ſo they ſcrupled not to give thirtie pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 23.</note> as a price for Jeſus Chriſt, that they might bring him to death, but when they had done, they would not caſt it into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. The Papiſts, they make much ado, it is a grievous offence to violate one of their faſting daies enjoyned by the Pope, but to murther Chriſtian Princes under the notion of Hereticks, they make nothing of that; this is the condition of many a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Mint, Annice and Cummin they muſt tythe, theſe externals and ceremonials; a Gnat they ſtrain at, but a Camel they can ſwallow.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another thing in their obedience is this; an hypocrite, he can be contented to take up the eaſie part of Chriſtianity ordinarily, but not the difficult, that which is more inward and laborious: they can come to hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O ſurely brethren, if our hearts condemn us, and tell us <hi>We work for our penny in the Vineyard of the Lord,</hi> we ſerve for our <hi>penny,</hi> it is not right; it may be we may pretend the glory of God, and may ſeem to take a right aim for God and for Chriſt, but like a deceitful bow, we turn aſide, and have ſomewhat elſe in our eye that ſetteth the wheels awork, when the glory of Chriſt will not; O this is <note place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 7.</note> groſs hypocriſie. So thoſe in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. they propheſied in the name of Chriſt, but not for his name, but for themſelves; and though a child of God may be peſtered with ſuch thoughts creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon him, yet he ſuffers them not to lodge with him, but whippeth them, and giveth them their paſs, he mourns under them, prayeth for pardon of them, and healing and ſubduing of them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Another thing is touching the conflict which the ſoul may have with ſin. How may we know whether that be right or no? An hypocrite may have ſome regret doubtleſs in ſinning, until he hath hardened his conſcience ſo by cuſtom, that he is paſt feeling.</p>
                     <p>Do but mind theſe two things. 1.

                     <p>WE have done with the former member, that is to ſay, <hi>the fooliſh Virgins trimming their Lamps,</hi> going ſo far in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, and yet fail when all is done. Now we are to conſider the ſecond member included in this general; and that is, <hi>that Believers are now to trim their Lamps;</hi> the wiſe Virgins were now to do it as well as the fooliſh; the real, as well as the formal profeſſor. I will only briefly note two things from this clauſe of the Verſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That though a Believers profeſſion may decline and grow low, and that towards his latter end,</hi> or after he hath long profeſſed Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>yet it is not altogether extinct;</hi> it wants trimming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but it is not out with the fooliſh Virgins.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>When this profeſſion groweth thus low, it is the Believers duty to renew it, to trim up his Lamp.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the firſt in the firſt place, wherein are comprehended three notes, which for brevity ſake I wrap up into one; partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of them have near affinity with what hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy delivered; and partly, becauſe I would not dwell too long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Text.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, <hi>That a Believer his profeſſion may decline and grow low, and need a renewing. 2. That it may come to this paſs after he hath long profeſſed,</hi> or near the time of his Calling for. And 3. <hi>That yet notwithſtanding it is not extinct</hi> altogether, as the profeſſion of the fooliſh is, of which afterwards. A word or two briefly to each of theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That a Believers profeſſion may decline;</hi> which is ſomewhat of kin to what we ſpoke before, and therefore the leſs here. <hi>The Lamp may grow low.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt then, <hi>The light which appears to be in the Saints may grow low.</hi> It may admit of mixtures, ſometimes of darkneſs which much dimmeth the light.

                     <p>3. <hi>Believers,</hi> as they may loſe in a great meaſure <hi>their joy of faith,</hi> ſo may they loſe <hi>their confidence of hope,</hi> ſo that they may be ready to ſay many times, <hi>their hope is even periſhed from the Lord, and hath God forgotten to be gracious, and will he be merciful no more?</hi> this you may ſee in many caſes of the Saints. <hi>David, I ſhall one day periſh by the hands of Saul.</hi> O I ſhall never ſee <note place="margin">1 Sam. 27. 1.</note> through this world of wickedneſs that is in mine heart, but ſooner or later, I ſhall be ſwallowed up by it.</p>
                     <p>4. A Believer may loſe the degrees of thoſe graces which are radical, and which indeed more principally are like the oyl in the veſſel, yet that may grow low, and then no marvel if the Lamp which is fed by them do grow low alſo.

But ſo much for the firſt thing. I am brief, becauſe I have had occaſion to ſpeak much what to the ſame purpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond will be this, <hi>That theſe declinings may be in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, even near their end, and the coming of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This will be juſtified by the Parable, here the cry cometh which rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wiſe Virgins, and when they awaked and came to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their conſciences were awaked, then they ſaw that their Lamps wanted trimming, they burned low; when they ſhould burn the brighteſt, they are dim &amp; dull; you need not much to be ſaid for the proof of this part of the Doctrine, for of <hi>Solomon</hi> after he had lived long, and followed God, and had had extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <note place="margin">1 King. 11. 9.</note> appearances of God to him again and again, publike and privately; yet when he was old, ſaith the text, and ſhould have grown better, he then began to love many wives, and then fell to countenance Idolatry, which is a blemiſh upon him to all poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And ſo you ſee it in <hi>Aſa</hi> his caſe, a good man, and a man ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forward and diligent for the reformation; and yet in his laſt daies, ſee how many failings are noted of him, his unbelief, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">2 Chron. 16. 10.</note> upon an arm of fleſh, his impriſoning the Prophet that repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, his going to the Phyſitians and not to God, his oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of many of his people; the lower he ran, his day ran, the more dregs he ran, he ran not cleareſt at the bottom.

                        <hi>at its perfection, it is but a creature,</hi> and depending upon God as the beams upon the Sun, and as the ſtream upon the Fountain, and therefore no longer then he is pleaſed to feed it, will it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; let our veſſel be never ſo full of oyl, our hearts never ſo full of grace, yet it depends upon the Lord Jeſus and his fulneſs; and <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.</note>

Thou maintaineſt my lot, Pſal.</hi> 16. <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note> Now if he withdraw and forbear to empty out of that fulneſs upon us, let our conditions be what it will, alas grace will lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, our Lamps will burn dim.</p>
                     <p>2. Becauſe (truly many times) <hi>this is the time the people of God grow moſt ſecure,</hi> they have long followed hard after God, and now they think they may ſlack their pace a little; we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding prone to ſet up grace received in ſtead of Chriſt; when our mountain is made ſtrong we lean upon it, whereas we ſhould only lean upon our beloved; as the Church. And then no marvel if he let us ſee, to our ſorrow, that grace is but a creature, and loſeable in its own nature; the child getteth moſt falls, when it thinketh it can go it ſelf without any holding; and this much for the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>The third thing is, <hi>That though the Lamps of the wiſe Virgins come to want trimming,</hi> to burn low and dim, and at ſuch a time as this, <hi>yet they are not put out;</hi> which is the complaint of the fooliſh Virgins in the following verſe. The <hi>declenſions</hi> of a godly man, at the worſt they are recoverable. An emblem of this, was the fire upon the <hi>Altar in the Sanctuary,</hi> it never went out after once <note place="margin">Levit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. 12. and 13.</note> it was kindled. It is ſaid of the good womans Candle, <hi>it goeth not out by night;</hi> ſhe may ſleep it may be, but it is by Candle-light; as perſons that intend to riſe again, and haply not to ſleep long, will ſleep by a Candle. Believers may fall aſleep, and the Candle may burn dim, but yet it goeth not out. <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 18.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed it is true, a child of God his profeſſion of Chriſt may be at ſuch a low ebb ſometimes, as ſcarce to be viſible. A candle in the ſocket ſometimes will burn ſo low, that a man would think it were even out, but it riſeth again. So we would have thought <hi>Peters</hi> profeſſion had given up the ghoſt, when he denyed and forſwore his Maſter, in ſuch a ſad manner. And ſo <hi>David,</hi> his profeſſion was very low. And ſo ſome of the Martyrs that ſubſcribed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Trapp</hi> his Com. place of Apoſt.</note> as <hi>Cranmer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> So <hi>Tho. Whittle</hi> and <hi>Benbridge, Bilny</hi> and others, <hi>Fullers lives,</hi> pag. 122. now we could hardly ſee the light, yet it broke forth again, and ſhone gloriouſly in them all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="245" facs="tcp:115245:188"/>
Again, It cannot be denyed but that a child of God may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and loſe divers degrees of grace, which for ought we know he may never recover again, never have his Lamp trimmed up as it was before; but yet, it never goeth quite out.</p>
                     <p>And ſo for comfort, they may live and dye haply, without the light of his countenance, and yet their Lamps burning. Our Saviour himſelf dyed without the ſenſe of the Love of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he had his ſupporting preſence, but not that ſweet refreſhing preſence, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> for this is <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 46.</note> not neceſſary to the being of a Chriſtian, as to believe with the heart, and confeſs with the mouth is, in perſons grown.</p>
                     <p>Now that it is ſo, that their Lamps do not go out, neither the light nor heat altogether, nor the acts of holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards God and towards men, are not altogether loſt and laid aſide. It will appear,</p>
                     <p>Firſt by Scripture, <hi>the path of the juſt is as a ſhining light, which</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhineth more and more to the perfect day;</hi> Some interruptions there may be, but yet it ſhineth more and more; the Sun runneth his race, though now and then a cloud intercepts his comfortable beams from the earth. And that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, his leaf ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>wither,</hi> the leaf is the profeſſion, he ſhall not wither but be green. An hypocrite indeed like a Bull-ruſh will wither, as we ſhall ſee by and by, when the mire and the water fails; but a child of God withers not. There are two Conditions which uſually wither mens profeſſion, but the child of God ſtands it out in both. 1. In a proſperous ſtate, that uſeth to choak the word; they that will call upon God in the day of diſtreſs, <hi>in their afflictions wil ſeek him earneſtly,</hi> yet when his hand is taken away, they no more <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. 15.</note> remember<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord their Saviour; but a child of God now in his proſperous condition, he loſeth not his profeſſion altogether, though the Lamp may be damped, yet not extinguiſht. And 2. For adverſity, that indeed is a trying time: <hi>all this is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, yet have we not dealt falſly in the Covenant;</hi> will the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite <note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 17.</note> alway call upon God? he will not call upon God alway, nor wait for him. Yea, the time of affliction uſually is an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the people of God; if ever their Lamp burn brighter then another, it is in the dark and cold night of perſecution and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; a Torch, the more knockt againſt any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more it burns.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:115245:189"/>
Secondly, <hi>Becauſe they have within them a Spring of oyl that feeds the Lamp,</hi> therefore it goeth not out. It is ſet forth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther metaphor in that place of <hi>John, out of his belly ſhall flow Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of water, ſpringing up to eternal life.</hi> Now where there is <note place="margin">Joh. 7. 38.</note> this within, the flame will live while there is oyl to maintain it: It is like fire in a mans boſom, he cannot carry it ſo ſurely, but it will diſcover it ſelf as fire in the bones, as the Prophet ſpeaks of the word of God. And,</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Becauſe that cruſe of oyl is continually ſupplyed by the Spirit,</hi> and from the fulneſs of Chriſt, therefore it never fails. If the oyl in the veſſel could fail, then the Light in the Lamp might fail, but it fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Son.</hi> Sin is ſtrong indeed, ſtrong luſts; and Satan is ſtrong, a Lyon, a Dragon, a Prince of the power of darkneſs; and Armies of luſts he hath warring in our members, a great ſtrength, and all theſe pluck at us, but they cannot pull us out of this hand of Chriſt. And thence it is that their Lamps are not put out in obſcure darkneſs. O how fain would Satan blow out the Candle, that we might walk in the darkneſs, not knowing whither we go; but it is held in the hand of Chriſt, and it is above the reach of his poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous breath to do it. A damp of luſts from our own hearts, if any thing would do it, this would, and it maketh them burn ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dimly and blew many times, but yet cannot overcome; the Lamp may want trimming, but it is not out.</p>
                     <p>For the Application then of this Doctrine. If it be ſo, <hi>that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ſubject to ſuch declinings,</hi> yea when they ſhould be at <note place="margin">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115245:189"/>
truſted in, it might be grace, for there is not any other ſo near approach to God, without which <hi>Angels</hi> were but <hi>Devils,</hi> the very perfection of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> And yet becauſe it hath its imperfections, therefore it is not to be truſted to. Nothing indeed is more ſpiritual then <hi>grace,</hi> the choiſeſt communications of the eternal ſpirit to the Creature, but yet conſidered in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the God of <hi>grace,</hi> it is but fleſh, if it be reſted upon; the ſtrongeſt mountain, that a man would think ſhould never be ſhaken, yet ſin and Satan, if the Lord permit, can get under it, and blow it up. Yea, if our grace were perfect, yet we might not reſt in it, becauſe yet it hath its comparative im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, it ſelf being but a derivative, and dependent Being upon the God of grace at the beſt; it is but a ſtream, a beam, though nearer the Sun, and nearer the Fountain; and but the water of a Ciſtern, and if whole before, yet this reſting upon it, would make it a broken Ciſtern. Well then bretbren, if our profeſſion flouriſh never ſo, if it be ſpring time with you, truſt not in it; for there may come a fall after this ſpring, there may come a time of ſcorching heat may make you wither, in a great part at leaſt. Though your Lamp burn, and ſhine never ſo gloriouſly, and the light be great which ariſeth from theſe ſparks of Gods kindling, you ſee it may come to want trimming, to burn more dimly, therefore truſt not in it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It ſhould teach us then to live by faith, in reſpect hereof.</hi> Alas brethren, we are withering every moment; if we have not waterings every moment, what would become of us now? whence muſt this come, but from the fountain of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <note place="margin">Iſa 27. 3.</note> eternal ſpring and fulneſs which is in Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>Of his fulneſs we receive,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Evangeliſt:</hi> What made the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note> the reſt of the Diſciples, their profeſſion of him, and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</hi> all their Lamps were damped in that <hi>hour</hi> and <hi>power of darkneſs,</hi> it was ſo great and groſs; but his was almoſt gone and giving up.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A word of ſtrong Conſolation to many a poor drooping ſoul; If once thou have but grace in thy heart, the oyl in thy Veſſel,</hi> it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſt again, though in its own nature it be loſeable. Thou art afraid ſome temptation or another from Satan, the world, or thy own heart will blow it out; ſome blaſt or other will wither thee; O thou ſhalt never be able to keep thy Lamp burning in the midſt of ſo many contrary winds of luſt and corruption; but though thou canſt not keep it alive, the Lord can do it, and he will do it. Indeed while the Virgins ſlept, for any care they took of their Lamp, it might have gone out; but the Lord kept it burning though it were but low, and needed dreſſing. Be of good courage then, poor drooping foul, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thy heart; didſt thou ever know of any that had this oyl in their veſſels, that had the real work of grace upon them, that did quite extinguiſh and dye? ſurely thou didſt not. If the Lord

                     <p>The ſecond Doctrine is this: <hi>When a Believers profeſſion grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>ſo low, and he is declined, ſpecially at ſuch a time, it is his duty to trim his Lamp, to renew his profeſſion, to look after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring.</hi> So here, <hi>they aroſe, and trimmed their Lamps,</hi> when the Cry came; and this did the wiſe Virgins as well as the fooliſh. Concerning the fooliſh Virgins I have nothing here to ſay, nor ſhall I trouble my ſelf, or you with what haply might be ſpoken of the Hypocrites trimming his Lamp, wherein it differs from the Believers. The wiſe Virgins trimming, I have ſpoke the laſt-day to that purpoſe, ſhewing how far they might go. But I will ſpeak here to the wiſe Virgins, becauſe I would not dwell too long upon theſe things.</p>
                     <p>So you find <hi>Solomon:</hi> his declinings were great, and that at his latter end; but he aroſe again, and repented, as appears by his Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> and <hi>Proverbs,</hi> &amp;c. written after this
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115245:194"/>
his backſliding, as is generally conceived. And ſo the Church of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> their love and care of the Apoſtle ſuffered a nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 10.</note> a winter, and had ceaſed to flouriſh as formerly, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed it again; <hi>It hath flouriſhed it again,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: <hi>Eurychus</hi> may fall down, and almoſt beat his life out of him, but it is ſtill in him, and there muſt be means uſed to draw it forth, as there is pains taken with Trees that have a fit of barreneſs come upon them; Spiritual life runs to the heart, and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears little or nothing without, ſometimes; as conquered men do from their outworks to the Tower; but it muſt be brought forth again, we have a command for it, to thoſe two Churches in the <hi>Revelations, Sardis had a name to live and was dead;</hi> likely the moſt of them were dead, and yet there were ſome things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 2.</note> which were ready to die, and theſe muſt be ſtrengthened, the things which remain, which were ready to die; for their works were not perfect before God. O it was hypocriſie that did eat them out of their life of Godlineſs, its a conſuming thing indeed. And ſo the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> their love was waxed <hi>Luke-warm, neither hot, nor cold,</hi> neither dead altogether, nor lively; now ſaith the Lord, <hi>be zealous therefore, and repent.</hi> But you will ask me here,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What it is to trim theſe Lamps that is here required?</hi> I will ſpeak but to two or three particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, <hi>In the trimming of the Lamp, there is uſually a ſupply of the Oyl, if it wanted;</hi> as when it hath burned long, if it be not ſupplyed, the oyl being ſpent, it will not live, except it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. And it was high time for theſe Virgins now to be awaked hereunto, they might elſe have ſlept until all had been ſpent, and the Lamp had gone out, as well as the fooliſh; grace being but a Creature, it liveth by a continual ſupply of the Spirit of grace, the firſt cauſe of it. So then <hi>in the trimming of the Lamp,</hi> there muſt be a fetching in of more grace, a recourſe to the fulneſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt; for the Lamp is ready to languiſh or dye elſe for want of oyl.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>There is a ſtirring up alſo of the grace which doth remain,</hi> ſome oyl remaineth, that muſt be made ready, the ready paſſage between the Veſſel and the Lamp, the heart and the converſation; it muſt indeed be cheriſhed; for being little, haply it is ready to dye, like a ſpark among much aſhes, <hi>ſtir up the gift that is in thee, there is none that ſtirreth up himſelf to lay hold upon</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 6. Iſa. 64. 7.</note>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:115245:195"/>
                        <hi>God.</hi> The wick in the Lamp muſt be raiſed, it being burned low, ſo it is in this caſe. It may be, in ſuch a declining conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a poor ſoul, there is more grace lying deep, and low, lying aſleep in the habit, more then the ſoul is aware of; this muſt be ſtirred up, faith ſtirred up, and love to Jeſus Chriſt, and his people ſtirred up.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>In the trimming of the Lamp, there is a taking away the filth, and the droſs that it gathers, and ſnuffing the wick which would hinder the light and burning of it, that it would be very dull and dim.</hi> Now what is this brethren, but the <hi>putting away thoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, repenting of thoſe evils;</hi> whatever they have been that have thus far prevailed againſt their profeſſion, that <hi>ſecurity,</hi> that <hi>carnality,</hi> that <hi>ſelf-confidence,</hi> thoſe things which laid them aſleep, which choaked the Lamp, that it could not burn. Whenever we are under any declining, do but ſearch and ſee, <hi>commune with your own hearts,</hi> and you will find there is ſome evil which lies cloſe, ſome ſoil we have gathered, and hereby the ſpirit of grace hath been grieved, and he is departed from us. Now this ſnuff muſt be taken off, deal not gently with it, this filth and droſs muſt be removed, if we would trim up our <hi>Lamps.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Application then of this briefly in a word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It may ſerve to ſtir us up every one to this duty; If our Lamps</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>be at preſent, or ſhall hereafter come under any declining.</hi> Alas brethren, do we not ſlumber and ſleep often, and neglect all this while the trimming of our Lamps, and will they not quickly burn low and dim, and need a <hi>ſerious trimming of them?</hi> I doubt this duty will be incumbert upon us, and required of us oftner then we are aware of. Do we know how ſoon the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> will come? his voice goeth before him, we have often heard, but have we trimmed our Lamps to this day, are our profeſſions more glorious then formerly? <hi>And for Motives hereunto, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Such a reſtoring is a thing feizable, hough the duty be</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                        <hi>thine, yet the work is Gods:</hi> he engageth to help, yea to do it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>he reſtoreth my ſoul,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, and it is for his own name</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>ſake;</hi> for the glory of his Grace. <hi>David</hi> had many decays and backſlidings, witherings, and faintings, but God reſtored
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115245:195"/>
his ſoul ſtill; and he is as ready to do it for his people now, as ever he was; therefore do not ſay, alas this is a work too difficult, or hard, or there is no recovery; my Lamp is ſo near extinct, as there is no hope for me; he that kindled it at firſt is able to reſtore it. It is indeed a work of ſome difficulty, and will coſt you ſomething, but yet it is fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zable. <hi>Peter</hi> was at as low an ebb as ever poor Believer was; <note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

The loſt groat was found again, and the <note place="margin">Luke 15. 6, 9, 24.</note> loſt ſheep was found again. And ſo the Prodigal Son, he ran far, and laviſht away his Patrimony, and yet he is reſtored again; the winter may deform the face of the earth, but the Spirit of God can renew it again in the <hi>Spring;</hi> now he hath promiſed to give this Spirit, and he ſendeth forth his Spirit to find out the loſt Child, the loſt ſheep, and therefore there is encouragement.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Conſider, until this be done, you are not fit for Heaven,</hi> nor to enter with him, you are not ready: the wiſe Virgins trimmed their Lamps, and then they were ready, ſaith the Text, <hi>and they that were ready went in with him;</hi> happy creatures that are found ready with their Lamps burning at that day of his appearing, which we know not whether it may be at hand. A wicked man is not fit for heaven upon any terms, it would be a place of no reſt unto him, no more then the Air is to the fiſh, or the water to a man, they are not con-natural; and truly no more is a gracious man fit for heaven while his Lamp wants trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Heaven is the inheritance of the Saints in light, and is he fit for it that is even going out in darkneſs? O no, the Lamp muſt <note place="margin">Col. 1. 12.</note> be ſhining and burning bright, or elſe there is no ſuitableneſs to heaven.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Hereby God will have much more glory by you then otherwiſe he is like to have;</hi> for minde you, it is the ſhining of our Lamps, the glory of our converſations, ſuitable to our profeſſion, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth occaſion to the men of the world to glorifie him; ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>good works, and glorifie your father which is in heaven:</hi> This is all the Lord expecteth, that he may be acknowledged, and have the glory of all his grace of us; we have the ſweet and comfort, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115245:196"/>
everlaſting advantage of it; and it cannot but be upon every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers heart to glorifie God, it is indeed the end of our coming into the world; now we cannot glorifie him ſo, while our Lamps burn ſo low, we are under declinings, but when we are fruitful and abound in it, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>herein is my father glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ye bring forth much fruit;</hi> this is that which God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 8.</note> by. It may be, we have ſome few good works; but they are but a few, and ſo few, that ſcarce any can take notice to glorifie God for them; methinks this ſhould ſtick much with us. Specially the nearer we come to glory our ſelves, the more ſhould we mind the glory of God, the more zealous ſhould we be for it. O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to lay about us to glorifie him here, learn the work of heaven for ever, if not before, yet at leaſt now we are ready to reap the wages of heaven, the glory and joy unſpeakable, and Rivers of pleaſures for evermore.</p>
                     <p>4. Conſider, Is it not a ſhame for us brethren, <hi>whoſe ſalvation is much nearer now then when we believed,</hi> began to believe that our light ſhould not be more dim, our heat more abated, our zeal for God, the fervor of our affections; ſurely it is a very great ſhame: as if the nearer we come to the enjoyment of God, the leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable he were; time hath been when we have ſome of us fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed hard after God, it is well if we have mended, or held on our pace; the time hath been haply when our Converſations have been bright, and a beauty of holineſs appeared in them, and others have taken notice of it, and glorified God; it is well if we be not grown Luke-warm. O what a ſhame is this, the nearer we come to the Sun to be the colder: hath not the Cry paſſed and awaked us, and do we not finde that our Lamps are dim, and we are in our profeſſion very low? O look to it, that our laſt days be our beſt days, and we go not out like a ſnuff.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But you will ask me, what ſhould we do to trim up theſe Lamps of ours?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>You muſt remember from whence you are fallen,</hi> look up to the top of the hill where once you were, and now you are undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernably <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 5.</note> tumbled to the bottom, you know not how: O how much ground have you loſt, ſearch and try brethren: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with your hearts: Conſider your ways, as <hi>David</hi> did, and turn to the Lord. It will exceedingly ſhame us, and that ſhame be a ſpur to us to conſider how far ſhort we are
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115245:196"/>
of that love, that zeal, that diligence and cloſeneſs of walking.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>We muſt repent of it,</hi> we muſt be humbled for our former miſcarriages, our declining to loſe our firſt love; the more love we have received, the leſs we return to him again: Is not this unworthy? Beſides, how much might we have honoured the Lord, if our light had ſhone before men, if there had been a Majeſty of holineſs alway upon our converſation, ſuch as ſometime hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there hath been, and is not this matter of humbling?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then we muſt do our firſt works,</hi> It is not a ſorrow on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our miſcarriage that is enough, but we muſt do our firſt works; If we have been zealous before, and now are become Luke-warm, be zealous and amend, do our firſt works; we have <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 19.</note> been more diligent and cloſe in our walking with God, now we are more remiſs, we muſt remember whence we are fallen, and do our firſt works. O why ſhould we not labour to exceed the love of our eſpouſals, when we followed ſo hard after him? <hi>our ſouls panted as the chaſed Hart after the water-brooks;</hi> and this it may be before we had many hints of his love, ſome ſight of him likely, elſe we ſhould not follow him, ſome touch upon our hearts, as in <hi>Eliſha</hi> his caſe, and <hi>Sauls;</hi> the people whoſe hearts God touched, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 26.</note> they followed, but did one taſte of his love? then draw thee out ſo earneſtly; and now thou haſt had many a ſmile, many a ſweet refreſhing from his preſence, many a Ring broken between Jeſus Chriſt and thy ſoul, and wilt thou not now be as diligent and as earneſt in following after him? it is the nature of true Grace, that as it cometh from heaven, it will never ceaſe until it reach to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven again.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>We muſt beg earneſtly of the Lord to work this and all our works in us and for us;</hi> It is he that reſtored <hi>David</hi> his ſoul when it was even loſt; and ſo he doth ours: he maketh them to return when they are even giving up; O give him no reſt, <hi>until he ſend forth his ſpirit,</hi> and give thee to be filled with that ſpirit, <note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 3.</note> with might in the inner man, that thou maiſt burn and ſhine, and the fulneſs and fruitfulneſs, the burning and brightneſs of thy converſation may be a witneſs to all that behold it, that of a truth the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt is in thee. He is wonderful ready to help in ſuch a caſe above what we can conceive; for it is he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in caſe of ſuch backſlidings, that puts words into his peoples <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 1.</note> mouths, when they have nothing to ſay, and cannot look up, nor
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115245:197"/>
hold up the head for ſhame, nor look their God and Father in the ſace, they have ſo grieved him, and ſhamed their profeſſion; yet then the Lord puts words into their mouths, in that fourteenth of <hi>Hoſea;</hi> It is the very caſe of the Prodigal, for he was a Son, and therefore calls God Father in his return, denyeth not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, nor calls it in queſtion, notwithſtanding his unworthy, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards him, but he had miſpent all, as ſadly as thou haſt done likely; and yet when he came and returned, his Eather giveth him the meeting, and runs and falls upon his neck and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, and was ready to make up all again; therefore go to him, be earneſt with him, and ſee if he make not your Lamps to ſhine again gloriouſly; and ſwallow up that glory in his greater glory, his preſence for ever.</p>

You know <hi>Judas</hi> was diſcovered, unmasked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, and laid open to be what he was indeed; a thief, a wretch, a traytor. And ſo thoſe many Diſciples that followed Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>he knowing their hearts not to be right,</hi> delivered ſuch a trying word as gave them offence, <hi>and they went backward, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 66.</note> 
                        <hi>walked with him no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Reaſon of this is very plain, <hi>Becauſe they have not a ſpring within to feed their profeſſion.</hi> As far as the ſpring they have, or the wet, or mire, they move by little; as far as that will carry them they will go, but then not a ſtep further. A beaſt, and a ſervant, or a child follow a man; the one followeth him for a bottle of hay, ſo ſoon as he laies that down before him, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no further after him; but the ſon followeth him home, and will not be ſhut out by any means. As haply now, while Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115245:198"/>
thrives, he will be on the Sun-ſide of the hedge, where it is warmeſt, he is a Summer-bird; ſuppoſe now a time of tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Job 27. 10.</note> come for the <hi>word ſake,</hi> will he abide? No, <hi>he withers as the ſandy ground,</hi> in the 13. <hi>Matth. Will he delight himſelf in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and alway call upon God?</hi> No, their profeſſion are like <note place="margin">Job 6. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, deceive him in the day of trouble; as a brook, and as the ſtream of a brook they paſs away, like a loud flood, make a great ſhew, run very fiercely, carry all before it for a time, but it is preſently dryed up, becauſe it hath no ſpring to feed it; as ſome note, that in <hi>Peru</hi> there is a diurnal-River, which runs in the day with a great ſtream, but in the night the channel is dry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the day the Sun melteth down the Snow upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and that maketh a great ſtream, but in the night it ceaſeth. In grace now it is otherwiſe, there is a principle within, there is the Spirit of grace dwelling in the hearts of Believers, and this ſupplyeth them continually; there is a new nature, and that is a thing durable. But,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If it fail not before death, as here it doth, yet ſome paſſions being longer then ſome, <hi>Joaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> held out long, yet he was diſcovered before death; but ſuppoſe they continue longer, yet <note place="margin">2 Chron. 24.</note> uſually they will not carry them through death; men may make a ſhift to live by a form, but they cannot dye by a form: indeed affliction opens many mens eyes to ſee that they were but rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; counterfeit gold will not endure the fire, or not the ſeventh fire at leaſt, fire is of a ſearching nature, and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome they paſs this tryal, and are not diſcovered until death, and then it fails them. If <hi>Balaam</hi> dye his own death, and not the death of the righteous, what a miſerable creature will he be? <note place="margin">Numb. 23. 10.</note> And death doth open many mens eyes: O what labouring is there then many times to be ſpared a little, <hi>that they may recover ſtrength before we go hence and be no more ſeen.</hi> All the life <note place="margin">Pſal. 39. <hi>ult.</hi>
                        </note> time they thought all was well, but now they find they are deceived, their Lamps are gone out. O brethren, the valley of the ſhadow of death is full of ſuch damps, as every Lamp will not endure, every profeſſion will not abide, but it overcometh them. But haply they may go down quietly, and go away with confidence in their conſcience; a ſtrange confidence have many poor blinded hypocrites, whoſe conſciences are ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Yet,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="265" facs="tcp:115245:198"/>
Thirdly, Be ſure brethren, It will not carry them through the Judgement; after the death the Judgement; we may make a ſhift to paſs through this world, and haply delude our ſelves, and think all is well; and through death, and yet never dream of our miſery; but if we be hypocrites, be ſure that a form will not endure to appear in Judgement, before the <hi>ever laſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the conſuming fire.</hi> There the Lord will examine mens hands, what ever their profeſſions have been, and their hearts; as it is ſaid of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he examined a fellow that pretended to the Crown, he was ſo confident and cunning, he could not trap him in his words; at laſt he examined his hands, and finding them hard with labour, he found him to be but a ſervile mechanick fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; he was then ſo ſtartled, ſaith Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> that he had no more to ſay. So the Lord will examine mens works then, and the principles of their works from which they acted, and they ſhall be forced to confeſs they are hypocrites, and their mouthes ſhall he everlaſtingly ſtopt, <hi>depart from me ye workers of iniquity;</hi> you tell me ye have preached in my name, or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let me ſee your hands, you are workers of iniquity.</p>
                     <p>For the Application then, <hi>What a terrible word to all formal profeſſors,</hi> who have only a Lamp, a form of godlineſs, but deny the power of it in heart and in their converſations. Let all ſuch, if any ſuch be here preſent, know,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Your profeſſion will fail you ſooner or later.</hi> You think when you have done ſo many duties, you have acquired ſuch gifts, and ſuch ſuppoſed graces of the ſpirit, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>w all is well, theſe are enough to lift you up to heaven, a Tower, a Ladder that will reach to heaven. But alas, it is not ſo, it is but a Caſtle build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 22.</note> in the air, they are lying words you truſt in, who cry, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are theſe.</hi> You are his people, and have his Ordinances; a <note place="margin">Job 8. 14.</note> fine web a ſpider weaves, takes great pains, ſpins it out of her bowels; but alas, it never cometh to any thing, it will not make a garment to cover their nakedneſs from the Lord Jeſus. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites reſt in a formality, and ſome obſervances of the Law, as if it were their hope that ſhould ſecure them from all ſtorms and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries whatſoever, but alas it will not, theſe things will fail.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Is it not worthy obſervation alſo, that an hypocrite, if he go to decay in this life, his hypocriſie be diſcovered, he decaies
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115245:199"/>
quickly, ſuddenly, more ſuddenly then another man ordinarily; therefore he is compared to a Bull-ruſh, that withers before any other plant when they are once blaſted &amp; curſed; as God doth curſ <note place="margin">Job 8. 12.</note> them many times, alas the next day they are gone and withered; as the tree that was dryed up by the root, which the Diſciples won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at; a ſad thing <hi>to-have leaves without fruit, a form without</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mark 11. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>power;</hi> the withering curſe doth light upon them ſooneſt, ſooner then prophane perſons, and how quickly are they withered? they are like the graſs upon the houſe top, that withereth before it groweth up.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It will be ſure to ſail a man when he hath moſt need of it; as in <hi>the hour of temptation, the hour of affliction, the hour of death, and the hour of judgement;</hi> in all theſe uſually it fails as a man, ſtanding him in no ſtead<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; as the brooks run in the winter when there is no need of them, but in Summer when the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller is ready to periſh for thirſt, then are they dryed up, in that place of <hi>Job:</hi> Like the Apples of <hi>Sodom;</hi> if a man come to touch them, would be refreſhed by them, they turn to duſt: <note place="margin">Job 6. 15.</note> poor creatures think they have faith until an hour of temptation or affliction; when they ſhould act it, then they have none: So they think they have love and bowels, but when an opportunity is offered, and they have moſt need of them, then they fail; like the houſe there in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. It was builded as fair to ſee to as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the wiſe mans houſe, and ſerved him while it ſhone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Tabernacle, but when once the ſtorms aroſe, the winds came, and the waves beat againſt it, alas it fell, and great was the <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 25.</note> fall thereof.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that which will ſet an edge upon all the former, is the ſad diſappointment of the hypocrite or formaliſt in all this, for his hope is cut off like a ſpiders web; there are two Pillars he leans upon, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> upon the Pillars in the houſe; the <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz:</hi> What are they, <hi>but the good things of this world, and life eternal;</hi> and alas, both fail him. For the good things of this life, they many times leave him; the mire and the water which made the Bull-ruſh to grow, they are dryed up, &amp; what is become of his hope then? he leans, laies hold on his houſe, and is loath to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let it go; but let him hold it as faſt as he can, yet down it <note place="margin">

Secondly, For things eternal, thoſe he expecteth, and is as high, until he be diſcovered to himſelf, in his expectation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Iſa. 29. 8.</note> as any other; but alas, he is but in a golden dream all this while, as an hungry man dreameth he eateth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Job 8. 14.</note> but a fancy, when he awakes he is never the fuller, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vexed ſo much the more, being diſappointed; for a man to have his hope cut off, is the greateſt cut in the world, nothing breaks the creatures heart more then this. O how great hope may a Miniſter be raiſed to, being an inſtrument in the hand of God to ſave others, that he alſo ſhall be ſaved; they themſelves have means to caſtout the Devil, and ſhall they go to the Devil? It is indeed the very emphaſis of damnation to be caſt down from <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 22.</note> ſuch a height of hope, to be ſo near to heaven in their hopes, and yet miſcarry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O, how ſhould this make us afraid of hypocriſie and formality, which is ready to creep upon us?</hi> how bitter a thing is it in the end to hypocrites, yea to the people of God in their way, when God opens their eyes to behold it in its colours? therefore let us be exhorted every one of us to take heed of it, leſt it be found in ſuch prevalency among us, as to denominate us hypocrites: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it brethren, If we be hypocrites, our duties will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to God, be they never ſo many, never ſo plauſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our hearts are not changed, which is a notable ſign of an hypocrite; he doth much duty, but never reacheth to a better heart, is not changed from glory to glory; but he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſinneth, and weepeth and ſinneth, getteth no ſtrength againſt corruption.</p>
                     <p>Again, an hypocrite, he will reſt and lean to his duties, he leans to his houſe, which is of his own building. Now truly Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, true grace where it is, if we ſhould lean to it inſtead of Chriſt, it would not ſtand, much leſs a counterfeit; the believer he reſts upon God alone, his preſence in the Valley of the ſhadow <note place="margin">Pſal. 23. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>And laſtly, how much comfort is here to a poor child of God, though it may be he flouriſh not ſo, and have not ſuch a glorious ſhew and formality, ſuch a compleat form of godlineſs as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea his own conſcience beareth him witneſs before the Lord, that his heart is right before him, and he hath a power of grace
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115245:200"/>
upon his heart, to ſubdue that to the Lord. Surely brethren, it is much rather to be choſe; a little ſpring, then a great ſwelling torrent, for there is a living principle, it will continue and hold out, it will not dry up in the day of drought and diſappoint our hopes, but as great Rivers in their heads are ſmall ſtreams many times, ſo here it will increaſe and grow from one degree to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to a place of broad Rivers, until it empty it ſelf into that fulneſs, and ſo of glory to all eternity: Look to the truth of it Brethren, if there be oyl in the veſſels; you ſee the wiſe Virgins, though they had their Lamps to trim, yet they were not gone out; but ſo much ſhall ſerve for this Doctrine.</p>

                     <p>For the firſt, <hi>That they may long lie hid from themſelves;</hi> this is plain from the Parable, for how long did the fooliſh Virgins walk with the wiſe, and thought their penny as good ſilver as theirs all this while? but they were aſleep; they had good thoughts of <note place="margin">Pſal 30. 7.</note> their condition, elſe they would have had little lift to ſleep; the wiſe Virgins would hardly have ſlept if they had not had ſome aſſurance, <hi>their mountain had not been made ſtrong by the favour of God;</hi> and the fooliſh, as fooliſh as they are, would hardly have ſlept, if they had not had a good opinion of their conditions: If their conſciences had been awaked, and their worm gnawing; could they have ſlept if they had ſeen their danger, now to have their portions with hypocrites, being ſuch themſelves?

                     <p>Now the grounds of this may be ſuch as theſe, in a word or two.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>The depth of our own hearts;</hi> hypocriſie, of all other works of darkneſs, <hi>hateth the light,</hi> and therefore if there be any more deep and remote corner of the heart then another, there it lurks. <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 19.</note> O ſaith the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>the heart of man is deceitful above all</hi>

It is great cunning to deceive others, but if that cunning be yet out-witted, and be deceived by it ſelf, this is more. Yea, I will ſay it Brethren; with a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, that if any thing in the world could lie hid from God himſelf, it would be the cunning heart of a ſinner: If there be more difficulty, or could be, in Gods diſcerning one thing then another, here it would be, and therefore his knowledge of the heart, is ſet forth by a <hi>ſearching</hi> of it; indeed he knoweth all things, but after the manner of men he ſpeaks; if
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115245:201"/>
men cannot eaſily find a thing, it lies hid in the darkneſs, in ſome corner; then they muſt ſearch, as ſearching for the loſt groat; or elſe if they would find out any thing to perfection, then they ſearch: So here it noteth the perfection of Gods knowledge of the heart, and withall the difficulty of the finding out the heart, though not to himſelf; yet after the manner of men, if any thing were difficult to God, this would be. <hi>If any man ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, his Religion is in</hi>

And that is the reaſon ſurely, that Antichriſt, that firſt-born of the Devil, by might and main keepeth his Proſelytes in the dark, takes away the Key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from them; he knoweth if once the light ſhould break in upon them, it is very great hazard but they would break out from him, from that bondage and ſlaverie that they are in to him; therefore Satan will be exceeding induſtrious, and how will he fill a poor creatures heart with falſe reaſonings concerning his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? O if there be any ſtirring or conviction at any time, how doth he labour to lick them whole again, to make up the breach the Word hath made in their conſciences, himſelf will turn Preacher and pretend to the tongue of the Learned to ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon, and put on the garb of an Angel of light, and preach <hi>peace, peace;</hi> O he is a cunning dauber, ſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our hearts on his ſide, and therefore as ready to be beguiled, as he is to deceive us.</p>

As when men ſhall ſeem moſt ſelf-denying for Chriſt, or forgo all, and give away all they have to the poor, as if they would become <hi>mendicants</hi> indeed, this is very much, and yet they might do this, <hi>give all to the poor, and give their body to be</hi>

                     <p>And they do from hence deceive themſelves. Such as will run <note place="margin">Jam 1. 22.</note> from Sermon to Sermon, and with much ſeeming delight hear the word of God, are affected, moved; but they do it not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving themſelves with a paralogiſm, a falſe reaſoning, for they are ready to conclude, O ſurel ſhould not have ſuch a deſire to be up early and ſeeking after Chriſt, as they think, though indeed they ſeek him not, nor his face, but ſomewhat elſe in the Word; they ſhould not delight in approaching to God, as you have heard, if there were not theroot of the matter in us; but they look not at the doing of the Word, the main thing, and therefore <note place="margin">Iſa. 58.</note> they delude themſelves with this ſelf-reaſoning. So the fool build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his houſe upon the ſand from the foundation upward, they are as like one another as can be, and as likely to ſtand out a ſtorm, and therefore they reaſon from hence, ſurely they ſhall hold out; if the wiſe mans hope will ſhelter him, theirs will ſhelter them. But alas, here is a paralogiſm, they look not at the different foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, the one upon the rock, the other upon the ſands; the one receiving Jeſus Chriſt, but as Jeſus it may be; the other as Jeſus and Lord: the event ſheweth, that a deceived heart was their undoing.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Becauſe alas, <hi>the hypocrite uſually is not much in ſearching of himſelf.</hi> Surely, if Gods knowledge of the heart be ſet forth to us as a ſearching of it, it will imply ſo much; we ſhould ſearch our hearts, elſe we ſhall never know them, for he

ſpeaks after the manner of men, with a ſpecial reſpect to the heart-knowledge; there they ſearch as men do for hid treaſures, for what they would find, and lyeth ſecret. A cunning cheat looks like an honeſt man, until he be ſearched into, and throughly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>ed, a ſlight examination will not find him out; and ſo truly will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a rotten heart go for an honeſt and good heart, until there be a ſearch: Hypocrites are like Sepulchres, which appear not; they are fair and beautiful, being painted without, but it appears not <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 27.</note> what they are within; if you would ſee what a Sepulchre is indeed, you muſt break it up, and down into it with a Candle, &amp; ſearch it out; there you ſhall find loathſom rottenneſs, &amp; dead mens bones. Now I ſay, an hypoerite oridinarily is not diligent in this work, and therefore his heart deceiveth himſelf, and this ariſeth from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral grounds. Haply, 1. He is too ſloathful, he is not one of the diligent laborious Chriſtians that will take pains in this work. If an overly view of mens hearts would do, every one would ſearch, but to rifle every corner of their hearts, and when the heart turns the back <hi>tergiverſatur,</hi> is loath to anſwer to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which are put to it, but flings an hundred waies up and down, and no hold of it at all; now in ſuch a caſe he is a diligent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an indeed that will not be baſtled, but will urge it home upon the heart, and will have an anſwer better or worſe; and thus from time to time an hypocrite will hardly take pains in this great work; and therefore no marvel if his heart deceive him, and he be hid form himſelf. 2. Haply, he is confident of himſelf, as in the place of <hi>Job;</hi> and who almoſt are men of more flouriſhing hopes then the hypocrites? were there any deadly doubt of their <note place="margin">Job 8. 15.</note> condition, then the Phariſees; and yet were there any more rotten then they were? they thought if there were any men ſhould go to heaven, they were the men; men of ſuch knowledge as they were, and ſuch duties and ſtrict lives as they were, was it poſſible they ſhould miſcarry; and you ſee how bold they are to plead it at the laſt day, as in that 7. of <hi>Matth.</hi> Now that which a man thinketh he hath already, or thinketh he is ſure of, he will not trouble himſelf to enquire after it, it is but needleſs labour: If a man be ſure, as he thinketh, he hath his groat, he will not light a Candle and ſeek it. 3. Becauſe haply they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſome of them miſgivings of heart; ſometimes hypocrites may, and therefore they may be loath to come to ſearch, they
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115245:202"/>
ſuſpect themſelves, ſome do, and yet not ſo ſtrongly, but that they have a falſe hope to ballance their fear, and to prevail. A Bankrupt, he that ſuſpects it, hath no mind to caſt up his accounts, he had rather do any thing; they may, I ſay, ſome of them lave ſuch miſgivings, which though they be not ſo clear as to amount to a knowledge condition, and to put them on to a recovery out of it; yet they may be enough to make them loath to ſearch. A man is loath to ſearch his coyn, he ſuſpects he ſhall find many bad pieces there, and haply thereby prove himſelf but a beggar; finding all braſs inſtead of gold. A man is loath to take up the grave-ſtone, he may ſuſpect what he ſhall find within, which he is not very willing to ſee it may be, nor to endure the ſtench of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleaſeth himſelf with the paint and outward beauty of it, and therefore no marvel if it be hid from his eyes.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>It is a righteous hand of God upon hypocrites,</hi> they are even paid in their own coyn; that ſince they have deceived others with fair ſhews and pretences, and endeavoured, as I may ſay, to deceive the Lord himſelf, that they ſhould deceive their own ſouls, and ſhould be hid from themſelves; that they may go on the more ſecurely, until they ſee by woful experience, that they are tumbled into the pit. And ſurely this was one of the things which were hid from <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> eyes, <hi>the things which belonged to her peace;</hi> the firſt, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

O it is a fearful hand of God brethren, when he giveth them up to blindneſs of mind, ſo that they ſhall diſcern nothing which concerneth them, and ſo not know their own conditions: if the Lord hide, who can find? as if he ſearch, who can be concealed? But ſo much for this firſt thing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>At laſt he ſhall be diſcovered to himſelf:</hi> He ſhall ſee himſelf to be but an hypocrite, this is many times ſo. I mean not only in hell, mens eyes ſhall be opened, but at death, or before
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:115245:203"/>
death many times the hypocrites eyes are opened to ſee himſelf what he is. It is true, ſometimes he may go down in peace to the grave, ſuch a peace as Satan, and an hard heart and ſeared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience gives; but yet you ſee here in this Parable, that before the coming of the Bridegroom, they ſaw their Lamps were gone out, and that they wanted oyl, the great work, the grace in the heart, which before they cared not for. I will not preſs it too far, and ſay, that becauſe all the fooliſh Virgins here ſee that their Lamps were gone out, therefore all hypocrites and formal profeſſors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their death, are diſcovered to themſelves as well as to others, that they are but hypocrites, but it is ſo many times, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; ſurely elſe I know not what can be the meaning of this part of the Parable; was it not ſo with <hi>Judas?</hi> was it not diſcovered to him when he was detected, and his conſcience ſo wounded that he could not but go and proclaim himſelf a wretch, a traytor to his Maſter before all the Court? if he were ſo blinded before, by luſt, by covetouſneſs, as not to ſee what he did, yet now his eyes were opened, he ſaw what his condition was; and the terrour of it was ſuch, that he went and hanged himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But how and when doth the Lord diſcover hypocrites to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi> Why truly brethren, haply in <hi>the hour of affliction,</hi> then the Alchymie gold being not able to endure the ſeventh fire, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelf what it is; ſo the hypocrite, <hi>will he pray alway?</hi> Or in the general, by any other means whereby the Lord blaſts their profeſſion, and maketh it wither, then they come to ſee it was but a gourd, under whoſe ſhadow they delighted themſelves; ſo you ſee God doth blaſt their profeſſion. Here it was not until their Lamps were gone out that they ſaw it, that they wanted oyl; while they could ſparkle &amp; walk in the light of their own ſparks, &amp; think all is well with them; while they can maintain their profeſſion, and keep up duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> haply, they ſee not the hypocriſie lies hid under thoſe broad leaves, but when they wither, &amp; they become as trees twice dead, then haply they come to ſee it. Not that alway thoſe whoſe profeſſions wither, do ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelvs to be hypocrites neither, for they may turn down right prophane, as many poor creatures have done, and returned <hi>with the ſwine waſhed, to the wallowing in</hi>

ſomewhat of a preſence of God, and now they have none, <hi>now their leaf fals;</hi> now as <hi>Saul,</hi> they have no anſwer from God, <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 19.</note> neither by Viſion nor Prophet, and now they ſee the woful caſe <note place="margin">1 Sam 28. 6.</note> they are in; now they are pluckt, as I may ſay, of their plumes, their nakedneſs appears. Not that a child of God may not want his preſence, and a great while too, but there is then a ſickneſs of love for him, a mourning after him ordinarily, or a ſad complaint that they cannot mourn after him; but an hypocrite, he findeth a want of the former preſence, and his heart is little or nothing troubled for it, he is contented to let it go.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It may be ſometimes <hi>without any ſuch affliction;</hi> yet the Lord may diſcover to an hypocrite that he is no better, that he is rotten at the heart; though the guilt wear not away, yet he can ſhew the ſoul that it is but Alchymie; though the paint of the Sepulchre continue, and be not waſhed away, he can ſhew a man that he is an Hypocrite; not but that a Child of God may think himſelf an Hypocrite, ſometimes under temptation, but he is not ſo; but when God revealeth it to the ſoul, he ſetteth it on with an evidence indeed that it is ſo.</p>
                     <p>But why doth the Lord then diſcover Hypocrites before the day of the diſcovery of all things? why truly it is,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That they might have a taſte of that bitter Cup which they are to drink the dregs of to all eternity;</hi> the Hypocrites Cup, if any be more deep then other, this is it; and if any more deadly dregs in it, this is it.

Indeed of all ſins, God hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That they might be warnings to others for ever, to take heed of Hypocriſie;</hi> for when men that regard the work of the Lord, and conſider the operation of his hand, ſhall behold a <hi>Judas</hi> hanged up in Gibbets, being made a <hi>Magor Miſſabeb</hi> to himſelf; doth it not preach aloud this Caution, to take heed, and beware of hypocriſie? <hi>theſe things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>were</hi>

O take heed of rottenneſs at the root, for all our fruit will give <note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 24.</note> up as the duſt, as the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> we ſhall wither and come to nothing, and go out like a ſnuff, as well as them, if we be not ſound at the heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It may be a ſtumbling block to ſome others, who are ready to receive any prejudice againſt the ways of Chriſt, and therefore they ſhall have a block to ſtumble upon.</hi> O here you ſee what becometh of this preciſeneſs and flouriſhing profeſſion of Religion, it is all but rotteneſs at the root, it is better to take on fair and ſoftly; a ſoft pace in religion, ſaith the Moraliſt, or civil, honeſt Man; as good continue in a meer wallowing, as being waſhed, to enter into it again; yea better, ſaith the profane man, and therefore he ſatisfieth himſelf in his carnal ſtate, which is woſul; for ſuppoſe ſome profeſſors wither, yet do all? Some, they keep their leaf, it ſhall never fail; ſome loſe their verdour, but recover it again; and what if ſome wither? will you therefore <hi>offend againſt the generation of the upright?</hi> ſaying, they are all of the ſame ſtamp. God forbid. It is a ſad thing, to conſider how many poor hearts are hardened in ſin upon this

very account, which addeth to the Hypocrites doom; but what if a diſcovered Hypocrite be ſo vile, the condition ſo dangerous? is not their own as dangerous? if thou be prophane, and a worker of iniquity, there is no more entrance into glory for a Dog or Swine, then for a Goat; no more for workers of iniquity, that profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commit iniquity, then for them who profeſs longer, do much in his name, and yet when all cometh to all, they are found but workers of iniquity, though ſecretly; but ſo much for the ſecond. <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 22.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third and laſt thing conſiderable in the Obſervation, is, <hi>That many times it is too late, when Hypocrites are diſcovered to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>themſelves;</hi> this is plain in the Parable; for the fooliſh Virgins all the time of the getting oyl in their veſſels, they complain not, not ſee their want of it, nor the going out of their Lamps, but only when it was too late; for before they could get it, the gates were ſhut.</p>
                     <p>We muſt not here underſtand it generally of all Hypocrites, as if none might be diſcovered to themſelves, while there is hope, and ſo as to recover themſelves; for then it would follow, they ſhould none of them be pardoned; <hi>for the Lord Jeſus is the Prince exalted to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins;</hi> Now if <note place="margin">Acts 5. 31.</note> they never come to know themſelves to be guilty of this great evil, even their hypocriſie, how ſhould they repent of it? and if they repent not of it, how ſhould it be pardoned? It is true indeed, there may be hypocriſie in a Child of God, which he may acknowledge only in the general among his ſecret ſins, which he knoweth not of; but I think, where hypocriſie is ſo raigning a ſin, as to denominate a man an Hypocrite, he muſt ſurely come to the knowledge of it, and acknowledge it before the Lord, or elſe how can he hope of pardon for it; now I ſay, there is pardon for all manner of ſins, only that againſt the Holy Ghoſt excepted; and therefore ſure, ſome Hypocrites God doth uncaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unmask, and rip up, and ſhew them the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their hearts, that they may mourn over them, and mourn after Jeſus Chriſt, and loath themſelves for it, and ſo be pardoned; therefore remember this, leſt if God ſhould come now, and open any painted ſepulchre, any rotten-hearted Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite among us, when we ſee our wound, we ſhould faint away; for though many times it is ſo, <hi>that God diſcovers it not to Hypocrites until it be too late,</hi> yet ſometimes he doth, and the

                        <hi>ſin</hi> in it ſelf is pardonable; therefore there is hope concerning this thing in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for the making good this aſſertion, conſider, either they are diſcovered not until judgement, or elſe not until death, or elſe not until <hi>their day of grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. If they be not diſcovered to themſelves until <hi>judgement,</hi> God never reproveth them of their hypocriſie, and ſets it in order with all its circumſtances, and aggravations, until the day of judgement, <hi>when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſplayed,</hi> and all the naſty corners of ſinners ſouls, all the hidden things of darkneſs, then ſurely you will all acknowledge there is no remedy; it is paſt help; there remaineth nothing then, <hi>but a fearful look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for of their doom;</hi> and ſome may go down in peace to the grave, (that is to ſay) not a peace of God, but of Satan; a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and ſtupidity of conſcience, knowing nothing of their fearful condition, which others alſo which are not ſo much as Hypocrites, may do.</p>

                        <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had her day, as you have it in that of <hi>Luke.</hi> Now this day may be conceived to be either revealed, ſo as that we may judge of it according to Scripture, or elſe ſecret, which God hath reſerved to himſelf. The revealed is uſually bounded by the time of a mans life, or the continuance of the means of Grace to a people at leaſt: all that while according to our eſtimation, Gods patience waiteth upon men, upon formal Profeſſors, to ſee, <note place="margin">Acts 1. 7.</note> if they will repent, and amend. Or elſe 2. There is a ſecret day which God hath kept in his own power, (that is to ſay) he reſolveth with himſelf; however, it may be the means of Grace may continue longer to a people, yet if they ſtand it out ſuch a time, ſo long, he will never make them available to their ſouls. So the Jews in that their day, <hi>O that thou hadſt known,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>in this thy day, but now they are hid;</hi> mind you, <hi>now</hi> they were hid, they ſhould never have a ſight of them; though they might have the means of Grace, the Goſpel preached to them yet longer, as they had, <hi>yet the things which belonged to their peace, were hid from their eyes.</hi> And ſo it may be with an Hypocrite, for ought I know, the Lord may open an Hypocrites eyes, convince him that he is an Hypocrite, and yet the time be paſt of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. So the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> you ſee their <hi>Lamps</hi> went out in obſcure darkneſs irrecoverably, though there ſeemeth by the Parable, to have been a further time before the judgement, a time wherein they did uſe ſome impertinent and improper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for their reſtoring; they went to the wiſe Virgins, and them that ſold, of which afterward; not to Jeſus Chriſt that was hid from their eyes, or elſe if they did, it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; you ſee they miſſed their aim, and then brethren, one of theſe two things will be the effect of it. Either,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The heart will ſink and die within them through ſome deſpair;</hi> either when God hath opened this wound in their Conſciences, they will die of it; their life, and ſouls will go out at the wound, as you ſee in <hi>Judas</hi>'s caſe; he could not ſo much as look to Jeſus Chriſt, that he might be ſaved; but his heart was ſunk within
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115245:206"/>
him, when he ſaw how he had played the wretch with Jeſus Chriſt, ſelling his Saviour for ſo ſmall a price, when he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo much love to, and to value him at a ſo low a rate. Or elſe,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The heart will grow deſperately hard, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſeared afterward,</hi> that it will be paſt feeling, and ſo commit all iniquity with greedineſs; and yet with a brazen face, and with the higheſt confidence, come, and cry, Lord, Lord, open to us, as it is here in the Parable, and in the ſeventh of <hi>Matthew;</hi> after a thaw, it will freez harder again, and then Conſcience will be covered with a ſtone, as it ſaid in <hi>Job.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſurely brethren, the reaſon is plain, why the Lord doth not ordinarily diſcover Hypocrites in his Church until it be too late; <hi>for a juſt recompence of their hypocriſie;</hi> his ſoul abhorreth hypocriſie more then any thing; their Sacrifices, and ſolemn meetings are an abomination to him, he is even weary to bear <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.</note> them; why? becauſe they drew near him with their mouths, honoured him with their lips, but the heart was wanting; that which God looks at as all in all, in our ſervices; and therefore they were like dead carkaſſes, however garniſhed with many, pretty, ſweet flowers, <hi>common gifs,</hi> and very taking manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of them, yet they are but dead Carkaſſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he abhorrs them; and therefore no marvel, if he ſeal up men under ſuch a Condition until it be too late. The Lord intendeth not mercy to ſuch a ſoul, ſuch a people, though their own hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and iniquity intervene as the immediate cauſe of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this purpoſe, and therefore it is, that he letteth them walk in their own ſparks, the light of them pleaſe themſelves with their Lamps, their profeſſion, until they have trifled away the ſeaſon of grace: A ſad conſideration for Hypocrrites.</p>
                     <p>For Application of this; <hi>Then it may ſerve in the firſt place for a ſtartling word to all formal Profeſſors;</hi> the Lord make it an <note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> awakening word. I doubt I ſpeak to many ſleepy ſouls; our voice is not loud enough to pierce the ear in the heart, and therefore, O that he would do it. Brethren, if I ſeem unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to you, it is my love to your ſouls, it is for your ſakes, elſe I have no ſuch delight to ſpeak things ſo cutting and wounding as theſe are, I fear brethren, in ſuch a multitude of Profeſſors, that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115245:206"/>
many of us have no more but a form of Godlineſs, and many of us not ſo much; but I ſpeak not ſo much to them. You ſee that five of them were fooliſh, and they had nothing but Lamps, a Profeſſion; I cannot conclude from the equality of number, that there are as many wiſe as fooliſh, or no more fooliſh then wiſe; but many fooliſh there are, that we may conclude, and yet we expound it according to the Analogy of faith, they are more by many then the wiſe. You may then brethren, be very confident of your eſtate, reſt as ſecurely as if you had the greateſt aſſurance of your Condition; the fooliſh Virgins ſlept as ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the other, ſuſpected their Conditions no more then the other, nor ſo much neither in all probability. You think, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that becauſe you conform to Gods Ordinances, you have ſome knowledge, and there is the light of the Lamp, though it may be but little, a Glow-worm, or the Moon, no heat in it, no affections to Jeſu; Chriſt, you never felt your hearts burn within you when he converſed with you: never knew what it was to be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now I pray you brethren, you that are ſo confident of the goodneſs of your condition, in the midſt of all your Sabbaths you keep, and duties you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, have you ever found ſuch a heart, yea or no? O that the Lord would awaken you: yea, are there not ſome that ground their confidence upon their own ſecurity, becauſe they never doubted, never ſuſpected themſelves; they can bleſs God for it,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115245:207"/>
they have alway had a good heart towards God, and they never had cauſe to ſuſpect their hearts and affections towards him, and ſhall they begin now? Brethren, let me tell you, this is a truth in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that a notorious Hypocrite may go on long, and never queſtion his condition; yea, it is rather the ſign of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, that he never did queſtion his condition. Was <hi>Judas</hi> ever the better for his backwardneſs to queſtion his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe he was the laſt that we read, put the queſtion, <hi>Lord, Is it I?</hi> Surely no, he was a <hi>Judas:</hi> the Lord pitty you, for you know not the danger you are in, poor, confident, ſecure Creatures; You may take your ſelves to be ſweet Chriſtians, and yet be in the gall of bitterneſs, and the bond of iniquity; your Lamps may burn long, and yet no oyl in the veſſel, and at laſt go out; and then you will cry out with the fooliſh Virgins, alas, our Lamps are gone out, our profeſſion is gone, it will ſtand us in no ſtead now.</p>

Is there any man that ſuſpects his eſtate, that will think much of his pains, to ſpend day after day, and time after time, to ſearch into it, and if it be poſsible, to ſecure it? Why what account do we make of our ſouls, brethren, that we can be ſo wretchedly careleſs of them? do you believe you have ſouls? do you believe they are immortal? do you believe it brethren, that they ſhall live for ever in the enjoyment of God, or elſe in unexpreſsible miſery? do you believe, brethren,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115245:207"/>
that hypocrites ſhall have the deepeſt damnation? And do you ſuſpect your ſelves to be hypocrites? and yet will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be at a little pains with your deceitful hearts? yea, much pains and often, to ſecure the eternal welfare of your poor, and yet precious ſouls?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Suppoſe you do ſupect your ſelves to be hypocrites, how do you make a ſhift to quiet your conſciences? do they not trouble you? are your hearts ſo deſperately heardned that you have no diſquietneſs ſeizing upon you? can you enjoy your ſelves? I believe you muſt needs then ſometimes have a terrible apprehenſion of wrath approaching, why will you not ſearch? It may be you may find your condition better then you expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo may live more comfortably and ſweetly then now you can; while you have ſuch a ſuſpition of your ſelves, your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be ſafe, but cannot be comfortable, and you cannot be ſatisfied without this comfort in reſpect of your outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Is that ſo great in your eyes and this ſo little? O for ſin and ſhame let us ſet a higher value upon theſe things, be more afraid of loſing our ſouls, then of loſing the world.</p>
                     <p>But then ſee if thou be confident of thy condition; either this confidence is well grounded or groundleſs, and whether ſoever it be, there is great need of ſearching ſtill. If well grounded, Brethren, yet we muſt know that the renewed ſearching and diſcovery of the ſoundneſs of our confidence, and the truth of our condition, is that which will renew our joy in the Lord; our thankfulneſs to him, for the impreſſions of theſe things upon our hearts, they are apt to wear away with time, and therefore if we would keep them freſh upon our hearts, the ſweetneſs and ſafety of our condition, that our hearts may be more enlarged toward the Lord; then we muſt be often peruſing our evidences, and the grounds of our confidence.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, alas Brethren, how much doth daily intervene, which is enough to darken and cloud all; if we do neglect this great work of ſearching, it may be within a while our hearts will be ſo over-grown with weeds, that we ſhall not diſcern the root of the matter within us; ſo much aſhes, that we ſhall ſcarce find the fire; O therefore keep up this inward difficult differencing duty of a diligent impartial ſearch and trial of our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>And then if we be confident upon no good ground, we had

moſt need of all to ſearch; yea, and how ſhall we come to know the grounds whereupon we are confident to diſcern them clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, except we ſearch? it may be thou maiſt upon the ſearch find, that thy condition is dangerous, thou art but a Formaliſt; is it not better then that thou ſhouldſt know it, then be ignorant of it? is not the knowledge of the diſeaſe half the cure, if it be cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? is it not better to diſeaſe thy ſelf a little now, then to go to hell in a golden dream?</p>
                     <p>Again, the time muſt come that thou muſt know it, when it is remedileſs, if thou know it not; there is nothing hid that ſhall not be revealed; do not think your Figleaves will always hold before the everlaſting burnings they will quickly ſcorch and burn, and then your nakedneſs and ſhame and confuſion ſhall ſwallow you up. s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

I deny not but a child of God may come in an hour of temptation to misjudge his condition, and miſtake himſelf for an hypocrite, when his heart may be ſound towards God; but if once ſound, <hi>for ever ſound;</hi> thou never wilt loſe it again, only be ſure thou run not away with miſtakes concerning thy ſelf.</p>

                     <p>4. Another Conſideration will be this; it is ſo neceſſary a thing, as that all things elſe will but help to ſink us, all is vain without it, our Priviledges will ſink us, our outward mercies, or Church mercies, and Goſpel mercies will but ſink us ſo much the lower, as you heard well lately.

                     <p>5. It is that which will not alway be to be had, and therefore to delay is very great folly; indeed if it were a thing of no value, a thing that men might not miſcarry in, though they go without it, it were not ſo much matter: or yet, though it were a thing ſo abſolute neceſſary, if they might have it when they would, or had their wills at their command, that it were alway to be had, a man were not to be ſo deeply condemned for his neglect, but ſo it is brethren the Market is not alway; He that in one place ſaith, <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth come,</hi> ſaith in another <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 1.

And therefore be of good courage, if he have given thee a heart now at laſt to look after him; and though thou lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geredſt with <hi>Lot,</hi> until God was even fain to pull thee out of the burning, the everlaſting burnings; thou haſte ſo much the more cauſe to magnifie the grace of Chriſt toward thee, that he would after ſo much abuſe of the day of grace, look upon thee at all, and when thou wert as a dry ſtick, no ſtrength nor vigour to ſerve him at all; therefore God could have no eye at thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nor any thing thou wert like to do, but meerly to exalt his grace, and therefore for ever thou maiſt more eaſily <hi>Conquer</hi> over-that temptation of reſting in any thing in thy ſelf, priding thy ſelf in any thing of thine own, and give him the glory of all, in an humble walking before him.</p>

how far we may urge this, I cannot tell, but me thinks we do not put it too far, if we may ſtand upon it at all; Whether they would now at laſt, being ſenſible of their want of the oyl in the veſſel, the grace in the heart, they would have ſome of that oyl which they had in their veſſels; or whether only ſomewhat to make their Lamps burn as they did before, it appears not, nor yet what their higheſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>They take not the right means for the accompliſhing that end, and therefore they are fooliſh; for wherein doth folly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt elſe but chiefly in this; they find not out or uſe not the right means, for the attaining of a right end. Now was this a right means, to go to the creature, to the wiſe Virgins for oyl? <hi>Give us of your oyl;</hi> this argues either deſperate ignorance, that they knew <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 16.</note> not whither to go to get oyl, that they were ignorant of the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the fulneſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt, from which fulneſs his people receive grace for grace; and ſuch blindneſs as this to be in men that profeſs Chriſtianity, it is very ſtrange, and argues great ſtupidity and folly; or elſe if they did know it, they had no heart to go to him, they would not; if they could get it otherwiſe well and good, and bring oyl to him, they had hope of acceptance, but they would have none from him, and this would argue a worſe kind of blindneſs: But of theſe things we will not ſpend our conjectures, nor in ſuch uncertainties. Whatever the caſe is, ſure it is, that they went not to him, but to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their oyl; from the Sun to the beam, from the fountain <note place="margin">

in the hour of their neceſſity? I know not what ſome of them may do, and ſome others I believe may be wiſer in this thing, but ſurely many poor creatures are led away with this wicked error; I cannot call it better.

It may ſerve to reprove many among our ſelves, that put off all the work which concerneth their ſouls; live as if they cared not for God, nor regarded him at all; the people of God, and Miniſters of Chriſt are the object of their ſcorn or diſregard, they ſleight them above others; but when an hour of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cometh, O then, when they are ready to dye, the Miniſter muſt be ſent for, and he muſt ſpeak a word of comfort, right or wrong; they are ready to think, I doubt, that as much is in it, as in a Popiſh Abſolution, according to their conceit then, as if it were in their power, or they were in Chriſt's ſtead to give them grace; they hang much of their confidence upon them: This is juſt like the fooliſh Virgins. Brethren, the Lord deliver poor ſouls from ſuch an end as God made with them, as you have it in the Parable here. It is the way indeed to ſtop our mouths, to hang too much upon any creature.</p>

                        <hi>power that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead,</hi> that muſt raiſe a dead ſoul to believe in Jeſus Chriſt. When <hi>Rachel</hi> would have of <hi>Jacob</hi> that which was beyond his power to give, he ſaith, <hi>Am I</hi>

                        <hi>in Gods ſtead, that I ſhould give thee children?</hi> So may the people of God and Miniſters ſay to ſome ſometimes, who come to them as if they could give them peace or comfort, and expect that as ſoon as ever they ſpeak a word, preſently all their doubts and fears ſhould be quelled and ſubdued; <hi>no, no,</hi> it is too heavy a weight you lay upon them; it is a thing above their reach. This the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If they were able to do it, <hi>they have no authority, no commiſſion to do it,</hi> and therefore they may not do it; Jeſus Chriſt <note place="margin">Iſa. 61.</note> was annointed for this very end, to do the thing, <hi>I come to do thy will O God,</hi> in the 40. <hi>Pſal.</hi> and what is that will? <hi>Why, that none that the Father hath given him ſhould be loſt or periſh, but his blood and Spirit ſhould be given to them;</hi> grace and glory ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them; <hi>this is the will of God, even your Sanctification,</hi> and <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 3.</note> this will he came to do, it was that the Father deſigned him to;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115245:218"/>
to deliver his people from their ſins, therefore was the ſpirit poured out in ſuch a full meaſure, yea without meaſure upon the head of this our high-Prieſt, that it might run down to the very skirt of his garment, to the very loweſt Chriſtian that belongs unto him. It is not every member in the body, nor any other, but <note place="margin">Pſal. 123. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This the third.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If all theſe did concur in men, <hi>yet they might want a heart when all is done,</hi> and then all the reſt would avail little to us in our neceſſity; and though it be true, the Saints do retain bowels of mercy, and do put them on, and <hi>long-ſuffering and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Numb. 20. 10.</note> yet alas, how ſhort-noſtrilled are the beſt of the Saints, in compariſon of God: <hi>Moſes</hi> his patience was at an end, yet the weakeſt man, and had often interceded for them; yet ye Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, muſt we fetch water out of the rock for you? though the murmuring was not againſt him, but againſt God. If a ſinner put off getting grace and coming to Chriſt until the laſt, our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience will hardly hold out ſo long, <hi>let the power of my Lord be great, as thou haſt ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. herein our weakneſs doth much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we are ready to caſt off and give up men if they come not in quickly, and if afterward they do come in, we are ready to ſhut our hearts againſt them. But if there were a heart, yet there is no power, and that will anſwer all; therefore <hi>if we go to the creature for grace, we are like to have a denyal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before we apply this, or elſe as a part of the Application, ſhall be to ſpeak ſomewhat by way of ſatisfaction to a doubt.

To this I anſwer, the Saints may and ought to communicate their experiences to others, as their neceſſity requireth; <hi>the humble ſhall hear hereof and be glad;</hi> how? when his ſoul made <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 2.</note> her boaſt in God.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>For any merit of our works we cannot give,</hi> for indeed there is none at all.

                        <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 10.</note> but alas, how infinitely ſhort do we fail of what is commanded in many things; <hi>in all things we offend all,</hi> for who doth any thing as he ſhould? <hi>&amp; our ſufferings of this life are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the glory:</hi> there muſt be a proportion in merit, now they are light, that is weighty, they are for a moment, that is eternal, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>and a far more exceeding and eternal weight.</hi> Now no man can give that which he hath not.</p>

                     <p>For the Application; this reproveth then the Papiſts, who take <note place="margin">

                     <p>Do but conſider two or three things, wherein it may appear how much they are too blame in this reſpect.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They take upon them the office of Chriſt, intruding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe things which are above them; he inviteth, <hi>Come to me,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>and I will give you reſt; I counſel thee to buy of me wine and milk without money, or money worth.</hi> No, ſay they, come to us, to our treaſurie of merit, though they pretend to make the blood of Chriſt the <hi>ſubſtractum,</hi> the bottom of their treaſurie; which to me, maketh the matter ſo much the worſe, the abuſe of the name <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 17.</note> and blood of Jeſus Chriſt to ſo high a wickedneſs, as ſelling and buying pardons for money, being moſt abominable. Chriſt calls poor ſinners to him, and they call them to them, ſo that they uſurp the power and authority of Chriſt. Let them ſee to it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yea that which is given freely by Jeſus Chriſt, they would ſell for money; for money they would ſell pardons for never ſo many years to come; ſtrange prodigious fopperies are there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported concerning them; <hi>Without money, and without price;</hi> but <note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 1.</note> they will have money for their Pardons &amp; Indulgences: Was not this a Declaration infallable, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was in the gall of <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 18.</note> bitterneſs and bonds of iniquity, becauſe he would have bought the gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt for money; yea the power of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the gift of the Holy-Ghoſt to others, and is it not more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then; to buy or ſell the grace of God? that which is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Acts 8. 23.</note> for money; to pretend to it, for do it they cannot. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his great guilt was this, that he would have the power
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115245:219"/>
of giving the gift of the holy Ghoſt, as the Apoſtles had, that ſo he might make a rich trade of it, to ſell it to others, as he himſelf had bought it; and truly thoſe that will buy in ſuch caſes, will not ſtick to ſell: O how much more then are theſe men in the gall of bitterneſs, that ſhall ſell grace, ſell pardons, ſell merit for money! Surely the wiſe Virgins refuſing to give, would much more have abhorred this, to ſell the Gifts of the holy Ghoſt for money? What got <hi>Gehezi</hi> by making that which was <note place="margin">2 Kings 5. 25.</note> free, mercenary.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They wrong the Saints exceedingly,</hi> ſuch as were ſo indeed, whoſe merits they pretend to ſell; for if they were wiſe Virgins, they had none to ſell; if they were fooliſh, none can queſtion it, but they had none at all; and if they were wiſe, and had never ſo much, yet they had none to ſell, none to give. Surely God is not more tender of his Name in any thing, then in his Grace, not more tender of wrong any where, then here, and his people are not more tender, or ſhould not be more tender any where of wronging him, then here in his Grace. And therefore ſurely thoſe that are Saints indeed, will be little beholding, they ſhall have little thanks for their labour.</p>

If you go to men brethren, you are like to have a denial; the wiſe Virgins, they ſay they have it not to give; if any be ſo fooliſh and proud, as to think they have any to give you, and you ſo fooliſh as to believe them, alas you are but deluded; but the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> will neither deny you, nor delude you, you ſhall have, if you come to him, <hi>buy wine and milk,</hi> yea this <hi>oyl</hi> of grace, yea you ſhall have abundantly, <hi>he came that his people might have life abundantly; Eat and drink</hi>

If a man be never ſo earneſt, diligent and forward, zealous for God, though he ſerve the Lord inſtantly night and day, yet ſhall he have no grace <note place="margin">Acts 26. 7.</note> to ſpare. <hi>David</hi> was a man of ſtrong affections, as moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and as warm they were toward God, as ſtrong were his <note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 2.</note> deſires after him, and love to him, as will appear by his ſpiritual breathings, and was as much in following after God, and after grace; in ſo much that when he was debarred from the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,

and Ordinances, where he uſed to behold the goings of God, the way of God, his glorious power and grace; when ſhut out from theſe, how ſadly doth he take on? you may ſee then by the ſtir and diſquietneſs of his heart in the interruption, that he was ſtrongly bent to follow after Chriſt, and yet at the cloſe of all, had he any to ſpare? Yea, 3. Let a man continue ſo to the end, if it were poſſible, without any interruption in his growth, and yet he ſhall have no grace to ſpare; had the Apoſtle any to ſpare, who was a man labored as abundantly as any other? <hi>yea, more then they all, and yet he was nothing,</hi> and when all was done, <hi>he would be found in Chriſt, not having his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs upon him, he had not yet attained the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> But then, <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. For the opening of the Point, let us note this alſo; <hi>That though a Chriſtian may have more gifts of Grace then may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Salvation, yet he never hath more, eſpecially ſaving grace, then is needful.</hi> I mean he hath none to ſpare; a man indeed haply might ſpare ſome of his gifts, but none of his Grace; though it is true, whatever Talents the Lord beſtoweth to fit a man for his Condition, his place, he ſhould be anſwerable to the Lord, and ſo they are neceſſary to the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful carrying on of his Calling or Condition, yet to heaven they are not ſo neceſſary; but all the Grace a man hath, is neceſſary for him, ſo neceſſary, as he can ſpare none: eſpecially that Grace which is more particularly a mans own (if I may ſo call it) and that is, <hi>ſincerity and uprightneſs of heart;</hi> others do partake with us in the ſweet effects of the other Graces, of faith and love, &amp;c. but the ſincerity of all without the reſt, are nothing: this is more eſpecially our own, and who is there that could ever ſay, <hi>that he had ſo much uprightneſs of heart, that he could ſpare any of it?</hi> can a man ſpare any of his life? this is the life of Religion and Grace.</p>
                     <p>3. Another thing to make this out, will be this: <hi>The greateſt Grace where it is given, uſually hath the greateſt corruption to wreſtle with;</hi> a ſpring-tyde of Grace, a ſpring-tyde of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſtrong workings of the ſpirit, ſtrong luſtings, of the fleſh, and ſtrong temptations, ſuch as many of us never knew what they meant: ſo that a Child of God indeed that is proved, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he hath little enough for himſelf, though it may be God
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115245:221"/>
hath given him more then to many others; where ſin abounds, Grace abounds: may there not be temptations to exerciſe the ſtrongeſt Faith? Some <hi>Goliah-</hi>luſt, or another, which requireth all their faith, and humility, and patience, to encounter with it; we never turned Gods treaſuries of temptation, to know what he hath in ſtore for poor ſouls.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Let a Child of God have never ſo much Grace here, yet he</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>fals ſhort of the reſurrection of the dead;</hi> ſhort of that pitch which he ought to aim at. Indeed if men could reach this fulneſs of the meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt, and go beyond it, then there might be ſome thoughts of having ſomewhat to ſpare; but until then, we are alway on the wanting hand, ſure, alway under emptineſs. Now though ſome be ſo bold, as to plead for a perfection in our days, we ſee by a divine hand upon them, they are let looſe to all manner of wickedneſs, and except that were the perfection, I underſtand not what perfection they are capable of.</p>

When they have attained to the top and pitch, (brethren) yet alas, <hi>if God ſhould enter into judgement with us, we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to ſtand, as you have it;</hi> therefore the Apoſtle would <note place="margin">Pſal. 143. 2.</note> be found in him, when he had done all; ſurely then brethren, if when all is done, there is ſuch an imperfection, incompleatneſs, as to juſtification, and eternal life, that we muſt go out of all, deny all, as we have heard, then no man ſurely hath any grace to ſpare.</p>
                     <p>For the Application then, <hi>It is a reproving word to as many as</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>are ready to think they have enough.</hi> The Papiſts tell us of works of ſupererrogation, and I believe that piece of Popery may cleave to ſome of us faſter then we are aware; but let us take heed of it; when we begin to be ſo full, as we think we run over, and could ſpare any of what we have, and we may therefore ſit down and breath us. Believe it, this is the way to make the Cruſe of oyl give over running; as long as they had an <note place="margin">2 Kings 4. 5.</note> empty veſſel, the Cruſe ran, but when all were full, it gave over; God will not in vain pour out this precious oyl of his Spirit, to have it loſt upon proud Creatures, and bury the Glory of his Grace in an unthankful, proud heart. That Ancient could ſay, and likely by experience, <hi>Si dixiſti, ſufficit, periiſti;</hi> and may not many of us ſay ſo, did we ever get good by it? it
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115245:222"/>
is the ready way to go backward, to tumble to the bottom again, when we think we are got high enough, higher then this or that Chriſtian; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God reſiſts the proud, but he gives Grace</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>to the lowly.</hi> The Heathen could ſay, even <hi>Plato,</hi> that a proud man is void of God, without God, <hi>God is far from his thoughts,</hi> and he is far from the favour of God; and indeed ſo it is, God knoweth ſuch a man afar off, at a diſtance, he ſhall have no <note place="margin">Pſal. 138. 6.</note> cloſe familiar communion with God. Well, the Lord reprove us, as many as are guilty in this kind.</p>
                     <p>2. It may ſerve then, <hi>to preſs with the Apoſtle forward toward the mark of the prize,</hi> &amp;c. O how lazy are moſt Profeſſors! who <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13. 14.</note> walk as if they never cared whether they reach perfection, or the fulneſs of the meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt; as if we were unwilling to grow too like heaven, for fear we ſhould be taken from this earth ſooner then we are willing to depart. O what earthly, heavy, drowſie ſpirits have we! how ſlowly do we drive? What, is heaven nothing in our eye? the enjoyment of Jeſus Chriſt nothing to us, that we make no more haſte toward him? O then, as the <hi>Martyr</hi> ſaid, <hi>haſte after as faſt as we can;</hi> Take heed of ſuch a thought, <hi>you have been diligent long enough, you may now ſlack your pace, you are pretty well for one;</hi> believe it brethren, nothing will ſooner quench the ſpirit then this: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſooner damm up the fountain, and ſhut out the light; you can never have too much; It may be you have (through rich mercy) what carrieth you (in ſome meaſure) through your preſent condition, you know not what you ſhall meet with: believe it, before we die, we ſhall have exerciſe for every degree of our Grace, our Faith, our Love, we ſhall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over. It may be with thy meaſure, which is leſs, thou maiſt make a hard ſhift to get to heaven; but why ſhould we not all preſs after a more abundant entrance into Glory, which <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 11.</note> will be much more for the Glory of his Grace, and much more for the comfort of our ſouls? Well then, place that behind you brethren, which we have attained; as <hi>Jehu</hi> in his furions march cauſed the Meſſengers, as he reached them, to turn behind him ſtill, and ſo went on; let not our eying what Grace we have received, be any further then to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; take heed of poring on them to pride, for that is the way to decline; who knoweth how much one thought of pride doth caſt
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115245:222"/>
us behind hand, if the Lord take the advantage, <hi>for he reſiſteth the proud above all others;</hi> caſt them behind then, ſtay not, reſt not until we come to the reſurrection of the dead. And then,</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, It may be an encouragement to ſome poor trembling hearts, who it may be, when they hear this word, are ready to lament themſelves. If this be a truth, that they that have moſt grace, have none to ſpare; what a condition then are ſuch as I in, who have ſo little? If they have occaſion to uſe all, and little enough ſometimes: What will become of me, who have ſo little, like a grain of Muſtard-ſeed? If the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> have no ſtrength over much, but are ready to be blowed up by the roots, all they can do is but to ſtand to the utmoſt: <hi>What ſhall ſuch a bruiſed reed as I do in the contrary winds of temptation and corruption?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt then, <hi>do not judge amiſs of thy condition,</hi> thou thinkeſt ſuch a one is ſo &amp; ſo eminent for grace, an Oke of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> a Cedar; God judgeth not as man judgeth, thou mayſt have more <hi>humility,</hi> and more <hi>love</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt; there may be more ſincerity &amp; truth in the inward parts, in a poor creature, that hath little parts or gifts to make a glittering to dazle the eyes of men; Herein lies the ſtrength or weakneſs of the ſoul indeed; Look to this then, and gaze not ſo much upon glorious outward appearances.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Remember that thou are not accepted for the greatneſs of thy grace inherent.</hi> God doth not give his Spirit and ſuch graces, in a greater and a ſmaller meaſure to ſome then to others, and then accept accordingily; he accepteth in Jeſus Chriſt, and every poor believing ſoul doth enjoy whole Chriſt, his righteouſneſs fully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them: Therefore this is your acceptance, and herein you are alike, bleſſed be the Lord, that in this, which is the main thing, he maketh no difference between the ſtrong and the weak, though one man may more ſtrongly and clearly apply him, and have more of the comfort, yet thou mayſt with a trembling hand, hold him as ſurely; or rather he will hold thee, if thou canſt not hold him, for the imbraces are mutual between Chriſt and a poor believing ſoul.</p>
                     <p>3. If thou have not ſo much as another, thou ſhalt not likely have ſo great tryals, ſo great things to do with it, <hi>thou ſhalt not be tryed above what he will enable to bear, and he will make a way to eſcape alſo.</hi> If his grace be ſufficient for thee in all conditions,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115245:223"/>
what matter is it? only preſs hard after more and more, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou haſt reached too; and at laſt thou ſhalt attain the <hi>end of thy hope, the ſalvation of thy ſoul, and in due time thou ſhalt reap, if thou faint not.</hi>

Here is little ground for Papiſts to bottom their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>perſeverance</hi> to be attained by their own induſtrie and pains; for alway <hi>his</hi> price is not <hi>comprehended</hi> from <hi>being,</hi> if it be from God, from Jeſus Chriſt; it is alway excluded, <hi>Come buy without money, or without price,</hi> as before, except they purchaſe it of men.

                     <p>
                        <hi>That ſuch as trifle away the day of grace, and are not ſerious in the work of getting grace, the time ſhall come when they ſhall have</hi>

                        <hi>none to pitty their miſery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If men may expect pitty or compaſſion from any; it is either from the Lord, who is a God of bowels, and <hi>unſpeakable, unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able compaſsions:</hi> Or elſe from the people of God, who as the <note place="margin">Pſal. 86. 15.</note> children of God, do put on bowels of compaſsions, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>they are cloathod with bowels,</hi> ſo that their compaſſions are eminent, and to be ſeen by them that have to do with them; but <note place="margin">Col. 3. 12.</note> yet the time may come brethren, if you now neglect ſo great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is offered to you, held out by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf the Son of God, ſpeaking from heaven, not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, <hi>that you ſhall have no pitty from the Lord;</hi> no nor from his people: from God, that is <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 3.</note> plain. I will but name it, becauſe it may ſeem impertinent to the Text; yet if it ſerve to no other purpoſe, it may ſerve to ſhew us, that the Saints, if they do not pitty in ſome caſes, where it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the day of grace is paſt, and men have wretchedly ſinned it away, that they have the Lord for their pattern for it, therefore I mention it; <hi>Then ſhall they call, ſaith the Lord, and I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they ſhall cry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will mock when their fear cometh, and laugh at their calamity; Prov.</hi> 1. 26. It is ſpoken after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, and ſheweth the heavy aggravation of their miſery, that the Lord ſhall be ſo far from pittying them, that he ſhall laugh at them. So in the 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> where the Annointed of God is lifted up upon <hi>Zion,</hi> there are ſome that will not be bound, will not have him to reign over them, count it a bondage, and a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous one indeed, <hi>the Lord ſhall laugh at them, he ſhall have them</hi>

be pittied in ſuch a condition by them, but they may meet with nothing but a mock, though a holy one; and indeed there is need of much holineſs, and in act too, to mock and not to ſin; So here you ſee, and ſo the Prophet by a ſpirit of Propheſie, <hi>go and buy of them that ſell.</hi> But leſt this may ſeem to be ground enough to build it upon, becauſe it is of doubtful interpretation. therefore take another Scripture, where he ſpeaks of the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of perſecutors of the people of God, ſuch as <hi>Doeg</hi> was, and there is the like reaſon for hypocrites, when diſcovered undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and their Lamps gone out; as here, <hi>the righteous ſhall ſee it</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 52. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>and fear, and laugh at him;</hi> when God ſhould deſtroy him for ever, and pluck him out of his dwelling place, and root him out of the Land of the living, <hi>then the righteous ſhould ſee it, and laugh at him,</hi> have him in a holy deriſion; yet with an holy awe of that glorious and fearful God, who was ſo juſt in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon him.</p>
                     <p>And is it not juſt with God it ſhould be ſo, When ſuch hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites have in their hearts deſpiſed the <hi>long-ſuffering, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>

But now a man would have thought when this Lamp had gone out, and they ſaw their ſparks of their own kindling would not endure to eternal life, that then they ſhould have bethought themſelves of a <hi>higher</hi> born flame, a higher principle that would endure to get that oyl, and that fire from heaven that would aſpire, and never reſt until it reached heaven: my meaning is, that when they ſaw the profeſſion and form which they could by their induſtrie and parts work out of themſelves, went out and failed them, they ſhould have thought of going to a higher principle, but what do they do? they go to the creature you ſee, to the wiſe Virgins for oyl, &amp; there they have another repulſe; they had none to ſpare for them: By this a man would have thought they might have taken a hint, that ſure it is not to be had then from the creature, we muſt look higher; if any creature could furniſh us, <hi>tht wiſe Virgins,</hi> the Saints indeed could furniſh us; but we have knockt at their doors, and it is not to be had there. And do they now bethink themſelves of going to Chriſt? no, not at all. Let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered yet further, that they had a very ſharp blow, to rap their fingers off the creature, which a man would have thought ſhould

have made them afraid of ever laying hold upon an arm of fleſh again, for this Irony, or holy mock of them, <hi>go to them that ſell,</hi> if they underſtood it ſo, was a reproof as full of Vinegar as can be. As that of our Saviour, <hi>ſleep on, now,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>take your reſt; now they are at hand, let us go hence;</hi> they had little liſt to ſleep <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 45.</note> after ſuch a reproof as that: and yet we ſee theſe fooliſh Virgins are ſo ſtupid, that this mock of them, it beateth them not off at all, but to the Creature they go ſtill, to try whether there be any oyl to be had among them that ſell; the flatterers and merit-mongers, they think not of going to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And whence doth this appear brethren? but firſt, From our corrupt nature, which hath departed from the Lord, and is now ful of enmity to him, and is loth to return to him; ſo proud we are, that as long as we can find any thing in our ſelves, we will go no further; but when we ſee our own gourd is withered, our tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent is dried up, ſuch is the enmity of our wretched hearts to God in the way of his Grace, that we would go any whither for ſuccour rather then to God, to Chriſt; <hi>the Jews would not</hi>

                     <p n="2">2.

The Lord help us every one to look to it, for I intend not to ſtay upon this; either we are ſuch as ſeek our oyl of Jeſus Chriſt, we live by faith in him; or elſe we ſeek to the Creature, we hang our hopes upon ſomewhat elſe; if ſo, whatever it be that relieveth us in the time of our trouble on this ſide Jeſus Chriſt, this is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our whoredom; Now ſhall the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> find us in the very act of whoredom, playing the whore, in departing from him, and will this be peace or comfort to our ſouls?

Then when Chriſt is coming, the <hi>Bride-groom</hi> cometh; doth he not find many running then to a prayer, then to a Sacrament? if they can but have that, they think they are ſecure enough; poor ignorant creatures! what is this, but to go and buy of them that ſell, inſtead of going to Jeſus Chriſt? Well ſurely, as this will much concern him to find men ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing him, who is a Saviour to the utmoſt, to go any whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rather then to him; ſo will it be confuſion to your ſouls, if you be found in the very act; there will be no denying, no excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it; you will have nothing to ſay for your ſelves; therefore let us be warned to take heed of this.

                     <p>Two things I ſhall do before I come to the Application.

                     <p>Firſt then, <hi>a man is ready,</hi> or this is a part of it, <hi>when he hath gotten this oyl in his veſſel,</hi> without this no readineſs; though the fooliſh Virgins be awaked after their long profeſſion and falling aſleep; yet you ſee they are unready, and are all in a hurry, as people unready uſe to be; when the Bridegrom cometh, they are going to them that ſell, <hi>that they might buy oyl,</hi> therefore they were unready; my meaning is Brethren, untill a man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Lord the ſpirit of holineſs to dwell in him, to be a living <hi>Cruſe</hi> of oyl that never fails, to be a ſpring of grace in his ſoul, to water, and refreſh, and ſupply him in all his conditions, a man is not ready to enter. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>a choſen Veſſel,</hi> but though he: was a ſtrict man, (I pray you mind it Brethren) I doubt ſtricter then moſt of us, the ſtricteſt ſect of the Phariſees, and touching the Law blameleſs, at leaſt in the Phariſees ſenſe, in the outward obſervance of the Law, which is more then many can ſay. Well, now when the Lord meeteth him going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> If he had called for him out of the world, had he been ready <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> for him? ſurely no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> woful had been his condition: there muſt then

be a holineſs, without which there is no ſeeing God. This is one thing then, he that hath the root of the matter in him, the ſeed of God in him, he is ready in part, ſo far he is prepared.</p>
                     <p>2. There muſt be alſo the brightneſs ſhining, the activity of the <hi>graces,</hi> they muſt be in act, or ſtirred up and bettered before we can be ready, for the wiſe Virgins were not ready, though they had oyl in their veſſels, becauſe their Lamps were not trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, their oyl grew low, muſt be ſupplyed, therefore they go about that work in the firſt place; If Chriſt had come and given them no warning, but taken them ſleeping, they had been all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, therefore you ſhall find ſtill in Scripture, the graces of the Saints ſmell ſweeteſt, and be moſt lively uſually toward their latter end: When was <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or any of them more ſweet? <hi>they muſt ſtand with their loins girded and Lamps burning, elſe they are not ready altogether.</hi>

But withall, if we have him not on, and girded cloſe to us for righteouſneſs, we are not ready; if we have him on, but he ſitteth looſe upon us; therefore you ſhall find this was the main thing the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> minded and ſtrove after, <hi>that he might be found in Jeſus, not having his own righteouſneſs upon him,</hi> he ſpeaks of the day of death and appearing before him, the reſurrection, that he may be found then in Jeſus. When we have done all, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not all, we undo all again, this only will terminate the ſight of the Father, he will ſee through all other coverings whatſoever; therefore the Apoſtle prayeth that <hi>One ſiphorus may find mercy in</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>How uncertain this coming of Chriſt to you, to call for you, is?</hi> do you know when he will appear? do you know brethren, whether you ſhall be warned again, called upon again to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for his coming? this may be the Cry, it may be the Cry is paſt with many of you already: is it not high time to awake, to look about you, to conſider whether you be ready or no?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To conſider, That there will be then no time given to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare.</hi> If you be ready, well and good, you enter; if not, you are ſhut out, as afterward we ſhall ſpeak. O then, how can we ſatisfie our ſelves, and quiet our Conſciences with an ignorance, how it is with us? It is high time ſurely brethren, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Except we do enquire, we are not likely to take a courſe to make ready:</hi> he that thinketh he is ready, or careth not whether he be ready or no, if he be unready; now he is like to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, for ſuch a man will not ſet about the work. O that the Lord would therefore perſwade you this day to conſider with your ſelves, <hi>are you ready, or are you not?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>There is very great need of this enquiry, becauſe alas, many are ready, and think they are unready, and then cannot have the comfort of their Condition, except they come to ſee to it in ſome meaſure.</hi> 2.

                        <hi>to Glory?</hi> Ah dear friends, what mean our loathſom conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations then? what mean the vileneſs of our hearts, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and rottenneſs, and ſin that is there? are you mortified in any good meaſure, or no? It may be you have forſaken the pollutions of the world, but is the heart of ſin killed, hath it its deaths wound, out of which continually the life and ſpirits of ſin are emptying, are you weary of it? do you loath it, and your ſelves for its vileneſs? O do not deceive your ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Are your Graces lively?</hi> It may be thou haſt a ſpark, but it is buried in the aſhes. Indeed I doubt brethren, theſe times of proſperity to the Church, bury more Chriſtians alive, then any days that ever we ſaw: why now, are we ready? are our Lamps burning, our loins girded? O how active, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and lively are the Graces of the Spirit in ſome, over they are in others! you are ſo far unready for the coming of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo far it will be uncomfortable to you; beſides, <hi>do ye live by faith above all this for righteouſneſs,</hi> elſe we are not ready? Is this the top of all, <hi>that we might be found in him?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſearch and ſee, take heed, you have to do with deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked and deceitful hearts.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Are we ready for the abundant entrance?</hi> how few of us have this perſwaſion? our calling and election is not made ſure; we do not know what would become of us, if God ſhould
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115245:235"/>
call for us: how can his coming be comfortable to us? we are ſo far from waiting for his coming, that every thought of it goeth cold to our hearts; that which ſhould moſt warm us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh us. O brethren, let me beg of you for Jeſus ſake, no longer to ſlight this great and neceſſary work; give your hearts no reſt, until you ſee whether you be ready or no. Suppoſe you ſhall find your ſelves unready, it is better to know it in time, then when it is too late: now there is hope, if you be not ready, you may obtain mercy: you may make the more haſte to get ready, that that day may be a bleſſed, a comfortable day to your ſouls.</p>
                     <p>3. Then brethren, <hi>If we be not ready for his appearing, ſhall I</hi>

                        <hi>beg of you brethren, for Jeſus ſake, and for your poor ſouls ſake, that you would now reſolve whatever buſineſs be done, you would not leave this at ſix and ſevens.</hi> It is the one thing neceſſary you have to do: nothing will yield you a dram of comfort, nor arm your hearts againſt the fears of death, but this; nothing will give you entrance into Glory, but this. Indeed if riches would be an entrance, or he that keeps the doors, and openeth, and no man ſhutteth, could be bribed with the multitude of gold, it were ſomewhat for men to heap it up as the duſt, and raiment as the clay; if men were admitted according to their glorious apparrel, or if the riches of the head, and treaſuries of humane knowledge would do it, Scholars might do well to ſpend all their time in ſearching after that, and none, or little or none to make ready for the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt: but ſurely brethren, ſurely you will find, <hi>nothing will find an entrance, but readineſs for his coming.</hi> The Lord give you believing hearts this day: how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied are men for other things which are trifles, and will not profit, and not one hour in an hundred ſpent ſeriouſly with their own ſouls? And though ſome men have more time then others, yet ſurely brethren, he that is moſt buſie, muſt find time for this great work, or miſearry. O therefore labour, preſs hard after it, uſe all means poſſible, you muſt take pains brethren; ſuch unready hearts as we have, will not be had in readineſs without much and conſtant pains-taking: As a Garden that is quickly overgrown with weeds, it muſt be taken pains with again and again; ſo here, &amp;c. And ſo in keeping an houſe clean
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115245:235"/>
and ready, there muſt be pains taken with it. Ah brethren, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your ſouls follow hard after Chriſt, you will never find him to your comfort. The Lord touch your hearts, and then you ſhall find him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Again, you will ſay, Why I hope I am ready; Well then labour to maintain this readineſs.</hi> Alas, how ſoon is the ſweeteſt frame loſt? think not, I have now done the main work, therefore you may take more liberty then other men, now you may indulge your ſelves, take more eaſe, more liberty about the world, then other men. Alas brethren, how ſoon will the world, and cares of it overcharge you? how hard a thing is it <hi>to buy, as if you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed not, to uſe it, as if you uſed it not? and if you be overcharged</hi>

                        <hi>with the cares of the world, this day will overtake you at unawares.</hi> Yea, I tell you brethren, if that day take you at unawares, as I doubt, if it ſhould come at any day upon us, it would take many of us when we are overcharged: O eaſe your ſelves of ſome of your burthen, have no more to do then will give you leave to maintain your communion with God, and make ſure of the main thing, <hi>to get your ſouls ready, and keep them ready for the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> O that we would be perſwaded to this end, to have every day ſome converſe with this his coming, and to labour to work the thought of it upon our hearts, that accordingly we may be affected with it, as we find our ſelves ready or unready, and ſo be carried out to make proviſion for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And how ſhould we willingly ſubmit to any dealings of God with us, that tend to make us ready.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle would have them <hi>count it all joy, when they fell into many temptations or</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iames 1. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>trials;</hi> this is the knocking of the torch, this is the ſnuffers which muſt take off the wick of our Lamps, and ſo trim them up; we ſhall find one day, we have more cauſe to be thankful for our afflictions, if ſanctified, then for the contrary diſpenſation: I do verily think there is nothing here below helpeth us forward more. And labour to ſee all working together for this great end, that we may be found ready at the appearing of the Lord Jeſus. And labour for a readineſs, for an <hi>abundant entrance into Glory.</hi> As the Apoſtle exhorts them.</p>
                     <p>And though at preſent thou canſt not find thou art ready, be not diſcouraged, for thou mayſt be ready in a good part, and for

the main, and yet not know that thou art ready: only ſtick not here, let not fear ſo overcharge thee, as to hinder thee, and weaken thy hands, but make it thy work with thy whole might, <hi>to make ready for his coming, pray hard, ſtudy thy heart much, ſtir up thy ſoul, and the graces that are there;</hi> though much corruption do appear, &amp; the aſhes fly about their ears in this ſearching, yet ſearch and try, and yet not ſo much blow the little ſpark as to blow it out, but labour to cheriſh it, increaſe it; O Lord increaſe our faith; then corruption will down, then communion with Chriſt will riſe higher and higher, for it is with us indeed according to our faith; therefore whatever we do, take heed of what weakens our faith, of diſcouraging, deſponding thoughts, ſtudy promiſes, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of God in Chriſt: O the unſearchable treaſures of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that are in every promiſe, in every letter of his Name! Labour to live by faith brethren, and as that groweth, all the reſt will come on; and thou wilt come at laſt to be ſenſible that thou doſt believe, to feel it, and know it, and then thy readineſs for Chriſt will be more then ordinary, and thy entrance abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant into this Glory.</p>

As in the example of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> at his Marriage they made a feaſt. And ſo <hi>Laban</hi> made a feaſt of ſeven <note place="margin">Iudg. 14. 10.</note> daies long for the Marriage of his daughter, <hi>fulfill her week, and then I will give thee the other alſo.</hi> And ſo again in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi>

you ſee they were at a Marriage-feaſt. So now at the <hi>Mariage of the Lamb; of the Lord Jeſus, there is a feaſt, a Marriage-feaſt:</hi> Yea, but you will ſay, this is not ground enough to underſtand here by the <hi>Marriage, a Marriage-feaſt,</hi> for they are diſtinct things: It is true, they are diſtinct, but yet in ordinary practice they were not ſeparated one from another, but went ſo together, that uſually in Greek and Latin, the <hi>Feaſt</hi> is comprehended under the word for <hi>Marriage,</hi> if not principally ſignified in many places. So in that of <hi>Laban, he made a Feaſt,</hi> ſaith the ſeventy Interpreters, <hi>he made a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. So there was a Marriage in Cana of Galilee,</hi> (that is to ſay) a <hi>Marriage-feaſt</hi> was made there. And ſo it ſeems the Syriach renders it uſually in the New Teſtament by a <hi>Feaſt;</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> upon this place, and <hi>Matthew</hi> in the beginning noteth.

                        <hi>Now the Kingdom of Heaven is compared to a Feaſt,</hi> both the kingdom of Grace, and the kingdom of Glory. The kingdom of Grace is a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> and a rich <hi>Feaſt,</hi> full of royal dainties, as you may find by ſeveral Scriptures; In that of <hi>Matthew, The</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Kingdom of Heaven ſhall be compared to a certain King, who made a Marriage for his Son,</hi> which the <hi>Syriach</hi> well terms a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-feaſt</hi> or <hi>Banquet,</hi> which <hi>Matthew</hi> cals a <hi>Dinner,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> cals a <hi>Supper;</hi> and indeed it is both, for the <hi>Father, Son, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luke 14. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Spirit do come in, and dine and ſup with us;</hi> they do continually eat bread at his Table, as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> did at <hi>Davids</hi> Table, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 7. So it is clear, <hi>Behold I make a Feaſt of fat things, of wine on the Lees, a Feaſt to all Nations;</hi> what is that, but the Goſpel <note place="margin">Iſa. 25. 6.</note> of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Ordinances thereof, and Chriſt held forth in them to be a <hi>Feaſt</hi> to every one that will come to him, as the carkaſs is to the Eagles; as the Lord ſometimes in Scripture invites the fowls of heaven to a <hi>Feaſt he maketh for them,</hi> (that is to ſay) <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 28. Ezek. 39. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>to the dead carkaſſes of his enemies;</hi> but here, <hi>to the carkaſs of his Son, who is ſlain for Sinners, a crucified Chriſt is the carkaſs, he is the fatted Calf indeed, he is the kidneys of the wheat, the fat,</hi>

                        <hi>the fineſt of it: his fleſh is meat indeed, and drink indeed.</hi> Now this muſt be ſpiritually underſtood, not carnally; <hi>the Kingdom of</hi>

                        <hi>Heaven is not in meat and drink,</hi> much leſs in eating and drinking the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, carnally, as the Papiſts ſay,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:115245:237"/>
but ſpiritually: <hi>It is joy, peace, and righteouſneſs, joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> here is the <hi>Feaſt.</hi> If here below we muſt know that this <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> Feaſt may be lookt upon, either according to the externals, or elſe the internals of it; and yet in both reſpects ſpiritual; <hi>The Jews that fell in the wilderneſs, did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drink the ſame ſpiritual drink and yet they fell in the wilderneſs.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> The ordinances, the word, the ſealing ordinances, baptiſm and the Lords ſupper, ſitting at the Lords Table, theſe are the externals of the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> that many Carrion-Crow may come to. And you ſee there in the Goſpel, <hi>He that had no wedding garment upon him, yet came to the Feaſt;</hi> Sure he went no further then the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, you ſee <hi>he is caſt out into utter darkneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this may be called the <hi>Marriage,</hi> or the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> becauſe here below they are neceſſary for us as ſigns of that ſpiritual communion; the Lord ſeeth it good we have theſe royal dainties thus repreſented to us by viſible, ſenſible things, becauſe of our weakneſs; and to magnifie his own condeſcending Grace to us, to make that myſterie of ſalvation by a crucified Chriſt, which all the reaſon in the world cannot fathom; and that <hi>which neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard,</hi> yet in a ſort viſible to the eye, and to be perceived by the ear, that we might even in <note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 4.</note> this ſacramental ſenſe even touch, and taſte, and handle (as I may ſay) the word of life.</p>
                     <p>2. As they are ſeals and pledges of this ſpiritual communion, being ſeals of the Covenant of Grace whereof Jeſus Chriſt is the ſum and ſubſtance, it ſealeth it up to a believers Faith, and ſo ſtands us in great ſtead: And,</p>
                     <p>3. It is a means of our ſpiritual communion, the Conduit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe that runs wine, the diſhes that hold the dainties, though but gold, as Kings and Princes uſe to be ſerved up in ſuch State, yet it is not them we feed upon, they are but the means, the <hi>vehicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and therefore becauſe they have ſuch a reſpect to our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual communion with Jeſus Chriſt, they may be ſo called.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly, the internal communion with Jeſus Chriſt is that indeed which is the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> the <hi>Marriage-feaſt,</hi> even here below, to eat and drink the fleſh and blood of the Son of God, which giveth life, and maintains life; this is the <hi>Feaſt, Eat and drink, yea drink abundantly,</hi> ſaith the Lord; I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied abundantly with the goodneſs of thy houſe; abundantly <note place="margin">Cant. 5.

ſatisfied, watered, inebriated with the fatneſs of thy houſe: what is that? not meerly with the Ordinances, no; but with Chriſtin them, <hi>beholding his might and glory in the Ordinances,</hi> the mighty prevailing of the Spirit of Chriſt againſt our unbelief, <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 4.</note> to quiet all our doubtings, O it is this, <hi>to ſee the good of the choſen of the Lord;</hi> thoſe choice inward refreſhings which the poor believers have from the preſence and powerful workings of Chriſt in them, to the joy of faith, and to ſtrengthen againſt corruption, to ſtrengthen for action, for ſuffering his will, this is that they cry out after, <hi>even after the living God, to enjoy him.</hi> And all this is but the Kingdom of God below, this is but the firſt courſe, as I may ſay, of this feaſt.</p>
                     <p>For ſecondly, <hi>The Kingdom of glory as well as the Kingdom of grace;</hi> which is that now I am to ſpeak to; <hi>this is a feaſt, a Marriage</hi> here called, that is to ſay, a Marriage-feaſt; for what is the Kingdom of grace here below, but a foretaſte of heaven? as <hi>Grotius</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. ſaith.

I will inſtance in a few things Brethren: <hi>Then will there be the love of Chriſt manifeſted to us.</hi> It may be thou haſt had thy heart touched with him, and thou knoweſt not what aileth thee, poor ſoul, but follow him thou muſt, thou canſt not give him over, <hi>thou art ſick of love for him;</hi> but thou haſt ſcarce ever had a good <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 2.</note> look from him, little of his love, or as thou thinkeſt, none. Now Brethren, will it be the Love of God in Jeſus Chriſt to us, that will be the feaſt indeed, <hi>O thy love is better then wine;</hi> it is better, it is ſpirits, it is life, it is that which giveth life, and keepeth life, and fetcheth life again when it is even going; this then is the feaſt, the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt to thy poor ſilly ſoul, that thou lookeſt upon as neglected by God, and neglected by men, <hi>no man careth for thy ſoul.</hi> Believe it Brethren, you that follow Chriſt thus, you ſhall have a time of making out his love to you, and this will be the feaſt, the Love of God will anſwer all the dainties that can be deviſed, a compleat feaſt, it is virtually all. Even among men you ſee, <hi>Love will turn a dinner of hearbs into a feaſt;</hi> O how much more then where Love it ſelf is the filling of <note place="margin">Prov. 15. 17.</note> every diſh!</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>The ſouls joy in this love,</hi> not to ſpeak of the ſouls returns of love again, and praiſes, <hi>hallelujahs</hi> to eternity, which are the fruits; <hi>but the joy in this Love,</hi> it conſiſts here in joy, in that place to the <hi>Romans;</hi> can it choſe but be joy to a poor ſoul think you, to ſee the heart of the Father. <hi>opened to us in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> bowels of Love all ſhed abroad upon us? therefore the <hi>Kingdom of heaven</hi> is ſo expreſſed by joy, <hi>enter thou into thy Maſters joy,</hi> or the joy of the Lord. But to ſpeak a little to ſoul-heightning <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 23.</note> conſiderations of this feaſt in thoſe particulars, that we might get our hearts in love with heaven, with this feaſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt conſider, It is now Brethren to be more immediate, then here below, it is new wine, the moſt excellent in its kind, that is reſerved until the laſt; the excellency of this feaſt of wine in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will appear by this among other conſiderations: That the Communion ſhall be more immediate, <hi>Dulcius ex ipſofonte, waters are moſt ſweet out of the Fountain immediately; now God ſhall be all in all when the Kingdom is given up to him,</hi> he ſhall be inſtead of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 24.</note> all Ordinances; Now indeed the <hi>Conduits</hi> run wine, and we may drink, and that freely, but yet it is not ſo immediately, we are indeed not fit for ſuch a condition; we muſt make uſe of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til

Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by us and for us, and ſo his love is better then wine now to <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 2.</note> us; but alas, there is ſome gall or Vinegar mixed with it; ſome ſin, ſome temptation, ſome affliction without, that weakens the comfort the ſoul might take in the love of Jeſus Chriſt. But in heaven there ſhall be none Brethren, no mixture at all, <hi>here the Lord giveth us a cup of trembling to drink,</hi> a cup of mixture: <note place="margin">Pſal. 75. 8.</note> that is to ſay, ready prepared wine, and his people drink round of it uſually, and he ſeeth it neceſſary; there muſt be ſome Acrimony, ſome ſalt to keep us from corrupting, before we come to our glorified ſtate, and ſo be able to bear that his love without any mixture at all of the contrary; No anger, the meat ſweet, the ſauce ſweet, the wine ſweet, the bread ſweet.</p>

man,</hi> it is too narrow, and the love too great, it cannot enter into his heart to conceive: Some of the Saints have had ſo much of love manifeſted, and joy in that love, that they have been fain to beg of God to hold his hand, they could hold no more; and ſo great, as to quench the flames, that they could not hurt nor pain them, they could feel nothing; O ſure this was a flood, that <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note> could put out ſuch flaming torments. But yet this is nothing, it appears not what we ſhould be, <hi>at thy right hand there is fulneſs</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>What it is that maketh this feaſt;</hi> or firſt, <hi>that it is a feaſt;</hi> it is not an ordinary meal: Now you know men at a feaſt do more liberally provide for their friends here below, it is a feaſt indeed, but nothing to this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Who provideth this feaſt;</hi> it is not a poor mans feaſt, but the feaſt of a King; ſuch a feaſt you ſee <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> made for his Princes; now a King will make a feaſt like a King; Princes have <note place="margin">Heſt. 1. 3.</note> their names from liberality and free, <hi>with a free ſpirit, thy Princely ſpirit,</hi> all thoſe as a King did <hi>Arauna</hi> give to the King, <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally,</hi>

                        <hi>freely;</hi> it was a great gift freely given. So here, it is a King that maketh this feaſt; Kings uſually have larger, more noble ſpirits, as they have larger purſes, and therefore at their feaſts they uſe to ſhew the Magnificence, and glory of their Kingdom. And ſo doth God here Brethren; A King, yea the King of heaven, the King of glory, the King of Kings, and King of Saints, he will ſhew the glory of his Kingdom, and his magnificence, the excellency of his greatneſs in making this feaſt; therefore ſurely there muſt needs be fulneſs of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>It is a feaſt,</hi> not an ordinary, but a Marriage-feaſt, and ſuch uſed to be more then ordinary alſo, being a time of greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing; you ſee the Marriage feaſt at which Chriſt was, what an abundance of wine there was turned from water by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; if you compute it, it will appear ſome 300. gallons <hi>full;</hi> ſix water-pots, holding three meaſures a piece or two, and each meaſure an hundred pints; very great ſtore indeed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>It is a feaſt, a Marriage-feaſt,</hi> not only for a ſervant or friend being married, but for a Son, the only Son, a Son and heir
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115245:240"/>
of all, a beloved Son, moſt dearly beloved; all theſe ſurely will exceedingly heighten the conſiderations of the fulneſs of the feaſt brethren, the fulneſs of that love which ſhall there be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and of the Believers joy in that love; theſe things are height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to us in that place of <hi>Matthew:</hi> Indeed the very feaſt here <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 34.</note> in the Goſpel is heightned by theſe conſiderations; but much more then this. Yea,</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Conſider yet further, <hi>It is a Marriage-feaſt,</hi> for which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration hath been making from eternity, God hath been provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for it, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you before the world;</hi> in theſe things he would have us ſurely to underſtand the decree and purpoſe of ſuch a thing: And withal, <hi>we may note the greatneſs and magnificence of the feaſt.</hi> You know men if they would royally entertain a Prince, they make proviſion long before, and as long as they can, to get all about them, the rarities that the earth or Sea affords, ſpecially if a King be the provider. O Brethren, the Lord hath been laying in, as I may ſay, this wine, preparing it for us from eternity: therefore ſurely it will appear in an unſpeakable fulneſs.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>It will be more conſtantly, without interruption; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, without any end:</hi> No interruption at all; here we have our viciſſitudes, now we have a ſweet cup, <hi>a draught, a full draught,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>a flagon,</hi> it may be to ſtay us when we are ſick of love; by and by we have nothing but our wormwood and our gall to chew upon; now we can behold him, have a glorious view of him, and our hearts raviſhed with it; by and by he is upon the Croſs nailed by our ſins, and we cannot but look upon him with a mourning eye. But there, Brethren, ſhall be no interruption, nothing but eating and drinking this Love of God in Jeſus Chriſt. All his thoughts will be love to us, and all our thoughts love and joy: no room for one ſigh, for one tear of ſorrow, for one groan any more: and then, it is not for a term, and then to end, but it is for ever, <hi>at thy right hand there are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the time when, and the place where this ſhall be; It will be at that day in the Kingdom of the Father: It will begin at the ſouls going <hi>to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> it goeth to Chriſt, <hi>this day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> it goeth to the boſom <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 29. 2 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>and</hi> 1. 12.</note> of the Lord Jeſus, to <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom; and beginneth this feaſt.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115245:240"/>
But the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of it is not until the glorified body ſhall be united to the glorified ſoul, and then both together ſhall be filled with this fulneſs of love, and fulneſs of joy to all eternity.</p>
                     <p>For the place, <hi>It is in heaven,</hi> where Jeſus Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of the Father: There <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw him, and there he abideth, <hi>where he is, there the Saints will be;</hi> ſome think this is <note place="margin">Luk 22. 12.</note> typified probably by the upper Chamber where they did eat the Paſſ-over and the Supper; but no more of that.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſecond thing cometh under hand, that is to ſay, <hi>That they go in with the Bridegroom to this feaſt.</hi> Wherein theſe things will be conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>How he brings them in unto the feaſt.</hi> And then,</p>

There is no acceptance with the Father, no acceſs, but in <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2.</note> and through Jeſus Chriſt; as a poor creature hath no admittance into the preſence and table of a King, but that the ſon takes him by the hand and leads him in; the Lord Jeſus then is the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe, <hi>he went to prepare a place for us.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He brings them unto the Marriage, they go with him even into thoſe joyes, unto that eternal bliſs and glory he leads them into, and there ſitteth down with them at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-feaſt, eating &amp; drinking with him <hi>this new wine in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>

of God ſhall be for ever, but even into the very depth of thoſe diſcoveries, and there he ſitteth down with them.</p>
                     <p>For the Arguments, Beſides that none elſe could do it for us, as you heard.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>His faithfulneſs to them requireth it,</hi> He hath promiſed he will never leave them, until he had fulfilled for them all the good that he hath ſpoken; now this is ſpoken, that he will give <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 54.</note> them glory as well as grace, that he will give them eternal life, and raiſe them up at the laſt day, elſe he were not a faithful High-Prieſt nor a faithful Saviour, if he ſhould leave them ſhort; you know it was his laſt Will and Teſtament, in that place of <hi>Ioh</hi> 17. and will he ſee his own Will and Teſtament violated? <hi>Father, I will that where I am, they ſhall be alſo;</hi> now they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 24.

                     <p>2. <hi>His own Communicative,</hi> He is not willing to be alone in the enjoyment of this glory wherewith he is glorified with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would not ingroſs thoſe delights and pleaſures which are at the right hand of the Father for evermore, but would <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 16.</note> communicate them to ſome; now he is in heaven, and his people upon earth, yet he would not be alone in thoſe comforts, but though himſelf muſt ſit at the right hand of his Father, yet he ſendeth the Spirit the Comforter to his people, to give them a taſte, an earneſt of thoſe joys of that Feaſt that is to come; indeed ſo much joy, that it is unſpeakable and full of glory to many of the people of God: many Saints are, as I may ſay, in heaven upon earth; the Lord Jeſus would not eat and drink abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and let his people have none, that were unkindneſs indeed; where there is little goodneſs in a creature, as all in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is but little in compariſon of him, <hi>Job</hi> would not eat his <note place="margin">Iob 31. 17.</note> morſel alone; ſo will not he Lord Jeſus, but he will have his people to go in with him to the Feaſt, to the Marriage, and drink wine with him, as you have it in the <hi>Canticles, He hath eaten his honey and honey Comb, and drank his wine and milk,</hi> and what <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 1.</note> then? <hi>Then drink ye, O my friends; yea, drink abundantly, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Eſther 5. 5.</note> he goeth along with him, he puts it upon him as a great honour; and this is the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, the honour which he doth to the man whom he delights to honour, who hath ſet his love upon him, even to bring him in to the Feaſt, the Marriage Feaſt; he hath not been aſhamed of him before men, nor will the Lord be aſhamed of him before men and Angels, and his Father, though while he was here below, it may be a man full of infirmities; ſo the Saints are called his friends in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: <note place="margin">2 Chro. 20. 7.

I anſwer, no marvel thou haſt no great appetite, until thou haſt more communion with him, if thou haſt had any: And no marvel, if thou haſt no appetite, if thov haſt never been with Jeſus, for thou haſt ſo long lived upon traſh, that it takes away the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack to the ſweeteſt and wholſomeſt food in the world. But withal remember this, who ever will, is invited to come, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and take freely.

                     <p>I will but add one word more, and that is this; <hi>It is no indifferent thing, whether you cloſe with this invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or no?</hi> there is a neceſſity lies upon you to come to <hi>the Marriage-feaſt,</hi> except you reſolve upon it to periſh for ever; <hi>God he was wroth, and ſent forth his armies to deſtroy, &amp;c.</hi> Ah what gnaſhing of teeth will there be to poor ſinners in hell, <note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> when they ſhall ſee their neighbours, who heard this Goſpel with them, <hi>ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob at the table of Chriſt in his kingdom, and themſelves caſt out!</hi> Ah bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 12.</note>

I beg for you a believing heart, you muſt either feaſt with Chriſt, or ſtarve for ever with Satan and his Angels, and then not a drop will be had to cool your tongues; now flagons <note place="margin">Luke 16. 24.</note> are tendered you, now wine and milk without money and price, now rivers of pleaſures at Gods right hand, and fulneſs of joy is promiſed you, is held out to you, cometh a begging to you; Ah then, then brethren, ſhall you beg for a drop, and ſhall not have it; rivers of burning brimſtone will be your bathing, when the Saints are ſwallowed up of thoſe rivers of pleaſures at his right hand; then will you be chewing upon your gall and wormwood, then will you be breaking your teeth upon your gravel, when the Saints are drinking this new wine in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their Father with Jeſus Chriſt. Ah think of it brethren, think of it; you have now your good things, many of your eyes ſtand out with fatneſs, you ſpend a world upon your luſts, live like Epicures, wantonizing in the abundance of your enjoyments; how woful will that ſentence be! <hi>Son, remember, thou in thy life time hadſt thy good things,</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, Then Brethren, <hi>let as many as have received power</hi>

uſually, and the more they will receive; ſurely it is ſo in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, the more a ſoul feeds upon Chriſt, and the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly he drinketh, the more he may, it enlargeth the deſires; <hi>Hitherto</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>you have asked nothing,</hi> little or nothing; <hi>Ask, and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 24.</note> the more abundantly the ſoul is ſatisfied with the goodneſs of the houſe of God, the more will the mouth be opened to receive; now, as our capacities do enlarge, ſo much the more fitter are we for this <hi>Marriage-feaſt.</hi> O therefore let us not come to the table of the Lord brethren, this ſign and pledge of that <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-feaſt</hi> in heaven, but with mouths opened, ſouls enlarged, that we may eat and drink abundantly, he that cometh hungry, will hardly go away without his fill; we come with narrow hearts, mouths half-opened, and therefore go away with little or nothing.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>This ſhould much edge our deſires after Heaven, and</hi>

                        <hi>the glory that is to be revealed:</hi> it is a feaſt, who is not willing to go to a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> if he be hungry and pinching? and yet alas, how backward are we for heaven? how do we hang back? it is a ſign we have little deſire after that fulneſs of communion with Jeſus Chriſt, all is not right with us, we are not ready, when we can be contented to ſit down by the pipe, and may go to the fountain, to the rivers, the ocean of unſpeakable delights in the Lord. O therefore brethren, eye heaven more, and the Glory of it, this <hi>Marriage-feaſt;</hi> the eye affecteth the heart; though it is true, it doth not appear diſtinctly what we ſhall be, yet ſome hints are given, whereby we may conceive how tranſcendent the delights of heaven will be above all we enjoy below. What <hi>Solomon</hi> dehorts men from as an occaſion of luſting after wine; <hi>look not upon the wine when it is red, when it giveh his colour in the cup,</hi> moves it ſelf aright, when it ſparkles, and <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 27.</note> hath a pure colour, if you look, you will be enticed by it. But here is a <hi>feaſt</hi> of wine, of new wine, more excellent, tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, full of ſpirits and vigour; look upon it brethren, with the eye of faith, and ſerious contemplation; ſometimes behold how it ſparkles, what a ſpirit there is in this wine, that to all eternity maketh the Spirits of the Saints to exult, and triumph in his glorious praiſe, a duty ſo far above our cold and heavy frames here below. O methinks this ſhould ſomewhat quicken
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:115245:247"/>
us, and raiſe our deſires to heaven, to be with Chriſt, drinking this wine new with him, in his kingdom, that here we drink only ſacramentally; and theſe are not deceitful meats, your expectations cannot be ſo high of heaven, but you ſhall find abundantly more to admire.</p>
                     <p>Fifth Uſe ſhall be a word of comfort and encouragement to the <note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> people of God according to the neceſſities of their various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, if ſo be that the Saints ſhall enter in with Chriſt unto the <hi>Marriage,</hi> unto this <hi>Feaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt then, <hi>Here is matter of encouragement againſt the troubles and afflictions the Saints meet with in the world, and from the world.</hi> It is true, this is a time wherein at preſent the world ſmiles upon Religion, but they are but like the Crocodiles ſmiles, ready to devour them notwithſtanding, yea indeed, her very embraces are killing. But if times ſhould but turn a little, the world would be the world ſtill, it hates the Saints, and it would diſcover it ſelf, what it is, more plainly then now it doth; the times will not bear hoſtility againſt the people of God: but ſuppoſe ſuch an hour of temptation may come upon us, this may encourage us againſt it (brethren): What though the world may give you gall and vinegar to drink, as they did to Jeſus Chriſt before, you are now going ready to enter in with the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> to the <hi>Marriage-feaſt</hi> of new wine, and drink with <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2. &amp;c.</note> him at his Table in the Fathers kingdom to eternity. Indeed brethren, there is ſo much refreſhing to a poor creature in this <hi>Feaſt</hi> of wine on the lees upon earth, in the Church, in this poor and dark communion with him, that it is enough to allay the bittereſt cup which God puts into his peoples hands to drink; witneſs this comfortable Propheſie, <hi>Though you have the bread of afflictions, and water of adverſities, yet will I not remove your Teachers any more into a corner; give wine to him that, &amp;c.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 20.</note> Prov. 31. 6. <hi>This will ſweeten all;</hi> one taſte of honey and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the end of the Rod, (and all wicked men are but Gods rod to chaſten his people) I ſay, this taſte enlightneth the eyes, reviveth the poor drooping fainting ſoul; Ah what are the <note place="margin">Luke 22. 28.</note> joys of Heaven then! Again, ſuppoſe it be not a perſecution for righteouſneſs ſake, but it is from the hand of God for thy ſins that thou ſmarteſt; yet this brethren, methinks if our hearts
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:115245:247"/>
were more upon it, would allay the ſmart; there will be a time, when there will be no room for one ſigh, nor one groan more, no interruption will be in your joy. Yea, ſuppoſe it be ſin that moſt troubles thee now, and temptation, and this is a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing indeed to a gracious heart: O remember brethren, that in the <hi>Marriage-feaſt</hi> there will be a ſwallowing up of all theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It may be encouragement to a poor ſoul that longs, and preſſeth hard after a fuller communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>and cannot reach it;</hi> but ſtill let them attain to what they can, their deſires are higher, and reaching after more; and that deſire <note place="margin">2 Tim 2. 12.</note> ſpeaks emptineſs in part, and hunger, and that hath pain, the ſoul muſt needs be reſtleſs in ſuch a condition. O remember brethren, there will be an entrance into the <hi>Marriage-feaſt,</hi> where you ſhall ever be with the Lord, you ſhall be ever drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him this new wine in his Fathers Kingdom, at his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: ſuppoſe there be not that to ſatisfie and fill thee, in the pipe (though the Conduits run wine, and the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be a feaſt of fat things) ſtill thou wouldſt have more; there brethren, your deſires will be ſwallowed up, your enjoyments will be above your deſires. I know it is a ſight of Chriſt crucified ſitting with us at the Table, which is the reviving of the poor ſoul; but alas, he quickly loſeth that poor imperfect glimpſe he had of him; but there ſhall thy eye be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſeeing him in his glory, and thine ear with hearing his bleſſed voice: there ſhall thy ſoul be filled indeed, and alway filled, becauſe alway ſwallowed up in this fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>It is matter of encouragement to ſuch, as it may be, are not admitted to every diſh, or every courſe in this Feaſt of fat things, this Marriage-feaſt upon earth;</hi> it may be the people of God may not be ſatisfied in ſome, to admit them, though the Lord have received them, it appears not to them; it may be their own ſpirits are not free to enjoy them in ſuch a way as they are to be had in the places where they live, ſome ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block or other is in the way, which they cannot get over, and ſo they mourn after them, but cannot enjoy them. O that God would remove all ſtumbling blocks, and help his people ſo to prize them, as not upon every ſlight matter to be kept from
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:115245:248"/>
them: but ſuppoſe thou canſt not come poor ſoul, and yet thy ſoul longs for them, and haply more then many that do enjoy them, if thou couldſt without ſin. Be of good comfort, though it is true, thou maiſt loſe many a ſight of Jeſus Chriſt ſitting with his people at the round table, and thou knoweſt not what thou loſeſt, yet if it <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 12.</note> be meer tenderneſs of Conſcience which keepeth thee off, and not perverſeneſs, thou haſt ſure much of the inward fellowſhip and communion with Chriſt, otherwiſe he can, if he pleaſe, ſupply it otherwiſe; but however, though not admitted among men, thou ſhalt enter in with Chriſt unto the <hi>Marriage-ſupper</hi> for ever, and this will make amends for all. Though far be it from me to ſtrengthen any mans hands in the neglect of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt on earth, and take heed, that our excuſes will ſpeak loud enough for us in Gods ears, whatever they do in mans. But if thou canſt not be admitted to the pipe, Is it not a comfort that thou ſhalt be admitted to the fountain, to the ſea? O me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks this ſhould put on ſuch above others, make a vertue of neceſſity, and ſo much the more long for his appearing to thee, that thou mayſt enter in with him to the <hi>Marriage-feaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>It may ſerve to allay the bitterneſs of death:</hi> It is a bitter thing, not only to the wicked; it is bitter, it muſt needs, having the ſting of ſin in it, and being a trap-door, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 32.</note> (as I may ſay) to let them ſink or drop into the everlaſting flames, this muſt needs be bitter: But to the Saints it is in ſome ſort bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo, nature is diſſolved by it: it is the fruit of ſin, and we find by continual experience of the Saints, that there is a hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back; But methinks, this conſideration, <hi>that it is an entrance into this Marriage-feaſt,</hi> ſhould much ſweeten it to a child of God. Our Saviours death was the bittereſt that ever was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, O it was a deadly cup, but this was it that ſweetned it, the conſideration that he ſhould drink this new wine with his people in his fathers kingdom, there feaſt with him for ever: <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him, he endured the Croſs;</hi> ſo brethren, do but ſet before you continually this joy, this pouring out of this love <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> of Chriſt upon your ſouls, thoſe immediate, ſincere; full, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and eternal delights of your ſouls in the light and love of the Father, and of the Son, and ſee if it ſwallow not up the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of death unto you? But ſo much for this Doctrine.

Here is the ſecond Conſideration of <note place="margin">Verſe 10.</note> this coming of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> a doleful conſideration it is to all ſuch as were not ready, <hi>for the door was ſhut;</hi> what is the ſence of ſhutting the door in the Parable, I ſuppoſe is eaſily underſtood, (that is to ſay) an entrance is denied to them that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; as well as they that were within, were ſhut in by the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the door.

                     <p>The Doctrine will be a ſad word; it is this, <hi>That the Gate of</hi>

                        <hi>heaven, or the door will be clapt againſt all formal Profeſſors, and fooliſh Virgins that are not ready to enter with Chriſt;</hi> for this is implied in the other part of the words; <hi>they that were ready, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with Chriſt into the Marriage, and the door was ſhut;</hi> upon whom? ſurely upon them that were not ready for that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whatever hopes they are big with, now they prove abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. There is a door of entrance into Heaven, and an outer door, (as I may ſay) which I may call a door of hope, which the Hypocrite hath not, when it cometh to a pinch, not a well-grounded hope, <hi>The wicked is driven away in his wickedneſs, but the righteous hath hope in his death.</hi> There is a door of hope <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 32.</note> to him, but none to the wicked; but his hope which he had before, many times at death, is like the giving up of the Ghoſt; <note place="margin">Iob 11. 20: Rev. 22. 15.</note>

As for Adultery, or whoring, though men be not guilty of the outward act, is there not heart-adultery? is there not contemplative wickedneſs? againſt which <hi>Job</hi> reſolveth, <hi>I made a Govenant with mine eye, why ſhould I think upon a maid? he that luſteth after her beauty in the heart, commits</hi>

                        <hi>adultery with her in his heart;</hi> yea brethren, by the thoughts, the very ſpirits (as I may ſay) and oyl of ſin are ſqueezed out, or extracted, as in a Limbeck, and that is more deadly and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 25.

                        <hi>God.</hi> Ah brethren, you that cheriſh that old man of ſin, (as I may ſay) rub him, and chafe him, and pour wine, and ſtrong drink into him, <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> and ſpirits into him; by your meditations of ſin, vain thoughts, luſtful, proud, paſſionate thoughts nouriſh your ſins ordinarily, and ſo blow up the coal into a flame, you are far from mortifying your luſts: inſtead of bringing water and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, to kill your ſins, you bring to the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:115245:250"/>
flame: well, all unmortified perſons are unready, let our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be what it will, the door will be clapt upon ſuch, I mean ſuch as are altogether unmortified, have done nothing in the work. I know a child of God may not be ſo mortified as he ſhould, and ſometimes for ſome acts may cheriſh ſin, uſe the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to the fire within, but it coſts him bitterneſs afterward; he liveth not in ſuch a courſe: If he do, it is good for him to be jealous of himſelf how the caſe ſtands with him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He is unready that hath no real holineſs put upon him, without it <hi>none ſhall ſee God;</hi> he knoweth his <hi>prima facie,</hi> as I may ſay, he can ſee the image and comelineſs upon a ſoul if it be <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> there: If not, he will not own any baſtards, any ſuppoſititious chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, changelings that Satan laies in the lap of the Church, as I may ſay, and rocks in the Cradle of ſecurity, but the Lord will ſhut the door againſt them. This real holineſs, you know what it is, <hi>a conformity to the will of God in our underſtandings,</hi>

A holy diſpoſition of heart to do his will, ſuffer his will, and delight in it; which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioneth our grief when we cannot; well, this is holineſs. Hear this then ye that never mind the will of God, purblind ignorant creatures, ſtubborn rebellious creatures, you that have iron ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news and brazen faces, which refuſe to return or to be aſhamed, though the Lord do blazen your iniquities before you continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Heralds, which cry aloud, and teach <hi>Jacob</hi> their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> their ſins, and ſpare you not, nor ſpare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet you refuſe to return, and to be aſhamed to conform to <note place="margin">Iſa. 58. 1.</note> the will of Chriſt; you never were brought to that ſweet ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive frame of <hi>Paul, Lord, what wouldſt thou have me to do?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts. 9.</note> Well, believe it, thou art unready, the gate will be clapt againſt thee.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Then others are unready; And who are thoſe? Such as have received work to do, <hi>and they have not done it,</hi> men of no action for Chriſt; then the Apoſtle was ready, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when they had done their work he gave them to do: Chriſt had wrought out a perfect righteouſneſs for his people, and therefore he went up to heaven, <hi>and the world ſeeth him no more,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 8, 9.</note> and this the Spirit convinceth the world of; if he had not done that work perfectly, heaven would not have held him: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

                     <p>Firſt then, <hi>all ſuch as triſle away their time in the world,</hi> ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſtrength for that which profiteth not, <hi>labouring for the</hi>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="368" facs="tcp:115245:251"/>
Secondly, <hi>Such as do but dally with God, and Religion, and the things of eternity;</hi> they ſpend themſelves and their ſtrength to feed a formality, to put forth broad and pleaſant leaves, and there is all; but for faith, and repentance, and the great works of a Chriſtian, they ſcarſe ever meddle with them at all; they go to the creature here with the fooliſh Virgins, go to the opinions of others, to the graces of others, to their flattering paraſite Preachers, to be ſeared and daubed up; ſuch as theſe are likely to be found unready, none in more danger then a formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Such as fail in the midſt of their Chriſtian courſe,</hi> as you ſee theſe Virgins did; uſually ſuch are hardly recovered again, for you ſee how they wandered up and down from moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to hill, from creature to creature, and come not to Jeſus Chriſt.

Such are like to the <hi>Laodiceans, ſpiſed out of the mouth of God,</hi> which none returneth to again; the Dog returneth to <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 17.</note> the vomit, but not a man; our time is fruitful in experiences of this kind; you ſee the door is here ſhut againſt thoſe Virgins which failed, I mean it of a total Apoſtacy, not partial declinings; ſuch the Saints themſelves had, the wiſe Virgins, but the other loſt all, true ſaving grace they had none, their form, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, it went out, and then they were in darkneſs, could not expect the coming of their Lord with their Lamps burning. So much for the opening of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The door is ſhut,</hi> the meaning of this is no more, <hi>but that an entrance into heaven is denyed unto them that are not ready,</hi> there is no manſion made ready for them that are not made ready for theſe manſions: the Lord Jeſus he is the door into the Church, <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 2.</note> the Kingdom of grace, and into the Kingdom of glory, as you have beard, <hi>they that enter, muſt enter in by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by him; now he will ſhut the door, that is to ſay, ſhut up his bowels and tender mercies for ever; though they have been <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 17.</note> opened to poor ſinners here upon earth, then they ſhall be ſhut up, he will have no more compaſſion on them, <hi>but when they cry and call, ſhut out their prayers;</hi> they have clapt the door of their hearts and lockt them againſt him, and now will he ſhut up <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 28.</note> his heart, and lock it againſt them for ever. Time was when the Jews might have found Jeſus Chriſt, but now, ſaith he, <hi>ye ſhall ſeek

                     <p>For the Arguments to confirm this a little.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe this feaſt in heaven admitteth no Gueſts without a wedding garment, without holineſs no entrance into heaven, no man</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14. Ioh. 17. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall ſee the Lord, except the Lord Jeſus have known them, and they have known him, which is life eternal:</hi> for ſo the Apoſtle puts them together, <hi>we know that we know him, or rather are known of him,</hi> elſe Brethren, there is no entrance, <hi>he knoweth no man,</hi> will acknowledge none then, but with a wedding-garment here, in the adminiſtrations of the Kingdom of grace; a perſon may creep into the feaſt withont the wedding-garment indeed, for the word preached, it is for all, but the diſtinguiſhing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances men may be admitted to haply, though they have no wedding-garment, as you have it in that place of <hi>Matthew,</hi> but he ſhall not abide there, but ſhall be caſt out, <hi>he will bind him hand and foot, and caſt him out;</hi> though he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eaveth the admittance <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 11, 13.</note> of them into the viſible Church and viſible communion in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to us, who can judge but according to appearance and by the rules of charity; yet himſelf cometh and vieweth the gueſts, and who are fit to be owned as the gueſts of heaven, that ſhall have entrance there, he whoſe eyes are a flame of fire, or like it, piercing into the inwards of our ſouls, to ſee what our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are cloathed with. And if he takes it ſo ill of them that creep into the Communion of his Saints and Ordinances here below without a wedding-garment; Surely then, he will never admit any to this feaſt of new wine to eternity, without ſuch a wedding-garment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another Argument or Conſideration to make this out, may be this, <hi>they that are unready ſhall not enter,</hi> the door ſhall be ſhut upon them, <hi>becauſe they have neglected, deſpiſed the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115245:252"/>
Lord Jeſus, who is the door, and hath the key of David,</hi> and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 7. Rom. 10. 21. Iſa. 65. 2.</note> and ſhutteth, therefore now, they ſhall be rejected; the door hath ſtood open all the day long, <hi>all the day long hath he ſtretched out his hands to a rebellious and gain-ſaying people; he would have gathered them, and they would not,</hi> therefore now he will not; now he will deſpiſe them, as they have deſpiſed him, and there is all the reaſon that can be, that they that would have none of Chriſt, by whom alone there is acceſs to the Father and to this glory, that he ſhould have none of them neither; they have reſiſted the motions of his Spirit, the Holy-Ghoſt offering to convince them, and now he will reſiſt them, clap the door againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe now the time of our working and Gods waiting is at an end;</hi> God hath long waited to be gracious to us, but now there is an end of waiting, he ſeeth it would do no good, as long as ſinners could for ſorrow, or pain, or death, hold their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, keep their ſins, their ſweet morſels, they would never ſpit them out, therefore <hi>now he will wait no more;</hi> though men were unready when Chriſt cometh, yet if he would ſtay a while longer, wait a year longer: O if it might be but a Sabbath, but a day, what new creatures would men become? they will promiſe fair: No, no, the time of waiting is done, he will not ſtay a jot, they have had warning enough, the cry hath paſt before him often enough, <hi>Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him,</hi> but you have not taken the warning; now when he cometh and receiveth his own which were ready for him, no more waiting, the door is ſhut. Though here in the Kingdom of grace God may be <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 7, 9.</note> intreated to ſpare a barren tree or Vineyard a year or two long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet when the time of waiting is at an end, and he ſeeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will do, he will down with them by the roots, into the fire with them; ſo it is no time for us to work then, to think of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt then: if we would gather Manna, it muſt be upon the ſix daies, there was none to be found upon the ſeventh. If we underſtand this of the day of the reſurrection from the dead, then it is clear, as the <hi>tree falleth ſo it lyoth, either hell-ward or</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>heaven-ward:</hi> But if of the time of death, truly Brethren, how ever this may ſometimes through the exceeding riches of his grace be a time of repentance and faith to ſome, yet ordinarily it is not ſo. Alas they have enough to do to bear the weakneſs upon them, they can mind little elſe; or if they do return, it is
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:115245:252"/>
but feignedly for the moſt part, with <hi>Judas;</hi> and uſually, when a ſinner hath ſo long trampled under foot the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord giveth them up to hardneſs of heart, that they ſhall never repent or believe, <hi>ſeeing, they ſhall ſee and not perceive,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 9.</note> &amp;c. <hi>leaſt they ſhould be converted and he ſhould heal them,</hi> as it is there in the <hi>Revelations, Let him that is filthy be filthy ſtill, let him</hi>

                        <hi>that is an hypocrite, be an hypocrite ſtill,</hi> this is fearful indeed. So much for the Arguments.</p>
                     <p>For the Application, Then Brethren, <hi>What have we all of us to bleſs the Lord for, that yet the door is not ſhut againſt us,</hi> as we may hope; indeed if God have ſealed up any heart under hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe of its long reſiſting the Holy-Ghoſt, woful is his condition: but doth he not breath now and then, and ſtir and ſtrive, that is a good ſign he hath not done with thee yet, his waiting and ſtriving time is not over, <hi>he hath not given thee over yet,</hi> &amp;c. What have we to bleſs the Lord for? what are our lives Brethren good to us for in any reſpect beſides, but that we might work out our ſalvation, make ſure of God, and Chriſt, and heaven, get our wedding-garment on, put on the Lord Jeſus for righteouſneſs and holineſs, that our nakedneſs may not appear, for heaven will not bear the nakedneſs of a ſinner; now, though ſinners have neglected this opportunity, alas how many of us have we are exceeding buſie, making proviſion for our luſts, our pride, our luxury, our backs, our bellies, proviſion for our wives, our children, but none for our poor ſouls; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, he waiteth, the door ſtandeth open: If you had many of you been cut off a year or a moneth ago, and the grave had ſhut her mouth upon you, would you not have found heaven ſhut againſt you, and hell opening her mouth wide for to ſwallow you up? Yea Brethren, if this day he ſhould come, Ah I fear, I fear, Brethren, as ſecure as many of us are now, and ſure of our conditions, we ſhould find the gate clapt againſt our ſouls: O therefore Brethren bleſs the Lord, admire his patience and long-ſuffering, that yet draweth out our day of grace, that yet holdeth his bowels open, his arms open to receive us. This is the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Then it may ſerve to lay before us the doleful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of poor trifling creatures, trifling profeſſors, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the ado they make with their Lamps, trimming
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:115245:253"/>
of them, and going up and down to buy, <hi>they are found unready, the door is clapt againſt them;</hi> the Lord grant that none of your poor ſouls may ever ſee that woful day Brethren, you will then know to your bitterneſs and ſorrow, what it is to ſin away a day of grace, an opportunity, while the door ſtood open to receive you: Ah ſurely there will nothing wound poor ſinners more then this, the time was, I might have been happy, I might have had heaven, the bowels of the Lord Jeſus ſtood open to me as well as to others, but now alas it is paſt; did it make the Lord Jeſus weep for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was not her condition ſad then, and will it not make your hearts bleed? O ſure it cannot be, but every <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 42.</note> ſuch thought to <hi>Eſau,</hi> prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> poor <hi>Eſau,</hi> when the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was gone he ſought it with tears, every thought ſure of this time was, <hi>I might have had the bleſſing, but wretch that I was, I ſinned it away, I deſpiſed it, preferred a meſs of pottage before it, and therefore now there is no recovery of it.</hi> Every thought ſure in hell, that heaven gate did ſtand open to you ſinners, you had as fair offers of grace and as long a ſeaſon and opportunity to cloſe with Chriſt as others, but now they are gone, will fetch blood from your very hearts and ſouls: O the condition is ſad and dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It ſhall be a word of Exhortation to us all, that we would lay theſe things to heart, It may be we have not ſo much minded them; If this be true Brethren, <hi>What need had we to look to it, that we be found ready to enter?</hi> which is an Exhortation. I have already preſt upon you, there is a promiſe left of entering, &amp; a threatning alſo that ſome ſhall not enter, even as many as are not ready; you ſee it here by the wiſe Virgins who enter, and the fooliſh againſt whom the door is ſhut; and the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Take heed leſt any of you fall ſhort through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 18.</note> as thoſe fell ſhort; the Apoſtle maketh that uſe of it, to warn the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> though Diſciples in profeſſion, and many of them doubtleſs in reality ſuch; ſo here from this example, I deſire Brethren, both mine own and your hearts may be quickned to look about us, leſt when all comes to all, we have the gate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven clapt upon us.</p>
                     <p>1. Then you that are yet in the gall of bitterneſs and the bonds of iniquity, have yet your filthy garments upon you, your rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> filthy rags of your own ſervices, duties, prayers, alms, as if
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:115245:253"/>
thoſe were a wedding-garment; you that are more profane it <note place="margin">Zech. 3.</note> may be, and cloath your ſelves with violence, as with a Cloak, and with curſing, as with a garment; and ſo for all manner of <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 6.</note> prophane perſons, I would beg of you for Jeſus Chriſt ſake this day, you would conſider this doleful word, <hi>the gate will be ſhut againſt you, if you be found unready for the appearing of Chriſt.</hi> Now there is none of you but your conſciences will tell you, that <note place="margin">Pſal. 109. 18.</note> you are not ready for it; can a drunkard, a ſwearer, a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, be ready for the coming of Chriſt? can you hold up your heads ſinners, when he appears, and look him in the face with comfort? Ah no. Either men believe not this coming of Chriſt to them, or elſe becauſe it is not preſent, they put it far from them, therefore they are not affected with it. O that I could preach this day Brethren, as if hell were at ſinners backs, as if the Lord Jeſus were at your backs now ready to call for you out of this world, that you may be a little ſtartled. That I would beg of you, ſhall be this, that you would without any more <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands,</hi> without any more delaies, ſet about this work, to make ready for his appearing, leſt the gate be clapt upon you; you have too long delayed it already, therefore now, if ever, ſet about the work.</p>

                        <hi>What would you have us to do?</hi> you will ſay; I anſwer Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, without any more delay, <hi>to conſider your waies, and turn to the Lord, to repent that you may believe, and believe that you may repent.</hi> O that you might have hearts to believe this terrible threatning, that ſo your hearts might be ſhaken (ſinners) out of your ſecurity; for this is the reaſon you make nothing of all theſe things, you do not believe that there will be a ſhutting out, or you do not conſider it, and that your ſelves are as likely to be the men that have the door ſhut upon you as any others; O therefore learn this day, a neceſſity of believing, if you would not be ſhut out, a neceſſity of repenting; you ſee they were ſhut out by reaſon of unbelief. I know what anſwer your hearts <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 19.</note> will make to this, If believing will do it, you will never be ſhut out, for you do believe, and will believe, and have believed; alway you have had a good heart, and a good faith towards God and Chriſt; Brethren, I tell you, that you never lookt upon the Brazen Serpent for healing, if you were never wounded; It is for them thatare wounded. You that are all faith now, before
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:115245:254"/>
God have touched your hearts, and ſet your ſins in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; if ever God come and ſhew you your guilt, there will be nothing but doubting, and fears, and terrors; It is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſign to me, that a ſinner never did believe, becauſe he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo light a matter of it: No, no, Brethren, you do not come to him indeed: the door ſtands open now, and you are invited to come and enter in by the door, by Jeſus Chriſt, into the Marriage-feaſt, but you do not come to him; O therefore be exhorted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, now while the door ſtands open, to come and enter in, <hi>take heed you fall not ſhort by your unbelief;</hi> and then upon this faith in Jeſus Chriſt will follow a Goſpel-repentance, a melting and mourning over the Lord Jeſus, whoſe love and bowels you have abuſed, and the love of Jeſus Chriſt will conſtrain you to another courſe of life then you have led, quite contrary, you will not be the ſame men: O break off your ſins by righteouſneſs, be abrupt <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27.</note> in your repentance, in greateſt haſte; men think it is hard to break off in the midſt of ſuch a deſign for the world, or ſuddenly to leave their companions in ſin, but by degrees they will do it; <hi>O break off,</hi> &amp;c. Again,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For you that have ſomewhat more then ordinary of a profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, I beg of you to look to it Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that you have the main thing, leſt when all comes to all, the door be ſhut upon you, as upon thoſe fooliſh Virgins; me thinks if we did but conſider how many poor ſouls of great hope have gone out and ſunk under ſuch a ſad diſappointment as this is, it were enough to ſtartle us all: O look to your footing Brethren, for Jeſus ſake look to your Evidences, the day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if we be not ready, there will be no entrance for us, let us paſs for what we will here among men. I cannot ſtand to preſs theſe things, I have already ſpoken much to the ſame purpoſe before.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I pray you conſider, that upon this moment of time, (for our lives in compariſon of eternity are no more) a hand breadth, a ſhadow, a vapor, nothing; you that have lived thirty, ſixty <note place="margin">Pſal. 39.</note> years in ſin, now it is paſt the ſeaſon you have had in your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, what is it but like a dream when it is paſt? but as ſhort as this time is, <hi>upon it depends eternity;</hi> he hangeth the heavyeſt weights upon the weakeſt wires: O Brethren, me thinks if men did but believe this, and it were preſent now and then upon their

                     <p n="2">2. Though time be ſhort whereupon eternity depends, yet you have time Brethren, though it is true, none but the preſent time be yours, that which is paſt is gone, that which is to come, you know not what it may produce, whether you ſhall ſee it or no, but you have a time, <hi>now while it is called to day;</hi> Ah Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſome of us have had a long day, our day of grace hath had already, ſome ſix, ſome ſeven, ſome eleven hours, and yet it is day with us, we have not wanted time, but we have waſted it, trifled it away, but ſince yet there is time, let this ſtir us up: <hi>O the long-ſuffering of God ſhould lead you to repentance:</hi> Ah bleſſed <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> are your ears, for they hear, and your eyes, for they ſee; Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they ſee a crucified Chriſt held out before you, with his arms ſtretched out all the day long ready to receive you, they ſee the door open, ſtand open for poor ſinners to come: Your ears, they hear the joyful ſound, now you are called upon, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be reconciled, to believe. Well, you cannot ſay, ſinners, another day, but that the Lord gave you ſpace to repent, ſpace to make ſure of heaven, but you neglected it.</p>

O what would the damned, that have been damned from under ſuch means and mercies as you enjoy, give for one of their Sabbaths, for one of their Sermons, for one of the many daies you enjoy! but it is paſt help.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Conſider Brethren, <hi>If the door be ſhut by Jeſus Chriſt, none elſe can open it;</hi> and he will not himſelf open it any more, and what will become of you then? It may be ſinners think this is not ſo ſad a word, <hi>that the door ſhall be ſhut,</hi> they think they can bring a golden key of their own that ſhall open it: No, no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it Brethren, it is the key of <hi>David</hi> only that can open and ſhut this door, and this Jeſus Chriſt alone hath the Wards of, <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 7.</note> your keys are not fitted for this lock; he ſhutteth therefore, and <hi>no man openeth,</hi> none elſe whatſoever openeth: Nor will he open it himſelf any more to them, he knoweth full well upon whom it is that he ſhutteth the gate; he knoweth who are, and who are not his; who are ready, and who are not. O therefore Brethren, I beſeech you conſider it, now while you have time, before it be too late, while there is hope concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this thing; O let not the world, Brethren, nor your ſinful pleaſures eat out all your time, conſume your ſeaſon of grace, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they could open the gate of heaven for you; if they could, it were ſomewhat indeed for men to baffle ſo with Chriſt, and trifle away their ſouls as they do; but if you will not believe, nor be perſwaded by any thing which in ſo much weakneſs can be ſaid, nor by what is delivered in a better manner by others, you ſhall ſee it to your ſorrow, when you come to heaven gate and find it ſhut againſt you. O then you ſhall know Brethren, what it was to have ſuch a warning, <hi>to flee from the wrath to come, and not have a heart to embrace it.</hi> Thus much for this Application, and this Doctrine.</p>

It is plainly taken up from the Parable here, the fooliſh Virgins they kept their Lamps burning long, until the very point of the Bride-grooms coming; yea not only ſo, but when the door was ſhut and others received, which whether it be at the day of judgement, or at each particular ſouls particular day, we will not now enquire; but yet they come (mind you) after all this, and they bounce againſt heaven gate, as I may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

done. And when many fell back from Chriſt, <hi>Judas</hi> continued with him, the Bag its likely kept him more then Chriſt; but he <note place="margin">Joh. 6 66.</note> continued until the very laſt, and then periſhed. There was but one ſtep, as I may ſay, between the young man in the Goſpel and heaven, he went very far, did much, he had kept all thoſe things from his youth; yet there was one thing wanting, which he could <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 20.</note> not reach too; our Saviour convinced him thereby how ſhort he was, and had need of a Saviour; but we find not that he came to him any more: How near was <hi>Ananias</hi> to the Kingdom of God? he profeſſed Chriſt in thoſe perſecuting times, owned him, but it ſeems his love of the world and diſtruſt was not killed; he went far as well as others, to ſell all he had, and to lay it at the Apoſtles feet, a very great piece of ſelf-denyal, only a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in hypocriſie you ſee, carried him aſide, and he periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To make this a little better appear, conſider,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the light and principles of nature will carry a man very far;</hi> how far did many of the Heathens go? how Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like would they ſpeak? and how heroically and ſelf-denyingly would they act many times? Yea, and ſome of them in their whole courſe, to the ſhame of moſt Chriſtians; the ſparks of our own kindling will riſe and flie upward, but yet they fall ſhort: <note place="margin">Iſa. 27.</note> Becauſe alas, 1. It leads us not to Jeſus Chriſt, and by his own ſtrength no man ſhall prevail for heaven, but he muſt lay hold upon the ſtrength of God in Chriſt. The Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt is a myſterie hid from ages, from all people, but where the Lord is pleaſed by the preaching of the Goſpel to make manifeſt the ſavour thereof. Now there is no other name, but the name o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Jeſus Chriſt whereby men can be ſaved. 2. Becauſe alas, there is not any of them but they <hi>hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> though <note place="margin">Acts 4. 11.</note> they do much, yet they have a light more abundant in them then they walk up to. It is impriſoned in their underſtandings, not ſhed abroad upon their hearts, ſo that they could ſee nothing but folly and that which is worſe. And ſo every one muſt needs be condemned of his own heart.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Common grace and gifts of grace, that will carry a man very far, there is a taſte of the heavenly gift, and the powers of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>the world to come;</hi> and this will ſeem to enliven and warm the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and carry out a man to do great things; as thoſe fooliſh Virgins had, and ſo <hi>Ananias,</hi> and others.</p>

Thirdly, with all theſe, <hi>a mans ſecret falſe ends concurring, help to carry on a man far. Judas</hi> had the bag, which he loved more then Chriſt, and as long as he had the bag he was well enough, he could follow on; ſo long as there were loaves to be had by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, what multitudes follow him, and throng upon him? Our Saviour knew their deepeſt ends, though haply they ſaw them not; their hearts were too deep for themſelves, but not for him. So many ends, ſo many ſprings and weights there are upon <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 26.</note> a man, which will add ſomewhat of ſtrength to him in his courſe; they are indeed the marrow of the bones that moyſten them, and give life and vigor to his actions. So it may be a man cannot keep his conſcience quiet, it is rouſed a little, and is dogged, and ſnarls, and it will not be quiet, except he ſtop the mouth of it with ſome duty and ſervice, and following the waies of God as to the externals. And ſo a mans glory and honour, ſpecially when Religion is in repute, it is a diſhonour to be eſteemed otherwiſe; mens reputations will carry them further then we are aware of. Yea, if the waies of God were diſcountenanced, yet a man may go far in them upon this end, to have his name much ſet by, as a couragious heroical ſpirit, he may ſuffer much, and yet not love Jeſus Chriſt: It is then, love to himſelf, to his honour, or ſomewhat elſe that is the ground of it; but alas, Brethren, when all this is done, it may carry a man near the Kingdom of heaven, but he ſhall fall ſhort. And that upon theſe two conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe, though they may come near Chriſt, and haply delude themſelves, and think they have him, <hi>yet they never were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ted into him;</hi> and hiſtorical faith and temporarie, that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the times, a man may have, and miraculous too, and yet never implanted into Chriſt; and then, though a man may come near the Kingdom of heaven, yet if be he Chriſtleſs, he is undone, he muſt needs be ſhut out. The Lord will in giving thoſe gifts, thoſe common gifts of the Spirit to men, honour himſelf by them; he will have glory, but they may never have the comfort of them, they may tend to their further ſinking and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe that all thoſe things, though precious in themſelves, yet <hi>they never change a mans heart,</hi> it remaineth the ſame ſtill, ſo they never do him real ſpiritual good; <hi>Judas</hi> a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:115245:257"/>
a Devil, though it appeared not to men, becauſe cloathed over with ſo many common gifts and graces. And ſo <hi>Ananias</hi> his heart was not throughly changed. Alas Brethren, the giving of theſe gifts to men, whereby they do much, as a gift of prayer, or a gift of prophecying, or preaching, whereby they do much, and paſs for eminent perſons with men, they are but like flowers laid in a window, as Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi> compareth them, they grow not; Or elſe, as outlandiſh plants removed into another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, they grow not, they proſper not, becauſe the ſoil is not changed; the grace they have doth not <hi>redundare in perſonam,</hi> make their perſons good, no more then a pearl in a ſwines ſnou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, changeth the nature of the ſwine; the pearl is a pearl and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but the ſwine is a ſwine, and filthy in her diſpoſition. And ſo beauty in a whoriſh woman, it is beautiful and lovely, but ſhe is nevertheleſs whoriſh and abominable; and therefore notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Attainments of a man by nature, by common grace, by his own ends, which will carry him very far, put a great luſtre upon him, ſeem to bid fair for heaven, carry a man after the things of God to the very laſt, it may be, yet it will not change a man, and therefore no admittance for him, he is ſhut out when all is done.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then Brethren, If a man may go ſo far and yet fall ſhort, <note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> What will become of them that never ſet foot forward toward heaven to this day?

Brethren, what do you mean? ſure you will never come ſo much as near the Kingdom of heaven: If any periſh, you are the ſinners are ſure
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:115245:257"/>
to periſh. They fell ſhort that came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you that never came out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> if you are yet by your fleſh-pots, your Garlick and Onions of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and will not be beaten off your loathſom delights of the fleſh, your mirth, and company, and gaming, and dicing, and drabbing, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Muſt a mans righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Phariſees, or he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 20.</note> this Brethren? What will become of thee then, that art ſo far from what they did? they prayed often, much, and long; they faſted often, they gave much alms, paid tythe of all; they were no extortioners, nor unjuſt, but thou art ſuch a one; they were no drunkards, but thou art a drunkard; they were no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean adulterers, but thou art one; and yet they fell ſhort, and where wilt thou appear? the Lord ſhew you how unlikely you are for heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this ſheweth alſo the woful condition of hypocrites, <note place="margin">

O Brethren, above all others, hypocrites will be cloathed with the deepeſt confuſion, becauſe they have been men of the faireſt hopes for heaven. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>he went away ſorrowful;</hi> for it muſt needs be ſo, for he was a man of more light then <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 22.</note> others, and ſurely had a conviction that Jeſus was the Meſſiah, &amp; that it would be advantagious to have him, and therefore coming <note place="margin">Job. 27. 9.</note> ſo near to him, and yet put back, <hi>he went away ſorrowful:</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man would have made nothing of ſuch a repulſe: hypocrites have great enlightnings, and they have had <hi>a taſte of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gift,</hi> as I may ſay, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a bunch of grapes to taſte the ſweetneſs of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and encourage them to go in to poſſeſs it. <note place="margin">Numb. 13. 23.</note>

O this, when God turned them back into the wilderneſs for their rebellion, that they ſhould periſh there, was a great aggravation of their miſery; if they had never come ſo near it, and never taſted of it, they had not known what they had loſt, what they had deprived themſelves of. So here ſurely Brethren, hypocrites have many a taſte, they have ſome glimmerings of heavens light and glory, ſomewhat they have to draw them on to the very borders, therefore for them to be turned off here and ſhut out, O ſure it will much aggravate their miſery: Ah wretch that I was, to come ſo near, take ſo much pains for heaven, and yet that I ſhould miſs it, will be the doleful ditty of hypocrites to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It may teach all young beginners, that are now, as I may ſay, ſtarting in the race that is ſet before us, <hi>that you look to it,</hi> Brethren, <hi>you be ſo furniſhed as to be able to run ſo as to obtain;</hi>

Ah dear friends, it will be worth your pains to look into the truth of your condition, though it coſt you many an hour, many a hot and cold fit, yet give it not over, be ſure of this one thing, that you be bottomed on Jeſus Chriſt, and have his Spirit to dwell in you, his fear put in you according to the Covenant of grace, and then you ſhall never depart from him, you ſhall never fall ſhort. If once you be but in him, you ſhall enter in with him; the reaſon why theſe fooliſh Virgins entred not, <hi>they were not in Chriſt,</hi> they had nothing but their own account, their own profeſſion, and what they could rap and rend, and get from the creature: alas, this was nothing, though it might carry them thus far, it would not make way for their entrance into glory; therefore let me beg of you to make this one thing neceſſary ſure, neglect this, and all is nothing.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It may teach all of us, even ſuch as have not only begun, but gone far, taken much pains for heaven, to tremble and fear, leſt for want of a little more, we fall ſhort. Ah dear friends, <note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> if we would offer violence to heaven, it muſt be while we are here, when the door is ſhut it is too late; therefore now let us preſs, and ſpare no pains, and look to theſe two things.</p>

                        <hi>to Chriſt for Grace, yet they will come to him for Glory.</hi> While Jeſus Chriſt is diſpenſing the Grace of the Kingdom, they neglect him and his Grace, they are buſied about ſomewhat elſe; but when he is to diſpenſe the Glory of his Kingdom, then every one will come to him; <hi>Luke 14. 18. They cannot come, but now they will come.</hi> This is clear in the preſent caſe: Theſe fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, they would not come to Chriſt for Grace; for you ſee how many times they were beaten off from the Creature, and yet they faſtned again, when their Lamps failed, which were ſparks of their own kindling, or elſe ſome common work at moſt; then they went to the wiſe Virgins, not to Chriſt; when they repulſed them, ſent them away empty, they went to them that ſold, they would by no means come to Jeſus Chriſt, not a word of that; and yet now the Glory of the Kingdom is to be diſpenſed, you ſee n ow they cry Lord, Lord, open to us: if they had taken this courſe before, and cryed, Lord, Lord, when their Lamps were gone out, O Lord, now we ſee our own ſparks dye before they reach heaven. O pardon this our Hypocriſie, and O give us of thine oyl, thou art the Olive-tree, pour out of thy oyl into our veſſels, as they went to the wiſe Virgins, and this in truth of heart, they had had oyl, they had been ready, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with Chriſt; no, but they would not; and ſee now, when the Gate was ſhut upon them, now they cry, Lord, Lord, open to us; they would not come to him for the wedding Garment, but they would be beholding to him to let them in to the <hi>Feaſt</hi> without one; though heaven would have held them but a little while, if they had entred in that condition. So the Jews, <hi>They would not come to Chriſt, that they might have life;</hi> that they <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 40. 7. 34.</note> might have the life of Grace, and then the life of Glory; but they would come to him to have the life of Glory. <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek</hi>

The grounds of this are ſuch as theſe; Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it is a principle indelebly written in nature, to will happineſs the end in general;</hi> (that is to ſay) happineſs is not that which cometh under deliberation and matter of choice at all, but only the means that tend to that end: no man living can poſſibly prevail with himſelf to be willing to be miſerable: it is as natural as for the fire to fly upward, or the ſtone to decline downward. A <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> would die the death of the rigteous, he would go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when all is done, notwithſtanding his Sorceries and Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> and Divinations againſt <hi>Iſrael.</hi> A man would think ſuch a wretch as he, that would have curſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> fain, if God would have hearkened to him, a deadly enemy he was to them, that he ſhould ſcarce have deſired to come where they ſhould be; As I have heard of ſome whoſe ſpleen hath been ſo great againſt the people of God, that if they came to heaven, they would never come thither; ſuch are worſe then <hi>Balaam, yet he would die the death of the righteous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe of the woful ataxie and diſorder that is in all our ſouls, whereby we are in all things prepoſterous, in all things that are ſupernatural;</hi> in things purely natural and civil we do not expect the end without the means, none but fools and mad men do it. A man would live and have his health, this he deſireth, therefore he will eat, you cannot perſwade him to ſtarve himſelf with hunger; he will take phyſick, though never ſo loathſom, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo bitter to him, &amp; what ever it coſt him, <hi>skin for skin, and all he hath, he will give for his life;</hi> this is the higheſt end he hath in theſe things; but now in ſpirituals there is nothing but confuſion, the end we do confuſedly aim at, we would have it; doubtleſs there is not the verieſt unbeliever that heareth this, this day, but would have heaven, and you cannot with all the arguments you can bring, make him willing to periſh in an everlaſting ſeparation from God, if he underſtand any thing what he ſaith; yet he would have this without the means, without this union and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Lord Jeſus, whereby he may be made meet for it.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Becauſe of mens unbelief and unacquaintance with the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of ſalvation, the myſterie of free Grace in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> they do not believe that a man muſt come to Chriſt for Grace, or elſe they can have no Glory from him; <hi>That he is the way, the truth,</hi>

                        <hi>and the life;</hi> they think he will ſave them upon any terms; he came to be a Saviour of ſinners, and ſinners they are, and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our he is, and therefore let Miniſters ſay what they will, they think if they have but time to cry Lord, Lord, though it be when the Gate is ſhut, as theſe fooliſh Virgins, it will do. Ah brethren, if the fooliſh Virgins had been acquainted with this, that they muſt have their oyl from Chriſt, or elſe they ſhould never hold out, nor enter with him; would they not inſtead of thoſe trifling, impertinent endeavours, made ſome application to him all that while? but they ſaw it not, it was hid from their eyes; <hi>The Lord will give Grace and Glory,</hi> and never will he <note place="margin">Pſal. 84. 11.</note> give Glory ſure, if he give not Grace. O for hearts to believe this, it would be a cure of this diſorder.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Becauſe of the enmity that is in our hearts againſt Grace,</hi> nothing is more contrary: wherevever Grace cometh, there is a continuall quarrel between it and ſin: the holy Ghoſt when he cometh to dwell in a heart, he knoweth he muſt have no peace there, but continually luſt againſt the fleſh, and endure <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> the luſtings of the fleſh againſt it ſelf. O brethren then, where a heart is altogether in ſin, what an enemy is it to Grace, and to Chriſt, as the Author of Grace? (ſo ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>you, while you were enemies in your minds through</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Col. 1. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>wicked works, hath he reconciled:</hi> now a man will hardly come to an enemy to help him, except he be in very great ſtraits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: as when men are ſinking into hell, then they will come to Chriſt for entrance into heaven: for then their miſery is preſent and imminent, they ſee there is no avoiding of it: hell is at their backs, the avengers of blood are now upon them, ready to hurry them away to deſtruction: therefore now it is high time for them to cry, Lord, Lord, open to us: but while they can but keep theſe things at a diſtance, put off the thoughts of heaven and hell, they care not for coming to Chriſt at all: yet as great as their enmity is, it may be overlaid by the preſent apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their neceſſity and danger they are in if they come not to him; and this is that brings in any ſoul to Chriſt for Grace here, while he is diſpenſing Grace, until the Lord let the Sinner ſee his ſins in order before him, ſee the hand-writing upon the wall againſt him, <hi>Mene, Mene,</hi> until God write his condemnation upon his Conſcience in bloody Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:115245:261"/>
and viſible, that he that runs may read it; he careth not for coming to Chriſt for Grace, and ſo for heaven; if a man neglect all this, yet when God ſheweth him the rivers of burning brimſtone, ſheweth the teeth of the worm which is ready to faſten upon him, opens a mans ears to hear Satan come jingling with his chain to fetch his ſoul, to tear it away whether he will or no: O then, though he hath no mind to go to Chriſt, now he will go and cry, Lord, Lord open to me.</p>
                     <p>Why, <hi>But you will ſay, If he be ſuch an enemy to Grace, and to Chriſt, as diſpenſing Grace, is he not much more an enemy to Chriſt, as glorious, and receiving ſinners to Glory?</hi> Yea bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I believe for my part, that they are ſuch enemies to an heavenly work, a glorious ſtate, that if they were admitted with ſuch hearts as they have, it would be a weary place to them, they cannot endure the reflection of the ſun upon a burniſh'd ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how will they endure the face of the Son of righteouſneſs himſelf? but the ſence of their danger, and looking upon heaven as a place of freedom from the torments of the condemned, not as upon an holy place, wherein Grace is made glorious, therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to enter; alas, what would theſe fooliſh Virgins have done there, if they had entred in this unready condition? heaven would have been too hot to hold them; but freed they would be from miſery, happy they would be, poor creatures, though they mind not that the happineſs of heaven is ſuch, as if they had not had Grace firſt to make them meet for it, it would have been no happineſs to them. What is more tedious to them then the Glory of Holineſs upon the Saints, then ſpiritual communion with God? they cannot bear this. All delight ariſeth from ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs between the object and faculty, and all grief and trouble from the unſuitableneſs of the object and faculty, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Grace glorified is ſo much the more unſuitable; but yet I ſay, they apprehending that miſery is approaching, would go any wihther for ſhelter.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly and laſtly, <hi>Becauſe now they can keep their luſts no longer, therefore now they would have heaven;</hi> as long as the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can keep his luſt, he will be for no other Maſter nor Lord, he cares for no other pleaſure; the pleaſures of ſin are the fools paradiſe to the wanton, and ſo is ſport and paſtime to the young gallant, they care not for any thing ſerious. If men could keep
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:115245:261"/>
the world for ever, they would never deſire to come to heaven; they could be contented to have their heaven upon earth; their inward thought is, <hi>they ſhall continue for ever, they call their houſes after their own names,</hi> and they think as they would have it; now <note place="margin">Pſal. 49. 11.</note> when they ſee they can hold the world no longer, now they would have heaven; therefore they care not for Grace, ſo long as they can have their fill of theſe delights; if men be Hypocrites, cloſe Hypocrites, have no open prophaneſs or luſt, yet ſome ſecret <hi>Dalilah</hi> they have that they delight themſelves with; but when the pangs of hell begin to catch hold upon men, when their conſciences do catch of the fire of hell, and this to flame, they ſee they are going, and there is no other way with them but one, and being at the brink (as I may ſay) the flame catcheth upon them, as it did thoſe Executioners in <hi>Daniel,</hi> then, O for heaven; Lord, Lord, deliver us, ſave us.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It may ſerve then to humble us brethren, all of us, before the Lord;</hi> for this is the frame of all our hearts by nature, though the Lord Jeſus ſo loved ſinners, that nothing was too dear for them, even to his very life and blood, and yet we are all of us ſo unkind to him again, that we would never come to him, we would not be beholding to him, through the pride of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:115245:262"/>
our hearts, until we cannot ſubſiſt without him, and then we will come, though it be too late; ſo that upon the matter Brethren, we do but make Jeſus Chriſt our ſinning ſtock all the dayes of our lives, and yet when we can ſin no more, we would ſerve our own turns upon him meerly, we would have entrance into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by him, we deſire him not for any lovelineſs that is in him, or in the Grace which is revealed by him: Is not this great cauſe of humbling? As ſuppoſe a Prince that <hi>deperit virginem,</hi> a poor, ragged, filthy creature, and he even dies for love of her: ſo be that ſhe will but come and take him, ſhe ſhall have all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of a wife; his honour ſhall be hers, his crown hers, his beauty hers: ſhe ſhall be like him alſo, be ſhe as uncomely as ſhe may, he will put off his comlineſs upon her: no, ſhe will not hear of coming to him at all, until at laſt, ſhe is even periſhing, and then cometh, and would have his Glory, but not himſelf, meerly to ſerve her ſelf upon him. O this is great unkindneſs! <hi>do you thus requite the Lord, ye fooliſh people and unwiſe?</hi> And thus it is with all us, until the Lord mightily change us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It may ſerve to convince us of our folly herein:</hi> folly is a thing we cannot endure the imputation of: But what greater folly is it, then brethren, to diſ-joyn the end from the means, ſpecially where the end is ſo neceſſary to be had to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and the means ſo abſolutely neceſſary to that end? ſurely then this is groſs folly: he is a fool that would have health and ſtrength, and yet will not eat, nor drink, nor ſleep, nor recreate, will not uſe the means: well brethren, you would have heaven every one of you, you would have this bleſſed ſlate after death, we are carried to it with a natural <hi>impetus,</hi> the end is neceſſary, we muſt enter or periſh for ever. 2. This means is as abſolutely neceſſary to come to Jeſus Chriſt, when the door ſtands open, while his bowels and boſom are open and ready to receive us, for when the door is ſhut, there is no remedy; we may enter, if we come while the door is open, afterward we cannot. Now is not he a fool in grain, that will trifle when the door ſtands open, and even goeth a begging to poor ſinners, and yet think to enter when the door is ſhut? Ah Brethren, this folly fils every ſinners heart: What is the reaſon elſe ſo few are perſwaded, while it is called to day, to come, <hi>to ſeek him early, that they may find him?

                     <p>HEre is the ſad Cataſtrophe of all the hopes of the Hypocrite in the Parable, and that wherewith I ſhall conclude my thoughts upon this Text; they would not be beaten off, though the door was ſhut againſt them; they come and bounce againſt it, with a Lord, Lord, open to us; to you, who are you, that I ſhould open the Gate now it is ſhut upon you? upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance ſhall I do this for you? you are ſtrangers to me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto you, I know you not. In this ſimilitude is held

out to us the doom of Hypocrites, and ſuch as are not found ready for the coming of Chriſt; Or if you will, rather the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the doom; the door was ſhut upon them, before they are excluded heaven, there is no entrance, there is a repulſe; and here the reaſon of it is given, as there in <hi>Mat. 7. Depart from me,</hi> ſaith he, which is equivalent, it is as much as the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the door at leaſt, if not more; the ſame reaſon is there given for it, <hi>I know you not.</hi> So that here ſeems to be two or three things note-worthy in theſe words: I will ſpeak briefly to them, and diſmiſs all, winding it up in one application.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That many that profeſs to know Jeſus Chriſt, and to be his people, yet are not known of him;</hi> he knoweth them not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Such as he doth not know, ſhall not enter;</hi> the door is ſhut againſt them; and when they plead to have it opened, they have a denial, which is preſuppoſed, and (as I may ſay) included in the exceptive particle <hi>but; Lord, Lord, open to us, But he anſwered, I know you not;</hi> therefore I will not open the door to you.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whatever formal Profeſſors may delude themſelves with, as if known of God, then it ſhall be declared to them, that he knoweth them not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Firſt, <hi>That many that profeſs Jeſus Chriſt, and to know him, yet are never known of Chriſt;</hi> That this is ſo, I think the Text is as clear as the noon-day; as for theſe fooliſh Virgins, they did go forth to meet the Bridegroom, had their Lamps, took pains to trim them when they were out, and you ſee they have a Lord, Lord, in their mouths, at the very laſt, and yet ſaith our Saviour, ſaith the Bridegroom, <hi>I know you not;</hi> do but add that other Text, and there will need no more proof; and that is in <hi>Mat. 7. Many ſhall ſay unto me at that day, Lord, Lord, open to us;</hi> juſt as here, as if the door was ſhut upon them there as well as here; but what is it they plead? O ſay they, <hi>We have propheſied in thy name, and done many wonderful works, wrought miracles in the name of Chriſt; thou haſt eat and drank in our ſtreets;</hi> ſurely prophecying and working miracles in the name of Chriſt, will amount to as much as profeſſion of him; they muſt needs have his name called upon them, that could do ſuch things in his name: and yet mark the return, <hi>Depart from me, I never knew you:</hi> never knew you, not before time, nor
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:115245:263"/>
ſince the world began did I know you; but chiefly I never knew you, (that is to ſay) when your profeſſion was at the higheſt, when your Grace was moſt green upon the houſe-top, then I knew you not, therefore now I know you not.</p>
                     <p>Here I ſhall only endeavour to open to you what is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by Chriſts knowing of a ſoul, and ſo come to the next Note from the words, becauſe I would haſten to an end.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, it is not to be underſtood, as if the Lord did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the wayes of an Hypocrite, and ſee the cloſe contrivances of his heart, as if he did not know who they are: and properly to ſpeak of knowledge, it is not the paint of the ſepulchre can hide the rottenneſs within from his al-ſeeing eye; it is not the fair <note place="margin">Ier. 17. 9.</note> leaves that can deceive him, and cover the rottenneſs of the root from him; did he not underſtand <hi>Judas</hi> from the beginning, and knew he was a white Devil, a ſon of perdition, though he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him as his Saviour? well were it for Hypocrites, if in this ſenſe the Lord did not know them; and ſurely their hearts do ſo conclude with thoſe Atheiſts in the Pſalm, <hi>The Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth it not, and is there knowledge in the moſt high?</hi> but thus <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 11.</note> he doth know them, and that appears plainly by his not knowing of them, as afterwards we ſhall mention; and that appears by his declaration to them, <hi>that he knoweth them not;</hi> he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth full well to whom he ſpeaketh this fearful ſentence, but this is but the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Yet after the manner of men,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, he may be ſaid not to know them. I know you not, you are ſo deformed and diſ-figured, ſo utterly unlike the men you were when you came out of my hands, that I know you not. As <hi>Jobs</hi> friends when they came unto him, his viſage being ſo marred with the affliction, it is ſaid, <hi>they knew him not;</hi> which ſome underſtand as a weak affirmative, (that <note place="margin">Iob 2. 12.</note> is to ſay) they ſcarce knew him; is this <hi>Job</hi> their ancient friend? Is this <hi>Naomi?</hi> they ſcarce knew her to be the ſame perſon that formerly, ſhe was ſo altered; paint will exceedingly deform <note place="margin">Ruth 1. 19.</note> them that uſe it, they ſay; but ſure I am, Hpyocriſie is the greateſt deformity, it is the picture of Satan, <hi>who changeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> and therefore after the manner of men, we may look upon this ſpeech of Chriſt as thus, I know you not, you have ſuch ſtrange apparrel on, you have
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:115245:264"/>
ſuch paint, ſuch deformity, ſo ugly have you made your ſelves, I know you not.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>He is ſaid not to know them, in that he doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of them;</hi> in this ſenſe knowing perſons and things is often taken, <hi>Pſalm 1. The Lord knoweth the way of the upright,</hi> the righteous, he approveth of it, though this be not all in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as by and by you ſhall ſee; but this is one thing, <hi>He deligheth in his way, he knoweth his people,</hi> at the laſt day, as he knoweth not Hypocrites, and this is part of it, <hi>Well done, good and faithful ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. he approveth of them. And ſo the <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 21.</note> Jews, that is, <hi>One inwardly and circumciſed in heart, whoſe praiſe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>is not of men, but of God;</hi> he is approved to God, and approved by God. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, That evil which I do, I allow</hi>

                        </gap>, I know not, (that is to ſay) I approve not of it. I judge and condemn my ſelf for it; I would not do it, becauſe I allow not of it: and to come nearer, even to the ſame uſe of the expreſſion, applyed to God himſelf, <hi>They ſet up Kings, but I</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>knew it not,</hi> ſaith the Lord, it was not by me, by my advice, I approved not of it; <hi>They would needs have a King, and I yielded</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 11. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>to them indeed, but it was in wrath and diſpleaſure;</hi> I never knew it, (that is to ſay) never approved of it: elſe he did underſtand it, and reproved them for it alſo at that very time by the Prophet <hi>Samuel.</hi> And by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> though there was his diſpoſing hand in it, and in a way of providence he gave the ten Tribes to him, yet he approved not of their revolting; the people had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from him, nor did they ſtay for it, to ſeparate from the houſe of <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>He is ſaid to know men, when he not only approveth of them in their wayes, but loveth and favoureth them;</hi> and not to know them, when he doth not love them nor favour them: as we are ſaid to know God, when we love him, and keep his commandments; ſo he is ſaid to know us, when he loveth us; and ſo that may be underſtood, <hi>He that loveth God, is known of God;</hi> (that is to ſay) is loved of him, favoured of him: <hi>For he</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>that loveth me, my Father will love him, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> In the Hebrew Verbs of knowledge, <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 21.</note> affection is included: and the ground of this ſeemeth to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know Love breedeth familiarity, and familiarity breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowledge and acquaintance: and ſo on the contrary, where
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:115245:264"/>
no love, there is eſtrangedneſs, and that ends in a not knowing of a Perſon; ſo then, he knoweth not many that profeſs, (that is to ſay) he loveth them not.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>This knowing here ſpoken of, may be alſo an owning of them for his own; an acknowledging of them: You only have I known,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>of all the People and Nations of the earth, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Amos 3. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>therefore I will not paſs by you unpuniſhed;</hi> (that is to ſay) I have owned you of all the families upon the earth: you have been taken for my family: I have owned you, and therefore you ſhall be ſure to be viſited with the ſtripes and rods of men, not to deſtroy. So ſaith he to <hi>Moſes, I know thee by name;</hi> (that <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 12. &amp; 17.</note> is to ſay) I acknowledge thee, and own thee in a neer manner indeed; therefore that place of <hi>Amos</hi> is no more then that of the Apoſtle, <hi>I chaſtiſe every ſon whom I receive:</hi> this knowing them <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note> then, may be ſuch an acknowledging of them for his own, they never were his children, never given of his Father, nor came to him, and therefore he acknowledgeth them not as his in ſo near a relation.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>He knoweth them not by experience,</hi> (as I may ſay) he hath had no experience of them, they never came to him, to touch him, that vertue might go forth from him to heal them, and pardon them, and therefore he knoweth them not, (that is to ſay) he never had a touch of faith from them, whereby they are ſaid to know him, for then he ſhould have known them, and have known that vertue went forth from him to heal them; he had no acquaintance with them, <hi>they never acquainted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with him, but their hearts were alway eſtranged and far from Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> though they drew near with their lips, their hearts never touched one with another; they reſted in ſomewhat elſe, as <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>miracles,</hi> and therefore he knoweth them not by experience of communion with him, and letting out his healing <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 23.</note> power upon them.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, <hi>He knoweth them not,</hi> (that is to ſay) <hi>he careth not for them, nor their ſouls, to defend them, ſave them: let them do what they will, be regardeth them not:</hi> As in that firſt Pſalm, <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly ſhall periſh:</hi> by the oppoſite, there it appeareth, that Gods knowing the way of the righteous, is to keep it from periſhing, the antecedent including the conſequent many

                     <p>Now who theſe are among profeſſors that the <hi>Lord knoweth not,</hi> I believe you eaſily underſtand; they are ſuch as are meerly formal, have a Lamp and no Oyl, a form and no power. But ſo much for this firſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The next Note from the words, you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was, <hi>That ſuch as he knoweth not, ſhall never enter into this Marriage-Feaſt,</hi> the door is ſhut upon them; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s is given as a reaſon, wherefore our Saviour would not open it to them upon their crying Lord, Lord; but he anſwered and ſaid, <hi>I know you not,</hi> there is no reaſon you ſhould expect to have the door opened, <hi>for I know you not;</hi> and ſo in that of <hi>Matthew,</hi> if he know them not, he ſends them away from him, <hi>Depart from me, for I know you not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe many that profeſs Jeſus Chriſt, yet are very ſtrangers to him, and he to them, and therefore they ſhall not have the door opened to them, they never knew him, nor he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew them, there was never any acquaintance; now ſtrangers that we never ſaw, who uſeth to admit to a Marriage-feaſt; they are the familiars and favorites; if Jeſus Chriſt knew them not, ſurely they are ſtrangers, for he knoweth all his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, his own ſheep, let their condition be what it will, under never ſuch deſertions and cloudings, and queſtionings of his love, he knoweth them: A woman may forget her children, but God cannot forget his people, if once acquainted with them; he writes their names before him; yea, upon his very heart they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:115245:265"/>
whither nothing can come to blot them out; now many a profeſſor is a meer ſtranger to Jeſus Chriſt, though he throng upon him, yet never toucheth him, he never had a ſight of Chriſt, a touch of him, is a ſtranger to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, to the holineſs of Chriſt, to the joy, and peace, &amp; Kingdom of grace, and therefore ſurely he will not admit them, he knoweth them not it is no place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ty, &amp; rejoyce in it for ever, which every profeſſor, alas is not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe of the pride of heart, which indeed is the great root of the former eſtrangedneſs of many a profeſſor from Chriſt, and Chriſt from them; what was the reaſon the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal would feed upon husks rather then go to his Father? O his ſtomack was too big to acknowledge his failing to his father, as long as ever he could hold out; and you ſee it plainly in the poor woman that had ſpent all ſhe had upon the Phyſitian, a ſtout heart would not down while ſhe had a peny. And ſurely you ſee you ſee here theſe fooliſh Virgins, they never went to Chriſt for oyl, but up and down where they could beg or buy of any body, they were too ſtomachful and ſlout; ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>They ſubmitted not to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> as if it were an <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 2. and 3.</note> act of ſubmiſſion and ſelf-emptying indeed, as it is to cloſe with the righteouſneſs of another, to be righteous and ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in; this they would not do, they would have heaven by their own works, or never have it: ſo the fooliſh Virgins would have oyl ſowewhere ſhort of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or they would go without, and ſo they do. Ah, we are proud beggers, proud of rags filthy rags; and the Lord knoweth the proud indeed, but it is afar off, he will never admit them to the neareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nion with himſelf for ever, therefore he will not open to them. This is the caſe of many a profeſſor, who will ſpin his own web, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                     <p>Thirdly. They are all of them workers of iniquity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will not know them; he approveth them not, he careth not for them, he will not admit them. <hi>David</hi> that had but a
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:115245:266"/>
ſpark of the holineſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt, the holy one of God, <note place="margin">Pſal. 101. 4. 119. 115.</note> and God equal with his Father, he would not know a wicked perſon, <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity,</hi> away with you, I am not company for you, I am a companion to all that fear God, both ſmall as well as great, though he were a King; and a vile perſon he contemned, be he as great as he would, away with him from me, what communion can light &amp; darkneſs have? can they dwell together? ſurely no: <hi>Depart from me, I know you not, ye workers of iniquity;</hi> into that holy place none that defileth can enter: now in this we may underſtand two things. (1.) That they do work iniquity, ſome ſin they live in, if not many, notwithſtanding their profeſſion of Chriſt, and therefore they are workers of iniquity. (2.) That the very form of godlineſs and all their ſhew, is but a working of iniquity.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, they are workers of ſome iniquity or other, and that either, in an outward groſs manner, as groſs hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, or elſe more cloſely and inwardly, as cloſe hypocrites, and yet they are workers of iniquity, and the Lord Jeſus will not know them, nor own them.

                     <p>(2.)

                     <p>Thirdly. Not our part of the Concluſion: that at that day it ſhall be declared openly to hypocrites, that the Lord Jeſus

At that day,</hi> that is to ſay, the day of general Judgement, or the day of death, which is every particular ſouls. Dooms day they ſhall ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and then will I ſay to them, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not,</hi> I never knew you.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, Why is this ſo, that at that day many Profeſſors ſhall have this doom <hi>I know you not, I never knew you;</hi> it ſhall be thus declared from the mouth of the Lord Jeſus himſelf; it may be taken from the Office of Jeſus Chriſt to be Judge; God hath appointed to judge the world at that day by one, even by Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore he ſhal pronounce the Sentence either with his own mouth, or the miniſtration of Angels; but rather <note place="margin">Acts 17. 31.</note> me thinks with his own mouth this word ſhal go forth, which ſhal be as a flaming two edged Sword to enter into the bones &amp; bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of ſinners, and divide them in ſunder for ever here ſinners are ſhut up under ſin, they have chains of darkneſs upon their hearts already, and hypocrites are lyable to this condemnation, and are held with the cords of their ſins, and then ſhall be the time of the doom, therefore then it ſhall be declared; a Priſoner fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what the ſentence may be before he cometh to the triall; and ſo hypocrites ſometimes may have ſome foretaſte, ſome fearfulneſs may ſurpriſe them, but they skin it over again; but now it ſhall be declared by the Judge himſelf, he knoweth them not, and therefore they muſt depart from him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>For a confirmation of the words of his ſervants, and an everlasting rebuke of their unbelief of his Word by them;</hi> for this hath been the meſſage of Chriſt to formaliſts in the mouths of all his Meſſengers, your form of godlineſs will not carry you through all conditions, it will fail you ſooner or latter; your fig leaves will not ſhadow you from the everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the hope of the hypocrite ſhall periſh and give up the Ghoſt, God loatheth no ſort of ſinners more, though they take themſelves to be highly favoured, yet they are deeply ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of God; yet alas, there is ſcarce an hypocrite but hath his ſhifts to put by an hundred ſuch thruſts as theſe, by the Sword

                     <p>Thirdly, For a Declaration and Vindication of his own Wiſdom, and Juſtice, and Holineſs; his Wiſdom in that now hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites ſhall ſee there was nothing could be hid from his eys, he knoweth through and through, even when they made the

moſt dazling profeſſion to the eye of the world, that his piercing eye ſaw through all this, ſaith the ſinner there in that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and it is the language of all hypocrites in heart, <hi>Tuſh, the Lord</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>ſeeth not, neither doth the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>regard it?</hi> doth he look to the thoughts, to a mans ends, the ſecrets of his ſoul? if he carry fair outwardly, will not this paſs the teſt? yea with men: but thou ſhalt know hypocrite, that thou haſt not to do with men, but with God; you may juggle ſo, as to caſt a miſt before mens eyes, but not before his; and though you think you can, yet he will now manifeſt it, that you have all of you been a deceived peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have thought to deceive him; he will now appear to be a God of wiſdom, and one that ſearcheth your hearts, and will recompence into your boſoms the very ſecrets of your iniquity. And ſo his juſtice and holineſs; becauſe an hypocrite hath flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed long, and hath had the uſe of many common gifts, and flouriſhed in the eyes of men, made a great ſhew, and God hath born with much patience; Juſtice hath been, as I may ſay, aſleep, but now he will repay them into their own boſoms; and ſo his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 21.</note> they thought God was ſuch a one as themſelves, but he will reprove them, and ſet their ſins in order before them. Now he will keep ſilence no longer, that it may appear how he hateth all their hypocriſie that hath been fathered upon him, and men have looked upon them as Saints, yet now his holineſs will endure no longer, but ſhake them off; they ſhall now ſee that ſuch impure hearts he cannot away with, to dwell with them, though with much patience he did bear them here, yet that he never knew them here, never owned them, cared for them here in the very height of their profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Becauſe now is the ſeparating time, nothing is hid that ſhall not be made manifeſt,</hi> ſaith our Saviour in another place, though chaff may go for wheat, and gilt for Gold, and alchimy for gold, and droſs and tin for ſilver, now they ſhall be ſeparated, it is high time now to unmask the hypocrite, he hath long enough deluded himſelf and others, now therefore he will make it known, himſelf will declare it, to put an end to their falſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: but enough for this.</p>
                     <p>Now to wind up all in a word of Application: In the firſt place, <hi>then it ſhall be a terrible word to all Formaliſts, all groſs and</hi>

                        <hi>cloſe hypocrites;</hi> the Lord ſearch you out this day, and make it a word of terrour, a ſhaking in your bones, that you may be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off your ſecurity. There are two or three things you ſhall ſee that are terrible to you herein, It is your portion, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it to you. Let not any poor trembling child of God catch at the dogs portion, no more then the dogs ſhould at the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread, God would not have ſuch ſadned, nor would I ſpeak any thing to the grief of ſuch as God hath wounded. But for Hypocrites and Formaliſts let me ſpeak it: 1. He knoweth you. 2. Therefore he doth not know you, becauſe he knoweth you. And, 3. He will not know you at that day.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I ſay, <hi>He knoweth you;</hi> that is to ſay, he underſtands you, there are windows of Chryſtal into your breaſts, <hi>all is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked before him with whom you have to do;</hi> it may be you are a little affected with hearing the death of Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent a perſon ſhould be ſo unworthily, treacherouſly and cruelly handled, and now you take your ſelves to be <hi>ſuch as have received the Spirit of grace and ſupplication,</hi> and mourn over Chriſt whom you have crucified; and it is nothing but a natural tenderneſs, that would be as much affected or moved with hearing any ſad ſtory of another perſon: Believe it Brethren, whether you ſee this deceit or no, the Lord knoweth it. Your ends are deep in your actions which ſeem to be for Chriſt, and with much ſelf-denyal ſometimes, and yet even then in that ſelf-denyal, there may be an end for ſelf at the bottom, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding wheel that ſetteth all a work; it may be this is too deep for any other to diſcern, or for your ſelves ſometimes, yet the Lord ſeeth it, he knoweth all the depth of your heart. You pray, and faſt, it may be, when you are in any diſtreſs, but little think it is for carnal end, for your corn, and wine, and oyl; that you howl upon your beds, you little think, <hi>when you pray and ſeek after God,</hi> it is for ends meerly that you might ſpend theſe <note place="margin">Hoſ. 7. 14.</note> things upon your luſts, that you may appear to be ſome body, be eſteemed among men, be of eſteem among the Saints. Well, Brethren, carry it as covertly as you can, ſo that your own ſouls are juggled into a deluſion it may be, <hi>yet be not deceived, God is not mocked;</hi> men are apt to be deceived, and think that their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of ſinning, <hi>their bread eaten in ſecret,</hi> their morſels under the tongue ſhall never be diſcovered, but the Lord ſeeth all this, he
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:115245:269"/>
knoweth you throughly, <hi>he ſearcheth the hearts, and tryeth the reins of the ſons of men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>becauſe he knoweth you, therefore he doth not know you, he approveth not of you;</hi> it may be men do approve of you, <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 4.</note> your praiſe may be among the Churches, among the Saints, but yet your praiſe may not be of God, he loveth you not, ſavours you not with that favour that he bears to his people; indeed ſome love Jeſus Chriſt had to the young man in the Goſpel that was but near to the Kingdom of God, he doth not diſallow of a form and profeſſion, it hath its uſe, the leaves of the trees of righteouſneſs they may be for healing to others; an holy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and walking to the appearance of others, may <note place="margin">Ezek. 47. 12.</note> win others to Chriſt, and yet a man may periſh when all is done; and a profeſſion may ſerve as a Motive to quicken up themſelves to look to the power; if the power of godlineſs be not good and neceſſary, why do men take up a form? and if it be good, why reſt they in a form and neglect it? but if there be no more, he will not know ſuch a man, he doth not know him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>What ever you dream of now, he will pronounce that ſentence upon you at that day, O that dreadful ſentence, that he knoweth you not, he never knew you.</hi> Ah dear friends, if the Lord would but ſingle out any one of us, and tell us we are the men, what agonies would it put us into? Ah Brethren, this will make ſinners ears tingle to hear this word from the Lord <note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 14.</note> Jeſus: O let fearfulneſs ſurprize the hypocrites; yea I tell you, this will make your hearts to bleed, and your heart-ſtrings crack within you, this will pierce you through with the ſorrows of hell. Ah dear friends, if the voice of his Meſſengers, diſcourſing of righteouſneſs, temperance, and Judgement to come, be ſo great as to make a <hi>Foelix,</hi> a great man, a ſtout hearted ſinner tremble that was not converted. O what will it be when the <note place="margin">Acts 24. 25.</note> ſentence is pronounced againſt them from the Lord himſelf? for while you hear Preachers, though it be terrible when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is opened, yet there is a Cordial at hand, but when once pronounced by the Lord Jeſus, there is no more remedy; if one word from the Lord Jeſus, when the Souldiers came upon him, and he asked them whom they ſought, <hi>I am he,</hi> ſaith he; this ſtruck them to the ground; ſouldiers in ſuch Garriſons in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries <note place="margin">Joh. 18. 6.</note>
                        <pb n="405" facs="tcp:115245:269"/>
kept by the ſword they were won by, uſe to to be men of ſtouteſt ſpirits, that would dare ſometimes the very Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and yet one word from Jeſus Chriſt's mouth ſtruck them to the ground. O Brethren, ſurely this word of ſentence will ſpeak men not to the ground, but to the lowermoſt pit: It will ſpeak them dumb forthwith, that they have nothing to ſay for themſelves; It will ſpeak them into confuſion and amazement, it will ſpeak them into the flames of hell in a moment: <hi>O this roaring of the Lyon of the tribe of</hi> Judah, <hi>who may abide? If the Law was ſo terrible in the giving, what will it be in the execution?</hi> You read how the Mountains ſhook, &amp; <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf trembled, <hi>but the ſentence of the Law is nothing to the ſentence of the Goſpel, as this condemnation of hypocrites will be;</hi> it is to men that have <note place="margin">Acts 7. 32.</note> in appearance owned Chriſt, followed him, done much in his name, and yet he will profeſs <hi>he never knew them,</hi> they pretended acquaintance with him now, but he will never own them.</p>
                     <p>You then Brethren, that have only a ſemblance of holineſs, you ſeem to have ſomewhat, and have nothing, then ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from you that which you ſeemed to have, then your vizard will be pluckt off; you pretend to be friends of Chriſt, and of his people, to be his Father, Brethren and Mother, but now will he profeſs he knoweth you not; you that preach in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and do not preach for his name, for his glory, but for your own; he will not own you, he will ſay to you, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you not, you reſt in this your form, this you are ready to plead, and not ſtay your ſelves upon him, he will not know you, O but we do lean upon the Lord: ſo you ſay, but mark that of the Prophet, you lean upon the Lord, and ſay, <hi>the Lord is among</hi>

Ah dear friends, I doubt many of us will be found <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note> with the fooliſh Virgins, following after the creature, reſting in ſomewhat elſe beſide the Lord Jeſus.

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:115245:270"/>
no difference between us and other men, open the mouths of the wicked, and this conſtantly, and without a returning to him, will he own ſuch a ſoul think you? O how can we be contented to be uncertain in our conditions, leſt when all is done, we ſhould be diſowned, ſhut out at that day.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Then Brethren, let us all labour and be exhorted to it, to ſtudy to approve our hearts to God, more then to men; a needful leſſon to us all, and it will be our wiſdom ſurely; for alas, what if men know us, and own us, and favour us as Saints, and precious people, and Jeſus Chriſt will not know our ſouls, will this countervail? O Brethren ſee to it, that your praiſe be <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 29.</note> not of men but of God! O how apt we are to be lifted up and cheared if men think well of us! and dejected if we ſuffer in their breaſts, if they diſown us, to be caſt out of their hearts, would go to our hearts it may be, and we could not be quiet. Alas, what is this to that fearful ſentence, <hi>I know you not:</hi> If Chriſt diſown us, what is it if all the Saints ſhould own us? and if he own us, what ſhould it diſcourage us, though they none of them own us. <hi>O labour to be more inward Chriſtians, and build your comforts upon the ſure mercies of</hi> David <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> No matter what is the riſing way in the world, which is the riſing Sun; Look to the mind of Chriſt, keep a conſcience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence toward him, and make this your work, to be found in him when all is done, not in your gifts, not in your duties, not in your graces, but in Chriſt. O ſuch a ſoul knoweth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and ſuch a ſoul is known of him, and ſhall be known to all eternity.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Here is an encouraging word to poor doubting ſouls; It may be they are ready to paſs this fearful ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, ſooner then many a wretched hard-hearted hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, to whom it properly belongs; No matter man, though thy gifts be not ſo great as another mans, thou canſt do little, or haſt not thoſe ſweet refreſhings and enlargements which another hath; Is thy heart approved to Jeſus Chriſt, canſt thou approve thy ſoul to him, <hi>that thou loveſt him?</hi> as <hi>Peter, Lord thou knoweſt that I love thee;</hi> though it may be not ſo much as other Saints do, nor ſo much as the great things he hath done for thee call for; yet thou loveſt him, and wouldſt fain love him more; <hi>be of good</hi>

O therefore, Brethren, though your grace be weak and little at the firſt, if there be the root of the matter in thee, if thou canſt approve thy heart thou loveſt him, there is nothing in heaven nor in earth thou wouldeſt have in compariſon of him, though thy infirmities be many, temptations be many, thou art a poor wearied creature, it may be with thine own heart, <hi>be of good comfort, the Lord Jeſus hath already owned thee, and he will own thee in that day.</hi> And me thinks, Brethren, as on the one hand when ſuch bold confident ſouls, that make no other reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but of ſalvation, but they reckon without Jeſus Chriſt, when they meet with ſo ſad a diſappointment; in ſtead of an admittance, they meet with <hi>I know you not:</hi> O how will their hearts dye within them!

So when they rejected the Lord Jeſus, how fearful a day came on them? who could abide it? At the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 1100000. ſlain, (beſide near 100000. taken captive) This day burned like an Oven; O! a devouring fire it was: ſo fearful a thing its to have a day of grace, a day of Chriſt come on a people, and yet they ſleight it and reject it: Greateſt love rejected, turns into greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; flaming love into flaming wrath; heat of affection into a burning of an oven, a furnace. Hear and tremble (Brethren) at this, we who now have a day of Chriſt, and a day of grace, leſt we find it in the end ſuch a day as this, ſo terrible to us.</p>
                     <p>But now, leſt thoſe mourners in <hi>Zion</hi> (that did wait for the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did fear the name of the Lord, were tender, and did tremble at this his word) ſhould be diſcouraged; he opens here a creek to let them in to hide themſelves; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a ſhadow, a skreen to ſet between them and this conſuming fire, in the words of my Text, <hi>But unto you that fear my name, ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ariſe with healing in his wings: Ye that tremble at my word ſhall not be ſcorched, nor this ſmell of the fire paſs on you; as it was with the three children.</hi> The day of the Lord ſhall be a wounding to others, but it ſhall be a healing to you: they ſhall be caſt into a burning oven as ſtubble or hay, <hi>but ye ſhall go forth and grow up as calves of the ſtall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that the words are nothing elſe (as I conceive) but a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace tempered into a cordial for poor drooping Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which might now be ready to faint to hear how terrible a day this day of the Lord would be, which they had expected, promiſing themſelves ſo much happineſs in it, and their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould not be fruſtrated, he would not make them aſhamed of their hope.</p>

                        <hi>But unto you that fear my name,</hi> &amp;c. Here is Chriſt promiſed (who is the Covenant, the ſubſtance of it, the mediator, the

                     <p>Therefore firſt we ſhall ſpeak to that promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>unto you that fear my name ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his wings;</hi> and yet before we ſpeak to the promiſe it ſelf, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we muſt ſay to the notion under which he is repreſented in this promiſe, and that is <hi>a Sun of righteouſneſs;</hi> from whence we will obſerve this Note.</p>

                     <p>There are two things (Brethren) here to be cleared. Firſt, that he is a Sun to his people. And ſecondly, a Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and what is meant by that.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, for that he is a Sun; if it be granted that its he who is here meant, there need not much more to be ſaid to make it good. And that its a particular promiſe of Chriſt-God, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the fleſh (ſurely) none will queſtion: for who elſe is it that's that good Phyſitian that can give healing but he? <hi>I am the Lord</hi>

                        <hi>that healeth thee;</hi> but that will appear better afterward. Let me add for the preſent a Scripture or two more to back this with, That Chriſt is held forth to us in Scripture, under the Metaphor of a Sun, ariſe and ſhine (ſaith the Lord to his people in their low and afflicted ſtate) he commands <hi>Babylon</hi> to come down, <note place="margin">Iſa. 60. 1.</note> ſo he would have his people to lift up their hearts, ariſe out of the duſt wherein they had wallowed: Why, what is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? thy light is come, the glory of the Lord is riſen on thee: and who is this but the Lord Jeſus? is it not he that was given <hi>to be a light to lighten the Gentiles, to be the glory of his people Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 32.</note> the Sun is the glory of the heavens and earth, when it

breaks out, it maketh a glorious day, and every thing glorious whoſe beauty before did not appear, yea puts glory on things that had none before; its ſtrange to ſee (Brethren) things how glorious (even over-dazling the eyes) they appear, when the Sun ſhines on them, which have little or no glory at another time. And here in the ſecond verſe, darkneſs ſhall cover the earth, and groſs darkneſs the people: But the Lord ſhall ariſe on thee. Well, its he that is that light, that is that glory of the Lord. Add but that place in <hi>Luke,</hi> where he is ſaid to be the day-ſpring from on high, viſiting us through the tender mercies of our God: its true, the word there is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>), which ſignifieth <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 78.</note> either the riſing of the Sun moſt ordinarily, or elſe the place of the Suns riſing, the Eaſt; or elſe ſome render it, a branch that did ariſe out of the root of <hi>Jeſs.</hi> But me thinks that is not ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſcope of the place, for the next words are, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs: therefore we may here note, that the day-ſpring, or riſing of the Sun, is put for the Sun it ſelf by a Metonymie, and the Sun by a Metaphor put for Chriſt, he is the Sun, which riſing, maketh it day; yea ſome there are that would have it underſtood of the Sun at noon-day, of the riſing of the Sun to the meridian, where it ſhineth moſt gloriouſly and moſt hot, according to that in <hi>Matthew,</hi> where the Sun riſeth <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 6.</note> they wither that ſpring up quickly, and have no root; that is, the Sun ariſing to its height, then it ſcorcheth and withereth. And this I will not altogether reject here, becauſe this ſeemeth to be ſpoken then comparatively, becauſe the promiſe is made here to the comfort of ſuch as did then fear the Lord, and may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fear him, which could not be, except the Lord Jeſus this Sun of righteouſneſs had had ſome influence on them; therefore this may ſeem to be meant of his riſing to the height of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his glory, when manifeſted in the fleſh. I mean the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of light manifeſted to us, though it were his own diminution: but haply more of this afterward. Now I will conſider it only abſolutely, that he is this Sun. The Lord is a Sun and a ſhield, <note place="margin">Pſal. 84. 11.</note> and how can he ſo be, except it be in Chriſt, as God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf? So of a conſuming fire, he <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> becometh a refreſhing Sun to his people, in his influences on them.</p>
                     <p>But wherein is Chriſt ſaid to be a Sun? We might follow the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:115245:275"/>
Metaphor very far, yet not too far neither. We abhor that dotage of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who ſaid Chriſt's body went no further then the Sun, but there it was incorporated, on which account they worſhip the Sun. But we will a little inſtance in two or three particulars, wherein the reſemblance holdeth between Chriſt and the Sun.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Sun is one, and therefore called <hi>Sol</hi> from <hi>Solus,</hi> he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath the ruling of the day aſcribed to him. And ſo, Brethren, the Lord Chriſt is one, though he be two natures, yet he is but one Chriſt, one perſon; though he be God and man truly, yet he is but one Jeſus, one Mediator between God and man, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he ſpeaks of him as man, not excluding the God-head: but to ſuit to the weakneſs of poor unbelieving creatures, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> we may go the more boldly to him, the diſtance between us now being not ſo great, he having taken part of fleſh and blood, <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> whereof the children, his poor people, are partakers. Its true, many falſe Chriſts there have been, and ſome there are now in <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 14.</note> our daies; but theſe, alas, they are but blazing Comets, make a little ſtreaming light for a while, and fall into a filthy ſlime at laſt. There are alſo ſome <hi>Parelii</hi> (as they call them) images of the Sun made in a cloud, fitly diſpoſed for ſuch a reflexion of his beams. But alas! how ſoon do theſe images and appearances vaniſh, as ſoon as by any diſturbance the clouds ceaſe to be ſo diſpoſed; the Image of a beauty in a glaſs, in water, is far from the beauty it ſelf: So do all falſe Chriſts, and falſe Saviours who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vaniſh. He is but one.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Sun is the glory of the heavens. Moon and ſtars have their glory, but one ſtar differs from another in glory; but there is none like to the glory of the Sun. O! the Lord hath <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 41.</note> put the excellence of glory on the Lord Jeſus; he is the <gap reason="foreign">

each with his peculiar glory. The Temple, the glory of the Lord filled it, ſo that they could not ſtand before him to miniſter ſometimes. So, Brethren, now the Lord hath placed his name in Jeſus Chriſt, he hath filled him with his glory: therefore (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>the glory of the Lord is riſen on thee:</hi> that is, Jeſus <note place="margin">Iſa. 60. 3.</note> Chriſt is manifeſted to thee: was not his glory ſo great as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>John,</hi> though a veſſel fitted to be filled with thoſe glorious revelations from-him? He fell at his feet as one dead at the ſight <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 15, 16, 17.</note> of him in that viſion. How glorious is an Angel, that the very ſight of him was an aſtoniſhment to <hi>John?</hi> what is the Lord of the Angels? If the Moon be ſo glorious, what is the Sun?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Sun is full of light in it ſelf, and filsall things capable of its light, and yet hath never the leſs; the twinkling Tapers of heaven, they have each of them their light, ſome more ſome leſs: and the Moon hath much light, and giveth much; but what's borrowed light? Firſt, ſhe hath it not in her ſelf, nor in ſuch abundance as the Sun hath. So its here, the Saints they are lights of the Sun (as our Saviour ſaith) but alas! like poor <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 14.</note> candles that burn dim, and ſometimes through the thickneſs of the damps of corruption in our hearts, burn blew, and are ready to go out for the moſt part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Lord Jeſus his fulneſs of Light by. Light maketh manifeſt all things; and that that maketh things manifeſt is the Light: now <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 13.</note> the light of the Sun, its true, diſcovers much, that before it aroſe appeared not; but its poſſible to hide from its light (Brethren) in the depths of the earth, in the bowels of man, it diſcovereth not any of thoſe, much leſs the ſecrets of hearts, there's no ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs between ſuch a cauſe and ſuch an effect. But the Lord Jeſus, he ſearcheth all the deep things of men, the very Marrow <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> of their bones (which is the deepeſt, and hath the moſt coverings upon coverings) he ſearcheth them. So doth Chriſt the ends of men, which are the moſt hidden uſually in all their deſigns, they are deep as the Marrow in the bones, cloathed over with fleſh, and skin, and bones, pretence upon pretence, but Chriſt this Light is ſo piercing, that there is no hiding any thing from it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Sun, his Tabernacle is in heaven; there he made a Tabernacle for the Sun; there is the ſeat of the eye of the world, from whence he views all that is under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <note place="margin">Pſal. 19 4.</note> there is his Palace, and from thence he diſpenceth light and influence. So, Brethren, its with Jeſus Chriſt, he hath his Tabernacle in heaven, that is, in his Church, (for ſo oftentimes the Church is called) there the Lord placeth his Tabernacle; as he ſaith of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>I will place my Tabernacle among them,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lev. 26. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>and dwell in the midſt of them.</hi> He walks in the midſt of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Candleſticks to behold them, to be nigh them, to diſpence of <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 13.</note> his light to them, and of his influence. So doth the Sun commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate of his light to the Moon, and to the Stars in heaven, and to the inhabitants upon earth. We are not to underſtand all this of Chriſt his perſon meerly, but Chriſt, as held out in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, in his Church, therefore he is ſaid by the Church to make manifeſt the mercy and wiſdom of God; his Ordinances are the raies and beams (as afterward we ſhall ſpeak, when we come to open that part of the Text.) But his Tabernacle is the Church, thence he ſhines forth on many others, as the earth is lightned by the raies from heaven.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, From the warming of the Sun; how cold and frozen are thoſe Northern parts of the world, becauſe remote from the Sun? how cold is the hemiſphere when the Sun is ſet for a time? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ow warm when it ſhines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So the Lord Jeſus it is that's the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:115245:276"/>
Author of heat; the Winter is paſt, the Summer is come, the <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 11. 12.</note> rain is over, the flowers appear on the earth, and the voice of ſinging of birds heard: that is, Chriſt is revealed in the power of his love to poor ſinners; this is that which warmeth the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heart when we are frozen in our affections; and as waters frozen up, cannot run this way nor that way, ſo we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor move towards God. Then, Brethren, its a ſight of the Sun of righteouſneſs, the Lord Jeſus, a hot gleamfrom him that thaws all, and melts all, warmeth all again: and therefore in this reſpect alſo, he may be compared to the Sun.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, becauſe of influence (which may be, they ſay, where there is no heat nor light at leaſt) and therefore Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers tell us, that by the influence of the Sun, the gold is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted in the bowels of the earth, whither its light cannot come. And this is that (Brethren) that calls forth the fruits of the earth, that in the winter for fear of cold were retired, the ſap recoiling to the root, there to be preſerved until a ſeaſon for it: Now the Sun, the heat, and warmth, and influence thereof calls it forth again; ſo that the graſs, and fruits, plants and herbs, put forth, bud and bloſſom (as we ſee it in the ſpring) ſo the face of the earth is renewed. And ſo its in this caſe, the Lord Jeſus <note place="margin">Pſal. 104 30.</note> from heaven ſhineth forth, and conveighing ſecretly the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influences of his Spirit, and of the Word to poor ſinners (though they were as dead and dry ſticks before, as trees that are ſtarven with the froſt, and ſeem dead) then they put forth again, then they grow green and flouriſhing, then the heart of a ſinner that was little worth before, becometh a golden Vial full of odours, its concocted, then the ſpices flow forth in the garden incloſed.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, the Sun diſpels the miſts and fogs which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom, would poiſon the air; yea, and thick clouds which would muffle up the Sun from us, we know this by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. So doth the Lord Jeſus (Brethren) all the miſts, fogs, and clouds of ſin, he diſpels them for his name ſake, he blots out the tranſgreſsions of his people as a cloud. Its the very heat (Brethren) of the love of Jeſus Chriſt, that conſumeth, (as <note place="margin">Iſa. 44. 22.</note> I may ſay) melts away thoſe clouds, that they intercept not our communion and fellowſhip with him. O! there is not a day, but the ſtreamings of our filthy hearts would gather into a thick
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:115245:277"/>
cloud and cover his face from us, were it not that the warm beams of his love did continually diſpell them and ſcatter them; we ſhould never enjoy the light of his countenance an hour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it were not for this; and for his names ſake he doth it. And ſo the cloud of ſorrow, let the diſeaſes of the people of God be what they will, never ſo great and black clouds they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with; their day is a day of gloomineſs and thick darkneſs, how come theſe to be diſpelled? is it not the Sun of righteouſneſs breaking forth on poor ſinners that doth it? one ſight of Chriſt as reconciled to him puts an end unto all.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, the Sun is the cauſe of the ſweet intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the earth and the clouds, and the clouds and the earth: for its the Sun that exhales the vapours from the earth, and draweth them up into the middle region of the air, and there with the cold of the air its condenſed into a cloud, and hangs until it be diſſolved, and render it ſelf to the earth again to make it fruitful: and ſo the dew is in like manner begotten, only is not far lifted up above the earth, and with the cold of the night is congealed into little drops, and ſo ſweetly diſtills. So the Lord Jeſus, he draweth out the hearts, the affections of his people in prayers, ſweet breathings after himſelf; and theſe prayers come down again ſometimes on the ſame ſoul, ſometimes on another place: they fall, but abundance of ſweetneſs, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and mercy is poured out by this means on poor creatures, whereby they become fruitful.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, The Lord Jeſus may be compared to the Sun, for that the Sun Giant-like rejoyceth to run his race, and who can turn him back? alas! all the clouds that gather about the Sun, that to our apprehenſions might haply ſeem to threaten a blotting of it out, a clogging of it, they are all below it. Its true, prayer once did hold him in his courſe, and it looks like a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Sun ſtand thou ſtill:</hi> and ſo prayer may do much with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <note place="margin">Joſh. 10. 12.</note> Chriſt, but not hinder him in his courſe, riding on in his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant charriot, conquering and to conquer, enlightning poor dark places and people. Before we come to the other, we will a little apply this to our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then (Brethren) if the Lord Jeſus be a Sun, then they <note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note>
                        <pb n="421" facs="tcp:115245:277"/>
that have this Sun riſen on them, they are children of the day; if the Sun be up, it muſt needs be day; and is not the Sun up Brethren, among us? is not the Lord Jeſus gone forth as a Gyant to run his race among us? we now have a day of Grace among us, and how long, or how ſhort it may be, I know not; Brethren, it ſeemeth to be declining in ſome reſpects, and the ſhadows of the evening growing low; O that we would be perſwaded, and ſtirred up to do the work of our day, in this our day! our great work, <hi>which is to work out our ſalvation with</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>fear and trembling.</hi> I doubt, if the Sun ſhould ſet, and the night come on you, wherein no man can work, you ſhould have <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 5.</note> this work yet to do many of you, eſpecially, brethren, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe hearts the Lord Jeſus, this Sun of righteouſneſs hath ſhone. O how ſhould you walk as children of the day, <hi>not in ſurfetting and drunkenneſs!</hi> I mean not with meat and fire only, <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 13.</note> but with any creature-comforts, and delights on this ſide Chriſt; away then with all the works of darkneſs, all practices which did ſuit better with the times of ignorance and blindneſs and now walk as becometh the light and the day, that the Sun may not be aſhamed to behold you.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Such as the Lord Jeſus then hath not riſen on, <note place="margin">2.</note> they are yet in darkneſs, children of the night, and walk at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, know not whither they go. Alas, many a poor ſoul thinketh he is as ſure to go to heaven, as he is to die, when he is in the very rode to hell; only ſome go in the broad trodden path, open prophane impudent ſinners; ſome ſteal thither behind the hedge; they are going to hell, but in a cloſure, walk hidden from others and from themſelves. Many night-Birds there are among us, children of the night indeed, though in one reſpect many of us may be ſaid to be children of the day, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt in the diſpenſation of the Goſpel is held forth unto us, as they are ſaid to be the children of the Kingdom; yet in <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> reſpect of the inward revealing of Chriſt in the heart, I doubt many of us are ſtrangers to it; though we fly about in the light, yet we are but Owls and Bats, darkneſs agreeth better with us; our ſouls are full of darkneſs, our works are nothing elſe but works of darkneſs. How ſad a conſideration is this Brethren, that in the midſt of light we ſhould be children of darkneſs! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Then thirdly, As there is this difference of perſons where Chriſt cometh, from them where he cometh not, ſo it is in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies <note place="margin">3.</note> and people. Brethren, what a ſad people and family is that where they are all in Egyptian darkneſs! Jeſus Chriſt is not riſen unto any ſoul among them, they know him not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, but they are all in blindneſs: Alas, none can help ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Exod. 10. 23.</note> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> (though they dealed among one another) in one family there was light, in the other there was nothing but groſs darkneſs that might be felt. O who would live in ſuch a family! who would not haſte out of ſuch a condition? you would think that a ſad conditioned houſe, that the light of the Sun and warmth of the Sun never entreth into, of all places you would not live in it: this is is nothing brethren, to the total abſence of Chriſt, where neither Husband, nor Wife, nor Fellow-ſervant, nor Children, none of them have had the Lord Jeſus ſhining into their hearts; <hi>Groſs darkneſs ſhall cover the earth,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>But on Zion ſhall the Glory of the</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, Then take notice how ſweet a condition it muſt <note place="margin">4.</note> needs be, to have an union and fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, eſpecially where that fellowſhip is conſtant: truly light is ſweet, <hi>And it is a pleaſant thing to behold the Sun</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon):</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11. 7.</note> but alas, that is nothing to a ſight of Chriſt! poor ſinners in a dark condition, when they become ſenſible of it, will tell you what its worth to have a glimpſe of Chriſt, of the light of his countenance: poor creatures that for half an year together are without the Sun, will tell you how ſweet a condition it is to have the Sun ſhining on them. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> will tell you, (when ſhe wanted her Saviour, her Lord) with many tears, what a want it is, and what a joy to have his preſence. O what light is there in that ſoul: what joy, what peace, what comfort, what warmth, what melting over the Lord Jeſus! it is a little heaven on earth indeed, this enjoyment of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, We may hence learn then brethren, whence cometh all <note place="margin">5.</note> our light, and all our warmth, and all our fruitful influences,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:115245:278"/>
whereby we ſpring forth, and bring forth abundantly, it is from the Lord Jeſus. Thy heart was as very a dungeon as any, full of darkneſs and bugs, frogs and ſerpents, and how came it to be lightned, but that the Sun of God was pleaſed to ſhine on thee, yea into thy heart more then another, and freely with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to ſcatter thoſe luſts thy ſoul was full of before. Art thou enabled ſo much as to bud, to think a good thought? its from hence, becauſe that the Sun of righteouſneſs hath ariſen on thee; thou haſt received ſome influence from him: doth it come to a bloſſom, a good word, holy communication? its from the ſame principle: doth the fruit knit and grow up into a ripeneſs, increaſe into an holy action, an holy walking with God, whence is it but from the Sun of righteouſneſs? doth the Marigold open? its according to the heat of the Sun <note n="*" place="margin">

How do the Birds each morning chant and chirp, when their little ſpirits are revived by the Sun riſing on them? and ſhall our mouths be ſealed up, when the Sun of righteouſneſs hath viſited our hearts, quickned them, enlightned them? The Stars you know appear not when the Sun ariſeth in his Glory: O dear friends, ſo ſhould we when the Name of Chriſt cometh in competition with our names, not appear, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be nothing, to decreaſe, ſo he may increaſe; Let him have the Glory of all.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Then (Brethren) learn to prize the Lord Jeſus, <note place="margin">7. Pſal. 89. 15.

O labour then to do it; beg ſuch a heart of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, Then Brethren, ſhut not the windows againſt the <note place="margin">8.</note> ſhinings of this Sun of righteouſneſs: ſometimes the Lord Jeſus getteth within a ſinner for all his fence and guard, light cometh in at ſome chink, beginneth to diſcover the condition in which he is, ſheweth him the filthy vermine that are ready to run away with his ſoul, that the heart ſwarms withal, that he ſaw not before: and yet alas, he maketh a ſhift to clap to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, to ſmother the light with both hands, puts it away, he deſires not the preſence of it; this is a ſad condition, when men are ignorant, and will be ignorant; when the Lord Jeſus would <note place="margin">Jer. 51. 9.</note> have healed them, and they would not be healed; O how canſt thou tell, whether ever thou ſhalt be healed till thou die? O take heed Brethren, of this! it is the way to bring the blackneſs of darkneſs on you, to provoke God to clap the everlaſting chains of darkneſs on you, wherein you may be reſerved to the laſt day.

have thought; Oh now we are full, now we have knowledge and heat enough; we have been ſo warmed with the influence of Chriſt on us, now it matters not for altogether ſo ſtrict a walking, now we have gotten the light of his countenance; this is a ſecret fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of our hearts, and then he is provoked to withdraw, and alas, we are in darkneſs again.

                     <p>Ninthly, Then Brethren, learn we not to reſt in the common <note place="margin">9.</note> influences of this Sun, the Lord Jeſus he ſhineth on the good and bad, Brethren, but he ſhineth only on the heads of ſome, but into the hearts of others (as the Apoſtle ſaith) the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> paſſages between the head and the heart are opened, and the light ſeizeth on the will and affections, as well as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; the Sun may ſhine on thee, thou mayſt have much knowledge, and an head full of notion, and yet be but a weed; for it ſhines on the weeds as well as on the flowers; on the dunghill as well as on the garden; the dunghil never ſavours ſo bad, as when the Sun beateth moſt on it. O what ſteams are there then, enough to poyſon a man! Ah Brethren, the ſhining of Jeſus Chriſt, on ſome poor ſinners, what doth it but raiſe ſteams of luſt within? men are more vile, more wicked, their guilt greater, their condemnation ſurer, their ſins more loathſom to God then any others; therefore ſtay not here (Brethren) except we find that the light we receive from Jeſus Chriſt do ſcatter our luſts, for they will not endure the light that is ſaving indeed: except thou find that it change thee indeed, and transform thy heart into his image from Glory to Glory: if thou find thou art rather changed from diſhonour to diſhonour, from one vile affection to <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> another, (<gap reason="foreign">

                        <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 11.</note> but for us that have the light of the knowledge of Chriſt in ſuch a rich manner among us, and yet have a Pope in our bellies, the indignity is much greater to Jeſus Chriſt: how prone are we to ſet up our own works, as our Saviour? who can ſay his heart is clean, and throughly purged from this evil? O that we were but aſhamed of it, and were able to ſay that we do it not in our hearts; for then its not ſo deeply chargable on us, (as I doubt) its on many of us. Therefore take heed of this Brethren, of ſetting up any ſpark of our own kindling (or of his kindling) in us, in defiance to the Lord Jeſus, in oppoſition againſt him, or partnerſhip with him in our ſalvation, in our comfort, or peace, or joy of faith: if we do, and give him not the whole, we do much diſhonour him, and ſhall find that we much wrong our own ſouls.

                     <p>Twelfthly, Then admire (Brethren) the tender mercy of the Lord that would give us ſuch a Sun, the Lord Jeſus, the Sun of <note place="margin">12.</note> righteouſneſs! if he had left the world in a Chaos at firſt, and never commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, never ſet any Sun in the Firmament, who could have charged any thing on him? But he knew what a miſerable world it would it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sun, and how little of the beauty, and excellence, and perfection of his works, and wiſdom would appear, if there were no Sun.

And truly for us in this Land, how long have we had the Sun of righteouſneſs riſen on us? and that yet it is not ſet, that he is not altogether eclipſed by the world of iniquity; that he hath ſtood ſtill (as it were) and not haſtened to a ſetting; this is unſpeakable mercy, admire it, bleſs the Lord, be filled with his praiſes!</p>
                     <p>Thirteenthly, Brethren, Then let us be exhorted to ſet our <note place="margin">13.</note> ſelves in the warm Sun. I mean, to wait diligently on the Lord Jeſus in his Ordinances, for theſe are the Orb in which he moveth in his Church, the Heavens, and doth, as it were, wheel about the Church in them, as the Sun in the Orb, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his light, and heat, and influences; and therefore its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I had rather be a door-keeper in the</hi>

O Brethren, have you not experience of it? where and how come in your warmings on your ſpirits? is it not in the Ordinances of Chriſt? doth he not breath there, and feed there with his people? if a man ſhould be ſo
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:115245:281"/>
peeviſh as that he would not have the Suns influence, except he did ſhine in his chamber, did move there, or ſhine on the earth, or move there, were he not moſt juſtly deprived of them? Here Brethren, here in the Word preached and heard, in the Seals, and Prayer, and all the Ordinances of Chriſt he will be found of his people, and above others in private; be much in maditation of the ſweetneſs, the riches of his love to poor Sinners, ſuch as thou art, this is to ſet our faces Brethren; towards the Sun. O how will this clear the eyes of an Eagle indeed, one that is gloriouſly born of heaven, though Owls are blinded by it? How will this (Brethren) darken the beauty and glory of all things here? You complain of earthlineſs, and you are faſt glewed to the world. O beg of God, that he would turn your eyes toward himſelf, toward the Lord Jeſus; behold this Sun in his ſtrength and glory, and ſee if this do not make all things elſe dull to you, to have no excellence in them, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Chriſt, that you ſhall cry out, none but Chriſt, none but Chriſt. O Brethren, this would make us ſparkle, like Diamonds, lying under the influence of the Sun: its for want of this that Chriſtians are like Diamonds in the dirt; this will make us ſparkle, as <hi>Moſes</hi> face did ſhine; this Brethren, is the way to contract the beams as in a burning glaſs, and ſet the heart on fire with love to Jeſus Chriſt; then our affections will flame, then ſhall we be a zealous people of good works; otherwiſe not.</p>
                     <p>Fourteenthly, Ariſe then and ſhine, thou poor fearing ſoul, <note place="margin">14.</note> that lieſt in the duſt, be inlightned, lift up thy eyes thou that languiſheſt, and thy ſpirit is ready to faint within thee, thou art even dying, and couldſt with fears of thy condition: Oh thy light is come! is not the Sun in the Firmament, though he may be clouded from thee? what though there be much darkneſs in thee of ignorance, of diſcomfort, thou walkeſt in darkneſs and <note place="margin">Iſa. 60. 1.</note> ſeeſt no light, the Sun may be up, though it appear not? it may be day with thee (poor ſoul) and thou a child of light and of the day, though thou beholdeſt not the Sun, nor the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And be not diſcouraged at the enemies of Chriſt: what though the clouds of ignorance, errour, prophaneſs and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry

gather together, and ſeem to threaten the Sun? Alas, how ſoon can he diſpel them, conſume them with the brightneſs of his glorious appearance? what if the Dogs do bark at the Moon, the Church, or at Chriſt, the Sun? will that hinder him in his courſe? what though the People when they are ſcorched with the heat of the Sun (as ſome Pagans are) do curſe the Sun? can they hinder his courſe? O no: as a ſtrong man he will run his race, and who ſhall hinder it? and thoſe that will not be made fruitful he will burn up and conſume; therefore be not diſcouraged; and thou that haſt much deadneſs, and coldneſs, and hardneſs, be not diſcouraged, there is influence enough in Chriſt, go to him, labour to act faith on him, ſet thy ſelf under his influence, wait on him in his Ordinances, and ſee if it come not into thee, to warm, to melt, to make fruitful in the work of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Now for the ſecond, which is, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Sun of righteouſneſs. But leſt I ſhould dwell too long on the Text, if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhould at large handle every part, therefore I will rather ſum up ſeveral things in one Obſervation, and its this.</p>

The people of God may, and ought to be afraid of the judgements of God, when they hang bound up in a black cloud, but yet in the womb of a threatning; and ſo <hi>Joſiah was afraid, and rent his clothes, and humbled himſelf,</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, One reaſon may be becauſe of his perfection; there ſhould nothing be wanting in him, he ſhould have all perfections which were juſt and fit for ſuch a Mediator to have; and ſo ſome think there is a Hebraiſm in the words, <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs; the righteous Sun, the abſolutely perfect Sun:</hi> and this is a truth, in this Sun there was no ſpot, no wrinkle, no darkneſs, no defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of glory, of light, of heat, of influences, of pains in wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about his Church continually for their ſupply and refreſhing; but this is not all.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and his dealing with <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> Theſe were ſhadows caſt on the beauty of Chriſt in them, that it was not ſo conſpicuous; the glaſs is dimmed, and defiled, and ſo not ſo tranſparent: but now the Lord Jeſus is a pure glaſs of divine attributes and perfections, and therefore of this righteouſneſs here ſpoken of. And ſecondly, conſpicuous in him was the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive righteouſneſs of God; it is true his juſtice is manifeſted in calling ſinners to an account, as he did the Angels, the Sodomites, the old world, and us in our times, his dealings do ſpeak him to <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 6.</note> be a juſt God: but never any ſo much as his dealing with Chriſt, though a Son, and equal with him in all eſſential glory; yet if he will be ſurety for poor ſinners, he muſt as it were for a time vail his glory with raggs of fleſh, becauſe the children partake of the <note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O! here the Juſtice of God is conſpicuous in him. (Brethren) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39, 42.</note> was there ſuch a pattern of righteouſneſs in God as this, that he would not ſpare ſin, though in his deareſt Son of his love. O then! ſhall ſons by adoption think to make bold with ſin, and not ſmart for it in ſome meaſure? Take heed you watchleſs, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs walkers before God. O! what ſhall become of poor ſinners then, that are never the better for all this, whoſe ſins ſhall be charged on their own account? Did it amaze the Lord Jeſus?

O! think on it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and tremble: but this by the by.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He may be called the Sun of righteouſneſs, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:115245:283"/>
as he is the fulfilling of all the promiſes that were made of him. The Lord made many promiſes, <hi>as the ſeed of the woman</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall break the ſerpents-head;</hi> and that in <hi>Abraham, in his ſeed all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed; and that a Virgin ſhould conceive and bear a ſon, whoſe name ſhould be Immannuel, God with</hi>

                        <hi>us;</hi> ſignifying the union of natures in his perſon.</p>
                     <p>Now if Chriſt had not come according to the promiſe, where had been the truth of God his righteouſneſs? and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, it was to declare his righteouſneſs for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, that are paſt, through the forbearance of God; <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25, 26.</note> when all the Fathers had believed in him to come, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, they dyed in faith, not having received the promiſes, that is, not having ſeen Chriſt come in the fleſh for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their redemption, though afar off they beheld them and embraced them: <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw his day and was glad. Now what had become of the faith of all theſe, grounded on the faithfulneſs of God who had promiſed; they without us, ſaith the Apoſtle, were not made perfect, though through forbearance <note place="margin">Heb. 11. <hi>ult.</hi>
                        </note> (as it were) their ſins were paſſed over; yet they would have returned on them again, if Chriſt had not come according to the promiſe; and therefore herein now Chriſt may be ſaid to be the Sun of righteouſneſs; but this concerneth moſt his firſt appearing in the fleſh, though for theſe ends and purpoſes, for which he doth ariſe unto every poor believing ſoul. Now therefore he is the Sun of righteouſneſs in this reſpect alſo, as well by his ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on any ſoul that ſtands in need of him now, as by ariſing on them then: for if God ſhould fail in any of them which he hath given to Chriſt, where were his righteouſneſs? This is the third.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Another conſideration wherefore he may be called the Sun of righteouſneſs, is this, becauſe he is the meritorious cauſe of our juſtification in the ſight of God, therefore he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs;</hi> he was ſet forth (ſaith the Apoſtle) for a propitiation through faith in his blood, called <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 6.</note> the righteouſneſs of God, as he accepteth of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, as God in Chriſt paid the price of it, even the blood of God (as he imputeth it to us, or for Chriſts ſake doth not impute our ſins on us) <hi>Enter not into Judgement</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt)</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 143. 2.</note>

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:115245:284"/>
the works of the Law, but by the blood of Jeſus:</hi> in this reſpect he is called a Sun of righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, in that he doth by his influences on the hearts of his people work on them a ſimilitude, a likeneſs to himſelf, to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo beget an inherent righteouſneſs, putting inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and ſeeds into their hearts, from whence flow all manner of holy converſation; in this alſo he is the Sun of righteouſneſs: the Apoſtle is clear in this, he is made of God to us wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption; which ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> is ſometimes called in Scripture righteouſneſs. So, he hath choſen us in him to the adoption of Sons, that we might be holy and unblamable, that by him we might be brought to ſuch a <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4, 5.</note> ſtate and condition, by beholding him, by lying in his beams with our faces towards him, with open face. Now all ſhadows, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18. 2 Cor. 5. 2. Made ſin that we might be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>de the righteouſneſs of God in him.</note> and ceremonies, and vails, (ſuch as in the Legal adminiſtration of the Covenant of grace were on him) being taken away, we are changed into his Image from glory to glory. In all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects he may be called the Sun of righteouſneſs: and thus much for the ſecond thing.</p>
                     <p>The third then, What is meant by the ariſing of this Sun of righteouſneſs on them? if we underſtand it with reſpect to the people of God, of thoſe times that feared his name; then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood (Brethren) as if that Chriſt had never ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on them: for, how come they then to fear the Lord, if he had not yet owned them as his people in Covenant? but it muſt be underſtood thus, that they ſhould behold him in a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner ariſing; they that ſhould live to ſee the day. Many waited for the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>Zach.</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 25.</note> and many others, who could not have done it if they had had no influence from Chriſt on their hearts; therefore we muſt ſay, that even among the Jews, yea and before, many of them had a dawning of light, had ſome glimmerings of Chriſt, he did ſhine through all the darkneſs and ſhadows of the Ceremonies: Chriſt was held forth in them all, but only as the beauty of the picturre is in the ſhadow. But now we have the very image of the things, (ſaith the Apoſtle.) So that this riſing on them (Brethren) <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 1.</note> may be as the riſing of the Sun to ſome height, rather then his firſt appearing: for I find that in the Goſpel of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is rendered. When the Sun is riſen, it wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 6.</note>
                        <pb n="435" facs="tcp:115245:284"/>
that is, when its up and at an height, then it wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>So now, (though before they had the dawning, I ſay, ſome ſcattering beams fore-running the glory of the Sun) yet now <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 10.</note> they ſhould have it in greateſt glory, for he came that his people might have light and might have it more abundantly.</p>
                     <p>But now to us (Brethren) on whom he hath ſhone ſo long, he may be ſaid to riſe, as he breaks through any clouds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, on us, as the Martyr at the ſtake cryed out, <hi>Son of God ſhine on me:</hi> he meant, that he ſhould ſhew him the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, break in on the heart with more light and warmth, whereby he might be armed againſt that tertible death he was to encounter with; and the Sun in the Firmament broke out in a glorious manner through the thick clouds, as an Emblem, if not an earneſt of the other; and a viſible evidence or teſtimony to the ſtanders by, that it ſhould be ſo. So that now I conceive, when on any poor ſoul in his firſt agonies, the throws that he hath to bring forth the child Jeſus, his troubles of heart for ſin, and thick darkneſs on him the Lord Jeſus breaks forth on the ſoul with a glorious diſcovery of his love, yea with an hint of his love, its ariſing on him; and ſo as the increaſe of the glory of his people <hi>Iſrael:</hi> the glory of his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> is called his ariſing on them; ſo where the Lord doth in a more eminent <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 32..</note> manner appear to his people, either after deſertion in reſpect of comfort and peace, or after deſertion in reſpect of holineſs, there he may be ſaid to ariſe on them. And thus much for the third.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing is, what is meant by the wings of this Sun of righteouſneſs? this is ſo much the more difficult, by how much the more Metaphors it is cloathed with, one on another: For firſt, the natural Sun is ſaid to have wings. And ſecondly, then this Sun of righteouſneſs being compared to the natural Sun, is alſo ſaid to have wings; that we may therefore a little unfold it, let us firſt ſee what are the wings of the Sun, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sun, and for that we muſt know it is Metaphorical: the raies, the beams of the Sun are ſaid to be the wings of the Sun; we read of the wings of the morning, wherewith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 139. 9.</note> would flie away to the ends of the earth; what is that but the dawnings of the day? the eye-lids of the morning, as <hi>Job</hi> calls <note place="margin">Job 3. 9.</note>
                        <pb n="436" facs="tcp:115245:285"/>
it: the firſt breakings of light, when the Sun peepeth above the Horizon, the raies and ſtreamings of light ſcattered before the appearing oſ the Sun: the Sun is as it were the eye of heaven, governing and viewing the earth; and the dawning of the day is as it were the eye-lids, opening before the eye do appear when it awakeneth. So <hi>Caryl</hi> and <hi>Mercer.</hi> they are called the wings of the Sun, (as is conceived) for ſeveral reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe as wings and feathers compaſs, clothe and adorn the fowl whoſe wings they are; ſo the rayes do clothe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and adorn the Sun as it were; how naked would a bird be without his feathers? and how naked would the Sun be without his raies and beams?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe of the ſwift motion of the Sun, not only in his diurnal courſe, as in <hi>Pſalm 19. He rejoyceth as a Gyant to run his race:</hi> but no ſooner is the Sun up, but he doth in a manner ſpread his raies to all the Hemiſphere, as a bird quickly when ſhe riſeth ſpreadeth her wings abroad; and therefore the <hi>Egypitans Hieroglyph.</hi> of the Sun, was a fowl ſpreading long wings every way.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe the wings of a fowl, are thoſe under which ſhe gathereth her young, cheriſheth them, refreſheth, warmeth <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 27.</note> them, that they may grow and increaſe: So here, the wings of the Sun are thoſe whereby the creatures in their kind are healed and cheriſhed; as you know how the body will be benummed, and languiſh with the cold of the night: when the Sun beams come to beat on it again, how doth it quicken and revive?</p>
                     <p>But now for the wings of the Lord Jeſus, what are his wings as he is the Sun of righteouſneſs? whatever anſwers to this Sun-beams are his wings; and what are theſe? In a word then, I take them to be the Word and Spirit eſpecially; not excluding other Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, but theſe eſpecially; yea (truly) the Spirit in the Word, and in other Ordinances of Chriſt, I take to be theſe wings here ſpoken of. The Spirit in the Word, even whereby he cometh and preacheth to men, even to them that were aſar off from Chriſt, is ſaid to come and preach peace; by which alſo (ſaith the Apoſtle) that is, by the Spirit, he went and preached to the Spirits in priſon, that now are in priſon, but not <note place="margin">

                           </gap>. 17.</note> when he ſent to preach to them; the Spirit of Chriſt in the Word which <hi>Noah</hi> preached to them (who was a Preacher of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs)
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:115245:285"/>
the Lord Jeſus went and preached to them: I ſay, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 19.</note> theſe are the wings of our Sun of righteouſneſs; and ſo they are called haply for divers reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that theſe proceeding from him, even as the raies of the Sun, which are his wings, proceed from the Sun, as the Sun ſends forth his beams and influences in a powerful manner; ſo Chriſt ſends forth his light and his truth, the Spirit as a perſon in the Trinity proceedeth from him as from the Father, but as to his <note place="margin">Pſal. 43. 3.</note> office, to be an enlightening Spirit, a quickning Spirit, a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit; ſo he proceedeth from Chriſt; <hi>I will ſend you the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>from the Father;</hi> he poured out of his Spirit on his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and many others, who were to go forth in his name, and preach the Goſpel to the Nations; and the Word he ſends it <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 16.</note> forth, out of his mouth proceedeth a two-edged ſword, which is his Word.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as the beams ſupply the abſence of the Sun, ſo doth the Spirit of Chriſt ſupply his abſence; therefore while he was yet preſent, the Spirit was not yet given, not poured out in that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but when he was to go, he comforts his Diſciples with this, that if he went, he would ſend them the Comforter, another <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 16.</note> Comforter; himſelf was one, and he would ſend them another, and that was his Spirit, and he ſhould lead them into all truth, bring all things to their remembrance, and be their Comforter, and help their infirmities, and ſo ſupply the abſence of Chriſt. Yea better then if he himſelf were with them; as we uſe to ſay, the Sun is come into ſuch an houſe, when the beams thereof are come in, which do ſupply the abſence of the Sun, and better it is for us to have the beams, then the Sun in our houſes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe of the ſwiftneſs of the opening of the glory of Chriſt to the laſt ages of the world. O! how ſwift are the beams of the Sun in a moment darted from heaven to earth, and over-ſpread the whole Horizon? So the Lord, his Word being quickned by the Spirit, doth run very ſwiftly (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 147. 15.</note> hath it) in how ſhort a time (as the age of the Apoſtles) did it overſpread the Horizon, gotten as far as <hi>Rome,</hi> and how mightily did it prevail, though the Jews did contradict, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, <note place="margin">Acts 19. 20.</note> and endeavour to take off the wheels of his Chariots, yet it went on never the ſlower for that, it grew and multiplyed;
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:115245:286"/>
Converts unto the face of the Church were as thick as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dew on the face of the earth, which is generated by the <note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 3.</note> Sun.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, as the beams of the Sun carry light, and heat, and refreſhing along with them to the poor languiſhing earth, and other creatures, ſo doth the Spirit and the Word, and the Spirit in the Word carries light with it; <hi>thy Word is a light to my feet;</hi> and indeed it is not Chriſt conſidered alone, but as he is held out in the Goſpel that is here reſembled to the Sun of righteouſneſs, <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 18.</note> as I told you before; their ſound is gone forth into all the earth; that is, of them that preached the Goſpel of peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation through Chriſt. And for heat; O! how doth many a poor creature come under an Ordinance with an heartleſs mind, cold and dead, and his heart doth burn within him, while the <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 32.</note> Lord by his Spirit hath communion with him in thoſe Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? and what refreſhings do ariſe to a poor weary ſoul, when the Lord createth the fruit of the lips, peace, peace, certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted peace, he doubleth it for emphaſis: that peace which <note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 19.</note> paſſeth underſtanding: and it ſhall ſurely be ſo, and ſuddenly too, not long, he delights not to hold poor ſouls in anxiety &amp; trouble, only what he ſeeth needful for their humiliation, fetching them off themſelves and ſin, and making Chriſt ſweet to them indeed, that he may be precious to them. Other reaſons might haply be given, why the Spirit, and Word, and Ordinances are compared to the Sun, which are the wings thereof, but this ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                     <p>The fifth thing, what is meant by healing, and indeed this is large, and as large as our ſpiritual maladies are: ſome ſay, there is nothing more wholſom then the Sun; where it cometh with its beams, how doth it purge the air wherein we breath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the noyſom vapours that ariſe, and would infect it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, purging the earth from its dregs, or elſe we ſhould quickly find the offenſiveneſs of it? So the Lord Jeſus by the breaking forth of his Spirit in the Word of Truth, doth heal the air, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and ſcatter the venomous errors of men, wherewith we ſhould quickly be all poyſoned, were it not for this, that be makes manifeſt their folly to all men, and they proceed no further. He heals the waters, the waters of the Sanctuary: how often have they been polluted, yea poyſoned by ſome, and the Lord hath
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:115245:286"/>
healed them again by his Spirit. Again, he heals the earth of its barrenneſs; in Winter the earth ſeemeth to be languiſhing, and all things withered and dead, when the Sun returneth how doth it heal it? To its here (Beloved) it is the Word and Spirit that opens the earth, moiſtens the earth, ſweetly refreſheth it, calls forth the fruits thereof: The fruits of the Spirit they are called, as the fruits of the earth are called, the precious fruits, put forth by the Sun and by the Moon (which ſhines by a derived influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 14.</note> from the Sun:) how precious are the fruits of the Spirit, (Brethren) love, meekneſs, joy in the Holy-Ghoſt, humility, ſelf-denyal, theſe are the precious fruits put forth by the Sun, the Lord Jeſus, by his Word and Spirit beating upon our barren hearts; indeed he maketh the barren Wilderneſs to become a garden of God. Again, he healeth, he reviveth the ſpirits which languiſh and are ready to go out, as the poor Birds that in the Winter are hard put to it, and ſome lye you hardly know where, as if they were dead or dying: when the Sun returneth, how doth it refreſh and revive their little ſpirits that were left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? The night brings a heavineſs and burthen along with it to the body, but the morning, when the Sun ariſeth, how doth it enliven and lighten? Oh! ſo its in this caſe, many a poor ſoul can ſay by experience, that when darkneſs hath been long on them, they have no light, no comfort, no refreſhing, no breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit to their apprehenſions in his Ordinances on their hearts. O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how have hands hanged down, and their knees feeble, and knock one againſt another for feebleneſs, and that which was within them was ready to dye: But now, no ſooner hath the Lord Jeſus, the Sun of righteouſneſs looked on them, but they have had their ankle-bones ſtrengthened, the joy of the Lord is their ſtrength, as <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. but I intend not here much <note place="margin">Neh. 8. 10.</note> to expatiate, only theſe two or three things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, the firſt thing in this healing which is brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wings of the Sun of righteouſneſs, is pardon for our ſins; <hi>who forgiveth all-thy iniquities, and healeth all-thy diſeaſes:</hi> theſe are exegetical one of another, or may ſo be looked on. Sin <note place="margin">Pſal. 103. 3.</note> (Brethren) cuts off a creature from God, and ſo maketh a wound, which now is healed and made up when they are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, and let their ears be heavy; their eyes cloſed, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, or</hi>

                        <hi>hear with their ears, or underſtand with their hearts, leſt they ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them:</hi> which <hi>Mark</hi> reads <note place="margin">Mark 4. 12.</note> thus, <hi>leſt they ſhould be converted, and their ſins be forgiven them.</hi> So then forgiveneſs and healing are all one; and its one thing ſurely included, in that of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, I will heal their back-ſlidings, I will love them freely;</hi> the juſtification freely by <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 4.</note> his grace, (as the Apoſtle calls it.) Poor ſinner, thou that ever kneweſt what ſin was, what a wound it was to thy ſoul; kneweſt that thy pardon is a healing to thee. So then this ariſing with healing in his wings, is by his Spirit in his Word; he conveyeth the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the merit thereof, maketh it over to the poor ſoul that believeth, to the doing away of all the guilt. So as a Sun of righteouſneſs, properly he healeth: and this is the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He taketh away alſo the anguiſh and trouble that did ariſe from ſin to the ſoul; as when a wound is healed, you know the anguiſh and ſmart is taken away, though while it is healing, (it may be) when ſearched and tented, there will be ſmart and ſore, yet afterward its taken away by degrees: I know ſome of you have felt, and haply ſome at preſent may feel the grief of your wounds. O! how they will throb, and beat, and burn, and ſmart ſometimes: broken bones are nothing to a broken heart, nor the broken fleſh any thing to a broken bone: the Lord heals the broken in heart, he bindeth up their wounds; <hi>I have ſeen his waies, and will heal him, ſaith the Lord;</hi> he ſpeaks to <note place="margin">Pſal. 147. 3.</note> the condition of a poor diſconſolate ſoul under the wrath of God: <hi>He was wrath and ſmote him, yea he hid him and was wrath:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 17. 18, 19.</note> O how this troubles a poor ſoul! he cannot but have his heart full of darkneſs, and terrour, and trouble, that hath the face of God hidden from him; well, ſaith the Lord, though he did walk frowardly before me, gave me not my ends in ſmiting him, yet I will heal him: and wherein doth this healing conſiſt? Alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in reſtoring joy and comfort to him; the poor ſoul now was over-whelmed with ſorrow, his heart now was ready to ſink and fail within him, and leſt it ſhould ſo do, he will heal him; and how is this but by his Word and Spirit therein, which is the comforting Spitit, he will create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him. Here is a healing indeed, the healing of broken hearts, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bones; its the work that the Father ſent the Lord Jeſus for <note place="margin">Luk. 4. 18.</note>

into the world, in an eſpecial manner, that he annointed him for, poured out the Spirit upon him, annointed him with the oyl of <note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 1, 2.</note> gladneſs above his fellows, that he might ſpeak in due ſeaſon, that he might bind up the broken ſpirits: Now the Lord Jeſus, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, our dear Saviour, he delighteth to do this will and work of his Father. O! he loveth to be doing with broken hearts: And O that we had ſome work for the Lord Jeſus this day, he is among us now, to ſee if there be any heart in this condition, that he may heal us; its his delight to do it. Well, this is a ſecond, he hath his cordials, as well as his purgatives, his lenitives as well as his corroſives.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he cometh with healing under his wings, as to take away the anguiſh, ſo alſo to purge away the filth of it, to heal the running putrifying ſore, that it may not run, and defile, and pollute all that a man taketh in hand: <hi>How much more</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall the blood of Chriſt purge our conſciences from dead</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>works, that we may ſerve the living God.</hi> With corroſives he eats down the proud fleſh and the dead fleſh; he dryeth up the bloody iſſues: then the perſon was healed when ſhe touched Chriſt, but the hem of his garment. This is that which troubles many a heart more then the guilt of their ſins; and indeed the returning and recoyling of ſin on them again and again, occaſioneth the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of their peace and comfort that they have had. O, how one cryeth out of this ſin, and another of that ſin, and walks heavily and ſadly! Well, the Lord Jeſus he will ariſe with healing under his wings for all theſe diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and laſtly, another healing is the taking away his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger manifeſted in outward calamities or diſeaſes in a people or perſon, <hi>I will heal their back-ſlidings and love them freely, for mine anger is turned away:</hi> either to turn away the affliction, or at leaſt the anger, which is the ſting; the inflamation of any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever, if it be but an itch, a ſcab, if it be fired with the anger of God, it ſhall be enough to conſume and deſtroy: the Lord challengeth it as a priviledge, <hi>See now, that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me, I kill and I make alive, I wound and I</hi>

Well, he will return if thou return to him, he will return, he will heal thee; or at leaſt take away the anger that inflameth the Viſitation (which is a kind of healing; Brethren) though we are kept under it. But thus much for theſe particulars touching healing.</p>
                     <p>You ſee then, what it is that is held forth in this Doctrine, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt will ariſe unto them that fear his name, with healing under his wings:</hi> that is to ſay, by his Word, and Spirit, and other Ordinances, conveigh to them pardon, and cleanſing, and peace, and comfort, and freedom from calamities, or the evil of them; and I hope it is ſufficiently proved by the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; there have been many Scriptures produced to prove it in each particular; therefore we will not any longer inſiſt on that part, but come to the Application, which will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, we may take notice (Brethren) hence, what a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive evil ſin is, for if we ſpeak of healing (which is the <note place="margin">

So when a poor ſoul hath a luſt, a ſore running, and never ceaſing, how ſad a condition is this? Brethren, how ſtrangely will a fit of ſickneſs change a perſon, that the rareſt piece of beauty in the world, quickly becometh a gaſtly ſight, every part contracting its deformity from the ſickneſs, all withered and ſhrivelled, joynts looſed, the eye dead and dull, the face thin, the knees feeble, the hand trembling, and what not; Brethren, if the Lord open our eyes to behold in the glaſs of the word, the deformities of ſin and filthineſs, as we may ſee the lothſomneſs and uglineſs of a diſeaſe, we ſhould for ever be haters of it; but I will ſay no more to this head, That ſin is a diſeaſe, a wound.</p>

It is a deadly diſeaſe, it ſeizeth upon the vitals, and then you know it is a matter of great difficulty and skill to cure it; no nor can a man cure himſelf: if he could, to what end did the Lord Jeſus undergo all? why <hi>he was ſmitten for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

be, ifyou had any thing to do with Chriſt? it is a ſign that ſuch a <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 21.</note> ſinner hath never touched Chriſt to this day; for no ſooner did the woman touch him, but vertue came from him; the leaſt touch of faith doth it: O what a faithleſs generation are we then! O how many of us are in this condition! what a ſad thing is it that we ſhould thus throng upon Chriſt, and ſo few touch him? but one poor woman in a whole throng come and ſteal a touch of Chriſt, <hi>O if ſhe might but touch him, ſhe ſhould be healed;</hi> and ſo haply now in a Congregation, there cometh in one poor trembling ſinner, with his affections ſtirred, his deſires are up, O if I may but touch him, I ſhall be well; when for the moſt part that is not our error. Now dear friends, what have you been doing all this while, have you eat and drank in the preſence of Chriſt? have you heard his Word and Goſpel wherein he is lifted up, as the healing Serpent, ſo many years, and yet not healed? have you ſo often received the Lord his Supper, the outward part of it, and yet are not healed? what, have you been praying, and reading, and coming to hear, until you have one foot in the grave, and yet not healed? what have you been doing all this while, that you have never got a ſight of Chriſt, a touch of him to this day, that you might be healed? Ah, ſure you have ſpent your time, your money upon the Phyſitians that cannot heal you, you have gone to the Diſciples in ſtead of Chriſt, you have expected healing from the Ordinances themſelves, and expected it haply from us in whom healing is not; as they lookt upon the Apoſtles, <hi>Why look ye upon us, as if we had done</hi>

                        <hi>this by our own power?</hi> O no, it is Jeſus Chriſt alone can heal, and therefore if you are not yet healed, he did never ariſe upon you to this day: It may be ſinners will be ready to ſay, what if Jeſus Chriſt hath never riſen upon us, is that ſuch a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Indeed I doubt we make a light matter of it; but I will tell you what a great matter it is, you are yet in your ſins, and it is a very great hazard but you may die in your ſins; if he never riſe upon thee, thou ſhalt undoubtedly die in them; and is this nothing? O but you will ſay, God is merciful, it is his nature to be merciful, he triumpheth in exalting that perfection, and making it glorious: It is true, brethren, but it is in Chriſt, all light and healing is from the Father, but he hath filled the Son now with inlightning and healing influence, ſo that they who

Well conſider this for the fourth Application of the Doctrine: Such as are not healed of their luſts, they have never had Jeſus Chriſt ariſing upon them as yet, they never knew Chriſt to this day; let our knowledge be what it will, our parts be what it will, our ſeeming following Chriſt be what it will, and thronging upon him never ſo much, we never yet touched him, he never yet ſhined upon our ſouls; O how many ſuch poor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſtleſs ſouls hear this Word this day!</p>
                     <p>5. Then, let us labour to raiſe our ſpirits in admiration of the riches of grace in Jeſus Chriſt, given to poor ſinners, to provide a healing for us; that when we had faln from the height of mercy, or rather grace and goodneſs, and ſo had all to be broken and bruiſed our ſelves, broken our b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, Yet further conſider the riches of Grace, Sinners, herein to you, herein held forth in that, notwithſtanding all our unkind dealing with him, yet he giveth not over the work; would not an able Phyſitian take it ill, that his Patient ſhould go away from him, and run to a cheating Mountebank, and prefer him before him? were not this enough to loſe a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian?

O, how do Perſons beſide themſelves abuſe their Phyſitian? many times fly in their face, and ſo do Sinners; now the Lord Jeſus cometh with his cordials in one hand, his purgatives in the other hand, ready to purge, to cleanſe, to heal us, and we fly in his face, uſe him moſt unkindly; and yet for all this, he is not overcome, giveth us not over, until he hath healed us of this, and all the reſt of the diſtempers of our ſouls. O how do you think the Lord Jeſus can endure to be kicked in the very bowels, to have his blood trampled under foot by poor Sinners, that he cometh to heal! and yet he doth endure it, and for all this healeth them. Is not all this unkindneſs? what can move him to give us over? ſurely many of us are able to ſay it, that if his bowels had not been unſearchable, we have ſo often grieved him, and kicked againſt him, even ſince he had to do with our ſouls in a way of healing mercy, that we had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. Oh here is unſearchable mercy, we wound him, and grieve him, and yet he heals us: we ſleightly eſteem of him, of his blood, of his mercy, of his love, even while he is pouring it out upon us, and he ſo dearly loveth us, that his blood is not too dear for us, no nor his Spirit, nor his bowels, nor any thing; O here is rich Grace indeed to poor froward-hearted Sinners!</p>
                     <p>5. Herein the riches of Grace doth appear to poor Sinners,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:115245:297"/>
that it is not the multitude, nor the depth, nor the loathſomneſs of our wounds, or deadlineſs of our diſeaſes, that diſcourageth him, to make him turn his back upon the work, and let us alone. O ſaith the Phyſitian, when he cometh to ſuch a Patient, he hath the plague, it is ſeized upon his heart, upon his vitals, it is paſt my ski<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>nſts were in our very hearts, it is matter of admiration, that ever we were healed; and though for the preſent there are, it may be, grudgings of the old diſeaſe, whereby we are a grief to him, and a grief to our ſelves, yet that the plague is cured at the heart, or curing rather; alas, do you think the Lord Jeſus did not know what a weary hand he ſhould have with us before he began with us? he knew what ulcerations would be continually breaking out that muſt be lanced and ſearched, and yet never turned his back upon his work upon this account; when the Chyrurgion meeteth with a <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.</note> poor creature, that is full of wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores, that have never been opened, nor mollified, but a long time have feſtered and rotted; O, ſaith he, I am not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to have to do with ſuch a Patient, the very ſtench of his wounds and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and from thence came water and blood, the ingredients of the healing medicine for poor Sinners for ever, being rightly tempered: like a tender Mother, if the child be ſick, it muſt be purged; ſhe her ſelf takes the purge, endures the wrings of it in its working, that the effect may be ſuckt by the child who lies at the breaſt; this is but a reſemblance of this rich Grace in Jeſus Chriſt.

O the price of every drop of that bleſſed blood that run trickling down to the earth, eſpecially if it be conſidered by what means it was ſqueezed out of him, this ſetteth a rate upon his love; it is not love in word, but in deed and in truth; if nothing elſe will be a price to redeem them but his blood, it ſhall go; he is not dear of it to the laſt drop; yea not to part with it by opening a vein, but to have it extract out of the veins by the pores of his body: O by the unſpeakable weight of wrath upon his Spirit! Now how can we judge of this, except we have had a little taſte of it our ſelves? when we are put into a little ſweat in our own wreſtlings with the diſpleaſure of God, O then we ſee what our Saviour indured for us: If a man would ſet the higheſt eſtimate upon love among men, this ſhould be the rate of it; would they willingly have the face of God in Chriſt hidden from them for a year or two for the deareſt friend they have in the world? you that have felt what this laſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Spirit is, that your breath was even gone at every blow, and you were ready to periſh, and you had fainted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you had believed ſome ſecret undiſcerned ſupport.

                     <p>But Thirdly, That which he himſelf preſcribeth, even the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of it, it is no more then he enables the creature to bear; if he do lance our wounds, and put us to ſome grief, withall he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a Cordial that ſtays us from ſinking; it is true, a right hand cannot be cut off, nor a right foot, a man cannot be diſmembred, but there will be ſome anguiſh and trouble; nor a luſt mortified, but it will coſt us ſome heart-aking, but then he quickly ſtanches the bleeding, keepeth the heart from ſinking, fainting, he will not ſuffer us to be tryed above what we are able, but maketh a way to eſcape; he doth not leave us altogether without his preſence <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> when we are in the dark, though we ſee him not; I ſay, if it were not for this, I know the lot of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> would fall upon every ſuch ſinner, nor will he keep it a jot longer upon us then he will lengthen out our patience. But what is all this Brethren to what our bleſſed Saviour hath taken down for us? If dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be ſo ſad to us, who never had but a glimpſe of the light of his countenance, what was it that the Lord Jeſus felt then, that had it in that fulneſs the creature was capable of, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably greater, by how much the more iniquity was laid to his charge? So that in a word, it is our bleſſed Saviour that was wounded, and we healed; all that is done to us is but as a ſcratch with a pin to thoſe wounds of his; he felt all thoſe wrings and pangs, and we have the effects of the working of the Phyſick; is not this unſearchable riches of Grace, that we ſhould be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after ſuch a manner as this!</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, He doth all this moſt freely, expecteth no reward, as Phyſicians you know do: the poor woman in the Goſpel ſpent all that ſhe had upon the Phyſicians, but when ſhe came to Chriſt, he asked her nothing, only willingneſs to accept of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to believe his power, his willingneſs to ſave, and this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to a reward; yea, and it is he himſelf that giveth the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to be healed; he went up and down throughout the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues

When a Phyſician cometh to heal a perſon of the Plague, O ſaith he, I will reward you, you ſhall not take all this pains with me for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; you ſhall have the rags that come off my ſores, for your pains: Is not the Phyſician much beholding to him think you?

Yea,</p>
                     <p>Eighthly and laſtly, it will appear in this, that the Lord Jeſus brings his heart full, and his hands full of reward with him to a poor ſinner, ſo that he will be but healed; you ſee fooliſh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they have fallen and wounded themſelves, they muſt be hired to let the Father or the Chyrurgion heal it, put a plaiſter upon it; but cryeth out as undone, had rather do any thing then be healed; but alas, who would do it to a ſtranger? it may be thou ſeeſt a poor leprous creature lie languiſhing at thy gates, and thou canſt heal him, but he is not willing; either he is in love with his diſeaſe, or diſtruſts your good will, or faithfulneſs, or ſomething, but he is not willing to be healed: now where is there a heart ſo full of tenderneſs as to be willing to offer him a reward? I will give thee thus much, or thus much, if thou wilt but let me heal thee, for I pitty thy condition: Brethren, a King and his ſubjects fall out, they rebel againſt the King in the war, the ſubject is wounded even to the death, except there be more then ordinary care taken of him; now the King, his heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, he cometh to him in the priſon, and doth not upbraid him with his unkindneſs, nor pride, nor ſtubbornneſs, but intreateth him he will give him leave to heal him, that he will but ſuffer his wounds to be ſearched, to be healed, to be cloſed, ſo that he may not periſh, he will pardon all that he hath done amiſs, begs of him to accept of him, he will make him the ſecond man in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he ſhall be near to him, if he will but ſuffer himſelf to be healed: Is not this rich mercy indeed, is there any ſuch <hi>Paragon</hi> to be found?

luſts; and to ſpeak the truth, I take this to be the greateſt part of our healing, when a poor ſinner that was in love with ſin before, loved his luſts as much as his life; O his merry companions were as dear to him as his very eye, or his right hand, he could no more part with one then the other, and ſo his gain of unrighteouſneſs. Now when the Lord by propoſing of objects, which have a great force, but that is not all, but by a ſweet and yet powerful bowing of the heart, maketh the poor creature willing to be healed; ſo that now he cryeth out with <hi>Auguſtine, How long Lord, how long? this man is in a great meaſure healed, and this is the work, and yet he rewardeth for this, promiſeth a Crown, giveth grace, and glory, glory with himſelf, fellowſhip with him, to lye in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to all eternity.</hi> O here is unſearchable riches of grace!

This concerneth two ſorts of perſons; Firſt, ſuch as yet never knew what this healing vertue of Chriſt is, only by the hearing of the ear, they hear the Lord Jeſus is able to heal the moſt deſperate wounds, and that he is willing, and therefore they make bold to continue in ſin, they may go on to inflame the reckoning a little higher yet, it is all one with Chriſt to pardon millions as mites, to ſwallow up mountains as mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

know that he will do it for thee, ſinner? or what hope haſt thou, or canſt thou have while it is thus with thoe?

Surely no, be not deceived ſinners, theſe are the inſinuations of the wicked one, this is ſuch Goſpel as the Devil preacheth, when he preacheth Chriſt as an Angel of light, but in the cloſe, you will find the Law inſtead of the Goſpel; ſuch preſumption and ſecurity uſually endeth in diſpair, the time may come, that you that make ſo little a matter of it, may cry out and roar, O your wounds, you refuſed to be healed; what if the Lord then ſay to you, your iniquities ſhall never be healed, you ſhall dye in your ſins; what will become of your preſumption then?</p>

O it is the want of keeping that freſh upon our hearts, what the cure of it coſt, that is the great cauſe of our ſo often relapſing. And ſo we forget what it coſt our ſelves; it is ſtrange that the burnt child doth not dread the fire: doſt thou not remember when the Lord came to ſearch thy wounds, what it coſt thee when he went to the bottom of them? O doſt thou not remember the ſtench of them, when he came to pluck off the hard cruſt grown upon them, and let thee ſee and be ſenſible of the filthineſs in them? is this forgotten, that thou makeſt no more of ſin? O doſt thou not remember the time when thou waſt even

weary of thy ſelf, a burthen to thy ſelf, thou couldſt not reſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a weary day and night, it coſt thee many an aking heart, and yet now ſo ſoon art making wounds again, making work again for Chriſt? Surely this is very ill requital of all that riches of grace. Or what, can we heal the breaches we make upon our peace by our <hi>recidivations</hi> when we pleaſe? It is true, if a man had his <hi>panacea</hi> in his pocket, that whatever diſeaſe he fell into, whatever wound he ſhould make upon himſelf, he could cure it again when he pleaſed, it were ſomewhat like, there were ſome colour; but have you the treaſuries of grace in your own keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? have you? or hath any man a pardon in a box, as the poor deceived Papiſts are grievouſly mocked? Surely no; Alas, we can make wounds, but we cannot heal them, we can make a ſhift to break our faces and bones, but we cannot heal them again, it is in his hand; and will it be for our comfort then, to grieve him by ſuch careleſs walking? what if he reſolve to grieve thee, and give thee enough of thy back-ſlidings? Will it not be bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the latter end? though he may heal it, it may coſt thee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a throb and much ſmart for this wantonneſs; Brethren, take <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 14.</note> heed of this: O ſickneſs is chargeable, it may coſt thee mourning all thy daies.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Then let it be for Exhortation to us all, that we get under the influence of this Sun of righteouſneſs. Sinners, we have all of us need of the Phyſitian, for there is never a whole ſoul among us, though to our own apprehenſion ſome of us think it is well with us, yet it is not, <hi>we are full of wounds, the whole head is ſick, the whole heart is faint,</hi> the Lord Jeſus hath <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.</note> ſent me to tell you where you-may have healing, and to perſwade you to come to him; but alas, I am a child and cannot ſpeak. Where is there healing to be had you will ſay? you know that as well as you can be told; why then, how cometh it to paſs that you come not to Jeſus Chriſt, he hath ſet open the Store-houſe, the Treaſuries of pardoning-mercy, and healing-mercy, inviteth all that will to come, and yet you come not? Surely, either you do not believe this report, or elſe you do not believe your need of Jeſus Chriſt. O conſider what hath been ſaid to that part, and the Lord help you to believe, and perſwade you to come to him, for indeed it is he that muſt draw, and make poor ſinners willing to come, or elſe they will never come to him, only he doth draw;
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:115245:303"/>
one way is by propoſing the object, by holding out a crucified Chriſt for them. And therefore let me a little propoſe ſomething to you to perſwade you to come to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Your need of Chriſt you have ſeen; for we are all wounded, yea even to the death, bitten with fiery Serpents, the venom whereof inflames our ſouls, and therefore a Phyſitian we muſt have or elſe dye: Now there is no healing in any other, but through his ſtripes; if you know of any other Saviour that can deliver, can heal you, take him; follow after him; but I muſt tell you, when you have ſpent all, you muſt be fain to come to Jeſus Chriſt for healing; and is it not better to come before you have ſpent all upon other Phyſitians that cannot cure when all is done? O that ſinners could but believe this! I tell you truth, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, a Plaiſter of any thing elſe; made of our own ſorrow, or tears, or righteouſneſs, or good works, or whatſoever, it is ſo far from being a healing, that it will venom the wound more, and maketh yet further work for Jeſus Chriſt, if reſted in as a cure. I ſay, you may make a ſhift to ſtop the Orifice of the wound with a balm of your own procuring, but all the while the ſore eats into the ſoul ſo much the deeper, wrankles within. O now the Lord Jeſus, he beginneth at the bottom, and ſo heals it up; ſay not then, <hi>Are not</hi> Abana <hi>and</hi> Pharpar, <hi>Rivers of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, <hi>better then all the waters of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>when we muſt go and</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider this, the longer you conceal your wounds and hold off, the worſe will it go with you; for either the Lord will let you go on and never heal you, but let you languiſh away in theſe waies of ſin you pleaſe your ſelves ſo much in; or elſe if he do, the longer the wound is wrankling the worſe it will be, the harder it will go when it cometh to be ſearched; when <hi>David</hi> had turned his back upon Chriſt for ſo long in the matter of <hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Do but conſider, what thronging there was to Chriſt for healing of their bodily diſtempers, they brought them from all <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 19.</note> parts to him, ſuch as could not come themſelves; and would

O how would poor Creeples ſet the beſt foot forward to come to him, and ſuch as had diſeaſed creatures, Lame, Blind, Palſie? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O how would they take themſelves bound to bring them to Chriſt for healing? and what, is the body more then the ſoul, Brethren? You would think you were undone if you were lamed, and could not ſtand upon your legs; why this is nothing to have a heart and a heart. Such a man is lame, one leg ſhorter then another, or walks with one foot in an higher way, and the other in a lower, and ſo halts, and is this nothing? O, what would a tender mother give now, if ſhe had all her children and ſelf under the plague at once, or lying of the ſtone or gout at once, one cryeth, and another cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, never pain like theirs. What would a mother give now for ſuch a Phyſitian, and how ready would ſhe be to carry them to him? what is this to the plague of the heart, and the ſtone in the heart? and yet no out-cries at all, nor care at all, nay the Lord Jeſus cometh himſelf, is firſt in the thing, viſits with his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, moveth, intreateth to accept of pardon, of healing, and yet you will not; what ſhall I ſay more, Brethren?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Conſider, that the Lord Jeſus is moſt freely willing to heal poor ſinners; do you think if the Lord Jeſus had not been in good earneſt, and hearty in the work of ſalvation of poor ſinners, he would have prepared ſuch coſtly cordials, made up of his own ſpirits and his own blood, that ſo no diſeaſe might be ſo deadly, but the ſoveraignty of the Medicine ſhould be as lively? Surely no; did he ever refuſe any that came to him for healing in the Goſpel, for healing of the body, but rather while they came for healing of their bodies, he did <hi>ex ſuperabundanti gratia,</hi> heal their ſouls; they came to ask crums of him, as the poor woman, and he giveth them the childrens bread, his fleſh and his blood to eat and to drink, to be food and Phyſick to heal and nouriſh them; you have heard at large, <hi>that none that come unto him he will in any wiſe caſt out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore, Brethren, let me beg of you to labour with the Lord, and with your own hearts, and never give it over until he hath brought you, and ſet you directly under the beams of this Sun of righteouſneſs: for the more direct they are, the more power they have, you know the reaſon: beams of the Sun in winter will not heal the earth of its barrenneſs and frozenneſs,

Some things are ſo groſs, as if there be but a glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of light diſcovered, they fly away, will not endure it; but there are ſome ſecret luſts lie ſo cloſe to the heart, have caſt out their roots ſo there, and are ſo faſtened in the ſpirit, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord Jeſus do ſhine in his ſtrength into ſuch a ſoul, they will never up, they will never wither nor dye, nor the ſoul be healed; but thus much for the Exhortation.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, I ſhall ſpeak a word of refreſhing to ſuch as tremble at this Word, and every Word of God; are indeed ſenſible of their condition by reaſon of ſin, and many ſad complaints they make; I may imagine, but the Lord heareth the moan that every poor ſinner maketh over his wounds, and over his diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; as you ſhall have a poor creature that feels he is wounded, the heavy groans he fetcheth, one cryeth out of the broken arm, another of a wounded head, a third of the ſtone, a fourth of the plague: O how it throbs and ſmarts, when the Lord opens ſinners eyes to ſee what they have done, which they never ſaw before, thus it is with them: Why now poor ſinner, is this thy caſe, doſt thou ſee and know thy wound? know this day, there is healing for thee, caſt not away thy hope; for ſo poor creatures are ready to ſay, is there any healing for me? there was never wound ſure ſo deep as mine. O never was there diſeaſe ſo loathſom, ſo full of pain as mine! yea, here is a promiſe, <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe with healing in his wings upon them that fear him;</hi> and now thou beginneſt to be afraid of him: though before thou kneweſt him, thou madeſt nothing of rebelling againſt him, yet now thou doſt: as they ſay, bring a man that is guilty of anothers murther before him, he will bleed afreſh.

                     <p>The ſecond thing, Is the <hi>quod,</hi> what this inlargement, or freedom is that is here promiſed? and truly this is a large que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and wherein moſt of our work will lie: each of us in the general acknowledge a ſlavery, a bondage we are under, from which the Lord Jeſus doth ſpeak to his people to go forth, yea brings them forth; but we have not a diſtinct underſtanding of it: and alas, I am the meaneſt of them, who make it their work to preſerve knowledge; yet as I have received, I ſhall endeavour ſomewhat this-way to open the nature of this liberty.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 33.</note> we are free-born, and we never were in bondage to any man; they meant ſure they were never particularly ſold for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to any, elſe bred in bondage to any to be their ſervants, not meaning their publick ſtate, but private, elſe they much did forget themſelves; for they had often been in captivity and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, as in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and at preſent under the <hi>Romans;</hi> but this is not the liberty we chiefly aim at, nor may we extend it to this bondage, any further then it is a curſe: now we know the Apoſtle tels us, that if a man be called, being a ſervant, care not for it, for ſuch an one is the Lord his Free-man, neither bond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or free: is there any difference? they are all one in Chriſt; therefore our Saviour did not come to break all yokes off the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:115245:308"/>
neck of Servants, or to deliver all ſuch relations; no, but it is meant here ſurely of a ſpiritual Liberty, a freedom of the ſoul from its thraldom; nay himſelf cometh to be a ſervant; did he not rather ſanctifie ſuch a condition and relation then abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Then taking it for ſpiritual Liberty, that is to ſay, a freedom from Spiritual evils, the ſubjection whereunto is a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to the poor creature; we muſt know yet further, that we may take it either in a larger, or in a more reſtrained ſenſe; in a more reſtrained, only for that liberty and freedom which the Saints have ever had through the Lord Jeſus, ſince the Covenant of Grace was preached to them, and they cloſed with it; for we muſt know that ever before Chriſt came in the fleſh, Believers believed in him to come; they had a liberty through him as to the main parts of it, and neceſſarily to ſalvation, though haply not in that degree that now ordinarily Believers indeed have that freedom: but there were ſome yoaks upon them then, which now we are delivered from, they are broken from off the necks of the Saints; yea, and ſuch as were pinching yoaks indeed, but yet leſs conſiderable by far, then thoſe from which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered and ſet free; ſo that now we ſee there is a larger liberty, and more glorious, which the ſons of God have; which will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear when we come to ſpeak to the parts of it, only this I thought good to premi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, loſt any ſhould think that liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan only when Chriſt was revealed in the fleſh; for it was the ſmalleſt part that then was added, though, I ſay, the other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from the ſore condemning, deſtroying bondage of the ſoul they had before, haply is now heightned to believers; and ſo much by way of premiſe.</p>
                     <p>For the opening of this ſpiritual Liberty, we ſhall conſider, 1. Its Subject. 2. Its Cauſes. 3. Its Parts, extenſive and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, if we may ſo ſpeak, that is to ſay, the degrees of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then for the ſubject of this Liberty, they are all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that are ſo indeed; therefore it is called Chriſtian Liberty, not only from Chriſt the Author, but from the Subjects, they are Chriſtians, Believers, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Bond or Free, Male or Female: <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, which is above, is <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 24.</note> free, which is the Mother of us all; all ſuch then as receive the Goſpel, as the poor are ſaid to do, all thoſe upon whom the Sun

of righteouſneſs doth ariſe, they are ſet free, they do go forth: for the partial ſubject of this liberty, that will better appear when we come to ſpeak of the parts of this liberty; ſome are for the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the minde, ſome the will, ſome the conſcience, ſome the whole man, but of this afterward.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Then for the cauſes of this liberty which is here promiſed, we ſhall ſpeak to ſome of them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, The principal efficient cauſe is, the Father, Son, and Spirit; the work of the Trinity <hi>ad extra,</hi> are individed: the Father it is that cals us to liberty; <hi>Ye are called to liberty,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>uſe it not as a cloke to the fleſh.

And for the Son, we have it: <hi>If the Son make you free, you ſhall be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you</hi>

And for <note place="margin">Gal 5. 1. c. 2. 4.</note> the Spirit, it is as clear: <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life in Jeſus Chriſt hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death:</hi> the <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> mighty, powerful working of the Spirit, is called the Law of the Spirit, as the powerful operation of Sin, is called the Law of Sin; and ſo in that place, <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> and ſo the Spirit of Adoption it is, that ſuccedeth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 17. Rom. 8. 15.</note> of Bondage, and ſetteth us free from that Bondage.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The impulſive cauſe is meerly his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, his good pleaſure, yea, his tender mercy, his bowels: So it is in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, <hi>The bowels of our God, whereby the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us:</hi> there is the ariſing of the Sun of rightouſneſs upon <note place="margin">Luke 1. 74.</note> us, and the effect of it you have before: <hi>That we being delivered from the hands of all our enemies, might ſerve him without fear in holineſs and righteouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi> It is not miſery is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive only, elſe he would do it for all as well as ſome, for we are all of us in the ſame bondage naturally, one as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The meritorious cauſe is the blood of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:115245:309"/>
no leſs then the blood of the Kings ſon is the price of the liberty of poor Slaves in bondage: this muſt needs be tender mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, rich love indeed: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>That through death he might deſtroy him that hath the power of death, that is, the Devil:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> no leſs then a Kings ranſom is paid for the liberty of every poor creature that is made free, and therefore he took upon him fleſh and blood; becauſe the children were partakers of the ſame, that he might die for them, and to deliver them that for fear of death were in bondage all their life-time, of which more afterward; we are now ſpeaking to the meritorious cauſe the price of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mercy, even the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The means of conferring or conveiging this liberty to poor Sinners, is the Goſpel of liberty, the Covenant of Grace held out in the Goſpel is the means; and this is plain in many places; As in that of <hi>Iſaiah, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>therefore he hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the Captives:</hi> if <note place="margin">Iſa. 42. 7.</note> ever any preaching was the Goſpel, Chriſts preaching was, and the Covenant, who himſelf was given to be the Covenant to the people: ſure he would preach nothing but that, or in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that, as he doth preach the Law too, as would eaſily appear: but we may not digreſs: and ſo in tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">Luke 4. 18.</note> where either that or ſome of the fore-cited places in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> are quoted: <hi>Ye ſhall know the truth,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>and the</hi>

                        <hi>truth ſhall make you free:</hi> by truth there, I take it is not meant indefinitely, any truth whatever, no, nor a ſcriptural truth, but the Goſpel of truth, which is called the truth: <hi>Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> it is ſuch a truth, ſo pure and precious: <hi>For his word is like Silver tryed and purified ſeven times:</hi> (that is <note place="margin">Pſal. 12. 6, 7.</note> to ſay) his Promiſe, therefore he concludeth, <hi>That the Lord will keep them, he will preſerve them for ever:</hi> and ſo pretious, ſo confirmed by miracles, that all other truth ſcarce deſerveth the name of truth in compariſon of it: either it is not ſo pure, but hath ſome droſs, or elſe not ſo pretious. O they are preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſes indeed! as the ſoul knoweth right-well, when he cometh to ſtand in need of a Promiſe, and the ſweetneſs of it he ſucks out, and it letteth down the ſweetneſs of it upon the ſoul; but take a parallel Scripture to ſhew that Goſpel is called the truth: The Apoſtle ſpeaks plainly, <hi>For the hope which is laid up
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:115245:309"/>
for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the Goſpel:</hi> and again to the <hi>Epheſians, In whom alſo ye truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>

                        <hi>after that ye heard the word of truth, the Goſpel of your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in whom alſo after ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of Promiſe.</hi> So that this is the truth then, the knowledge whereof ſhall make us free; where the Spirit of Chriſt is, there is liberty; that is clear, as you heard before; Now how is the Spirit given but by the Goſpel? <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> which is that hearing of Faith <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 2.</note> by the Word of Truth; the foregoing Verſe, even that which held forth a crucified Chriſt to them, hearing of Faith, not the rumour of Faith, but hearing is ſuch an hearing, as whereby a man believeth; and Faith by a Metonymie, is put for the Word of Faith, as the Goſpel is called ſometimes, becauſe Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is begotten; now by this the Spirit is received, and therefore liberty cometh; and therefore the Goſpel is called <hi>the miniſtration</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> in that place of the Apoſtle, becauſe therewith the Spirit is given and miniſtred to poor creatures; whereas the Law works Bondage and Wrath, <hi>Therefore Jeruſalem is free, which is above;</hi> (that is to ſay) the Church builded upon the <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 15.</note> Covenant of Grace is free, is the Mother of us all, but enough of this; The Goſpel is the outward inſtrumental cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the inward inſtrumental cauſe or Con. as ſome will have <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 2.</note> it, which I ſhall not now diſpute; that is faith, whereby we cloſe with this Covenant; it is the Word of Faith and hearing of Faith, (that is to ſay) of the Goſpel, ſo as to work Faith, whereby the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is given which brings liberty to the ſoul. Alas, many hear the Goſpel of liberty which we preach, and few do receive it, few believe it; for it appeareth by woful experience, we are yet in bondage, we have never gone forth to this day, many of us, though we have had as much preaching of the Goſpel as any other; <hi>Jeruſalem that now is,</hi> (as the Apoſtle cals it) <hi>was in bondage</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>then,</hi> though they had the Goſpel preached among them a great while, they believed not; except the Spirit therein be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, the Goſpel is but a dead letter as well as the Law, and a deadly letter alſo: and ſo much for the cauſes of this liberty or freedom which cometh by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The third thing under this head, is the parts of this liberty or freedom, which we ſhall conſider two ways. Firſt, Extenſively,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:115245:310"/>
in their latitude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> And ſecondly, Intenſively, in the degrees of each of theſe parts in its latitude. But that we may the better underſtand it, we muſt know that liberty is a relative, and reſpecteth ſome bondage, ſome impriſoning or ſhutting up, from which this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a deliverance, <hi>ye ſhall go forth:</hi> and therefore to ſet off the luſtre of this glorious liberty, it may not be amiſs to run a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel between them. That there is ſuch a bondage under which every poor creature without Chriſt, is held, we ſhall at preſent preſuppoſe, though afterward haply I ſhall come to prove it: I would not here too far digreſs before we come to ſpeak of the parts of the bondage, to which the parts of liberty will be oppoſite and correſpondent. I ſhall ſay in a few words, ſomething to the Author of this Bondage and Tenure of it, and but a word or two.</p>
                     <p>For the Author of this bondage under which poor creatures are without Chriſt altogether; and in part alſo many times when they are under Chriſt, and under Grace.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Some part of it is to be aſcribed to the Lord, ſo far forth as it is meerly vindictive, or an inflicting of a juſt penalty upon Sinners for ſin, ſo far we may aſcribe it to God, as will more plainly appear in the following Conſiderations. <hi>The Law</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>which genders to Bondage, it is his Law, and holy, and juſt and good, though it gender to Bondage:</hi> nor will it follow, becauſe we are delivered form it, therefore it was an evil in it ſelf, but only <hi>per accidens,</hi> by reaſon of our corruption, and ſo the Spirit of Bondage which in ſome is vindictive, when he binds and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers a Sinner with the cords of his ſin, haply never intending that he ſhall ſee through thoſe terrors to his comfort; this is from him, and juſtly; or elſe if it be in order to a ſettlement, to a peace, to an Adoption, a Sonſhip through Chriſt, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to the receiving of Chriſt, this is from him; and ſo ſeveral other parts of it are from him under this Conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But ſo far forth as any part of it is ſinful, there it is from Satan, and from our own evil hearts: for darkneſs cannot come from the light, nor can any thing unclean come from that which is altogether pure, no more then a clean thing can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an unclean, as the bondage under ſin, which more at large afterward we ſhall diſcuſs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For the tenure: for being in bondage, we are in

bondage to ſome perſon properly; to ſome thing impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and by a kind of <hi>Proſopopeia</hi> we are ſaid to be in ſuch a bondage; now there is ſome Tenure (as I may ſay) wherein they do hold us in bondage, there are three or four tenures (if I may ſo call them) whereby we are thus held under Bondage, until Jeſus Chriſt come to ſet us free.

                     <p>Firſt then, There is a Bondage by Captivity, when People are taken Captives; this is ſo common, there is none can be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it. What are the <hi>Turks</hi> Gally-ſlaves but the prey of their piracies? all is fiſh that cometh to the net; ſo it is in this caſe; This is one Part of the Tenure, we are taken captive by Satan even at his pleaſure; <hi>Of whom a man is overcome, of the</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, There is alſo a Bondage by Sale, as you know <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſold into Egypt for a ſervant; and nothing more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary then ſelling and buying of ſervants; he is bought with thy money, ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 12. &amp; 13. (diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of ſervants) he muſt needs be circumciſed, whereby it appears, they had a more abſolute power over them, then they had over other Servants bought of any ſtranger, which is not of thy ſeed; thy bond-men and thy bond-maids ſhall be of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, not of thy brethren, <hi>Of them ſhall ye buy bond-men and bond-maids, Levit.</hi> 25. 44.

                              <desc>•</desc>

Now there is another ſelling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man doth ſell himſelf to commit wickedneſs, as you know <hi>Ahab</hi> did. <hi>Paul</hi> did not now ſell himſelf, but was under the former ſale, and in ſuch a bondage he could by no means alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">2 King. 21. 20.</note> free himſelf from; he could not ſhake off his chains and weights that did hang upon him by reaſon of this bondage; but now Sinners, they ſell themſelves. Such as <hi>Ahab, Haſt thou found me, O mine enemy?</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Elijah: I have found thee, becauſe thou haſt ſold thy ſelf to work wickedneſs in the ſight of the Lord; and ſo the Iſraelites are ſaid to ſell themſelves to do evil in the ſight of the Lord, making their Sons and Daughters paſs through fire, &amp;c.</hi> Now by this Sale, the Sinner paſſeth himſelf over into the power of him that buyeth him, yet more and more fully. <hi>Quod venditur, tranſit in poteſtate ementis:</hi> The Devil knew the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his, the price he pays, a little pleaſure of ſin, a little profit; he cares not how often there be a bargain between him and the ſoul of a Sinner; a man that for a little pelf will venture and hazard his ſoul, he ſhall have it, or elſe it ſhall coſt the Devil a fall; I ſpeak not of Witches ſelling themſelves to Satan, for the accompliſhment of ſome luſt, to ſatisfie ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, but of every lew and wicked Sinner; he little knoweth what he doth, that goeth on in a courſe of Sin; every new tranſgreſſion and ſatisfaction to the fleſh is a new price, (as I may ſay) laid down in your hands for your ſouls to become ſlaves to the Devil. O how many times hath he bought many of us! and have we ſold our ſelves to do evil in the ſight of the Lord? the ambitious man for the ſatisfaction of his luſt, ſels himſelf to commit wickedneſs; as the covetous you ſee in <hi>Ahab,</hi> to have his deſire, would not ſtick to murther, to
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:115245:311"/>
ſuborn witneſſes to ſwear falſly; the ambitious perſon would not care to ſwim through a Sea of blood to the Throne, they are ſlaves to the worſt of Tyrants, a luſt; it would make a man tremble to read the fearful things that are done upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſpecially by the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> the great Turk, who rivits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Imperial Throne, with the bones of his murthered brethren, as one expreſſeth it. O how dear a rate do men give, who ſell their precious ſouls for a ſpurt of pleaſure, for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, they are not alway in ſeaſon neither; or a little profit of ſin, a little unjuſt gain, they pay not twenty, nor an hundred years purchaſe, but if the Lord do not intervene with the purchaſe of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, they pay eternity for it, and when they have ſo ſold their ſouls to commit wickedneſs, what can they give, or what would they give in exchange for their ſouls again? a world full of honours, and pleaſures, and <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 26.</note> profits then, alas, would be nothing to part with, if they might but have them redeemed, when it is too late; this is another way whereby ſinners come into bondage.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By brith alſo there is a bondage; as you know the children of them who were taken captives were captives, they were ſold themſelves, that were ſold, and with them their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, therefore ſuch ſervants as the Iſraelites bought with money, <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 14.</note> how many ſo ever they did beget in their families, they were all ſervants and bond-men; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſo many ſervants train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, born in his own houſe, 318. <hi>I had ſervants born in mine houſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> The Iſraelites indeed, if they did ſell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through poverty, or became ſervants, they did continue <note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 7.</note> until the year of jubilee, but muſt not be ruled over with rigor, as they might rule over ſtrangers, nor muſt be kept as bond-men for ever; but the ſtrangers they might buy of them, and leave them as a poſſeſſion for ever to their children, that is to ſay, both them and their children; they might buy, and ſo ſell them again, and leave them to their children, and therefore all born in ſuch a condition were bond-ſervants; ſo we find in that place when our Saviour told them they ſhould be free indeed, if the Son made <note place="margin">Lev. 25. 46.</note> them free; why ſaid they, <hi>We are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and never were in bondage by birth;</hi> we are free, not as the ſeed of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 33.</note> who were bond-men, and they never were in bondage to any, they were not ſold as ſervants; poor blind creatures could ſee no <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note>
                        <pb n="490" facs="tcp:115245:312"/>
further then a civil bondage or liberty. Now truly Brethren, thus we are all of us bond-men and women by birth, being all ſtrangers from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Covenant of promiſes (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) they are the children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe only, that are free. We are all the children of wrath by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not a mothers child of us free-born; if any by nature ſhould have been free-born, ſurely the ſeed of <hi>Abrah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, by tenure and uſurpation there is a bondage alſo; as we ſee it in the caſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were bond-men in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they made them ſerve a hard bondage, it is called <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>the houſe of bondage;</hi> they made them ſerve with rigour, ſo ſaith the text, in all manner of ſervice; the deſign of the King being to weary them out by degrees, and yet to advantage himſelf by their ſervice, while they were wearying out, this was their wiſe dealing with them, leſt they ſhould be too hard for them; and truly of this nature is the bondage wherein the people of God themſelves are in part, though the Devil have no title to them, the price being paid for them to the juſtice of the Father, yet he as a tyrannical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aylor, loath to let them go, and therefore he loads them with chains, laies heavy temptations upon them, and ſin rageth to loſe its ſervant, and therefore tyrannizeth, <hi>and the Law in the members carryeth captive to the Law of ſin,</hi> and this is one great grief to the poor child of God, that though ſin do not raign in their mortal bodies, yet it tyrannizeth over them, and with a ſtrong hand many times holds them down, ſo as that they are not able to ſtir hand nor foot: but more of this afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Now for the parts of this bondage, with which the parts of that liberty or freedom we are to ſpeak of will run parallel: We ſhall devide this bondage into theſe two general parts, it is either to ſin, or elſe to the black concomitants, which are very many; we ſhall particularize ſome of them, and thereby our liberty will the more plainly appear.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then for ſin, it is clear we are in bondage to ſin, either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally or in part, all of us by nature altogether in bondage, for we are ſold under ſin; and though it be true, that ſin is only a

privation of good, and diſpoſition to evil, and ſo properly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to rule over us, yet by a <hi>proſopopeia</hi> we are ſaid to be in bondage to it, therefore we are ſaid to <hi>be ſold under ſin;</hi> ſold <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> under it, and therefore in Scripture it is, that ſin is called an old man, corrupt according to deceitful luſts, and this old man it is <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22.</note> that hath the poor ſinner under his power, and ruleth him with ſubtilty.

                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 34.</note> You talk of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and never being in bondage, this is nothing to my purpoſe, I ſpeak of a bondage to ſin, and he that commits it is the ſervant of it; he that works it induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, is a drudge to his luſts, as alas, how many of us are? and he that curiouſly works it is an Artiſt. O with what art can ſome <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> mon lye, and cheat, and cozen, and play the hypocrites! theſe are the ſervants of ſin. O when one fulfills the luſts of the fleſh, and of the mind, maketh proviſion for the fleſh to ſatisfie the luſts thereof! This man is a ſervant of ſin: the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, the pride of life, the love of profits, the love of pleaſures, and the love of pride, when men give themſelves up to ſatisfie theſe, ſtudy their luſts, how to fulfill them, this is a bondage under ſin with a witneſs.</p>

So it is here, the Law of God <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 23.</note> is that which ſhuts up a ſinner, as it is in that place of the Apoſtle; ſo that we are, as I may ſay, in priſon; and a man under guilt, whether he ſleep, or whether he wake, he is a guilty perſon and under bondage; ſpecially, if it proceed ſo far as to a condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is in this caſe, every unbeliever is condemned already in the Court of Scripture; for God doth mannage in this liberty concernments of our ſouls by a Law, by a Law he acquitteth or condemneth, and ſo unbelievers are under this bondage alſo; from this now every child of God is ſet free, <hi>there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> their guilt is done away, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> their ſurety hath ſatisfied juſtice, hath paid the debt, laid down the price, and therefore all being cleared, the poor creature is ſet free from that part of his bondage.

and ſo the night impriſoneth men, ſhutteth up their works and employments, <hi>night cometh when no man can work,</hi> which is the night of darkneſs, by removing the Goſpel; or elſe the night of death: Now when the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſeth upon a ſoul, he ſhall go forth of this darkneſs or priſon.</p>
                     <p>Here it will be enquired what is meant by this darkneſs, which is a part of this bondage. Firſt, by darkneſs, I mean a ſtate of ignorance; <hi>groſs darkneſs covereth the earth,</hi> ſaith the Prophet; <hi>ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are ye light in the Lord;</hi> that is to ſay, ſo dark as that nothing but the abſtract would <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 8.</note> ſuffice to ſet forth their condition. Now truly, ignorance may well be lookt upon as a bondage, for it is the very beginning, the principal of all our bondage, and therefore when the Lord ſpeaks of delivering a poor ſinner from the power of ſin, he ſaith, <hi>who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated us</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>into the Kingdom of his dear Son:</hi> mind you, <hi>from the power of darkneſs,</hi> darkneſs is the power of Satan, he is the Prince of the power of darkneſs, as ſome render that place: were it not that ſinners are blind-folded, do you think they would be led by <note place="margin">Eph 2. 2.</note> Satan into ſo many horrid things? O if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi> Alas, the <hi>Panther</hi> hideth his head when he allureth the beaſts, the ſweetneſs of his ſmell, or beauty of his <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 34.</note> skin, only the <hi>Drag</hi> is ſaid to flie from him, <hi>Iſid. li.</hi> 12. 2. See <hi>Mead</hi> upon <hi>Revel.</hi> p. 2. p. 52. Alas, they ſee not the head, which is ready to affright them and devour them; and not only is it the ground of this bondage, but of all the reſt; how cometh it to paſs that poor ſouls are plunged into ſuch deſperate gulfs of deſpairing, and ſuch breaking bondage in that kind, but becauſe they are held in ignorance, they do not come to know the Father and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, he keepeth them in ignorance of the <note place="margin">John 17.</note> promiſes, the ſweet and precious promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt. O dear friends, it is impoſſible, were it not for our ignorance of that love of God in Jeſus Chriſt, and that riches, exceeding riches of grace that is in him, and his thoughts that are above our thoughts, that there ſhould be ſo many cloudings, ſuch fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plunges as many poor ſouls are put unto, yea many times even after they are once delivered from them; why now I ſay, when the Lord Jeſus cometh, ariſeth upon a ſoul as the Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:115245:315"/>
he diſpels this ignorance, diſcovers ſin in its own colours, and indeed worſe it cannot be ſet forth in; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>ſin might appear to be ſin;</hi> and then he opens the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 13.</note> of the Promiſes of the Covenant of Grace, to let a poor ſinner ſee there is enough for him there: though his ſins be great, yet mercy is tranſcendantly greater: if he have mountains to be covered, the Lord hath a ſea to ſwallow them up; if multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of ſin, there is multitude of mercies: there is love, which will cover a multitude; and ſo by diſcovering himſelf thus, and our ſelves to our ſelves, he by degrees ſetteth the creature at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from thoſe fearfull apprehenſions of God, and from that delight in ſin, which formerly he had taken; ſo that now no longer will he ſerve it.

then, with the cords of love, ſweetly thereby inclining our hearts, and bowing our wills, and then the poor creature come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth out of this bondage; before we ſee we are in priſon, or ſee the loathſomneſs of it, the darkneſs of it, we are in love with it, and will not go forth.</p>
                     <p>But Secondly, This darkneſs comprehendeth another, and that is Error, or rather this ariſeth from the other, and therefore we ſhall ſpeak to it apart, <hi>Ye err, not knowing the Scripture, nor the</hi>

The Apoſtle there ſpeaks of Heretical Doctrine, held by ſuch as do perverſly oppoſe themſelves againſt the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, who hold out the truth as it is in Jeſus. He ſheweth how <hi>Timothy</hi> is to carry himſelf to them, in meekneſs, inſtructing them that oppoſe themſelves; if God peradventure will give them repentance, to the acknowledgement of the truth; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is a turning from ſin to God, and to the contrary <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        </note> Grace or Vertue, and that is the acknowledgement of the truth; therefore their ſin was ſome corruption of the truth, and that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will, out of the ſnare of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; a ſad ſnare it is: if the devil can but get ſo far within a man as to dazle his eyes, to blinde them, he may lead them whither he will; if he can but corrupt their judgement, eſpecially in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals or practicals, then they are his own, they are faſt enough, he carryeth them captive, takes them alive even at his pleaſure. Now our liberty from this part of bondage alſo is by the ariſing of <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 13.

                     <p>Fifthly, There is another part of bondage, under a ſlaviſh obedience, that is to ſay, ſuch an obedience to the Law of God, as nothing but a ſlaviſh fear is the principle of it; and truly, this puts on men to do many things; they know it is written, <hi>Curſed is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>he that continueth not in every thing that is written in the book of the Law to do it:</hi> Now this ſticks with the poor ſoul, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth me to love him with all my heart, with all my ſoul, with all my ſtrength; and if I do not, I am curſed; therefore now he buckles a little to it, as far as ſuch terrors will carry him; but alas, he is not able to do it; like a ſlave that doth his task, while his Maſter ſtands over him with a rod; or becauſe he is ſure to be beaten, if he do it not; not out of any love to the Maſter, nor to his ſervice at all, what a grievous bondage is this? Let but any Apprentice, that hath a hard Maſter, whom he ſerveth meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of fear, as the Egyptians did their task, becauſe if they did them not, they muſt be beaten: and this maketh the yoke very heavy and uneaſie, alſo it pincheth exceedingly. Now when the Lord Jeſus cometh to a ſoul, he breaks this yoke, the Law <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 24. &amp; 3. 13.</note> genders to bondage; the curſe of it hath the very ſeeds of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in it: Now I ſay when the Lord Jeſus cometh, ariſeth upon a ſoul, letteth him ſee that he hath undertaken for him, not only the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe, but hath ſet his love upon him, hath paid all the debt, will take him to be his ſon, no more as a ſervant; O now when the ſoul beginneth to be ſenſible his condition is changed, that he is a Son, and now hath not a cruel hard Maſter to ſerve, but a Father that will pity and ſpare where he falleth ſhort of his duty, let him do his beſt; this doth much facilitate the work, maketh the yoke eaſie, and the burden <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> light, his Commandments are no more ſo grievous to the ſoul, as they were before: Now the Law of Chriſt is a perfect Law of Liberty to him; before it was a Law gendring bondage; for alas, before it was only preached to the ear, and that under the <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 25.</note> penalty of ſuch a curſe, now it is written in the heart; now there is an eccho in the ſoul reſounding, <hi>Thy will Lord will I do,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſal. 40.</note> when he ſpeaks any thing; as the Law of love was upon the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:115245:316"/>
heart of Chriſt, in the work of our Redemption; now his Law is in our hearts, and therefore we delight to do his will in ſome meaſure, <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man,</hi> as the <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 22.</note> Apoſtle ſaith; as a Servant it may be for a while under his Maſter hardly uſed, yet afterward he changeth his manner of dealing with him, offers him great immunities, it may be, to be of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Son in Law to the King: O now the Servant will be bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he will now become a willing ſervant, and not be dragged to obedience by terrors and fears any more, but willingly yieldeth up his members weapons of righteouſneſs to holineſs: now the <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 6. Exod. 21. 5. &amp; 6. Rom. 6. 19. Pſal 110. Rom. 6. 17.</note> ſervice is hearty and free; his people ſhall be a willing people in the day of his power: O ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Ye were the ſervants of ſin, but now thanks be to God, ye have from the heart obeyed the form of doctrine delivered to you:</hi> from the heart, that is to ſay, out of love, it cannot elſe well be from the heart; for whom we dread with a ſlaviſh fear, we hate, and while the ſoul looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, as ſuch a Judge, as a cruel Maſter, and his Law a cruel, bloody Law, nothing but blood and ruine to them that come not up unto it, there is a hatred of God, it is impoſſible to love him, or his ſervice; and then the ſervice ſuch a man doth, it is not from the heart; a man may ſerve ſin, and yet do ſome ſervice to God out of a ſlaviſh fear, as moſt unbelievers do; therefore they pray, and therefore they read, and therefore they do many things, and yet ſerve ſin; but they never obey from the heart, until this work be done, the Law of love be written in their ſouls: now you ſhall go forth, you ſhall obey no more out of fear, but out of love: this is a Fifth.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, From the terrors and fears before a mans converſion, which uſually ſeize upon the creature, in order to it; for truly, before the Lord hath to do with our hearts, we are ſo dead aſleep with the opium of ſin, that there muſt be ſomewhat to rouſe us, to awaken us; uſually there is a ſpirit of bondage, which works fear and dread, and terror in the ſoul, that is to ſay, when the Spirit of Chriſt, breathing in the Commandment, maketh ſin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſin, exceeding ſinfull, and opens ſome of the terrors which ſin doth breed in it, witneſſeth to the poor creature, that he is in a ſtate of condemnation, that there is no way but one with <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> him: O now the ſoul beginneth to be amazed, and ſtartled, and knoweth not what to do! this runs him to the heart: he had
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:115245:317"/>
many afflictions and troubles in the fleſh before, never any came ſo near as this; and no marvel, becauſe the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Jeſus Chriſt hath wounded him at the very heart. Brethren, the Law of God is, as I may ſay, an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> or rather <hi>Animam,</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, or claps up a ſoul, as I may ſay, puts him in priſon; and therefore the Apoſtle uſeth that expreſſion; mind you, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath concluded all under ſin <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> hath ſhut us up together, all concluded under one priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in one dungeon, that <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 23.</note> the promiſe, which is of Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, might be given to them that believe; but before Faith came, we were kept under the Law: I pray you minde it, we were kept as in a Garriſon, as the Learned interpret it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; and again, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut up together unto the Faith, which ſhould afterward be revealed: it is juſt as it is with a Prince, he proclaimeth Pardon to all his Rebellious Subjects, but withall he ſendeth out his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, his Purſuivants, to apprehend, throw in priſon, keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Bolts and Shakles as many of them as he can apprehend; this is not contrary to his mercy, nor proclamation of Pardon, but in order to it, ſubordinate to it, that ſo his Pardon, offered might be accepted, they might ſue for it: So it is here, the Law doth thus ſhut up a ſoul, as I may ſay; as when there is an High-way open for a man to walk in, but he will go another way, there it is hedged up; at laſt he is ſo hedged in, he cannot tell which way in the world to get out again: O then! if he could but finde the open way, he would go in it: So it is in this caſe, the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this terror and this bondage a means to their inlargement. Ah bleſſed Priſon! that is only to make poor creatures willing to be at liberty; well, now this the Lord Jeſus when he cometh and revealeth himſelf to a ſoul, he brings him out of theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths of fears and terrors; letteth the poor creature ſee, that himſelf is the way, and the only way; he hath undertaken the work for his people, only if they will believe, though they have no ſtrength in them to do any thing, nor to extricate themſelves from the difficulties they find themſelves in, by reaſon they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fulfil the Law; yet he is the mighty one upon whom help is laid, and withal letteth them underſtand how his bowels do yern over them, and how his heart is open, ready to inlarge them; and ſo perſwadeth them to cloſe with him; and then they go forth when faith cometh; ſo Chriſt is the end of the Law, and the

                        </gap>aw a School-Maſter to bring us to Chriſt: But that is but the Sixth.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Another part of this bondage, is thoſe after-claps of fears and terrours, that after Chriſt hath been revealed to, and in a ſoul, may befall the creature; alas, you find it ſo, they may be clapt up afterward in the pit of noiſe, the horrible pit, and be in the deeps, and in darkneſs; and like <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 2.</note> ſink in the mire, where there is no ſtanding, they feel no bottom of their miſery, their fears are overwhelming; or like <hi>Jonahs</hi>

Now I ſay, the darkneſs of a mans own heart, which doth naturally gender, fear, and Satan to help, and the frowns of Gods diſpleaſure for the preſent, though he do not witneſs any more that a man is a child of eternal wrath and diſpleaſure, theſe may bring the poor creature into ſad perplexities; Well, yet the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus when he cometh, brings alſo liberty with him from this bondage; <hi>David</hi> will tel you ſo; and <hi>Heman</hi> will tell you ſo: do but conſider what conditions they were in? how came they to be delivered? <hi>O lift up the light of thy countena nce upon me;</hi>

Well, the Promiſe doth extend even to this bondage alſo, and to this may we refer the next: I will ſpeak of it diſtinctly.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, There is another Bondage, and that is the fears of death and judgement, whereby many a poor creature is kept in Bondage all the days of their lives; (as the Apoſtle ſaith in that to the <hi>Hebrews)</hi> to which I will ſpeak a few words; <hi>He came;</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>and took part of fleſh and blood, that through death be might deſtroy him that hath the power of death</hi> (that is to <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> ſay, the Devil) <hi>and deliver them that through fear of death were all their life-time ſubject to Bondage.</hi> Brethren, death it ſelf is a terrible thing, the <hi>Simplex</hi> could ſay, but hardly could he

tell the reaſon of it; for them that have no fear of God before their eyes, but have put out the eye of reaſon, and live like Beaſts, giving up themſelves to commit wickedneſs with greedineſs, though while they can keep off the apprehenſions of death, they may go on merrily, but when that ſeizeth upon them, it marrs their mirth, it maketh a change in their faces, and they are not: now truly death is not ſo terrible in it ſelf conſidered, but that the ſtoutneſs of a mans ſpirit, ſpecially where there is no other conſideration of it, he may overcome it, and live above the fears of it, as the Heathens ſome of them did; but now a man that knoweth indeed what death is, not only a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the union between the ſoul and body, taking down this mouldring Tabernacle, but a Serpent with a ſting it is, where <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 15. 5, 6.</note> ſin and guilt lies upon the ſoul; it is the beginning of ſorrows, the arreſt of the ſoul to judgement to come, to receive its doom for all its bloody evils he hath been guilty of. The wordling is not willing to give up his ſoul, O he knoweth, he can never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for his waſting of his ſpirits, and ſpending his time to lay up treaſure here, and in the mean time neglecting his ſoul and Jeſus Chriſt, and tenders of Grace; he knoweth this well enough, and therefore he will not yield up his Spirit, they ſhall take it from him, as it is in the Parable; <hi>This night ſhall thy ſoul be taken from thee:</hi> and ſo for any other ſin; and now I ſay this maketh death <note place="margin">Luke 12. 20.</note> terrible, and by reaſon of theſe fears of death, men that have any ſight or ſenſe of their condition, they are in Bondage all their lives long, yea, even the people of God themſelves are in ſome meaſure under this bondage; and according to the meaſure of the diſcovery of Chriſt to them, and the power of faith in them, is this fear, and this bondage broken, and the Lord Jeſus came for this end, to deliver them: alas, before his coming the Saints may be ſpecially meant here, who had indeed the knowledge of Chriſt to be crucified for Sinners, and beheld him crucified, though darkly in the ſacrifices, &amp;c. and in the promiſe from the foundation of the world, but yet notwithſtanding they had not that confidence uſually, but there was more room for doubtings and fears, becauſe they died ſtill without the accompliſhing of that promiſe; now though ſuch as had an extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith and a prophetical ſpirit, might ſee this clearly, and ſo it might raiſe them much what above this bondage, yet ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:115245:318"/>
I believe it was not ſo, that they had ſuch clear conviction of the freeneſs of grace, and the abundance and riches of it in Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore it did not ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> there is not that real terrour in it, that otherwiſe, except himſelf had gone through it, and broken the bars of it, and pluckt out the ſting, and ſanctified it as a paſſage to our Glory as well as to his own, we ſhould ſtill have been in as great bondage as they were in this reſpect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace according to thy word:</hi> now he had embraced the Lord <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 29.</note> Chriſt not only in his bodily arms, but had a clearer diſcovery alſo of him to his ſoul doubtleſs: and the ſence may help faith alſo.</p>
                     <p>But then ſecondly, According to the meaſure of the faith of his people is the degree of their liberty from this bondage; alas, it is terrible to many of us, yea, ſuch as do believe; but their faith is weak, and the perſwaſions of ſenſe are ſtrong, and hold down the ſoul many times, but the Lord Jeſus came to deliver his people alſo from this bondage, and according to the degrees of his manifeſting himſelfto the ſoul, will the ſoul go forth from theſe fears: and though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> died doubtful whither he ſhould go, and yet cried out, <hi>Ens entium, &amp; cauſa cauſarum miſerere mei;</hi> Yet the Apoſtle, and thoſe that attained that pitch, <hi>to know that when our tabernacles are diſſolved, we have an houſe eternal in the heavens:</hi> to know, <hi>the ſting of death, and victory of the grave is ſwallowed up by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>

                     <p>Ninthly, A freedom or liberty from the Govenant of works; What ſaith the Law? <hi>Do this and live: continue in every thing that is written;</hi> now when the ſoul cometh to ſee how ſpirittual the Law is, and how earnal he is, and ſold under ſin, that it binds not only the thoughts, but the deſires of the heart, that there muſt not be ſo much as a vain thought paſs through his ſoul, but if there do, this Covenant knoweth no mercy; alas, this keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the poor creature under much bondage, and trouble, and doubting concerning his condition; now we muſt know that this is not a bondage of Gods putting upon us, (though he gave us the Law) but of our own making; the Lord gave the Law with Evangelical purpoſes, it was added becauſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; it was added, that the Covenant of Grace, that it might convince poor creatures of their condition by ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Rom. 10. 1, 2.</note> yield to be righteous by the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt: the one was their freedom by Birth, <hi>They were the ſeed of Abraham, and not the ſeed of the Bond-woman,</hi> and therefore what need they care for this liberty: the other was their own works, they made account their own penny was good ſilver enough, though the Lord knoweth it was but reprobate ſilver, they went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, they would be juſtified by a Covenant of works. And ſo there were ſome that came, and
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:115245:319"/>
endeavoured to turn aſide the <hi>Galathians</hi> to another Goſpel, by teaching them they ſhould again put their necks under this yoke, not only of Ceremonies, though that be one thing to the Jews, if not to the Gentiles, that never were under it; but it is the Law, the Moral Law, as a Covenant of Works, elſe to what end doth he mention the curſe therein: <hi>And if ye be juſtified by the Law, Chriſt ſhall not profit you, you are fallen from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace.</hi> Well now, the Lord Jeſus, when he is revealed to a ſoul, delivereth him from this: though I muſt tell you, it is an harder matter to get clearly off it, then many do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and even the people of God themſelves ſhall find, that too often they are turned aſide to the bondwoman from the free, from the Covenant of Grace to a Covenant of Works. Again, from the Law as provoking, for that is the Bondage chiefly the Apoſtle ſpeaks of: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. But the more clearly and fully the Grace which is in Chriſt, is revealed to us, with the greater power he ariſeth upon us, the more fully are we ſet free from it. Here we might diſcuſs the queſtion, how far we are delivered from the Law, and how far by Jeſus Chriſt? I will rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that to another place, and proceed to conclude this part.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, There is a kind of bondage the people of God are under, even that weakneſs, and ſtraitneſs, and deadneſs of heart towards God: you know that ſickneſs doth weaken a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, in ſo much that he can ſcarce go upon his legs, he is a priſoner a great while under that weakneſs, from all action to purpoſe; let but a poor priſoner be under hardſhip a while in the priſon, and how feeble will he be, and ſcarce worth the ground he goeth upon? a while longer he is a priſoner under that weakneſs, ſo it is here; therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Then</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>will I run the ways of thy commandments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart.</hi> Now the Lord Jeſus when he cometh in with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſpeaking peace, ſmiling upon the ſoul, filling the heart with joy unſpeakable, this joy of the Lord is the ſtrength of the ſoul, he goeth forth, even as a man to his labour in the morning when the Sun ariſeth, that drouſineſs, heavineſs, deadneſs under which he was a priſoner before, being now removed.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, There is a liberty and freedom alſo from outward afflictions, for theſe are alſo an appendix of the Law, a part of the execution of it; and therefore the Lord doth ſet his people
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:115245:320"/>
free from the fear of theſe, before they come, which is a kind of bondage upon them. Secondly, From the preſence of them when they are come. Or Thirdly, From the evil of them, the pinching, and wringing, and galling of the yoke.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In reſpect of the fear of them, <hi>They ſhall go forth:</hi> he ſpeaks here plainly to the believing Jews, they were afraid of the judgments of God in the threatning while they did but hang over their heads, and they were in a kind of priſon, or bondage by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this fear; Well ſaith the Lord, <hi>Fear not, you ſhall go forth, the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe upon you. Job was afraid of his ſorrows:</hi> take and compare <hi>Job</hi> the none-ſuch in the Eaſt, a moſt eminent Saint, and <hi>Paul</hi> in the New Teſtament: and the <note place="margin">Iob 9, 28.</note> one you find; <hi>he is afraid of his ſorrows, Paul he glories in his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,</hi> you never hear him complaining of his ſufferings, no nor feared them, he knew <hi>that bonds and impriſonments did abide him in every City,</hi> but he cared not for any of theſe things, he <note place="margin">Acts 20. 23.</note> had a richer diſcovrey of the Grace of God in Chriſt, then <hi>Job</hi> had, and clearer it is like; and therefore this ſet him free in a great meaſure from them: and indeed his ſoul that knoweth the things that are freely given him in Chriſt, knoweth now that he is his Father, and what ever ſhall befall him, it ſhall turn to his good, what need he much to fear.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They ſhall go out from the preſence of them, this the Lord doth many times for his people what though <hi>the day of the Lord burn like an oven, and burn up the chaff and ſtubble, and devour them root and branch, I will be an hiding place to you, ſaith the Lord, You that fear my name indeed, and tremble at my word:</hi> O the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe upon you, and by vertue of his death ye ſhall be delivered as the Jews were in <hi>Egypt, By the ſprinkling of the blood of the Paſſover upon the Poſts of the Doors,</hi> which did repreſent and typifie the blood of Jeſus Chriſt: <note place="margin">Exod. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

difference between the deliverances of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and other people are, the one is a Covenant mercy, the other a common mercy meerly. Well now ſaith the Lord, ye ſhall go forth of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even as the children in the Furnace, it burned, but they eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, the Lord Jeſus was with them, ſo ſhall ye go forth; and the Lord did provide a little <hi>Zoar</hi> for his people in the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> many of them eſcaped to <hi>Pella</hi> as the ſtory go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, a little Town beyond <hi>Jordan;</hi> and ſo the Lord doth ſeal the 144000. before he brings thoſe bloody calamities upon the earth, <note place="margin">Rev. 7.</note> the perſecuting world, and thoſe in the ninth of <hi>Ezekiel, O who would not be in Covenant with God! they ſhall go forth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or thirdly, They ſhall be freed from the deſtroying evil, the hardening evil of affliction, which is a bondage, and a ſore one too, being bound in affliction and iron; and ſo <hi>Job</hi> in the 13. ch. <note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 10.</note> ver. 27. God writeth bitter things againſt him, and puts his feet in the ſtocks, and all his affliction together is called <hi>Jobs</hi> captivity; he was, as I may ſay, reſigned up to the pleaſure of Satan for a while, who led him from one affliction to another, but the Lord brought him out, and brought him off without the evil, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil expected that he ſhould curſe him and dye, curſe him to his <note place="margin">Iob 1. 11.</note> face: now I ſay, the Lord maketh his people go forth, brings them through; and not only ſo, but without any of the hurt ſeizing upon them. Sinners are the harder for being in the fire, but they are melted, as very a ſtone as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was, he began to burn in the fire, and be hot, and a man would have thought his heart had given, but it was a ſtone ſtill; but his people came out melted, refined with this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> to all their afflictions. <hi>O it was good for me, I could not have been without it, much of my droſs</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 71.</note> 
                        <hi>is gone by it;</hi> and thus the Lord maketh his people go forth; <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, There is one more, and that is the yoak of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies &amp; traditions of men, I will put them both together; the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were a yoak you know, circumciſion was a hard ſervice, to draw blood of their children at eight daies old, their journeys to their feaſts at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> their offerings and oblations, they were very chargeable, inſomuch that they grew weary of them, and ſnuffed at them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the Traditions of men, they are a grievous burthen where their Doctrines are taught and received; <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 13.</note>
                        <pb n="508" facs="tcp:115245:321"/>
the Apoſtle comprehends both-under that word, the rudiments of the world, whereunto he would not have them be brought in <note place="margin">Col. 2. 8, 20.</note> bondage again, the difference of meats and drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Lord Jeſus hath let us looſe from thoſe obſervations, and therefore it is a deſperate doctrine, a doctrine of Devils, or at leaſt of them that ſpeak lies in hypocriſie, to forbid to marry, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 2, 3.</note> to abſtain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thankſgiving; and bleſſed be his name, that by the riſing of the Sun of righteouſneſs among us, he hath brought us out from this bondage generally: and if he would be pleaſed to ſhine among the poor ignorant Papiſts, that they might but come to the knowledge of his will, doubtleſs this would be quickly ſhakt off with them alſo, but you have the parts of this liberty.</p>
                     <p>For the degrees of it, we muſt know this, that it is not in the ſame degree to every believer, you have already heard, how that before Chriſt's coming it was not in ſuch power as ſince; <hi>Ye ſhall go forth,</hi> hath been accompliſhed in many reſpects ſince the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and the more faith and the clearer ſight we have of Jeſus Chriſt, with the greater power, and ſplendor, and glory he ſhines upon us, the more of the riches of his grace we come to apprehend, the more fully and perfectly to reſt upon that grace, the more ſhall we find that all theſe bondages ſhall be broken we have been ſpeaking to; but thus much for the two things, which is, what this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is.</p>
                     <p>Which are the arguments for the further confirmation of the <note place="margin">3.</note> Doctrine, <hi>Where the Lord Jeſus ariſeth upon a ſoul, there is liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and enlargement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, from the very nature of that gift of grace, the ariſing of the Sun of righteouſneſs upon them, what is this but the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of himſelf unto a ſoul, <hi>revealing himſelf in the ſoul,</hi> as the <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>it pleaſed the Father to reveal his ſon in me,</hi> by which means that darkneſs and terrour is taken away in great meaſure; <hi>Chriſt is all in all:</hi> the bondage you heard before, it is <note place="margin">Col. 3. 11.</note> either ſin, or the ſad effects of ſin; the revelation of Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably, is either for holineſs, or elſe by joy and comfort, wherein he meeteth with both the other, the guilt, the bondage he takes away, to that end <hi>himſelf was made ſin, that knew no ſin,</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, another Argument ſhall be this, <hi>that they might ſerve him, therefore they ſhall go forth;</hi> while a man is under bondage he is at the command of ſuch as he is in bondage unto, and therefore cannot ſerve another Maſter whatſoever; this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reſpecteth that part of the bondage which concerneth ſin and Satan: when Satan had filled <hi>Ananias</hi> heart, could he obey <note place="margin">Acts 5. 1 King. 21.</note> the will of Chriſt? No, no more could <hi>Ahab</hi> that had ſold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to commit wickedneſs; it is impoſſible for a man to be a ſlave of ſin, and a ſervant of Chriſt at the ſame time.

                        <hi>of unrighteouſneſs to unholineſs, and yet pretends to be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt.</hi> What is this but a mockery? but be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, God is not mocked: would you not take this to be a mockery, if one come and tells you, O Sir, I will be your ſervant if you will give me this or that reward, but you muſt give me leave to do all the ſervice I can to your enemy, you ſhall have the name of my ſervice, but your enemy ſhall have the reality of it: is not this a mockery?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That their ſervices may be more chearful, therefore he ſetteth them free from their bondage, and this reſpecteth that part of bondage which concerneth the Concomitants, even ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and fears, and terrours, and the like; the Lord doth not love to have his people follow him whining, he loveth a cheerful giver and a cheerful doer of his will, it is much for his honour that his ſervants ſhould lift up their heads; for what would we ſay to ſee a poor ſervant go diſcouraged, and as if ſcarce worth the earth he goes upon, amazed with fears, with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; ſure ſuch a ſervant hath a hard Maſter, that he hath ſo <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 2.</note> little joy of his life, therefore the Lord Jeſus maketh his people go forth out of the horrible pit, ſetteth them free from all their fears, and terrours, that they may with a cheerful and a large heart ſerve him; here is love indeed, that the Lord doth ſo ſweeten his yoak and his ſervice, as that his people ſhall delight in it, therefore ſaith he, that we might ſerve him without fear in <note place="margin">Luke 1. 74.</note> holineſs and righteouſneſs all the daies of our lives.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that their ſervices to him may be more ſtrong then otherwiſe they would, a man under bonds brought down with bard bondage, cannot do the ſervice which another man can, but the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> joy of the Lord is the ſtrength of his people, as in that of <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10. therefore he doth enlarge their hearts, that they may run the waies of his commandments, takes off the fetters for this very end; a poor child of God under terrours and fears, or under the prevailing of a luſt, have, as I may ſay, their hands manacled, they cannot fight, their feet are fettered, they cannot walk, much leſs run.</p>

                     <p>For the Application of the point, there are ſeveral uſes to be made of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, take notice from hence what a grievous bondage the ſervice of ſin is, this is the principal part of the bondage, and all the reſt are but the product of ſin; ſin is pregnant, it hath the ſeeds of all thoſe terrors, fears, ſorrows, ſlaviſhneſs, deadneſs, ſtraitneſs, and all the reſt in its womb, but it ſelf is the chief, and therefore we are ſaid <hi>to be ſold under ſin, and ſin is ſaid to have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over us;</hi> ſo many luſts, Brethren, in ſtrength, ſo many <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> pairs of fetters there are about our legs, and how then is it likely that a ſinner ſhould run the waies of Gods Commandments! but I hope by what hath been ſaid already, it will be granted, that a condition of ſin is a condition of bondage; only a little to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate this conſideration to you, and all little enough, I doubt, to ſtartle ſinners who are in this condition.</p>
                     <p>Firſt conſider, it is the baſeſt, moſt ſordid thing that can be; you know a ſervile condition is mean and baſe in compariſon of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and freedom, take it at the beſt; but to ſerve the baſeſt of men, who would not abhor this? what ſpirit would ſtoop to be a drudge to a Maſter, to rake Channels and cleanſe Jakes, who would not abhor this? Brethren, this is nothing to ſin, to the ſlavery of ſin: as it was the greateſt honour in the world to be <hi>a ſervant, a ſon of God; Moſes the ſervant of the Lord, David my ſervant:</hi> As you know ſervants do much bear themſelves up upon the honour of their Maſters. So it is the baſeſt ſervitude in the world to be in bondage to a luſt, for a man to ſell himſelf into the hands of ſin and Satan, for a moments pleaſure of ſin, this is baſe: It is brutiſh for a man to ſubject his underſtanding and will to the paſſions of his luſt, diſhonourable baſe paſſions; <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 26.</note> for beaſts are led by their appetites.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As it is baſe drudgery, ſo ſecondly the poor ſinner hath ſo many luſts and ſo contrary to ſerve and ſatisfie, that he muſt needs be diſtracted between them; one commands him this way, and the other commands him that way; as now for a man
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:115245:323"/>
to ſerve his pride and covetouſneſs, or his luxury and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, theſe are contrary, and diſtract, and diſtort the mind, and hurry him hither and thither, he can enjoy no peace in his own ſpirit at all; you ſhall ſee a man that will ſpend at no aim when he is in company, and none ſeemeth to ſet leſs by the world then he at ſuch a time; but afterward, when he recollects himſelf, then he muſt run, and drudge, and hurry himſelf and all his family, and drive faſter then they are able to bear, and all to make up that which he hath conſumed upon his luſts, is not this a miſerable bondage to be under ſuch contrary luſts?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Yea conſider that theſe luſts are moſt inſatiable, in drinking up a mans time, and ſpirits, and ſtrength, and will never <note place="margin">Luk 16.</note> leave a man while he hath any thing to lay out upon them more. So you know the Prodigal ſpent all that ever he had upon his luſts, all his patrimony, his time, and ſtrength, and ſpirits, and all; and ſo the wanton doth upon his <hi>Dalilah,</hi> and thou mourn at the laſt, ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>when thy life and thy body is conſumed, and</hi>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hat they ſhall eat, and what they ſhall drink, how they ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this and that deſign, what a drudge is any man that is under the power of this luſt, he doth nothing but root in the world? in other ſervitude, if that a ſervant were maimed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, loſt an eye, yea or but a tooth, they muſt be let go <note place="margin">Exod. 21. 26.</note> for their eye-ſake, or for the tooth-ſake, but here ſin doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wound the ſoul, breaks a man, conſumeth him ſoul and body, and yet will not let him go; ſin doth put a mans eyes out, that ſo it may have the more full compleat command over the poor creature, and ſtops the ears, and ſtrikes out the teeth, and diſtaſteth the pallate, ſo that any thing of God hath no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh then a chip to a ſoul, maketh the poor creature lame for any luſt harboured in the ſoul, maketh a man go with an uneven pace,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:115245:324"/>
and halt, he cannot go uprightly, and ſo it weakens the hands and maketh feeble knees, and indeed like a woolf in the fleſh, or a greedy wen, devours all the ſtrength, and yet will by no means let the poor ſinner go free.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is a growing bondage, the longer a man continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it, the faſter he is held with the ſnares and bonds of his ſins; in the tranſgreſſion of an evil man there is a ſnare, ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 29. 6.</note> and every act of ſinning doth faſten the ſnare ſo much the more upon the ſoul with bands of iron and braſs, yea of adamant; the longer they are in this dark and filthy dungeon, the deeper they ſink into the mire and clay, where there is no ſtanding, the heart groweth more hard through the deceitfulueſs of ſin. O the cup of delights is a bewitching cup, and the more a man drinketh of it, the more he may; every drop of oyl you caſt upon the flame, maketh it the harder to be quenched, every act of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth ſtrengthen the habit, as in all other caſes, and diſpoſe a man ſo much the more ſtrongly, incline him to the ſame ſin again, and ſo there is ſo much the more ado to get the heart off from theſe luſts; there is many a poor ſinner among us, I believe, can ſpeak by experience what a miſerable bondage it is, and what a growing bondage it is, the further a man goeth in it, he goeth ſtill further into the priſon, binds the yoak upon his neck ſo much the harder and cloſer, inſomuch that a gray-headed-ſinner you ſhall ſeldom ſee recovered out of the ſnare of the Devil, though ſometimes we may: This the fourth.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, it is ſo durable a bondage, that it abides in part, even where a ſoul is brought under the command of another principle, it doth continue in a great part in many a gracious heart, as in this place of the Apoſtle, <hi>I am carnal and ſold under ſin;</hi> he ſaith <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> not he was, but he is carnal; that is to ſay, in part, as thoſe in that firſt to the <hi>Corinthians, are you not carnal?</hi> that is to ſay, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 1, 4.</note> hath not the fleſh a great ſway with you, when you are ſo divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and full of ſtrife and emulation, and one for <hi>Paul,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Apollo?</hi> &amp;c. and therefore the Apoſtle did walk heavily under the ſenſe of the chains which were upon him, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhakt off. <hi>O wretched man, who ſhall deliver me? I am</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>carried captive by a Law in my members to the Law of ſin.</hi> O ſtrange, that in the Apoſtle, ſo ſanctified, ſo mortified a creature, yet the Law in his members ſhould have ſuch a ſtrength as this
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:115245:324"/>
is, to carry him captive; though the ſpirit do luſt againſt the fleſh, yet the fleſh doth luſt againſt the ſpirit, ſo that they cannot <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> do the things they would; they are under bondage in part, though notunder the reign of ſin; yet it uſurpeth, and tyranizeth, and laies its commands upon a poor believing ſoul, as if he were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together his own; ſin will not let go its hold altogether, but if it loſe the Cittadel, the Tower, the chief Fort, the Will, yet it will lurk in ſome of the out-works ſtill; if it loſe the heart, it will hold by the heel ſtill, and hang about us, that we cannot walk at liberty in the waies of his Commandments.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The reward to the ſervice and bondage of ſin, what is it but bondage upon bondage? you have heard how many ſad <hi>Concomitants</hi> there are of this bondage of ſin, doth it not ſubject to the curſe, to the wrath of God? it is not only an unprofitable ſervice, <hi>what fruit had ye then in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> that is to ſay, what good had ye by them, ye are now aſhamed of them: that is the reward, as you ſee in the caſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> it laid him open and naked before the Lord, both without covering for the ſhame, and without defence againſt his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, now he wanted ſomewhat in ſtead of his innocency to skreen him from the everlaſting burnings, or the preſence of God, <hi>who</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19:</note> 
                        <hi>is a conſuming fire, yea the wages of theſe things is death, whoſe end is deſtruction,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>whoſe glory is in their ſhame, whoſe God is their belly, who mind earthly things;</hi> a man will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, that the ſavouring of earthly things is ſo dangerous a ſervice, being ſo pleaſing as it is to men; alas, you little think what you do, you have heard ſome of you, how many evils do attend it, you little know what wounds you get, <hi>a wound and diſhonour ſhall he get, and his reproach ſhall not be wiped away;</hi> this is nothing to the wound of the conſcience. O what pains ſinners are at to ſtore up gun-powder at laſt to blow up their comforts and their ſouls and all; would you not think it a ſad ſervitude where a maſter ſhould delight in nothing but the cruel wounding and goring of a mans ſelf, this is nothing indeed to the ſervice of ſin, you will one day find ſinners, the truth of this, whether you will believe it now or no, that ſin is big with terrours, and fears, and amazement, that ſin doth nothing but wound the ſoul, the conſcience, though you feel it not for the preſent; many and <note place="margin">Prov. 5. 11. Prov. 23. 29.</note> many that have been as ſenſleſs as many of us are, that yet at
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:115245:325"/>
laſt mourned and ſaid, O how is my fleſh and my body conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med! O what a wretch was I to ſerve ſin, to lay out my ſelf for ſin, that now hath nothing but woe and miſery, nothing but racks and woundings to reward me with! O what a reward is it Brethren, to paſs fro m the chains of your ſins here, to thoſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chains of darkneſs!</p>
                     <p>Se venthly and laſtly, it is inextricable, as to our ſelves, we cannot open the priſon doors, nor looſen our fetters, the cords of our ſins wherewith we are held, and bound over, as I may ſay, to Judgement. O I know the poor creature, ſpecially when his eyes are open to ſee what a condition he is in, will be making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an attempt, ſometimes to break priſon, ſometimes to looſe his bonds, but it will not be; O what reſolutions and vows you ſhall have many a ſinner make, ſpecially after a paſſion in their ſpirits, when their eyes are a little open; O they will never return to their folly any more, and it is the next thing they do. O the bands of our own making are too ſlender to pull a poor creature out of the mire and clay, they all break even as a thread of <hi>Tow</hi> when it cometh to the fire, and there the poor ſoul ſticks; no, nor is it the prayers nor tears of our own that can do it, for you ſhall ſee, and haply ſome of us know it by experience, though it be wonderful to ſee a man pray and ſin, and weep and ſin, mourn and ſin, go on in the ſame courſe of ſinning a long time, ſome of our ſouls I believe know this, we pray and are not willing to be delivered, as <hi>Aug.</hi> did, and ſo mourn upon the ſight of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs of a ſin, but it prevails not to for ſake it. O no, if any of all this would have done it, what need the Lord Jeſus then be annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that work, to preach deliverance to the captives, and the opening of the priſon doors to them that are bound: ſurely the Lord would do no nothing in vain: but ſo much for this Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>Then it may teach us the vanity of all conceit of liberty or <note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> freedom, or going forth before the Lord Jeſus come and ſhine upon a mans ſoul, then they ſhall go forth, not before; what is the reaſon that the moſt of men can ſatisfie themſelves with their condition as they do, but they have ſome conceit they are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; were ſinners perſwaded that they are under the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin and Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could they eat, or drink, or ſleep?
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:115245:325"/>
what a fearful thing would we think it, if the Devil had but power over our bodies, to carry them whither he pleaſed, to ſhatter and ſhake them at his pleaſure? but what is this to the having power over the ſoul, over the will, the affections, the mind, by keeping them in blindneſs? and yet ſinners do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are in ſuch a bondage, but think they are free, nor do I think there is any one thing doth keep more poor creatures in bondage then this, they think they are free; but let us ſee a little the vanity of ſuch conceits.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Some are ſo groſs, as to think they are born free, when as you heard before, <hi>We are born the children of wrath,</hi> we are <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 3.</note> all born in the houſe of bondage, in the Priſon Houſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we as well as our Parents are under bondage.

                        <hi>alſo, for they are my ſervants ſaith the Lord, whom I brought out of</hi> Egypt; which was a Type of our ſpiritual bondage: mind you, the Lord calls them his ſervants, his children, as well as others; only note here two or three things for the clearing of it.</p>

Firſt, that this is by grace and not by nature; for by nature and natural generation, no man can beget, nor woman bring forth any child that is free; no, though they themſelves through the riches of grace are made free, yet their children by nature are the children of wrath as well as others; yea, though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Election of grace, and be ſaved whether they die in infancy, or come to the acknowledgment of the truth, and believe, as the Apoſtle did; yet by nature they are the children of wrath, a ſad condition our poor children are in by nature, if parents did but well lay it to heart; but what then doth this hinder, but that by grace they may be free, though by nature they are bound? as the Apoſtle himſelf by nature was a child of wrath, under the curſe of the Law; that is to ſay, and in bondage, but by grace he was free; and why might not the Lord by grace make him free ſooner if he pleaſed, as well as later? is it not all one with him, can he not make children free as well as men if he pleaſe? are not men purely receptives in the firſt grace, and are not children as paſſive and receptive as any?</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly, there is a freedom inviſible and ſaving, and a freedom viſible, and both by grace; the freedom inviſible, when a ſoul is actually ſet at liberty from the power of ſin and the bondage of his corruptions; or elſe viſible, when there is ground for our judging they are ſo freed; now many are viſibly free, that are not inviſibly free at all: ſo there is many an hypocritical profeſſor, that carries it ſo like a free-man of Chriſt, that it would puzzle the moſt diſcernable ſpirit to diſcover that he is under the bondage of ſin or Satan, and yet he is ſo inviſibly haply, but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he is free, that is to ſay, appears to be ſo: appears to be in Covenant with God, for that is the freedom; therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt is ſpoken of, as to preach liberty, it is ſaid ſtill, <hi>he is given as a Covenant to the people;</hi> ſo many appear to be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſo viſibly are ſuch, that inviſibly are not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch holy parents, who are in Covenant with God, are viſibly free, though inviſibly they may be in bondage, that is to ſay, they are in viſibly in Covenant with God, that is to ſay, we have ground to judge charitably and hopefully of them, that they are in Covenant with God, and if they ſo die, that they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>um,</hi> to deny all viſibility of ſalvation to them: Or elſe we muſt ſay, the Lord hath left nothing upon record, whereby we might have any comfort concerning little ones that die in that condition; which what an impeachment it were to the wiſdom &amp; grace of God in Chriſt, I wiſh men would impartially conſider. And if they will ſay they may be ſaved, can it be without the inviſible grace? have they not corrupt natures, and the ſeeds of all ſin in them? and can any unclean thing enter into heaven? and therefore ſure they muſt be freed from ſin: and will we grant them the inviſible grace, that they come under that which is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, and ſhall we deny them that which is larger? would you think that man himſelf, that ſhould yield that a man may be in the Kings bed-Chamber, but he may not be in the Pallace; or a man be in this houſe, and yet not in the City, which is much more large and comprehenſive?</p>
                     <p>But thirdly, I conceive that this viſible freedom of theirs is to be limited with the time, until they come to diſcover the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as an hypocritical profeſſor, to us he is viſibly a Saint, and free, until his leaf do fade and fall, and that be taken from him which he ſeemeth to have, as it is in that of the Evangeliſt; now the child is upon his Fathers root, the Lord owning them with their parents in the ſame covenant of grace; yet if afterward, when they come to underſtanding; and by the rule of Chriſt they are to own the covenant themſelves actually; if they do diſown it, they ſhall be caſt out as well as <hi>Iſmael</hi> was, and therefore it is I ſuppoſe, that our Saviour reproveth the Jews when they ſtood now at age, and ſhould have minded what themſelves had done, now ſtanding upon their own, and not upon their Fathers root, they ſhould have owned the Covenant themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that ſo they might have been free indeed inviſibly; but though they never wrought the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to believe in Chriſt to come, and now in Chriſt come, they ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; but wrought the works of the Devil: yet they bound themſelves up with this, that they were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they were ſo indeed; and this in their infancy was ground for a believing hopefully of them, ſpecially if their Parents were Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; but now the Lord required themſelves, I ſay, to own
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:115245:327"/>
the Covenant, and walk worthy of it, elſe that would not ſtand them inſtead; it is juſt as if a man that maketh a profeſſion of Chriſt gloriouſly for a while, and in the judgement of all that behold him he is a gracious man, but yet he falls off, draweth back to perdition, <hi>the latter end of ſuch a man is worſe then his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> yet he bears up himſelf, O I am a Chriſtian, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 2.</note> Chriſt as well as you, and yet at preſent is thus ſtubborn and rebellious; do you think this would ſatisfie any mans ſpirit <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 45.</note> concerning him, is not here as much vanity of hope concerning his condition, as in the other caſe?</p>
                     <p>O but ſome will ſay, what a Doctrine is this? can a man be free in any ſenſe, and yet come into bondage again, and periſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward? are not the gifts and calling of God without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? therefore that children ſhould be free by vertue of this <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 19.</note> Covenant, and yet afterward become the ſervants of ſin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and be ſo deſperately wicked and prophane, this ſeemeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to grace, and that any that have been in Covenant of God and free, ſhould now be bound with everlaſting chains of darkneſs? It is no derogation from the truth, nor from the grace that came by Jeſus Chriſt that it ſhould be ſo; for mind you, it is one thing to be free in the account of God, and another thing to be free in the account of the Church and people of God; God judgeth not as we judge, viſibly we judge, and he judgeth that which is inviſible: now it is true, one that hath been truly inwardly delivered from the bondage of ſin, and ſo gone out of priſon, he can never be reduced to ſuch a condition, cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; and ſo that man that is, or ever was inviſibly in Covenant with God, can never come to that place of darkneſs; but ſuch as only viſibly and in appearance did own the Covenant, or were in Covenant, may miſcarry; how many glorious profeſſors that made a great ſhew for a time, and ſprang up as faſt, and flouriſhed as much as any, that yet now are the fuel for thoſe everlaſting flames? what could men judge of them, but that they were in Covenant with God, and ſo free-men and delivered from the <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 6.

we will allow profeſſors a communion and fellowſhip with us as free-men, as men in Covenant with God, whoſe profeſſion ſo oftentimes prove rotten and unſound, and think this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a ſufficient ground to declare to us they are in Covenant with Chriſt, and yet we will not allow Believers children to be in Covenant with God, becauſe afterward they come to walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Covenant: Nor do we think the declaration of God, that he doth own them as his, as his children, his ſervants, as holy to himſelf, to be as ſufficient to make it out they are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God: For my own part, I ſee not the pretended dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but if there be any advantage in the viſibility of being in Covenant with God, I take it upon this hand, for I do and ſhall make more of a word of God, where the Lord hath ſaid it, that they are his in a way of grace, though it prove to be but viſibly, not inviſibly, then I ſhall make of any mans profeſſion in the world, which can amount to no more then a viſibility, or at leaſt I ſhall make as much of it.</p>
                     <p>Well but then, ſuppoſe thou wert a child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving parents, and ſo wert free and in Covenant with God viſibly; yet alas, this will not now ſtand thee in ſtead to ſalvation, no more then a profeſſion of a temporarie faith will do an hypocrite; thou workeſt the works of the Devil, art a very drudge to Satan, and the world, and thy own hearts luſts, and yet will hang thy hopes of ſalvation upon a being born free, we are <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeed; if any ſeed of Believers ſince the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſhould have been ſaved and freed, inwardly and ſavingly, <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 44.</note> by being the ſeed of ſuch parents, when themſelves came actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to renounce it in works, to deny the Covenant in works, they might have it by <hi>Abraham;</hi> but yet you ſee our Saviour tells them, the Son muſt make them free, before they could be free; therefore this is a vain conceit, the Lord perſwade poor ſinners againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſome there are, that becauſe they feel nothing of ſuch a bondage as hath been ſpoken of, therefore they conclude there is no ſuch thing upon them, they do not feel any ſuch thing as fetters and ginns upon them, they never were under any ſuch ſlaviſhneſs of obedience, under any ſuch terrours, nor under the command of their luſts, they think they are Maſters of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and can command their paſſions and appetites as well as
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:115245:328"/>
any others, and therefore ſure they are free. This is a deceit alſo. The more undiſcerned the bondage is, the more ſure it is; it was the ſlatelineſs of ſome Princes, they would not be ſeen by their ſubjects, nor make their perſons too common, they ſhould feel the weight of their loins, but not ſee them, to keep up an eſteem among them; if they had made themſelves too common haply, and too cheap, it might have weakened their authority: So it is in this caſe, ſin and Satan will not be ſeen haply in the buſineſs, they know if it ſhould appear to a ſinner he is in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to them, it were a dangerous ſtep to dethrone him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him of his commanding power over a poor ſinner; for who, if he did ſee himſelf thralled to ſo baſe and bloody an enemy as Satan is, would endure it long? and therefore he keepeth them in darkneſs, <hi>from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to</hi>

                        <hi>God;</hi> therefore it is the firſt work of grace to open the eyes, as in the caſe of <hi>Paul, who art thou Lord?</hi> he knew not, nor did he know his perſecution was a ſin; he was ſo far from it, as that he thought verily he ought to do many things againſt that way: <note place="margin">Acts 26. 9.</note> And truly ſo it is with many a poor ſoul, they think they are as far from bondage in ſin; as he that is furtheſt, whereas they are altogether in bondage: A man in errour, if of a leſſer or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moment, he is in the ſnare of the Devil, and yet he thinks himſelf free, ſpecially before admonition; elſe fundamentals are written ſo clearly, that after the firſt and ſecond admonition, if <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 11.</note> adminiſtred with ſuch clearneſs and tenderneſs as it ought. Dear friends, I doubt there are ſome of us, that it never came into our hearts ſeriouſly to conſider, ſcarce to ſuſpect that we were in bondage; do not your hearts bear witneſs to this truth? believe it, ſuch are in the greateſt bondage of all others ordinarily. I know it is true, that even from the child-hood, under gracious education, which the Lord hath promiſed a bleſſing to, as one of his Ordinances, with it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled ſo inſenſibly, as that a man may ſcarſe ever know how it came to paſs; but yet that he is free, he may know, as the blind man ſaid; but I ſpeak of ſinners, that it is too apparent; alas, if they did, or could but ſearch, and try, and ponder their waies, that they are in the gall of bitterneſs and bonds of iniquity, and yet think highly of themſelves, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> did, that they are ſome body: O this is a grievous deceit.</p>

Thirdly, There are ſome, that becauſe they part with ſome ſin, they think they are free; it may be they were before drunkards or blaſphemers, now they are reformed, and not guilty in this kind, therefore they think they are free, they have gone forth; when alas they are held in the cords of another luſt; it may be run from one extreme to another, reel from one pit to another, and truly one chain upon the ſoul will hold it faſt enough; one foot in the ſnare holds it as well as if the whole body were reſtrained; if Satan have but one cord about us, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 16.</note> he takes us alive at his pleaſure; Becauſe that they paſs one Gate in the Priſon, they think they are preſently out, no: Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, there are iron Gates and Bars yet to be opened, there are more luſts yet to be ſhaked off, before you can look upon your ſelves as free; <hi>Sampſon</hi> muſt have his <hi>Dalilah; Herod,</hi> his <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> though he did many things.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Some think they are free, becauſe it may be they forbear the outward acts of rebellion: ſo be <hi>they can keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>

                        </gap>, they heed not what is within. Brethren, what is it the better to have the hand and the foot out of the ſnare, and the heart be intangled? a man may through fear, ſlaviſh fear of God, or elſe fear of men, fear of ſhame, or the like, forbear to act, and yet the heart love and like the ſin well enough. The Dog is not offended with his vomit, though he bring it up, he liketh it well enough, it is only ſome pain at the ſtomack which he cannot brook. So you may pluck away the iron from the Loadſtone, but it hath a lingering after it ſtill; and ſo <hi>Phaltiel</hi> when his Wife was taken <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 16.</note> from him, he parted with her indeed, becauſe he durſt not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe chuſe, for the dipleaſure of the King would wax hot againſt him; he might loſe his liberty, if not his life, if he had refuſed; but ſaith the Text, <hi>He went mourning after her,</hi> he did it with an unwilling heart. So may a man part with ſin, the practice of it, but yet his heart cleaveth to it ſtill; he may caſt it away when the coal is fired, but yet he could be content if the fire were out, to put it into his boſom again; Brethren, Is it thus with us? we dare not let down ſin haply, ſwallow it, for fear it prove bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the belly: but yet we will roul it under the tongue as a ſweet morſel; ſurely this is not to go forth, to be ſet free from this bondage, therefore do not miſtake your ſelves: it may be thou

And for ſome Motives to ſtir us up a little, at leaſt to a conſideration of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and what we do all this while.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Conſider this is the acceptable year of the Lord, as in that of <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> O it beginneth with the preaching of the Goſpel; indeed the acceptable year, minde you, acceptable to Jeſus Chriſt: It pleaſeth him wondrous well, if ſinners be willing to come out of priſon, to be ſet at liberty: there is many a poor ſoul that thinketh with himſelf, I am willing; if the Lord Jeſus be willing that I ſhall go forth: O it is the acceptable year of the Lord, there is nothing more pleaſing to him, then to ſee the ranſom he hath laid down for you ſinners take effect, and bring out many out of bondage; the Apoſtle applyeth it to the times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; <hi>There is joy in heaven, &amp;c.</hi> The Father of the Prodigal, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 2.</note> how willing was he? and then it is the acceptable year to ſinners too: O how did men that were in bondage long for the Jubilee, and breath and pant after it, eſpecially if their bondage were hard? that ſet them all free. Dear Friends, Conſider, this is the great Jubilee, proclaimed ſolemnly with the Silver Trumpets of the Goſpel, that every poor creature, that will, may go forth out of priſon; yea, that if now they go forth, the Lord Jeſus is <note place="margin">Lev. 25. 9, 10.</note>
                        <pb n="530" facs="tcp:115245:332"/>
willing we ſhould; but if we ſhall trifle away this year of the Lord, which we know not how long it may laſt to us: either the Goſpel may be taken away from us, or elſe we from the Goſpel; or elſe the things which concern our peace in the Goſpel be hid <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 42.</note> from our eyes, that we ſhall never ſee them: O that ſinners would but conſider this, <hi>theſe ſeaſons the Father hath kept in his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 1. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>own power,</hi> that ſinners might be afraid to trifle away one Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <note place="margin">When liberty was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> ſome would ſtay there, &amp;c.</note> wherein this grace is offered, for fear that it never be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more to us: If the Servant did neglect to take the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Jubilee, he muſt be in bondage, he and his, until ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jubilee, and ſo he himſelf was like to periſh in that ſervice.</p>
                     <p>There were only three things that did hinder their going free in that acceptable year: 1. Either they were ſtrangers, and of the curſed <hi>Canaanites,</hi> who were doomed to bondage; now there was <note place="margin">Lev. 25. 45, 46.</note> no going forth for them: Or elſe 2. The Matters would not let them go free: Or elſe 3. They themſelves had no minde to go free, and ſo bound themſelves for ever to their Maſters.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I ſay, The Strangers: alas, the Jubilee was not proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; and therefore, though they might he willing to go free, yet they could not, they were as good never think of it, it concerneth them not; and the Maſters knowing this would never let them go free; ſurely, this is not our caſe, though the <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 13.</note> time was, when we were ſinners of the Gentiles, and afar off, and the year of Jubilee was not proclaimed to us; yea, the Lord Jeſus forbid his diſciples, to go into the way of the Gentiles: If <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 5.</note> this were our caſe, then there were ſome excuſe for our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in bondage; and thus it is with many a poor people under the Sun this day; the Lord Chriſt hath never ſaid to them <hi>that ſit in darkneſs, go forth,</hi> elſe haply, <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zidon</hi> would have done it ſooner then <hi>Coraz</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly then, the unwillingneſs of him to whom we are in bondage, to let us go free: it is true, ſin is unwilling to let the ſinner go; alas, how ſhall luſt be ſatisfied and ſerved then? And ſo is Satan, as long as ever he can, he will hold his hold; but doth not the Lord threaten the hard hearted Jews, ſince they would <note place="margin">Jer. 34. 15, 16, 17.</note> not let his people go out of bondage, that he would proclaim a Liberty to them, to the ſword, and to the famine, and to the peſtilence? <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was very loth to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go as long as he
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:115245:332"/>
had a being, therefore he was deſtroyed: And ſo ſin and Satan, they will not let the ſinner go; O how a mans luſts do cling about him then, when he ſhould go free! what, will ye forſake me now, have I not brought you in ſo much content, ſo many ſweet hours you have had of repoſe in my lap, ſo much gain and advantage, have you not lived by me, and will you now leave me? theſe will ſtratle the ſoul; and then for Satan, either he multiplyeth his baits, maketh the beſt of every thing in the way of ſin that now beginneth to be laid open, to find colours and gloſſes to put upon them, or elſe he rageth and tells the ſoul, thou go free! doſt thou think that now thou haſt ſerved ſin ſo long, Jeſus Chriſt will accept of thee? and indeed, all that his wit or power can do, he beſtirreth himſelf, now he ſeeth his kingdom go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, and his yoak breaking; I, but remember this, that the Lord will break him to pieces, tread him under-feet if he refuſe to let you go, the Lord will pluck you out of his hands, deſtroy his power.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Our own unwillingneſs, for if the ſervant ſaid, he loved his Maſter, and his Maſters ſervice, and he would not go free, then the Jubilee ſerved him in no ſtead, he muſt have his ear <note place="margin">Exod. 21. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </note> bored to the door-poſt by the Magiſtrate, and ſo be his ſervant for ever; either this might be as a puniſhment of his contempt of liberty, now he might have liberty, which is rather to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, as the Apoſtle ſaith: and the Lord out of a tender reſpect to them, as his people, that he hath bought out of bondage, would not have them kept in bondage by their Brethren; Now if he would not go free, but loved his Maſter ſo well; that he preferred his ſervice before freedom, he ſhould have this torment and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſhame, to be bored through the ear: And I tell you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it will not be the piercing of the ear that ſhall be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of your refuſing of this liberty, but the piercing of your hearts, as with a ſword, when you come to ſee what your bondage will bring you unto; or elſe ſecondly, That now they muſt never go out of their Maſters doors without his leave, the ſervitude muſt be ſtricter then ever it was; and ſo truly I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Brethren, that now, where the acceptable year of the Lord is preached to ſinners, they have liberty offered, and they will not accept of it; that now they are more fully under the command of Sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n and ſin, then they were before. Thirdly, that
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:115245:333"/>
hereby might be ſignified the willingneſs of their ſervice for the time to come, that they had, as I may ſay, their ears opened now to what ever their Maſter ſhould command them; and ſo in that <hi>Pſalm; Sacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not; but mine ear haſt thou bored or digged,</hi> ſo the words may be read, that is to <note place="margin">Pſal. 40 6.</note> ſay, thou haſt made me willingly obedient to thee to the death, &amp; that obedience is better then ſacrifice; and truly this is the ſaddeſt of all the reſt, when men ſhall give up themſelves with a fuller will to ſerve Sin and Satan then ever they did before, in ſtea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of going forth; O let us fear and tremble before the Lord, leſt while liberty is proclaimed, we in ſtead of going forth, be bored in the ear, and become Satans ſervants for ever, never go forth from our bondage.</p>
                     <p>Again, Conſider yet further, that the day if liberty is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed; it is the day of the vengeance of our God alſo, as the Prophet hath it; as if he had ſaid, if it be not a day of liberty, and of going forth to you, it will be a day of vengeance to <note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 11.</note> you as well as to the enemies of Chriſt; for what deſperate love is this, to ſin againſt Chriſt? that when he hath been at ſo much pains and coſt to purchaſe a liberty for us, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and reject it, will not part with our chains, will rather rot in priſon then come forth, what can be expected but wrath to the utmoſt to come upon ſuch a ſoul?

                     <p>Laſtly, Conſider how ſweet and precious Liberty is, even ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel libetty, how ſweet a thing it is; elſe men would never expend ſo much treaſure and blood as we have done for it: Ah, this is nothing to a freedom from ſin, and from other bondages which ariſe upon ſin unto the ſoul: Ask but any poor creature that is newly come out of the dungeon, out of the horrible pit, where there was no ſtanding; will they not tell you that liberty is <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 2.</note> ſweet? it is not to be expreſſed: If <hi>Paul</hi> had not been free, he had had many a laſh by thoſe cruel tyrants.

                     </p>
                     <p>There are three things here conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That there muſt be a through acquaintance with the bondage that we are under, and the better condition of ſervice; how much the ſervice of Chriſt is to be preferred before that of Satan; for the truth is, while a man knoweth no better, he will be content to ſerve the worſe; there is never a ſinner under the dominion of ſin, but thinketh he is the freeſt man; and the people of God that are bound up in their Spirits to ſuch a ſtrict way of
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:115245:334"/>
walking with God, he thinketh they are the men in bondage; but alas, it is becauſe he underſtandeth not his own condition: nor is it a ſlight hint of ſuch a thing that will uſually prevail to a freedom from all ſin, therefore you muſt labour to ſtudy what this bondage is, ſee what thou art expoſed to by reaſon of it, and ſee what a prfect freedom the ſervice of Chriſt is. O what great <note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> reward there is in the very keeping of his Commandments; joy is ſuch an inſeparable attendant upon obedience, that ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it followeth every good action, as the very heathens themſelves acknowledged; much more then, when the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Maſter, and his ſervice the work.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Thou muſt be acquainted with the commands of Chriſt; his precepts are pure, and they have an influence upon the heart that believeth them, to bring him out of that bondage, to ſet him free: I do believe nothing more keepeth many a ſoul in bondage; he knoweth not what the will of Chriſt is in ſuch or ſuch a particular, elſe he would do it. Be acquainted with Chriſt the ſumme of the Goſpel, you ſhall know the truth; that is to ſay, what he hath done to ſet poor creatures free became a ſervant obedient to the death, was in bondage, in priſon, in the horrible pit, how he was put to it to overcome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly and principally, thou muſt be acquainted with the promiſes of the Goſpel that are made to this end; it is their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to help forward our freedom; this part of the truth well known, ſo known as to be cloſed with, will make every poor creature free, <hi>ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free;</hi> and ſo this in the text, <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe</hi>

Either we know not theſe things, or elſe we make not uſe of them, we act not faith upon them; the Lord doth love to have his people uſe the importunity of faith, for nothing is ſo importunate as faith, nor offers, as I may ſay, ſuch violence to heaven as that doth. O Brethren, the Lord help our unbelief, and forgive our neglect of our faith in this point; if thou canſt
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:115245:334"/>
act it but weakly, yet put forth ſome act of faith, hang upon theſe promiſes, tell the Lord he hath cauſed thee to hope upon this his Word, elſe thou couldeſt not hope, and thou doſt hope in this Word, elſe thy heart would altogether ſink within thee; and will he now make thee aſhamed of his hope, hath his promiſe ever failed a poor creature, and will it now fail thee?</p>
                     <p>But beſide this, doſt thou find thy heart moved, made willing indeed to part with ſin? Art thou in good earneſt in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? O yes, ſaith the poor ſoul, I would rather then my life be ſet at liberty, for what good will my life do me, if I muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſerve ſin, and grieve ſuch bowels of love towards me in Jeſus Chriſt? have you ſearched, do you know your hearts in this point? it may be thou haſt not that heed of truſting thy heart further then thou ſeeſt it, it will deceive thee then; but if thou haſt ſearched it; and beg'd of God to ſearch it, and thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doſt not find but he hath through infinite riches of grace made thee willing to come out if thou couldſt tell how: I tell you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if this be ſo, the chains are fallen off from your hands, and the bolts from your legs, your freedom is in a great part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, only thou canſt not find the way out of the priſon.

                     <p>O beg the Spirit, for he is the cauſe of liberty, it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as light upon the Sun, and the Spring upon the Fountain; he applyeth what Chriſt hath done for us, knowing the deep things of God, he revealeth them, he only convinceth and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers objections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Why am I not ſet above theſe wretched carnal delights as well as others of his people? as if, God ſhould do any thing for us out of reſpect to us, we had deſerved any thing at his hands; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we may rather expoſtulate with our ſelves, O why is it not worſe with me then it is? why am I in no ſorer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bondage then I

So on the other hand, it ſtops our mouths for returning unto the Lord for what he hath done for us; we may many of us thank our ſelves for much of the bondage that is upon us, that we ſo much complain of. O if every time the Lord ſetteth our frozen ſpirits a melting, every time he ſetteth our ſtraightned hearts at large, we inſtead of lifting up our ſelves, we could and did but admire that grace, magnifie him, loath our ſelves, would he not much more delight to enlarge us? O therefore look to this.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Thèn look to it thàt ye ſtand faſt in that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free; I ſpeak not ſo much here <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> to the yoak of Ceremonies which the Lord hath taken away al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, but I ſpeak ſpecially to our freedom from the dominion of our ſins, the freedom from the Law as a Covenant of life, and from outward preſſures and bondages; you know our fears were great when we ſaw this cloud of blood but hanging over our heads, and many of thè precious ones of God, I know, when I was little and ſcarce able to take notice of ſuch things, yet I have been an eye and ear-witneſs of the ſad complaints made before the Lord of it.

I doubt this is a great cauſe of much ſorrow and heavy walking before the Lord of many a poor creature: O he cannot do this, and he cannot do that, and therefore he doubts all is not well with him, whether he have any thing to do with Chriſt? It is true, if he had made our doing, our perfect obedience the condition of his Covenant, it had been ſomewhat, but he hath not, but faith in him; take from him for all ends and purpoſes, not only for pardon, but for ſtrength, for food, for victory over our ſin. Now we go off this, and therefore we move ſo heavily and cannot ſtir, but are like a door off its hinges, a Chariot off its wheels, bring much bondage and trouble upon our ſelves, and much of our time and pains is ſpent in poring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, and getting healing again for this, which might be ſpent in glorifying him. <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 12.</note>

Brethren, I pray you let us look well about us every one; it is true, the day of the Lord, it hath burned like an oven among us, and many have been as ſtubble fully dryed put into it; the bryers and brambles that did ſcratch and tear the people of God, they are conſumed, <hi>God hath gone through them and conſumed</hi>

The Apoſtles ſcope in that place leadeth us to one part <note place="margin">Gal 5. 13.</note> of the ſenſe of this abuſing of our liberty, and that is to think they are ſo free now, that they need not have their necks under the yoak of men at all, for that goeth before, exhorting them to <hi>ſubmit themſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake;</hi> to be ſubject to the higher powers and ſubordinate powers, is very conſiſtent with this ſpiritual freedom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was there ever any ſo free as our Saviour, who is the Son that maketh us free? and yet <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 51.</note> did not he ſubmit? ſubmit to his parents, was ſubject to them, and ſubject to the powers under which he lived, becauſe his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was not of this world; and would it ſuite with the head, and will it not ſuite with the members? But I hope I need not ſpeak much to this. But there is much more wherein we may abuſe our liberty as children, by a carrying it frowardly and rebelliouſly againſt their parents, upon pretence of liberty: and ſervants that are under the yoak, it may be think they may do much in this caſe, more then they have warrant to do, becauſe they are free, it may be, and their Maſters haply in bondage under ſin, therefore ſhall they deſpiſe them? No, but count them worthy of all <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1.</note> honour, ſerving them in ſingleneſs of heart, as unto Chriſt; not for by-reſpects and ends, for fear of their diſpleaſure, but for Chriſts ſake to do it: this is freedom indeed.</p>
                     <p>But to ſpeak a little more generally, many men think when once they have gotten their necks out of the yoak, from under that bondage, and thoſe fears that they have been under, they think now they are at liberty, they are paſt all the worſt, when
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:115245:337"/>
they have gotten a little peace, and therefore though before they walked mournfully before God, and were diligent in following hard after him, now they ſlack their pace, grow remiſs, they have their conſolations, the loaves they would have, and now they may take their eaſe. O this is a horrible abuſe of this liberty, for therefore the Lord ſpeaks peace, that we might not return to folly; <note place="margin">Pſal. 85. 8.</note> and we quite croſs, becauſe he hath ſpoken peace to us, therefore give up our ſelves to folly; is not this to walk contrary to him? and will he not walk contrary to you? is not this to make our liberty a cloak, an occaſion to the fleſh, a handle for the fleſh to <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 13.</note> take hold of, and ſo to bring you into bondage again, and ſo make more work for Chriſt to ſet you at liberty again? Brethren, can we make our liberty a cloak to the fleſh, and do you think the Lord will not pluck that cloak over our ears, and ſhew us our nakedneſs again, and make us know how we come by it again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have it? and therefore take heed of this, I beſeech you, leſt your liberty degenerate into licentiouſneſs; <hi>Maxima libertate minima licentia,</hi> ſaid that Antient.</p>
                     <p>But yet more particularly, take heed of abuſing of your liberty in the uſe of things lawful in themſelves and indifferent; it is a ſign of a heart that hath little fear of offending God, that dare walk juſt at the very brink, upon the very line of deſtruction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſin and lawful liberty, if it can be aſſigned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You find the Apoſtle of another Spirit, rather then offend his weak Brother, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 13.</note> he would never eat meat while he lived: why how would he live? rather upon herbs, and fruits, and ſuch things, then to eat fleſh as long as he lived too. I tell you Brethren, in our daies, though there is much diſcourſe of liberty, there is little true uſe of it, when a man will offend all the people of God, and his Brethren, rather then he will part with an excrement; and a woman rather then ſorbear her ſpotting, and painting, and bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam nakedneſs. If the things be lawful in themſelves, which I think they are not; or a man will rather grieve all the people of God then croſs his humor, this is ſad.</p>
                     <p>Again, Brethren, one man may have a greater liberty then another in this caſe, and another greater then he in another caſe; as for inſtance now, <hi>Abraham</hi> might look upon <hi>Sodom</hi> when it was flaming, but <hi>Lot</hi> might not, becauſe there he had his deſirable things, leſt it ſhould draw back his heart from the journey now

                     <p>In a word, look to it Brethren, <hi>that we ſerve one another in love,</hi> this is oppoſed to uſing our liberty as a Cloak to the fleſh, to bear one anothers burdens; Brethren, we are not at liberty one from another, we may not ſay with <hi>Cain, Am I my Brothers</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>keeper?</hi> we ought not to deſpiſe the infirmities of the weak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee not as we ſee, and therefore are grieved and offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at many things that we make nothing of; here we ought to bear their infirmities, to cover them, to labour to inform them, <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 1.</note> and forbear them, not deſpiſe them; become all things to them that we may lawfully, as the Apoſtle became all things, but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 19, 22.</note> to gain them; this is ſerving one another in love, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love either to God or men is a free ſervice indeed; we are rather ready to ſerve our ſelves one of another, for ought I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, generally it is ſo, then ſerve one another in love. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I doubt there is little love for Chriſt ſake, though there may be ſome for our own, and then all the liberty we talk of, it is but bondage; the Law of love is a Law of liberty indeed, but enough of this.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Then look to it, <hi>that we being free from ſin, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſervants of righteouſneſs;</hi> that is to ſay, that you give <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 22.</note> up your ſelves, yield your ſelves unto God, unto Chriſt, as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the holy Spirit to play upon, as inſtruments, tools, weapons of righteouſneſs for the Lord to make uſe of, even as he pleaſeth, this is the end of all that liberty held out in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, <hi>that we being delivered from the hands of all our enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

this? ſpend our ſelves now in his ſervice. O if men would but conſider, how much of their ſtrength and ſpirits ſin hath had, while we were under that bondage: Me thinks it ſhould put us on ſo much the more earneſtly, ſpecially conſidering how our ſervice addeth nothing to him, it is for our own good, as you heard before, and it is all he expecteth for delivering of us. What poor Gally-ſlave would not moſt willingly yield to a Noble-man to be his ſervant, where his ſervice is honourable, and pleaſant, and delightful, ſo be he would redeem him? why this is the very caſe.</p>
                     <p>Beſide, if we conſider the fruit here, and the reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; the Apoſtle puts both together, and I will not put them aſunder, <hi>the firſt-fruits, and the harveſt, they have their fruit unto holineſs;</hi> the more we ſerve the Lord Chriſt, the more eaſie, pleaſant and delightful will his ſervice be, the more our ſouls will ſhine with the beauty of holineſs; as the bondage groweth by continuance, ſo doth the freedom by this ſervice. I dare ſay, the more acquaintance any poor heart hath with a diligent, cloſe, humble, upright walking with God, the more pleaſant the waies of God are to him; yea, and the more holy that man groweth, it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe he hath more communion with the Fountain of holineſs, even God in Jeſus Chriſt, and the Spirit alſo: would you be holy, Brethren? would you be more and more freed from the remainders of bondage which are upon you? Believe it, the only way is to lay out your ſelves more in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt; the Spirit of Chriſt will delight to be where he is entertained; where his motions are received, every hint is taken, and followed, and improved, and the more that ſpirit then dwells in the heart, which is his contrary principle luſting againſt the fleſh, the more the fleſh muſt needs go down in a ſoul. But the end is that will make up all. O the reward will be according to our works; when a man is rich towards God, hath been faithful in a little, faithful in a great deal, hath laid up a good foundation againſt the time to come, O how ſhall ſuch ſhine in glory! Me thinks our eyes ſhould be a little forward, the eye of faith, as well as altogether backward to Chriſt, and what he hath done for us, to what he hath prepared for us, and therefore he himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelf as a pattern to us in this very reſpect, looking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus <hi>the Author and Finiſher of our faith, having laid aſide</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note>
                        <pb n="544" facs="tcp:115245:339"/>
                        <hi>every weight,</hi> being ſet free from this bondage, then run, looking to Jeſus the Author of our Faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſed the ſhame; endured the clouding of his Fathers face from him, that was the weight that made him hang the head; it is the propoſing of the end that ſweetens the means, health that is aimed at, how it ſugars many a bitter potion, a man will endure any thing in ſuch a caſe: Well, though we may have much ado with our froward and backſliding hearts, and be many times wearied with them; yet give not over, but run, &amp; work, and ſo work, as men ſet at liberty, not in chains, chearfully and ſtrongly upon all the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and this will be a right uſe of our liberty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Then be not brought under bondage unto men, that is to ſay, to have our conſciences inſlaved, either through the fear of men, or favour of men; ſurely, if the Spirit of Chriſt be in us, as it is, if we be his, it will free and make us go forth from this bondage: You have ſeen it in all experiences, when they threatned the Apoſtles, commanded them they ſhould not <note place="margin">Acts 4 19.</note> preach in that name; the Spirit that was in them did break all thoſe bonds, though it taught them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

See the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, how it did triumph over their adverſaries, they overcame their cruelty by the invincible patience, and yielding their bodies to a torment, rather then their conſciences to the cruel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of ſinners, which tend to their wounding. Was there ever ſuch a ſlave as <hi>Canaan</hi> a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be; when another man, a great perſon, is a ſervant to ſin, and thou <note place="margin">Gen 9. 25.</note> for advantage or fear art a ſlave to him; is not this to be a ſervant of ſervants? to have this curſe upon thy ſoul in the higheſt degree, to be a ſlave to a ſlave, is the deepeſt ſlavery that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Therefore take heed leſt ſuch a bondage creep upon us at unawares, for our hearts are deceitful; take heed of ſinful compliances with the prevailing evils of the times for advantage,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:115245:339"/>
this is to be a ſlave to men and to humours, and not to be free-men to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But if you would ſtand faſt in this liberty in all theſe reſpects, then truly we muſt ſee to it, that we do not grieve the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt; for this is the principle of our liberty, <hi>where the Spirit of Chriſt is, there is liberty;</hi> and according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his preſence with, and working in any heart, is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedom of that ſoul; he firſt works liberty, knocks off the bolts of the ſoul, pulls out of the horrible pit, he only anſwers our doubts, ſatisfieth the ſoul that is in bondage, by witneſſing love to the ſoul, by applying the blood of Jeſus Chriſt to the ſoul, this the Spirit doth, and he only eſtabliſheth the ſoul in this liberty, <hi>eſtabliſh me with thy free Spirit;</hi> indeed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe may looſen a man, as to the outward practiſe from ſin, but the Spirit only can looſen the heart from ſin, and only can diſſolve the ſodering of corrupt affections, whereby our hearts and their ſinful objects are ſodered and glued together, and then the heart is broken from ſin, as well as for ſin, nor can any thing elſe keep up the ſoul in the enjoyment of that liberty by this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and therefore if we would keep up and maintain our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual liberty, we muſt be ſure to keep in with the Spirit; if we grieve him, he will grieve us, and leave us to fight with our own ſtrength, and fall under ſin, and ſo come to bondage again in part, to the grief and wounding of our ſpirits; ſome of us alas it may be, thought once we had been free, but have been brought into bondage again, and held under the power of ſin, in terrours: we are ready to wonder when the luſts we thought had been dead and buried, do riſe up again, captive us to them; but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not at it, for how often is this holy Spirit grieved by us, which is the principle of our liberty? if we conſider this well, it will put an end to our admiration; if we would keep our liberty, not return to bondage, grieve not the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he is grieved when he is neglected and ſlighted, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to put us on to ſuch a duty, we ſhift and ſhuffle, and make one excuſe or another, and will not do it; either to ſet upon a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we never performed, or to do it in another manner then we have done at another time, this grieveth him; as for inſtance, he puts us on to reprove our Brother for a ſin, not to ſuffer ſin to lie upon him, and we ſmother it, we think it more offendeth
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:115245:340"/>
another then us, or elſe it is an unthankful office, it is the way to loſe a friend, to be accounted a buſie-body, we ſee that men for the moſt part cannot bear a reproof, but they will ſnarl at leaſt, if they do not turn and rent us, and bear us upon their backs. And therefore we neglect our duty, and ſo for any other; now alas, how often are we guilty in this kind?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Take heed of all impurity, uncleanneſs, for he is a pure holy Spirit and will lie clean, he cannot endure a naſty place; this will grieve him, if it be pollution of the fleſh, or pollution of the ſpirit, if harboured in the heart it will grieve the Spirit; and then as a man grieved, he departeth, that is his grieving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; properly he is not grieved, God is not ſubject to any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or fears, or ſorrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe all things are alway preſent with him, he ſeeth what we would be, before he had to do with us at all, but then, when we do actually thus pollute our ſelves, he takes occaſion to depart, to leave us to thoſe evils, and to fill us with our own back-ſlidings.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Take heed of ſinning againſt conviction, againſt light, this is dangerous indeed, you may come to be ſhut up in darkneſs for this, to be bound in affliction and iron, to endure ſad things upon your ſpirits; for if the Spirit of Chriſt who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth you this or that is a ſin, be ſo far ſlighted as you heed it not, what if he then forbear? and is it not righteous he ſhould forbear to ſhine upon your graces, that you ſhould ſee any thing that is ought in you? So that you ſhall walk in darkneſs and ſee no light: will not this be a paying of you home in your own coyn? <hi>David</hi> could not be ignorant what his ſin was before he committed it, and yet you ſee, he ventured upon it, and what it coſt him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Take heed of deliberate ſinning, when a man hath time of conſideration of his ſin, to argue the caſe <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> as we uſe to ſay, and doth revolve with himſelf, O this is ſinful, if I do it I rebell againſt God, I do what in me lies to undo my ſelf; O but ſaith luſt, man it ſhall be ſatisfied; God is merciful, there is time enough to repent, or it will eaſily be healed afterward. Now upon ſuch deliberations as this, if a man will ſin, there is much of the will in it, and ſo much the more wicked, and therefore now the ſpirit muſt needs be grieved; what can ſuch a poor creature expect but to be brought under bondage? as you ſee it in <hi>David,</hi>
                        <pb n="547" facs="tcp:115245:340"/>
his plotting and contriving the death of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> theſe ſins in cold blood, when a man is not under the ſudden violent heat of a temptation, and yet will ſin, O this grieves him much; if a pot be on the fire and the ſcum riſe, we throw it out, we expect it would riſe; but if no fire be under, and yet a ſcum ariſe, O this is ſo loathſom, it is not to be endured.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Take heed of Ranker and Malice, of grudgings of heart one againſt another, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>grudge not one againſt another;</hi> prejudices, heart-burnings, grudgings upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, real, or conceived and imagined: O this grieveth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who is a Spirit of pure love, and will have them that look to enjoy him, to be a people of love, to cover much, bear and forbear, and forgive in love, for love will cover a multitude of offences.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Take heed then of pride, of being lifted up, for the Spirit of Chriſt is a Spirit of humility: O he loveth to dwell in the lowly ſpirit: if we be lifted up we rob him of his honour, to arrogate that to our ſelves which he hath been working for us, to think we are ſomething of our own, of our ſelves: he will let us know, to our ſorrow, that we have nothing in our hearts but darkneſs, and bondage, and ſin, and that all was from him.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Take heed of unthankfulneſs for what he hath done for us: when the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus ſhall be at all this pains with us, conteſt with the quarrellings and diſputings of our own hearts, againſt our own peace and comfort, and anſwer all our objections, and ſtill our complaints, and ſeal up love upon our hearts, remove our trembling and fears, diſpell our darkneſs, cleanſe our loathſom hearts in a great meaſure of thoſe luſts that did ſo much prevail againſt us, and we ſhall forget this now, and not return to him the praiſe, but either to grow into carnal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and when we have reſt from that which galled us, with the nine leapers, go our waies, never mind whence we received it, or elſe ſo much pore upon the remainder of our ſins, as not to exalt that grace whereby we are in ſo great a part delivered? O this grieveth him, and therefore he may juſtly let us ſtep back again, or let looſe upon us again thoſe luſts, that we were delivered from their ſtrength, and never prized the mercy; that we learn to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that grace; much more might be added, but this ſhall ſuffice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="548" facs="tcp:115245:341"/>
The next uſe of the point ſhall be for ſatisfaction to ſome doubts, ſince we are delivered and ſet free from the Law, as you have heard from that; It may be thought, Firſt, that the Law was an evil, that it is ſuch a priviledge of the Saints to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it. Secondly, It may be doubted how far we are ſet free from it, and therefore I will ſpeak a little to each of them; for the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Apoſtle meeteth with it, or rather prevents it, for ſeeing that carnal reaſon would be ſo ingenuous as to find out that cavil among others, againſt the Doctrine of faith, and of freedom from the bondage under the Law, as the ſtrength of ſin ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>What ſhall I ſay then,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is the Law ſin? that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom 7. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>we are ſaid to be delivered from it, and that ſin hath its ſtrength from it?</hi> and ſo deliverance from ſin is a deliverance from the Law, as the ſtrength of it. Or, is the Law death, ſince ſin by this means doth work death? <hi>No,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the Law is holy, juſt and good, the Law giveth no occaſion to ſin;</hi> but ſin takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſin will not endure to be contradicted, it ſucks poyſon out of that holy and good Law of God; meeting with oppoſition, it ſwells and rageth, ſo that indeed it is ſin that is the evil, the Law is holy and good. O but the Law it works wrath, and works death, and can this then be good? and how can it be ſuch a mercy to be delivered from it? is it a favour to be put into gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en fetters? ſuppoſing the Law to be good and holy, yet ſince it is, as we may ſay, ginns, and fetters, and bolts, though of gold, to hold the poor ſoul in, to keep him in and up as in a priſon, is this ſo good then? To this I anſwer, It is true, by the Law is the knowlege of ſin, <hi>I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid thou ſhalt not covet;</hi> whether in the laſt command, or in each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, now I will not diſpute; but the firſt motions, thoughts, riſings and bubblings of corruption, I had not known them to be ſin, but that the Law hath ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt not covet: Why, but was that then that was good made death to me?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: You muſt know the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of a death, which is the receiving, as I may ſay, the ſentence of condemnation in his own ſpirit by conviction, for this is all his knowledge of ſin, that ſin by the commandment might appear to be exceeding ſinful; this is the dying there mentioned, <hi>ſin revived and I dyed;</hi> which is in order to liberty, to make the poor creature ſee his neceſſity of
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:115245:341"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo he might make out after him, to make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don welcome, therefore he caſts poor ſinners into fet ters under this Law: So that if you look upon it in this ſubſerviency to the Goſpel, though the creature may be put to much grief by it, yet it is good; when pardon is proclaimed, that a Prince ſhould caſt thoſe rebells into priſon, to make them willing of a pardon; the Goſpel is a ſavour of death to death you know, and yet it is a ſweet ſavour in them that periſh, and them that are ſaved; the Goſpel is never the worſe for that: and if the Law prove fetters to a poor ſinner; to keep him under bondage for ever, and bind him over to everlaſting Judgement, this is through his own wickedneſs, that he will not accept of deliverance in the Goſpel where it is preached: the Law is never the leſs good and holy.</p>
                     <p>But the ſecond is the main thing, how far we are ſaid to be freed from the Law of God, and how we are not freed from it?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, we are delivered from it as a Covenant of righteouſneſs, <hi>do this and live;</hi> that is to ſay, be thou exactly conformable to this Law for ever; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, want of ſuitableneſs to this Law is a ſin, and every ſin, the wages of it is death; if thou break it but in one, thou art guilty of all. Alas, Brethren, the Law was weak through our fleſh, and could not juſtifie, it could diſcover ſin, as a glaſs, but not purge it; it could work wrath, work it out, but it could not pacifie, therefore the Lord Jeſus came and took upon him that name, <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> and he is now, ſaith <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4. Gal. 3. 25.</note> the Apoſtle, <hi>the end of the Law for righteouſneſs:</hi> It was a School-maſter to whip us, to fright us, out of our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt; therefore every ſoul in Chriſt now is delivered from the Law as a Covenant of life, that is clear; but this was mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Now from the rigorous exacting of obedience; for according to the Law, nothing is obedience, except perfect; if a man miſcarry in one thing he is guilty of all, there muſt be a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every thing written, yea in the fulleſt, moſt ſpiritual ſenſe of it; yea a continuance in every thing to the end, or elſe it is not obedience; but now the Lord accepteth of the deſires of the upright heart, he heareth the prayer of ſuch as deſire to fear his name: the will now goeth for the deed, where the poor ſoul
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:115245:342"/>
ſtriveth to do and is not able; Dear friends, how ſad a condition were we in many times if the Lord did ſo rigorouſly exact our obedience? how often do we come to pray, and can ſay nothing in his preſence, can ſcarce ſigh or groan? and in hearing and ſpeaking his Word, though we do ſtir up our ſelves to watch: O how often do vain thoughts run away with our hearts? now if we were under this exacting of the Law, what would become of us? what had become of <hi>Paul</hi> when he did the things he hated, the things he would not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if he had been under the rigour of the Law? If there be firſt a willing mind, that <hi>imprimis</hi> Brethren, doth legitimate all the following <hi>Items,</hi> though never ſo weak; now the Law is in the hand of Chriſt, as a Father who pittieth and ſpareth us; alas, what had become of the beſt of us elſe long <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 17.</note> ſince? thus we are delivered.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, From the curſe of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 18. our Saviour being made a curſe for us, ſo that the curſe of it doth not lie upon us to ſink us, that is to ſay, the weight of the wrath or diſpleaſure of God; Nor yet as a compulſion to obedience to this Law; as ſlaves and very wretched ſinners may do much for the fear and dread of this curſe of God, but this the Lord delivered his people from, he maketh them a willing people, he now ſheweth them greater reaſon againſt ſin then ever they ſaw, now opens to them the grave, they ſee the rottenneſs of it, which they ſaw not before, now he opens his treaſures of rich grace in Chriſt, and ſo by mediation of the underſtanding works upon the will, ſweetly inclining it to God, though there be a moral ſwaſion by appoſition of object, as a Lamb is led by a green buſh up and down; yet this is not all, there goeth more to the taking away the ſtone in the heart, and giving a heart of fleſh, which doth moſt what lie in the making the will flexible and plyable, not ſo much in ſorrow, and tears, and meltings, which doth many times accompany it, and ſometimes not at all, or very little: <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was hardened, for he obeyed not, he was ſtiff and ſtubborn, and therefore ſaid to be a ſtone: Now I ſay, a moral ſwaſion will not reach to this, a man may uſe much oratory to a ſtone, and yet it remaineth a ſtone ſtill; a Preacher may hold forth ſin to be ſin, and exceeding ſinful, and hold forth Chriſt crucified by them and for them before their eyes, and yet alas, all will not do, they remain ſtones ſtill: No, no, an enclining of the heart; he
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:115245:342"/>
turns the hearts of men whitherſoever he will, as he did the heart of <hi>Eſau</hi> to <hi>Jacob</hi> upon his prayer, there was more then a ſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <note place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> and as he did the thief upon the Croſs in the midſt of his torments and agonies of death, then to think upon a Chriſt, then to have his heart towards him, that never regarded him in his life-time, and in the midſt of a people reviling him, as you know, and upon the Croſs ſuffering and dying, and yet then to be wrought upon, argues a wonderful divine power put forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the will. Well then, when the will is overcome, we are made free to the ſervice of Jeſus Chriſt; now we can delight in the <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 32.</note> Law of God after the inward man; it was a wearineſs to a ſinner to hear the Word, ſpecially if it came near to him, he could not endure to be grated upon; and a wearineſs to pray; now he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in theſe things: So far we are delivered from the curſe, as the great inforcement of Obedience.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, From the provoking power of the Law, as you have often heard; now that Law that was the occaſion of the rebelling of luſt, is hid in the heart, that we might not ſin againſt <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 22.</note> him; this is a great change indeed in a child of God from the former condition, when before, God would put his yoak upon our ſouls, we writhed and pluckt away our neck, would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it; now it pleaſeth us to be under it, it is ſweet and eaſie to us now, it is a provocation to obedience, that before was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation unto ſin.</p>
                     <p>But now on the other hand, we are not ſet free from the Law, as a Law, a rule of holy walking, of new obedience; our Saviour did not by fulfilling the Law deſtroy it, but accompliſh it; becauſe we were not able of our ſelves to do it, he under went the rigour of it, and took away all the condemnation of it, that it might be an eaſie yoak to us; and wherefore have we a Law written in our hearts, which is but a counterpane, as I may ſay, a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do the revealed will of God, except we have this revealed will of his to be a rule to walk by? hath the Lord Jeſus then <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17.</note> lightned the yoak, ſweetened it, given us his example, chalked out our way thereby as a pattern to us, and given us ſtrength alſo to do it, and ſhall we refuſe this holy Law, as a rule to walk by? it is true, it is not now in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a School-maſter, to laſh, to terrifie, to bring us to Chriſt, when once we are in him; but now it is a rule in the hand of Chriſt, in the
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:115245:343"/>
hand of a tutor, that with all gentleneſs doth lead us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into all truth; that is to ſay, not the knowledge, but the practiſe, that is, to be led into the truth: man may know much, and yet be far from being led into it, know nothing as he ought to know; now it is a rule in the hand of a Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a Lyon terribly roaring upon us, hell, and wrath, and ruine, and ſo it is ſtill to every unbelieving creature, who are under it, as to the ſatisfaction of divine Juſtice by ſuffering, that is to ſay, under the curſe, though as a Covenant of life none is under it ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> for I conceive it was not given for that end; but under it, as to ſatisfaction of divine juſtice they are: now I ſay it is terrible to ſuch, but when the Lyon is killed by our <hi>Sampſon,</hi> there is ſweetneſs in it, <hi>out of the eater came meat:</hi> the very Law of God that is terrible, condemning, affrighting a poor guilty ſinner; it is the delight of a <hi>David:</hi> indeed not a page of the Book of God, but is, as I may ſay, a hand-writing againſt every wicked wretch, wherein he may read his doom; and not a page wherein there is not ſomething that miniſters conſolation to a Believer: for to ſee the terrours of the Law, which is a wounding, death, overwhelming a ſinner; is a raiſing of his Spirit to conſider what he is delivered from; well then, <hi>now it is a Law of liberty, Jam. 1. 25. his commands are not grievous, 1 John</hi> 5. 3. but yet we are under thoſe commands ſtill. So the Apoſtle was not without the Law, but under the Law to Chriſt; <hi>we make it not void by faith, but eſtabliſh it:</hi> But thus much ſhall <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 31.</note> ſerve to be ſpoken to this.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Uſe ſhall be a word of comfort to poor creatures that are yet under this bondage. Something of encouragement I may give to ſinners that yet are rebelling againſt the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, though if you continue ſo doing, there is no hope for you; yet know this, that the Lord Jeſus hath laid down a ranſom ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all, and publiſheth this liberty to all; he ſetteth open the priſon doors, and if then you will not go free, thank your ſelves: but of this before. I doubt ſuch ſinners as theſe will be ſnatching at the comfort which belongs not to them. Therefore mind it Brethren, you that pleaſe your ſelves in ſin, are given up to the waies of your own hearts, while you are ſuch, it is not my work to comfort you at all; catch not at it, it concerneth you not; but I ſpeak to poor ſinners that are ſenſible of their

condition, that are ſtriving, ſtrugling, groaning under the bondagè, the yoak of ſin, or the concomitants thereof, which you have heard ſpoken to ſo at large. Alas, may one ſay, I doubt all is not well with me, if where Jeſus Chriſt cometh into a ſoul, revealeth himſelf in a ſoul, he brings liberty with him to that ſoul, then I am a poor creature without Chriſt to this day, for alas, I am in grievous bondage; O there is bondage of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ears, and bondage of ſin; It is true, I do ſomething ſaith one, but I doubt it is nothing but a ſlaviſh obedience out of fear; for this we muſt know, Brethren, that though it be true there is a fear which is meerly ſlaviſh, when a ſinner looks upon god as a ſevere terrible Judge, his Law a cruel bloody Law, while he ſeeth no mixture of mercy and love, and yet with <hi>Foelix,</hi> trembles; or as they at the deliverance of the Law, when God revealed himſelf in ſo terrible a manner, trembled, could not endure the ſight; now a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe of the Law, he endeavours to do what he doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, becauſe of terrours; but a child of God he hath a principle of love, it is mercy, it is love, it is tenderneſs in Jeſus that ſetteth him a going; terrours indeed do amaze, and aſtoniſh, and fright him out of himſelf; but it is love in Jeſus Chriſt that ſetteth his ſoul a work to do his will; yet ſo Brethren, as that you muſt know there is not all fear baniſhed out of the ſoul; but that we may the better underſtand it, let us conſider <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Firſt, there is to be a reverent fear of the Majeſty of god in all his people; <hi>let us ſerve him with reverence and godly fear,</hi> ſaith <note place="margin">Heb. 12. ult.</note> the Apoſtle, <hi>for our God is,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a great God, and greatly to be feared:</hi> what an awe there is upon a poor peaſants ſpirit when he appeareth before a mighty Prince? ſo here, and I doubt we have moſt of us cauſe rather to complain, that there is not ſo much of this holy awe upon us as there ought to be, <hi>O ſerve the Lord</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, There ought to be a fear of offending God, as <note place="margin">Hoſ. 3. 5.</note> a Son his Father, though he were ſure never to be ſcourged for it; or becauſe he is his Father, and carryeth ſo much love toward

                     <p>Thirdly, There ought to be a fear of the judgements of God upon others; <hi>David</hi> was affraid of his judgements, when the Angel of the Lord was there; he durſt not go up to worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tabernacle in <hi>Gibb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Fifthly, A man, a child of God may have a fear of everlaſting damnation, which ſerveth to rouze him up when he is growing ſecure, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>that can kill the body, but fear him that killeth ſoul and body:</hi> And ſo, <hi>if ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye, but if by the Spirit ye morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>

                        <hi>the deeds of the fleſh ye ſhall live:</hi> theſe threatnings ſurely would not have been written to Believers, except they were to make ſome uſe of them, to be as an awe upon their ſpirits to keep them from ſinning, to be a quickning to their ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Now on the other hand it is true; that there ought not to be in us ſuch a fear, as to diſtract us; to drive us from, to weaken our Spirits, to diſable us from duty, to cloud and drown all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his waies, to blot out our apprehenſions of his lovelineſs, and compaſſion, and bowels, ſo as to beget hard thoughts in our hearts of God, which will produce hatred of him; ſuch a fear ought not to be in us, and though there may be a ſpice of it ſometimes, even in the beſt, when they are not themſelves, yet this is not the prevailing principle in the ſoul, but an holy fear of offending him, which ariſeth from a mixture of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and holy reverence and awe of him, and of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Greatneſs; and truly Brethren, this is no enemy to ſpiritual liberty; But I muſt not dwell ſo long, upon things.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly, the main thing that I know moſt troubles a gracious heart, is, that he finds himſelf ſo much under the power
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:115245:344"/>
of ſin; O I find not this freedom, this liberty you ſpeak of, I am a wretch then under the power of my corruptions: O the ſad complaints to Chriſtians, to men continually, from ſome poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate ſouls! and to ſpeak a little for their conſolation if the Lord breath in it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Brethren, you muſt know this, that as ſin hath had a time of ſettling and rooting, there will be a time of unſettling it; thou art of yeſterday, it may be, and doſt thou think to be ſo free the firſt day, as they that have many years been wreſting, and fighting, and praying, and faſting, and mourning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving down their luſts? This is a great miſtake: it is infinite mercy that thou haſt thy hands let looſe, and thy feet out of the mire and clay, and that thou art ſet upon a Rock, that thou haſt now a ſtanding and liberty to fight, thou muſt not expect a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from fighting and conflicting with ſin while thou art in the fleſh; mind you the Apoſtles two or three verſes of the ſame Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life, the powerful working of the Spirit of life, hath ſet him free from the</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, Brethren, know this for your comfort, that your labour is not in vain; ſtriving againſt ſin, fighting with it, you are ſure to overcome, though ſin lie hard upon you, you ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. Firſt, the Lord he is able to break all the bonds: if he will deliver <hi>Peter</hi> out of priſon, what ſhall hinder? his chains ſhall fall from his hands, the Iron-gates ſhall open of their own accord before him, nothing ſhall be able to hold them; It was ſomewhat hard for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to believe that they ſhould be delivered out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſomewhat a ſtrange Meſſage of <hi>Moſes</hi> at <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 14.</note> the firſt; even as one ſhould be ſent to the great Turk to tell him, the God of the Chriſtians commands him to let them go; but God tells him and them, <hi>that he is that he is; I am hath ſent me,</hi> the great God, who is being it ſelf, and from himſelf, he is what he is, he is able to deſtroy the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> doſt thou believe this, that he can ſubdue thine iniquities, thy ſtrong, impetuous, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

                        <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>truth ſhall make you free;</hi> he ſpeaks this to his Diſciples, who did already know it in part; know himſelf, the truth, the way, and the life; and the truth in oppoſition to ſhadows, <hi>grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt, and it ſhall make you free;</hi> how many promiſes are there? as in the text, therefore ſurely he will do it: Now what an encouragement it is to fight, when we are ſure to overcome; yea, to endure hardſhip in this conflict.</p>
                     <p>But thirdly, conſider it is the very office of Jeſus Chriſt; the work which he received of his Father is to deſtroy the works of the Devil, to deſtroy ſtrong holds, to lead captivity captive; <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 21, 22.</note> therefore he came into the world: if it had not been for ſuch poor creatures as are under bondage, there had been no need of Chriſt, <hi>he came to give himſelf a ranſom for many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to preach deliverance to them, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound,</hi> you have heard already, and therefore he was annointed of his Father, and received the Spirit, that he might ſet open the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doors: Now poor burthened ſouls, if any ſuch, whoſe body of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin and death preſſeth them down ſore, and they walk heavily, go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="557" facs="tcp:115245:345"/>
Fourthly, Conſider how pittiful a heart he bears to his people labouring under corruption; when we are weak, it may be, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſpirits of a poor creature are ſpent in labour in other ſervices, and he thinketh he ſhould be as lively then as at another time, but it is not likly ſo to be, and therefore when natural vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour decaies in old age, though there may be as much upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there cannot be ſo much vigour appearing in ſervice alway; Now men are apt to have ſad thoughts of themſelves upon this account, and ſo in other caſes when wearied out; our Saviour is tender and pittiful, he takes notice of every groan under it, when thou canſt not help thy ſelf but art foyled, and he pittyeth and ſpareth. O ſaith he, to his Diſciples, <hi>could ye not watch with me one hour?</hi> and at ſuch a time as that was, when our Saviour <note place="margin">Mat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     <p>Fifthly, But ſome will ſay, O but they are grievous workings of ſin that are in my heart, whether they riſe from within or from without, my heart cloſeth with them, and they are very horrid, and I know not what to think concerning it: But I ſay, was <hi>Paul</hi> buffeted, and canſt thou think to eſcape? truly Brethren, I take it, the Devil befools himſelf much in putting a ſoul upon horrid ſins, becauſe that is the way to ſettle the ſoul ſo much the more fully, when the bit is bigger then will down; when <hi>Egypt</hi> dealt more hardly with the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> then before, it made them cry out, and then the Lord heard; ſo it may be, a ſoul was not ſo fully delivered from a ſin, but he doth ſtick, as I may ſay, in the skirts of it, but now this maketh him cry out, more willing, more earneſt to be delivered.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Take heed leſt anguiſh of ſpirit ſo far prevail, as that thy ſoul refuſe to be comforted, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith; and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not believe by reaſon of anguiſh of heart, when God had ſent them a Saviour to deliver them; it may be it <note place="margin">Exod. 6. 9.</note> is ſo with thee.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, There will come a time when thou ſhalt be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free, thou ſhalt never ſee the <hi>Egyptians</hi> more, which now
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:115245:346"/>
purſue thee and trouble thee, me thinks that the thoughts of this ſhould refreſh us, and make us deſirous and willing to depart, Well then, whatever thy condition be in reſpect of the world, it may be afflicted, it may be friendleſs, it may be in other kinds, Oh me thinks one thought of this, that thou art free from guilt, and haſt a free acceſs to the Throne of grace, might exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſupport thy ſpirit. But thus much for this uſe of the point alſo.

                     <p>We are now come to the laſt promiſe in the bundle, and it is not the leaſt conſiderable: That bondage under guilt, under ſin, in its prevailing, could not but be a hinderance of growth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we lay ſo much weight upon the order of the words, ſomething ſeemeth to be held forth of that nature, that this growth is a Concomitant of that liberty and enlargement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed before; but I will not hang too much upon that, though it be an undoubted truth; yet whether it may be argued ſtrongly enough from the order of words, I will not urge.</p>

It is true, it doth not neceſſarily follow, becauſe here is the ſumme of the Covenant of grace, therefore earthly promiſes are to be excluded, for they are a part of the Covenant alſo, ſo far as good for us, and all included in that, <hi>I will be thy God.</hi> Godlineſs hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe now as well as then, of the things of this life, as well as of <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> that which is to come; yet I ſhall rather ſpeak to the other, the growth in ſpirituals; that is to ſay, the daily renewing of the inward man, the increaſe of their ſanctification, and holineſs, and grace; this I take here to be meant, and ſpecially meant, and therefore thus we ſhall underſtand it; the promiſe is amplified by a compariſon, <hi>grow ye ſhall as Calves of the ſtall;</hi> the word for <hi>ſtall</hi> ſignifieth an incloſure, a coop, any place made for to fat Cattle, or other creatures in; and we know that uſually ſuch do grow exceedingly, elſe there is a great deal of coſt beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in vain, and therefore our tranſlators read that in the <hi>Proverbs, better is a dinner of herbs where love is, then a ſtalled</hi>

                     <p>There may be three things haply couched in the compariſon.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that they ſhall grow in quantity as calves; calves ſhoot up and forth very much when they are in the ſtalls, do grow much more then if at random they run up and down; none grow ſo much as they: and therefore this is uſed to ſet forth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the growth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="560" facs="tcp:115245:347"/>
Secondly, in fatneſs and ſweetneſs, they grow very much, a ſtalled-Oxe is fatted very fat, which is much ſweeter and better then another; ſo they grow not only in quantity but quality, as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the ſpeedineſs of the growth haply is in this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, they grow faſter then other creatures of the like kind when they are put into the ſtall, and therefore they are ſaid to grow as the Lilly, not only in beauty, which was greater then <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> himſelf in all his glory had, but in ſpeedineſs, for they ſay, this flower groweth much and diſcernably in one night; and <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 5. Mat. 6. 29. Iohn 2.</note> though it be true, ſudden growths are the more ſuſpicious, yet God can, and ſometimes doth work them, even with truth, as in the Miracle, he quickly turned water into wine; which he doth every year, though in greater time, by the operation of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>In a word then, the Holy-Ghoſt uſeth this ſimile to them, being rude and weak of underſtanding, that they might the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, and have the greater aſſurance of it, that it ſhould be ſo, therefore he propoundeth it ſo croſs, ſaith <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this as well as the other we muſt look upon as a Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, yea an effect of the appearing of the Sun of righteouſneſs to us, his ariſing upon the ſoul, that is the grand promiſe; all things elſe are promiſed and given for him and with him to us, and this among the reſt, the going forth out of the priſon was one, and this growing is another of the genuine and ſweet effects of the riſing of the Sun of righteouſneſs upon them that fear him; ſo that take it in this connexion, and then the note is this.</p>

                     <p>And the opening of it I ſhall deliver in ſeveral propoſitions as diſtinctly as I can; for the right underſtanding of the meaning of it: note in the firſt place, that growth is a motion or mutation from a leſs to a greater quantity; as you ſee a babe, though it be a man in a ſmaller letter, and have part for part, yet they are ſmall, and grow to a greater bigneſs; <hi>the child grew in ſtature,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>and in favour with God as well as with men.</hi> And <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 52.</note> ſo a plant or a ſeed is little at firſt, but it groweth to a tree, to a blade, and the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to the ear, and the full corn in the ear, here is a motion from a leſs to a greater quantity: So a Calf of the ſtall muſt needs alſo ſhoot forth. Now for grace, you know it is either Relative or Inherent, and accordingly we muſt underſtand the <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 27.</note> growth; Relative grace, as that of remiſſion of ſins, and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the ſight of God, and adoption to be ſons and daughter,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:115245:348"/>
this, if lookt upon as the act of God, it will be hard to ſay, that it is intended or remitted, that there is a growth or motion from a leſſer to a greater quantity, for remiſſion of ſins being the act of God, we cannot ſay that one mans ſins are more pardoned then anothers, that believeth as well as he. So we cannot ſay, that one believer is more a Son then another, they are all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the moſt high; though a child grow in ſtature, yet his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation groweth not, he is a Son the firſt day he was born, as well as when he is at the perfect ſtature, this is plain; though every Son be not a <hi>Joſeph</hi> or a <hi>Benjamin,</hi> yet he is a Son as well as any; which by the way miniſters much refreſhing to a poor weak ſoul, that eyeth his ſtature and growth. O he is ſo weak, ſuch a babe, a child in compariſon of ſome of the people of God, which are ſtrong in faith, and can give glory to God, when they are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſcrupling every ſtep they go, yet I ſay, though this be a burthen, yet the main whereupon the comfort of a poor creature hangs, is alike to all, there is no growth; there the weakeſt, poor, ſickly, froward-hearted child, is a chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d as well as he that is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, healthieſt, moſt ſerviceable; and though faith be weak, yet the relation of one is alike, the purchaſe, the price paid, the ranſom is alike to all that believe, though it be but in ſome more weakly.</p>
                     <p>Only here miſtake not neither, though this relative grace grow not, as of juſtification or adoption, yet the knowledge of this grace ariſing from the reflexion of the ſoul upon its ſelf, and the ſhining of the Spirit upon the works of grace he hath wrought in the ſoul, this is capable of a growth, it may be that a man may be a child of God, and yet not know it; alas, how long are our children children, and we look upon them ſo, and hearts and bowels yearn and tender them, and yet they know not that they are children; we need go no further then common experience for this: do we not ſee many a precious ſoul that lies at the feet of Jeſus Chriſt for mercy, whoſe ſouls are ſick of love for him, who prize him above all? O they are willing with all their ſouls to cloſe with him for all ends and purpoſes, if he be but willing <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> to cloſe with them; they think they are not children, nor that they do not believe, when they do believe; for this very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt in ſincerity, is believing, and therefore they think they are not children, when they are dear in Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Again, another he hath ſome probability which begetteth an opinion in him concerning his condition, and that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this ſpecial grace from the Lord, and been partaker of this love, to become a Son of God: others they riſe higher then <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 1.</note> this, and have a ſtrong confidence, and ſome a full aſſurance, and know that they are the Sons of God, that their perſons are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34.

                     <p>Secondly, There is a grace inherent, which is indeed as the root; and the acts and iſſues of it are, as I may ſay, the fruit; but this grace within we ſhall ſpeak to as moſt nearly concerning this purpoſe; the fruits I have ſpoken to, you know, at large upon another Scripture, and I would not in this diſcourſe interfere with what I then delivered; or if we ſpeak any thing to the fruits that grow upon theſe internal inherent graces of the Spirit, as likely enough we ſhall, yet we ſhall not conſider them as fruits riſing from ſuch a root, but as growing fruits, being bettered, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to the growing of the principles from whence they flow.</p>
                     <p>But for the grace inherent, by that I mean all thoſe habits or gracious diſpoſitions of the heart godly, as that of faith, &amp; that of love, and humility, and ſincerity, and ſpirituality, and ſelf-denyal; theſe things and all the reſt in the habit or diſpoſition of the ſoul is the ſubject of this conſideration; and theſe Brethren, you know they are but qualities, though divine qualities, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though growth or augmentation, according to terms of Art or Logick be not properly aſcribed to them, yet according to Rhetorick, it is proper enough to ſpeak it of any thing under a Simile, that it groweth, if it any way increaſe, as if a quality:
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:115245:349"/>
Now the light, for inſtance, or heat in the fire, or Sun, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or waxeth more clear and more hot, this may be called a growing-light, or growing-heat, becauſe that as in things that properly grow, there is an addition of one quantity to another, whereby it increaſeth; ſo here, there is an addition of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the quality to what was before, whereby it is more intenſe then it was before; therefore when we ſpeak of grace growing, the ſpeech is figurative, taken either from plants or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive creatures, that all their beginnings are ſmall, but afterwards grow up to their pitch.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A thing is ſaid to grow properly, you know, when the increaſe is made, not by oppoſition as they call it, but by an inward receiving, that is to ſay, it is a nutrition, as the means; it was a cuſtom to caſt every one a ſtone, and make a great heap, <note place="margin">Ioſhuah 7. 26. 2 Sam. 18. 17.</note> as upon <hi>Achan</hi> and <hi>Abſolom:</hi> Why at firſt it was little, but every ſtone maketh ſome increaſe of the heap, and yet it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not properly; ſo a ſnow-ball, it is greater with rolling, but this is not properly growth nor augmentation; but it is when there is ſomewhat inwardly received, which by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes in man, at laſt is turned into his ſubſtance, and maketh an increaſe of it, as a man doth his food, and a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> doth the juice of the earth, which is concocted and becometh nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the branches, whereby they grow and increaſe; this is properly growth.</p>
                     <p>Now to apply this propoſition to the caſe in hand, when we ſpeak of growing in grace, either we ſay the grace it ſelf grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or elſe perſons do in this or that grace. If the former, then this doth not ſo ſuitably hold, for the grace, the habit of faith, of love, cannot properly be ſaid to receive inwardly this or that nouriſhment, but as qualities, have added to them ſuch or ſuch degrees, and ſo increaſe. But if we ſay, that a ſoul doth grow or increaſe in this or that grace, then it will hold ſomewhat more exactly, which is alſo a metonymical ſpeech, a met onymie of the ſubject for the adjunct, to ſay the perſon groweth, when indeed it is but the habit of grace which is increaſed, the perſon continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame. I ſay, then it holdeth ſomewhat more near, though haply the Simile will not yet run upon all four neither; nor is it to be expected, the poor believing ſoul then receiveth nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inwardly, that is to ſay, that which is nouriſhment to his
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:115245:350"/>
faith, to his love, whereby he groweth therein; ſome deeper knowledge of the riches, the exceeding riches of the grace of God, the riches of the Covenant of promiſes, whereby his faith is increaſed; and ſo ſomewhat more of the height, and depth, and breadth, and length of the love of God in Chriſt towards him he knoweth, which much heighteneth his love to Chriſt again. Now remember this is not by any thing external; external additions to a thing may make it appear the greater, but not really the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as a mans cloaths make him ſeem bigger then he is, yet he is the ſame in them and out of them, no bigger at all; there is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great difference between a weight hanged upon a Clock, the more weight, the more the motion is haſtened; and a child that went but timerouſly and weakly, the Spirit of life within him prevailing, that he can run faſter, and ſo groweth in ſtature and agility, there is much difference; &amp; ſo there is much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an hypocrites growing in appearance, in duties, in ſervices, in zeal, which appears to us, for we can but judge the root by the fruit; therefore we think they are grown there, but all this while are miſtaken, for it is not the root of the matter within, it is ſome external weight, and that is hanged upon their affections; ſome by-reſpect or another to their credit, their profit, their Kingdom, as <hi>Jehu,</hi> that ſetteth them a working ſo faſt more then before; there is great difference between ſuch an one and a child of God, ſuch as <hi>David,</hi> whoſe heart was perfect, who from the inward revelations of Chriſt in them, diſcoveries of his love, teachings of his Spirit, and quicknings, they grow up more and more, there is much difference I ſay. But this is the ſecond, I am affraid I ſhall be too tedious herein, yet I hope this will not be unuſeful to make things as plain as I can, as we go, that we may underſtand what we ſpeak of.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The thing that groweth remaineth the ſame, though increaſed, the body that grows it is the ſame body ſtill, though much increaſed; as a child and a man, he is the ſame perſon when a babe and when a man, only he is much increaſed by a continual nouriſhment: So it is here, a mans grace is the ſame, the ſame habit of faith and of love, but groweth much ſtronger, as in the caſe of <hi>Thomas</hi> and the reſt of the Diſciples you ſee it; it is the ſame that was a tender plant, and now is become a ſtrong Oak or Cedar, only now it is more rooted then before, and grown
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:115245:350"/>
up and ſpread it ſelf; though a child of God have many ſhakings with contrary winds, temptations and falſe Doctrines, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his knowledge may be corrupted, and ſometimes his faith may be ſhaken, yet I believe he is never pluckt up by the root, and then planted again; when once he hath received that grace, and obtained that mercy, to be faithful, to believe, and have the graces of the Spirit implanted in the ſoul, theſe are never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed altogether; once alive to God, and that life never fails, becauſe the principle, the fountain of it, that feeds it, never fails; <hi>the ſeed of God abideth,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith. It is true, there may be ſickneſs, and weakneſs, and wounds, and diſtempers that may <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 9. &amp; 2. 14.</note> hinder the growth of a child, but yet he liveth and groweth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward again, yea more then he did before haply, and this is the caſe; and though <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> broke their bones, though they be ſore ſhaken, yet they are not pluckt up by the roots, as trees dead and ſo planted again, nor doth any grace of Gods planting wither away altogether, like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s gourd: the reaſon that is given for the withering away of ſome of the corn that <note place="margin">Math. 13. 21.</note> was green, is becauſe it had not root. This the third.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Another conſideration to make out further the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this growth, is this, there muſt firſt be a life before there be a growth, either vegetative, or ſenſitive, or rational; you know if there be no life in the tree, if it have not a root alive to maintain it, it groweth not at all, ſtands at the ſame ſtay for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and groweth dry indeed, and rotten, and fit for burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo there muſt be life in a man before he groweth, when he is dead all growth ceaſeth, there is nothing but diſſolution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſſolution then; and ſo it is in this caſe, there muſt be a root, a planting into Chriſt, a grafting into him by his ingrafted word; before we can grow up in him, we muſt be one with Chriſt, for <note place="margin">Math. 13. 21.</note> you know that which had no root withered; it may make a ſhew for a time and flouriſh, even as the graſs upon the houſe top, but it withereth before it groweth up. <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollo</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 129. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>may water, but it is he the Lord that giveth the increaſe, he that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtereth ſeed to the ſowers, both miniſters bread for your food, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6. 2 Cor. 9. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>your ſeed ſown, and increaſeth the fruits of your righteouſneſs:</hi> Now this he doth in and through Chriſt, for he is the only pipe through which grace is conveighed to us, as things here are to be noted, to make this out fully.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="568" facs="tcp:115245:351"/>
Firſt, that all the nouriſhment is from Chriſt, as the breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milk is from the mother that brought it forth; ſo it is with us in <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 11.</note> reſpect of Chriſt, he travelled, his ſoul travelled with us, he was big with us, and O what ſharp travel he had, ſuch as never was, nor can be the like again, and he ſupplies the nouriſhment, <hi>the Word and the Spirit he promiſeth ſhall never depart out of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mouths;</hi> and this is that the Evangeliſt hath, <hi>of his fulneſs we</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, But then beſide this, there is a forming power, a power of concoction, digeſtion and aſſimilation, to turn theſe nouriſhments into the very ſubſtance, for ſo the Apoſtle, Some preach Chriſt of envy, ſaith he, ſuppoſing to add affliction to my bonds; the Devil and his Angels of light preach Chriſt, but with no good intent, not to gain credit but diſhonor to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel at the long run; we ſee it by too woful experience; well ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I know this ſhall turn to my ſalvation, through</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7. Heb. 4. 2.</note> then when it is ſo mixed and concocted it groweth indeed, the Word groweth, then the poor Believer groweth, his faith grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: And ſo the Apoſtle in that to the <hi>Corinthians; who behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in a glaſs,</hi> there is the nouriſhment, the Ordinances, the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> beholding Chriſt in them, but the power of concocting theſe, turning them to ſtrength, is the Spirit, <hi>we are changed into his image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> as there <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 14.</note> is not <hi>ſimilitudinis,</hi> but <hi>identitatis, the glory as of the only begotten Son of God, full of grace and truth;</hi> there is the truth in general,
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:115245:351"/>
that it is from Chriſt, and more ſpecially that this power is his; in that one place to the <hi>Epheſians, from whom the whole body fitly</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>joyned together and compacted by that which every joynt ſupplyeth, according to the effectual working in the meaſure of every part, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth increaſe of the body;</hi> he ſpeaks of the growth of the Church in general, but there is <hi>par ratio</hi> for the growth of each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for it is one part of the growing of the whole, that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers grow in ſtature as well as in number; and ſo in that place to the <hi>Coloſſians, Let not man beguile you of your reward:</hi> as a Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the race of maſteries preſcribes, it is an exorbitant courſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>un out of the way, and then promiſe you the reward for it; this will be but a beguiling of you in a voluntary humility, and worſhip of Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is worſhiping of Saints any better then this voluntary humility and yet ſome there are that beguile poor creatures of their reward, promiſing them, if they run in this courſe they ſhall have it, not holding the head; me thinks an ingenuous Papiſt reading this, ſhould begin to ſuſpect their way, ſince to worſhip Angels, and ſuch voluntary humility as God never commanded, as not to approach to Chriſt without a mediation of Saints, which he never commanded, is voluntary humility, and ſo this is not to hold the head Chriſt Jeſus, from which, from the head, all the body by joints and bands have nouriſhment miniſtred and knit together, increaſeth with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes of God; it is the increaſe of God, becauſe he is the Author <note place="margin">Col. 2. 19.</note> of it, or elſe becauſe of the greatneſs of the increaſe and its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, for ſo the name of God is often uſed in the old Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and their phraſes the Apoſtles do often keep in the New. You ſee the nouriſhment is miniſtred from the head, as the ſap is from the root of the tree, and it is his effectual working whereby it is turned to an increaſe of our faith and love; and therefore that ſoul that is not really and truly in the Lord Jeſus, though he may for a time flouriſh, yet he will wither; he may be green, and yet be but a weed, and they grow faſt, but they are not upon a right root, they ſpring not from ſuch a ſeed, and therefore at their perfection they will be but wild Oates it may be, or Tares, which for a great while are ſo like to Wheat, as ſome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſpeak, that it is not to be diſcerned from it until it come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ear; and ſo many an hypocrite may have as broad a leaf, as green a blade, in externals: not be behind any for enlargements,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:115245:352"/>
and parts, and notions of the knowledge of Chriſt; and yet alas, though he had more and more degrees, this is not a ſpiritual growth, this is not from the head, from the root, the Lord Jeſus, as a root of ſaving life. I deny not but he giveth thoſe gifts and parts, but it is not as head of the inviſible Church, who alone ſhall be ſaved; though as head of the viſible Church there may be a communication of ſome fatneſs and ſweetneſs of the Olive to them; that is to ſay, the Ordinances and priviledges of the Church, which an hypocrite may enjoy, &amp; yet be cut off when <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 17.</note> all is done, and thereby he may make ſome progreſs of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a formality, but yet this is no true ſpiritual growth; this ſhould make us look well about us, and ſee if our water do ariſe from this fountain, it will ſpread it ſelf until it come to a river, grow broader and broader.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, As it is from him, and therefore we muſt be in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can grow with this ſpiritual growth; ſo this growth in grace is a growing up into him; and good reaſon, if of him and by him be all things, that to him ſhould be all things alſo; <hi>if Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers be from the Sea, they return to the Sea again;</hi> there may be <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 32.</note> two things in this one expreſſion of growing up into Chriſt who is the head.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that we grow up into a nearer fellowſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him who is the head; and this is moſt ſure, whether the growth of the members where it is, the faſter do draw more and more yet from the head and other parts where the nouriſhment is prepared, I ſhall not meddle with, but this I am ſure of, the more grace any ſoul receiveth, the more yet he may, it is in order to further fellowſhip and communion with the Lord Jeſus; which is indeed an argument whereby the grace of Chriſt is as highly advanced as by any other whatſoever, that he ſhould therefore increaſe the ſtrength of his poor weak children, that they may draw more ſtrongly from him, and their hearts more enlarged to receive more abundantly from his fulneſs; as a ſtrong child will draw harder and harder ſtill, the arms of the trees as they grow ſtronger and ſtronger, ſo they ſuck more juice from the root ſtill to feed them and carry them on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now I ſay, this is ſweet to the ſoul, and it may be a character alſo of our growth; if we do grow in grace indeed, we ſhall grow up into him, we ſhall find a greater drawing of our hearts after him ſtill,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:115245:352"/>
and ſuck more ſtrongly from him: This the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, another thing comprehended under this growing up into Chriſt may be this, that all our growth is to his honour, it ends in him, who alone is exalted by it, it is the honour of the head when the members grow and become by the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the animal ſpirits, more vigorous and active, and fit for the diſcharge of their ſeveral works, this is the glory of the head; this may be underſtood two waies. Firſt, it is the end of the thing it ſelf, <hi>finis operis,</hi> the thing doth much advance him, when others behold ſuch a fulneſs of ſtrength and power flowing forth from Jeſus Chriſt upon the members; to ſee the members of a body languid, and weak, and withered, it is not for the honour of the head, ſpecially if generally ſo, though there may be alſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cauſes, as obſtructions, and the like, but theſe are not ſo viſible. What an honour is it to Chriſt to ſee a poor ſoul th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> now is as weak as water, like the poor man in the Goſpel, <hi>Lord help my unbelief,</hi> that ere long through the ſupply of grace from Chriſt, is able to ſay, <hi>My Lord and my God;</hi> to ſee a poor ſoul lie lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing under a luſt, and not be able to ſtir, and yet ere long able to triumph over it; to ſee a poor ſoul that ere while was cleaving to the ground and to the duſt, could not get up the heart, and now after a while upon Eagles wings running without wearineſs, and walking without faintneſs, is not this to the honour of Chriſt? But ſecondly, It muſt be ſo intended by us, elſe our growth is not right in the end, our end in deſires of, and Gods end in working; we muſt look to the end, Brethren, we deſire ſtrength againſt this and that corruption, to wax more valiant in this fight, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, to triumph over them; we would have ſuch a meaſure of knowledge, ſuch a meaſure of faith, but what is our end; is Chriſt the end in all this? is it that we may more advance him? Ah that ſoul that indeed groweth into Chriſt, Brethren, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downward into the root, can be content to be any thing, to be nothing that his bleſſed Saviour may be advanced; ſo it was with <hi>John:</hi> Ah ſo with <hi>David, if the Lord will lay me aſide, and I</hi>

O he would not have <hi>Joſhua</hi> in another caſe envy for his ſake, he wiſhed all the Lords people were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, God would have the greater glory: when the Lord of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="572" facs="tcp:115245:353"/>
to make of him a greater people, <hi>O what then wilt thou do to</hi>

O dear friends, let this be conſidered, if we grow, we grow up into him; I ſay, it may ſerve for a piece of tryal; though delivered in this place, I would have my whole diſcourſe as applicatory as may be.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, In a true growth we muſt know, there is an uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as you know one member groweth in the body as well as another if it be a true growth; where ſome of the members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no nouriſhment, but all the growth is found in the root, this is a diſeaſe, and not the effect of the principle of life within them; as you ſee it in the <hi>Rickets,</hi> a diſeaſe now ordinarily known by that name; but this uniformity is two-fold.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in reſpect of the Church.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, of each particular member thereof, in regard of the graces of the Spirit which are growing in them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, for the Church of Chriſt, there is an uniform growth there, that is to ſay, the Lord Jeſus doth not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his ſap, and vigour, and vertue ſo to one, as to ſpend it on him, and leave another without, but every wild Olive grafted into the Olive, either viſible or invſible Church; the viſible there is meant in that place of the Apoſtle, <hi>in whom the whole body being,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph 2. 21.</note> &amp;c. they receive accordingly, either the common influences of the Spirit with the Ordinances, whereby they grow up in that which we call common grace, and one as well as another; there is none ſure but thriveth more or leſs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for the inviſible, there is none ſo grafted but he groweth, he is one Spirit with the Lord, and therefore ſure muſt needs grow that hath a continual ſupply of the Spirit, as the Apoſtle in that forecited place; the Lord Jeſus in his inviſible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hath no withered arm nor legs, whatever there be in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, whatever dead and drie ſticks may cleave to the viſible Olive, there is none ſo cleaveth to the inviſible; it is impoſſible a ſoul ſhould hold the head, and hold inward communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him, and yet not to grow; but this is but for the Church, which thus uniformly groweth, one member as well as another.</p>
                     <p>Now ſecondly, for particular members, they alſo grow, and
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:115245:353"/>
that uniformly alſo; grow not in one grace only, or in this grace, or that grace, nor in another, no, but they grow uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that a man ſhould be all faith and no love it is impoſſible, or all love and no knowledge it cannot be, there muſt be an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in growth, if right; that were more like a wen and its growth, then growth of the body; you would not eſteem that a growth, that a man ſhould grow all in the eye, and it ſhould become as big as the body almoſt, ſo that he could ſee wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in the mean time the reſt of the parts are as ſmall as when they were born; grow in one grace, and grow in every grace, grow in ſincerity, and grow in humility, grow in faith, and grow in love, &amp; grow in all. A timpany, a growth of one member more then all the reſt is monſtrous, and ſo it would be in grace: Now though through defect or ſuper fluity in natural cauſes, there may be a monſtroſity in a birth or growth, yet it cannot be in reſpect of Chriſt, who doth alike extend his influence to the growth and increaſe of one as well as another grace which he hath begotten in the ſoul; ſo that if a man find he thinketh he groweth in faith, and thinketh he groweth in love, and yet grow not in zeal for the glory of God, groweth not in tenderneſs of heart and plyableneſs to his will, this is not a right growth: Alas, how many of us then do not grow in grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Though there be an uniformity in growth, yet we muſt not ſo underſtand it, that every member groweth in the ſame meaſure with another, and yet may grow alſo in its due proportion; and ſo alſo in reſpect of graces, there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of truth in it: but to ſpeak the more diſtinctly:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, conſider the members of the Church of Chriſt, and our ſelves, if we be ſuch indeed; though all the members of the Church of Chriſt do grow, yet they do not grow all alike in the ſame meaſure; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>according to the effectual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the meaſure of every part;</hi> ſo that you ſee each part hath <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16.</note> a meaſure, every member hath not the ſame relation, the ſame office in the body, and ſo doth not require the ſame meaſure of ſtrength, or the ſame quantity or greatneſs. Yea if it have a greater quantity then is meet, it is a burthen and an hindrance, as if the joynt of a finger ſhould grow as much as the joynt of a mans knee, would it not be monſtrous? and yet both joynts
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:115245:354"/>
grow, but each according to its proportion, ſo that they grow all <hi>

the meaſure of every grace its growth, as I think, is much more hard to determine, whether all graces do grow according to the proportion of the growth of any one of them; that is to ſay, whether love to God, and zeal to his glory, do grow according to the meaſure of every mans faith, and ſo patience according to the meaſure of his faith; indeed I am at a ſtand here; if that one habit of grace did beget another, faith did beget love, it would be the more clear, becauſe then according to the ſtrength of the cauſes, the effect would be; a ſtrong cauſe, a ſtrong effect, the habits of grace in us being not voluntary agents; but I take it for granted that the efficient cauſe of all grace, one as well as <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 19.</note> another, is the ſame Spirit of the Father and the Son; it is the ſupply of the Spirit, as the Apoſtle calls it, whereby we grow in any grace; now the Spirit of God being a moſt free agent, is not tyed up by a neceſſity of nature to work alike upon the ſame heart, to the increaſe of every grace; though he do work to the growth of every grace, yet whether he doth equally work to the increaſe of them all. So that what proportion of grace a Believer hath in one grace, he hath the ſame proportion of ſtrength in another, is doubtful; ſpecially ſince the Lord, who works in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure, knoweth what tryals he hath for every one of us, ſome in one kind, ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome greater tryals for their faith, and ſome for their ſelf-denyal, and ſome for their love, may accordingly work; but this is not ſo much material, if we can find we grow in every grace of the Spirit, whether we do grow alike in the meaſure of love, as in the meaſure of faith, or zeal, or ſpiritualneſs; as it will be very hard to judge, conſidering how hard it is to judge of the ſtrength of our habits by their acts, which may accidentally be inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Surely no; it would be night preſently; now we have a ſwelling ſtream, it fills the Channel, and over floweth its banks, to the inriching of the ground about it, but cut it off from the Fountain, or from the Sea, and what will become of it? ſo that the growth, the continuance of the ſtream is from the fountain; ſo it is in this caſe, though a mans gifts and grace riſe never ſo high, and over-flow at his lips, at his actions, to make others alſo fruitful and to grow, yet if there be not a continual ſupply from the Fountain, would it ſubſiſt, would it not languiſh? therefore this is the comfort, that he is an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, <hi>I the Lord, haſt thou not heard, haſt thou not known,</hi>

O how heavenly and ſweet do the Saints generally grow before the Lord takes them? Brethren, if ſo glorious a building as the temple of God be intended, will every rough ſtone, a rough-hewn-Chriſtian be fit to lay in that building? O no, ſurely thoſe knotty pieces ſhall be plained, and ſmoothed, and polliſhed before they be laid in that glorious Temple in heaven: remember it, I ſay, Brethren, there is a meetneſs for heaven, and though haply many of us care not for it, we would not be too meet for it, leſt we be taken to it before we be willing to part with the world; never fear that, while thou haſt ſuch a heart, it is well if thou be not ſo far from it that thou never come thither, thou needeſt not fear coming thither too ſoon.

Firſt, It is worth the noting, that even they who deny them the priviledges of the Covenant of grace, which are viſible and outward in the Church of God, yet dare not profeſs, whatever they think to the contrary, but that they are ſaved, or may be ſaved, and profeſs tender thoughts of them; they are not ſuch <hi>duri patres infantum,</hi> as to exclude them out of the Kingdom; it was the Diſciples fault you know, and ſo it may be good mens now, to hinder them from coming to Chriſt; they thought they were but troubleſom gueſts to him, they were capable of little, and therefore forbad them, but they got a rebuke for their labour; what, ſaith our Saviour, is it not clear enough, even from the old Scripture, for there were no other then written; and they had means to know that they did belong to Chriſt and <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 15, 16, 17.</note> the Kingdom, elſe he would not have reproved them, <hi>Do you not know to ſuch belongs the Kingdom of God? you might have known and ought to have known, and therefore you deſerve a rebuke for it;</hi> and ſo it may be good mens faults now a daies, but yet they dare not exclude them from the Kingdom of glory.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is to be noted, <hi>that no unclean thing ſhall ever enter into that place;</hi> Children by nature are the children of wrath, poor leprous polluted creatures, and therefore if there be not a pardoning grace and cleanſing mercy for them, how can they enter into glory? and becauſe we cannot apprehend how it ſhould be conveighed, ſhall we therefore deny it? are we not all of us pure <hi>receptives</hi> in the firſt grace, and are not infants as <note place="margin">Pſal. 17.</note> purely <hi>receptives</hi> as we? Yea, are they not more purely <hi>receptives</hi> then we? for though it is true, they have the ſame ſeeds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the ſame ſpawn, the ſame venomous poyſonous nature with our ſelves, miſerable ſinful off-ſpring, of miſerable ſinful pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; yet according to their own principles, they cannot put it forth into ſuch actual rebellion as we; and do not the acts increaſe and ſtrengthen the habits, and the ſtronger the habits are, the ſtronger the oppoſition is againſt Chriſt, and therefore they are more purely <hi>receptive</hi> then we are: and therefore,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, What hinders but they in as ſhort a time as the thief upon the Croſs, may be brought to as high a degree of grace as he, though in an unſpeakable manner? Was it not more then ordinary that <hi>John</hi> leaped within the womb at the voice of the
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:115245:358"/>
mother of the Lord? it was more then ordinary, elſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 41.</note> would not have wondered at it, though a miracle it were; truly, Brethren, every work of grace is a miracle, and the greater miracle it is, to work upon a deſperate, prophane, hard-hearted ſinner, that hath all his life-time been working wickedneſs with both hands earneſtly; to make ſuch an one in one day fit for heaven and glory, as the thief upon the Croſs, where there is greater oppoſition, is not this a greater miracle then the other? Beſide, let it be conſidered I beſeech you, what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>he that receiveth not the Kingdom like as a little</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>child, cannot enter into it.</hi> It may be ſome will ſay, this is nothing, he compareth his Diſciples to Doves and Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo he doth to a little child, this proveth nothing: But let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and weighed; and then I leave it to the judgement of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial perſons; he ſaith not only, you muſt be like children, and like Doves for innocency; he ſaith not, you muſt be like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for humility, and want of envy, for love; no, <hi>but ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter except ye receive the Kingdom as a little child:</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon lies in the receiving the Kingdom, as well as in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo that except little children did receive the Kingdom, how can the Diſciples be compared to them in receiving the Kingdom? how can they be, as I may ſay, made the very ſtandard in receiving the Kingdom of God? we muſt receive it as little children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; you never find ſuch a like ſpeech of Doves or Sheep, that we muſt receive the Kingdom as Doves or as Sheep, becauſe they are not capable to receive the Kingdom, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appointed nor prepared for them: Now if little children be made, as I may ſay, the pattern for humility, ſelf-denyal, which I tell you, Brethren, goeth far in Chriſtianity. O which is the firſt ſtep? humility, the ſecond humility, the third humility, it reacheth to the top of the Ladder; and not only ſo, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pattern in receiving the Kingdom of God. Surely then, ſuch children as we allow, as we muſt allow ſome, elſe the compariſon were not true nor rightly framed, they muſt be allowed to be as holy as any others; truly Brethren, me thinks if we conſider how much innocency there is in theſe little ones, which is not in us, O how we have rebelled all our daies, which they never have done; played the hypocrites before the Lord, which they never have done; dealt falſly in his Covenant, which they never

have done; have ſuch ſtrong luſts in act and vigour, and ſtrong habits of ſin, pride, and envy, and hatred to oppoſe the workings of grace in us, which they have none of; me thinks it might eaſily be yielded unto, that former ſuppoſition, that many of them are ſaved (and who dare deny it) that they have grace, and a great meaſure, ſo as to be made the ſtandard of receiving the Kingdom; therefore they may quickly come to a great height: but thus much for this reaſon, I am carried further then I had any thought, when I firſt minded it as an Argument.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Another reaſon may be, becauſe the greater our growth is, the more honour he hath from us, and the more ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and we the more comfort; this doth much what concern the growth of ſuch as are of years of underſtanding, for to ſuch I ſpeak; I give it therefore as a reaſon, only of the growth of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of underſtanding, though ſome part of it may reach others.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, hereby God hath the more ſervice: Alas, what ſervice hath a Father or Mother from a little child when it hangs upon the breaſt? many a weary hand ſhe hath with it in its fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, but no help at all, but when grown up it will do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 12.</note> ſo while a poor Believer is weak and feeble, feeble knees and weak hands, alas can ſcarce ſtand upon their legs, every little wind of temptation or doctrine is ready to blow him over, and <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 14.</note> ſtagger him, he ſtands ſcrupling and trembling at every ſtep, and doubting, he cannot ſet a foot before another, but the Father is fain to take him by the hand and teach him to go, as he did <hi>Ephraim;</hi> this is the great time of Gods taking pains (like a <note place="margin">Hoſ. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

the manner of men; but this coſts the people of God dear, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, though it be true the Lord hath no need of our ſervice, we profit not him at all, he can work deliverance for his people and Church, if there were never a <hi>Heſter</hi> to pray nor mediate to the King, ſome other way he will do it; yet he ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily uſeth the ſervice of his people; and alas, that our reward may be the more abundant, our Crowns of grace may be the more weighty, ſo that there is not a ſtep from the very Cradle to the Crown of glory, but all is grace, and growing, until it be ſwallowed up of that fulneſs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He is honoured indeed ſo much the more, Brethren, by our growth, <hi>fortes oreantur fortibus:</hi> O when his people come to that ſtrength, to bear the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, to deny themſelves, to hate their lives for his ſake, which the Diſciples at all times were not ripe for; how doth this honour the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? O what Spirit is that whereby they are acted, that even their enemies themſelves have been confounded with the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of it, and ſo when they are ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God; a man weak in faith, a child, a babe that ſtaggers at every difficulty, is queſtioning upon every occaſion whether God be with them, as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe they had no water; O, ſaid they, <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 20.

<pb n="585" facs="tcp:115245:359"/>
though they act little among men, ſpecially while properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, that cannot ſpeak for him, thence they have their names Infants; there may be little appearance, yet the very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, <hi>that the Lord ſhould infuſe grace,</hi> yea ſuch rich grace, as you heard, into them, me thinks ſhould take us up ſometimes with more admiration then we are taken up with it; for I ſay, no man dare deny but that they may have grace, and ſome of them have grace, and all of them that die in infancy for ought we know, have: Now how admirable is it? but God hath made it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in ſome extraordinary caſes, as in <hi>John;</hi> is it ſtupendious that the like babe ſhould leap in the womb for joy at the hearing of the report of Jeſus, more then the moſt of Believers likely would have done upon a bare report? Beſide, how many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of little children wrought upon, even as ſoon as they can ſpeak, I ſay, that can make it appear in an admirable manner, and to call God Father at very tender years, yea know him to be their God, and they his, and that they ſhall have a Kingdom prepared for them; me thinks theſe things are enough to convince us; there is no ſuch neceſſity of years, Brethren. And then, is it not the more admirable, is not Chriſt more to be admired? Again, it is much for the comfort of his people, and truly this the Lord hath much in his eye, next to his own glory, which indeed is much magnified by the comfortable walking of his people; the more then a man groweth up in the knowledge of the things free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given of God by the Spirit of Chriſt, the more comfortably he <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12.</note> walks, ſuch are an ornament to their profeſſion, an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and invitation of others to enter upon the ſame waies, when they ſee the faces of the Saints that ſhine, to be anointed with the oyl of gladneſs, and the Kingdom of God in them, to <note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 7.</note> conſiſt in righteouſneſs, and joy, and peace, this encourageth others, that otherwiſe would be diſheartened: Now I ſay, the Lord is very tender of his peoples comfort; do but obſerve it, and you ſhall find, Brethren, the blood and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus to run through all the veins of the Scripture, and all for the conſolation of the Saints; <hi>theſe things I write to you, that your</hi>

with every mans condition, but that his deſign is the comfort of his people? and wherefore are the examples of the Saints propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us; their falls, their reſtoring again, but for our comfort and hope? ſurely this is the deſign, Brethren; and therefore ſurely, he will carry on his people in the knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them, the cloſing with them, elſe the work is done but imperfectly; for what though the righteouſneſs of God be revealed in the Goſpel from faith to faith, except there be an eye <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.

O they think they are hypocrites, they are not right with God, or they are in unbelief, they cannot believe in Jeſus Chriſt, they cannot do this or that, or they cannot ſee that there is any thing right in them: Why Brethren, it will not ſatisfie a tender heart, except he ſee and diſcover ſomewhat in himſelf of Gods working; now when it is, ſmall as a Muſtard-ſeed, as a Cypreſs-ſeed, it is ſcarce diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but as it groweth from ſtrength to ſtrength, at laſt he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſee it, when ſincerity of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O what riches of grace is <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 20.</note> here! but thus much for the Arguments of the point.</p>
                     <p>For the Application then; Firſt, this will ſpeak the ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two ſorts of perſons, and thoſe are,</p>
                     <p>Firſt; Such as make a profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet grow not, are at a ſtand; we do <hi>innovere</hi> but not <hi>promovere,</hi> like a horſe in a mill, go round, and are at night where they were in the morning; they go round in a formal compaſs of duty, but alas, grow not by it at all; look upon many profeſſors, and conſider what they have been, and ſhall you not find they had as much life ſeven years ago as they have now, they are grown in faith nothing, their faith is ſtill as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, if they have any at all indeed, as they may, its true, and yet not grow for a time; the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſilly women, that are alway learning and never come to the knowledge of the truth; and <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 7.</note> there are ſilly men among us that are alway learning and yet are not come to the knowledge of the truth: Some indeed I pitty much, there is a natural defect in their underſtandings, by media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof all this growth is perfected, and it is ſo great in ſome, that they will hardly ever be able to apprehend much of the wiſdom of God in a myſterie, it is well if they underſtand the main thing, without which there is no life; but theſe are not the perſons I ſpeak of, but ſuch among us have wit and parts enough, can underſtand, and manage, and improve any thing elſe they take in hand, and yet in the matters of their ſouls, they take up their reſt like tyred Jades that will go no further: the Apoſtle reproveth the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for it ſharply, that when for the time they might have been teachers of others, yet we had need <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note> to be taught our ſelves the firſt principles of the Doctrine of Chriſtianity: truly Brethren, me thinks you that have long known Jeſus Chriſt, and have gray hairs upon your heads, and are found in the way of righteouſneſs, when you ſee young ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:115245:361"/>
out-grow you, and apprehend much of the myſteries of Chriſt which you do not, this ſhould be a ſhame to you: it is a <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 31.</note> ſtrange ſottiſhneſs and ſecurity that ſeizeth upon men, in reſpect of their ſouls: they would think ſhame that a young man of little or no experience ſhould know them, to manage their trade bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then themſelves, that are of ſo long ſtanding and experience, but here they are content to be out-ſtript, and content themſelves with any thing; that your grace ſhould be ſo ſmall, as I may ſay, in the ſeed ſtill, ſo ſmall as a ſeed, and ſcarce diſcernable to this day; O what a ſad thing is this! now your ſalvation is nearer then when you believed, and you are as far from being meet for it, as when you believed. O how unfit are we for death, though we have one foot in the grave already ſome of us, and we do not heed this? Surely, if this be a truth, that thoſe who are planted in Chriſt do grow, and thou canſt not find thou groweſt; what canſt thou conclude, but one of theſe two things?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that either thou haſt all this while deceived thy ſelf, and thought thou hadſt the root of the matter within thee, and hadſt it not, for if thou hadſt, thou wouldſt have grown: The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God will not be alway as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, and that which is in thee haply appears to be no more; and is not this a ſad condition, Brethren? is it not high time for you to look about you, when you are grown to ſuch years, and never have been planted into Jeſus Chriſt, never made one with him to this day? I ſay, a man that findeth he groweth not at all, he is where he was ſo many years ago, hath cauſe to fear this; and me thinks this ſhould ſtartle us, a company of lazie profeſſors, that never matter whether they improve or no.</p>
                     <p>Or elſe ſecondly, which is bad enough, that thou haſt ſome ſad diſeaſe upon thee, that hinders thy growth: ſurely ſomewhat is the matter, Brethren, it is not right with you; if you have a child ſtand at a ſtay for two or three-years, while it ſhould grow, you ſee it is a living child, but it groweth not; O ſurely it hath ſome diſeaſe or another, ſome obſtructions hindering the courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the head, and heart, and the members, and you fear ſuch a child will not live. O that you would but apply this to your ſouls! ſure you have ſome deſperate diſeaſe upon you, ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or another; it may be the world is gotten between you
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:115245:361"/>
and the root, and the head, which is Chriſt, and ſo the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is hindred, you grow not up into him, draw nothing nearer to him at all; doth it never enter into your hearts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, Brethren, are you not afraid of periſhing in ſuch a condition? I am ſure your condition is ſad, that a growing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Chriſtian would not be in your caſe for a world; and are you not ſenſible of it? it is ſo much the worſe. O how will you anſwer it, Brethren, conſidering how much influence you have had from on high, the Ordinances, the fat things of his houſe in abundance, the ſincere milk of the word you have had in this place for a long time, more then moſt places have had it, and yet your ſouls have proſpered no more under it; you have had five Talents, and yet it may be many that have had but two, but one, have out-ſtript ſome of you; where you have had five Sermons, five opportunities of grace, many a poor ſoul would have been glad of one, and yet ſuch it may be ſtronger in faith, more in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, more ſpiritual minded then we are; can you anſwer this at the great day? But thus much for this firſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It ſheweth us the ſad condition of ſuch, as inſtead of growing in grace, alas they grow worſe and worſe; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>evil men and ſeducers grow worſe;</hi> and indeed, we <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 13.</note> muſt know this, Brethren, we do grow either better or worſe, as haply afterward we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak to at large; either the houſe of <hi>David</hi> groweth ſtronger, or the houſe of <hi>Saul;</hi> either the fleſh or the ſpirit prevails in the hearts of the people of God; there are two ſorts of perſons whoſe condition is under this conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Such as have profeſt the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet alas, though they were green for a while, now their leaf is fallen, their light is gone out, they are fallen from their place of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Saints in appearance; never was there an age more fruitful in ſuch barrenneſs then this is; alas, like a Fir-tree ſhaken with the wind, they loſe their fruit, yea, are turned up by the roots, and now are become as a dry ſtick, fit for nothing but to burn, <hi>the latter end of ſuch men is worſe then their beginning,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 45. Iude 12.</note> 
                        <hi>they are trees twice dead;</hi> not only dead by nature, but have loſt their profeſſion, which was a viſible life, whereby they did appear to men to be alive; and is there any hope of ſuch a tree living again? truly, Brethren, very little; I have oberved
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:115245:362"/>
it, and I wiſh I could look upon it with a more trembling heart, that ſuch men as theſe grow worſe, fall off and decline, they are the ſaddeſt, hard-hearted, deſperate, prophane wretches afterward; or the moſt beſotted worldlings, and ſeldom are they recovered. I know not whether I may ſpeak to any ſuch at this time, I hope the beſt things of you; if there be any ſuch, let me tell thee, thou art in a more dangerous condition then thoſe that never knew God to this day.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Such as never yet had appearance of being planted into Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo no growth in them, but are yet in their <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 11.</note> naturals; know this day, you are growing worſe and worſe, the Goſpel doth not return in vain, you are worſe every day then other, every Sermon then other; the Goſpel is a ſavour of death to death to you; as there is nothing doth condemn ſinners like to <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 19.</note> the Goſpel rejected, ſo nothing doth harden ſinners more then the Goſpel, and thoſe precious promiſes which men give the hearing to, day by day, but alas that is all. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the moſt Evangelical Prophet, he cometh with a <hi>make you the ears of this</hi>

                        <hi>people heavy, that hearing they might hear and not perceive.</hi> If the Son be not kiſſed when he is offered to ſinners, but they turn their <note place="margin">Pſalm 2.</note> backs upon him, he will be angry; if the more worthy perſon be ſuitor, and be denyed and ſlighted, and the heel lift up againſt him, will not this provoke him think you? ſurely it will: therefore God doth uſually give up ſuch to a reprobate mind, yea even for <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 28.</note> deſpiſing the light of nature, much more the Goſpel, and giveth them up to hardneſs of heart; you ſhall ordinarily ſee where the Goſpel cometh at the firſt among a people, it works more mightily then afterward; at firſt, though men are prophane, yet they have not had the Sun-ſhine to harden the Clay into a Brick; the Word of God, this Goſpel and means of growth, it is as fire, the coals of love, and either they do melt, or elſe burn ſinners into ſtones and bricks, and ſear their conſciences that they are even paſt feeling, hence it is we have ſo many deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked perſons among us. O how ſad a condition is this Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to be growing worſe and worſe under the greateſt mercy and love that the Lord manifeſteth to any! Sinners, in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, do you think it is the way to heaven to grow worſe, and worſe, or the way to the Chambers of death? Thou knoweſt thy ſelf to be a more deſperate prophane wretch then formerly,
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:115245:362"/>
making no conſcience of that which heretofore thy ſoul it may be hath trembled at, now it goeth down without regret, or elſe if not in open prophaneneſs, if thou melteſt away in ſecret wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that no eye takes notice of, and art worſe and worſe, what will the end of theſe things be? the Saints that grow, they grow up into the likeneſs, and image, and glory of Chriſt, they grow up into him; and thou groweſt up into the likeneſs of the Devil, up int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

O that ſinners would but lay theſe things to heart: if heretofore thou waſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with a ſin, it may be it was ſome trouble to thee; now thou wilt work the works of the Devil, thy will is ingaged, and ſo much the more haynous the ſin is; what can you expect, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? O that God would open ſinners eyes, that they might but ſee whether they are going, what they are doing, and they could but conſider what bitterneſs this will be in the latter end, to grow worſe and worſe.</p>

I think we may all of us, or the moſt of us, plead guilty here; have we our times, Brethren, we ſet apart for this work of ſelf-ſearching and tryal? not an hour in a moneth, or many moneths; when we come to the Lords Supper, an hour in a quarter, or a day in a year, yea, do you ever perform this duty at all? truly, it is an ill ſign when we are ſo backward to ſearch; the Lord perſwade you to the duty: you heard before how ſad a thing it is to be at a ſtand, not to grow; and beſide, how canſt thou be thankful if thou take not notice of it? he loſeth his glory, and that will neither be for our advantage nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                     <p>And here I hope it may not be beſide the Text, to ſpeak of growth, under that other ordinary Simile, of growing like trees or plants; in Scripture, nothing more ordinary, then that where Believers are compared to trees of righteouſneſs, and branches in Chriſt the Vine; and what is included in this compariſon here, as to the growth in quantity, increaſe in quality, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſwiftneſs of it, I hope I ſhall meet with in the other.</p>

Alas Brethren, what ſtrangers are many of us to the very principles of Religion, if examined, in them that pretend to ſuch high diſcoveries and revelations of Chriſt in our times, <hi>ſuch have need of milk, and not of ſtrong meat; the wiſdom of God in a myſterie is a riddle to them;</hi> the <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 5.</note> Apoſtle ſpake it to them that were perfect, that is to ſay, grown men and women, in oppoſition to babes: Well then, look to it, if you find your ſelves eaſie to be ſhaken, to turn with every wind of Doctrine like a weather-cock, it argues you are but children, but babes; you may perſwade a child to any thing, to be of twenty minds in an hour, becauſe alas, he hath no ſound well-grounded knowledge of any thing, you may perſwade him to part with his meat, his drink, for a toy, or by ſome pretended loathſomneſs in it that is not, and ſo it is with poor, weak, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſouls; how do we ſee many cheated out of Ordinances, out of duties, out of cloſe walkings with God, as things of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the cunning craftineſs of them who lie in wait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. It is a ſad thing to ſee perſons that ſhould be of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er knowledge then ordinary, that in things ſo much controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they are now a daies, can in a few daies time be ſo toſt with a wind of Doctrine, as to take up a ſtrange, a contrary practiſe; this eaſineſs to forgo our principles, argues we are childiſh and weak.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Are we grown in underſtanding? you will find it by this; thou wilt not be ſo ready, ſo eaſie to take offence as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore thou haſt been: alas, before men are acquainted with the waies of God at all, you ſee they are offended at every thing they ſee; the Jews were offended with the meanneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, his deſcent, that he was the Carpenters Son, he was not like to be the Meſſias; alas, it was the weakneſs of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:115245:366"/>
they did not conſider thoſe Scriptures, where it is ſaid <hi>there ſhould be no beauty in him that we ſhould deſire him;</hi> and that <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 15.</note> he ſhould come meek and lowly, riding upon an Aſs: and ſo they were offended at his Doctrine, when he told them, <hi>they muſt eat his fleſh, and drink his blood,</hi> they could not conceive of it; and many of his Diſciples went backward and walked with <note place="margin">Zech. 9. 9. Iohn 6. 66.</note> him no more. And ſo ſinners, O they ſtumble at every thing in the people of God, when they conſider them, and pry into them, and find they miſs it, and fall in their duties, they are prejudiced ſtrongly againſt the waies of God upon this ſcore; alas it is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they know not that they have a corrupt principle within, whereby they are laid open to ſin, when luſt and temptation meeteth, except the Lord do wonderfully keep them; they expect they ſhould be as the Angels in heaven, altogether ſpotleſs and pure, even while they are upon the earth, and therefore they are offended. And ſo a weak child of God, that is newly come on to grace; alas, every little thing in the way they ſtumble at, for this offending is nothing elſe but ſtumbling upon a thing, ſo as to hurt themſelves by it, either by being drawn to ſin thereby, being encouraged to ſin thereby, or elſe by being grieved at it without cauſe; you know a child cannot get over that which a man maketh nothing of, but he ſtumbleth and falleth: ſo the Apoſtle, where he diſcuſſeth of the uſe of indifferent things, ſaith he, <hi>All</hi>

                        <hi>men have not this knowledge, that an Idol is nothing, and therefore if ſome weak ones, ſee a Brother that is ſtrong eat of that which was offered to an Idol, which he knoweth to be lawful for him to do, he is offended at it:</hi> this argues weakneſs: now have we found it ſo, that we have been apt to take offence at any thing, at every thing in others almoſt? and now we can bear; it argues we ſee more clearly the grounds of ſuch actions; but thus much for this.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another part of this growth upward, I place in the will, which is indeed the main, the commanding faculty of the ſoul, and indeed wherein the main of faith doth lie, and of other graces, as of tender-heartedneſs, and the like: doſt thou find then that heretofore thy will was more unſettled and wavering, being as I may ſay, halting between two, thou waſt not able to come up ſo fully, to ſuch a reſolution for God and for Chriſt, as to trample all under-foot for them; thou wouldſt have them, but

                     <p>A man of a weak reſolution for Chriſt, alas if a temptation come, to deny him the allurements of the world, he forſakes him with <hi>Demas,</hi> and imbraceth the preſent world, or the frowns of the world, <hi>he draweth ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ah dear friends, it may be ſome of us can tell the time when for fear of men we have ſadly miſcarried, is it better with us now? have we now more courage? have we for fear of ſhame come to Chriſt with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> by night? and now are we not <note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 50.</note> aſhamed of Chriſt nor of his Goſpel? As the Apoſtle, he was not aſhamed of it, though it were perſecuted, and though his meanneſs of ſpeech were deſpiſed, his preaching in a ſuitable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the ſubject, which is a great part of a Preachers duty, he was not aſhamed: Well then, now conſider, doth the Lord give thee ſuch boldneſs, ſuch courage, ſuch reſolution of heart, as to hold faſt the Word of his patience, the ſuffering-truth? it may be we may be tryed in this point; if we be not grown we ſhall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry as heretofore we have done.

O you may not do this and ſin againſt God! then we are grown in the will indeed: and the more ſtrong we grow in theſe reſolutions, the more we grow in this reſpect; but if we cannot ceaſe to ſin, Brethren, we are where we were; it may be we may be ſometimes affected a little with our ſins upon a flaſh or pang, but have no power nor <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 14.</note> ſtrength to reſiſt our wills, our wills are as weak as water to any thing that is good, and againſt ſin; we grow not, Brethren.</p>

Again, as thus downward and upward, ſo ſee how we grow in fruitfulneſs; we have ſpoken at large to that ſubject, that we muſt bring forth fruits, or elſe we cannot eſcape the Axe; now I ſpeak of the meaſure of the growth therein; a young tree of the firſt year, cannot be expected to bear ſo much, as when better grown; no more a young Chriſtian: here I would only mind you of two things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that we bring forth more fruit, that is, that we do more for God then we have done, and for his people, and for our own ſouls; it may be thou haſt heretofore, but now and then prayed to God, doſt thou now do it more often? it may be three times a day with <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> It may be heretofore thou gaveſt but little to the relief of the poor Saints and others in diſtreſs; doſt thou now give more and more, proportionable to thy eſtate, as the Lord hath bleſſed thee? for that is the proportion which <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 4.</note> the Apoſtle maketh; and ſo where heretofore thou didſt ſpeak but now and then a ſavory word, now doſt thou grow in that? is thy communication much more ſeaſoned and ſavoury? is it all ſavoury, tending to miniſter grace to the hearers? heretofore thou hadſt it may be ſcarce a thought of God in a day; now he is the object of the workings of thy ſoul, the thoughts of him are pleaſant to thee, this is an high condition, it argues thou haſt grown, thou art in a growing condtition; but this is not all, Brethren.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Is that more fruit you bring forth, better then it was before? is it more mellow then formerly? or if thou bring forth no more in number, is it more in weight? for God takes not our ſervices by number but by weight; and it is a ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs of the poor blind Papiſts, to think that God is pleaſed with their much ſpeaking, with pattering over ſo many <hi>Avy Maries</hi> and <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> or principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt. I wiſh our practiſes be not too like theirs; It may be heretofore thou couldeſt not enlarge thy ſelf in prayer, and now thou canſt; and thou thinkeſt thou art much grown, it may be in bulk, but not in goodneſs; are thy prayers now more, the breathings of the Spirit of Chriſt within thee, and leſs of thine own Spirit? O how much ſtrange fire mingled with our ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and ſtrange incenſe, ſtrange zeal, even our own paſſions, inſtead of a zeal for God! Now Brethren, is our zeal and fire

                     <p>Firſt, I ſay, from oppoſition without, grace will grow and gather ſtrength, and this either from men or from the Lood; from men, when they oppoſe the way of God wherein we walk, we muſt look to it that we grow ſo much the ſtronger, for that is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of grace, Brethren; as when <hi>Paul</hi> preached the faith which once he had deſtroyed, and the people were amazed, ſaith the <note place="margin">Acts 9. 22.</note> Text, and they ſpake of him as a changling, <hi>is not this he that waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that called upon his name in Jeruſalem?</hi> but <hi>Saul</hi> waxed ſo much the ſtronger, and confounded the Jews that dwelled at <hi>Damaſeus,</hi> proving that this was the Chriſt.

Truly, it is to be feared it is not right with us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From the Lord, there is ſome oppoſition ſometimes, he wreſtleth with us; <hi>Jacobs</hi> wreſtling with God implyeth ſome <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> oppoſition of God, as I may ſay, he wreſtled with him, <hi>let me go,</hi> ſaith he, this ſtirreth him up ſo much the more earneſtly to lay hold upon him, when the Lord would take his leave of him; and you ſee the poor man in the Goſpel, when he was rebuked for crying after Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>he cryed ſo much the more earneſtly;</hi> and <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 31.</note> ſo our Saviour when he was in that great agony, or ſtriving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſpleaſure of his Father, ſaith the Text, <hi>he prayed ſo much the more earneſtly.</hi> So the Lord doth ſometimes hang back <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 44.</note> or hide his face, that he might draw out more and more his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts toward him, as a Fiſher draweth away his bait to make the fiſh follow it the more eagerly. Well, conſider this now, do we thus grow, even by oppoſition? if the Lord ſay to us we are dogs, not fit for childrens bread, can we conclude the worſt againſt our ſelves, and yet gather upon him for the crums at the leaſt?</p>
                     <p>But then there is oppoſition from our ſelves, from within, and that is from the rebelling of our luſts, they riſe and ſwell, and many times over-bear us, we are foiled; do we grow by this? this may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange, that the acting of ſin ſhould tend to the encreaſing of grace, for that we muſt know, that it is not proper; for every act of ſin properly doth ſtrengthen the habits of ſin, and the ſtronger ſin is in the ſoul, the weaker grace is like to be; as the more the water cools, the leſs heat there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in it; but it is by accident, as water caſt upon a coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, at preſent it ſeemeth to put it out, but afterward it burns ſo much the hotter and fiercer. So grace takes occaſion hereby to ſtir up it ſelf ſo much the more, to ſet it ſelf ſo much the more
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:115245:368"/>
in oppoſition to it; it maketh a child of God ſo much the more humble, ſo much the more watchful and full of prayer, if it be right with them, and neither ſin nor Satan gets by this at all. So if <hi>Peter</hi> be toſt in that ſieve of vanity, that temptation, and fall; O how it humbles him; and how afterward it fetcheth him off his own bottom! how valiant he grew for Jeſus Chriſt? And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his pride in the buſineſs of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> how it tended to humble him ſo much the more; do we find it thus? doth ſin increaſe our grace, increaſe even by our falls? do we get ground of them yea or no? if not, it is not well with us.

                     <p>But may he not much rather take us up for this: the Spirit was not poured out as now he is, and we have more then the bodily preſence, even the Spirit of Chriſt, and great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to beg that Spirit, whereby we ſhould exceedingly grow in this Grace; may he not ſay to us, O ye of little Faith, why do ye doubt? why do you walk ſo penſively, and hang the head, to the diſhonour of my Grace? may he not ſay, O ye of little Faith, why do you perplex your ſelves, and rack your ſelves with cares of the World, what ye ſhall eat and drink, and how ye ſhall be prvoided for? doth not your heavenly Father take care of you? O ye of little Faith, why do ye in every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and trouble, as men at a loſs, run to this creature, and that creature, and not to the Lord wherein your help doth lie? O ye of little Faith, why do you, when means fail, then caſt away your hope, as if there were no help in God? as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtreams were dried up, therefore the fountain muſt needs be dry alſo; therefore Brethren, labour to grow in this Grace: if ever you would do any eminent ſervice for Chriſt, or honour him, ſet the crown on him in any condition, labour to be ſtrong in Faith.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In that Grace of Love, labour to grow therein. Firſt to the Lord himſelf, to Jeſus Chriſt: It may be thou doſt love him, and according to the meaſure of Faith and Knowledge

                        <hi>his Saints,</hi> you cannot love him too much; do you alway err in his love: the more you love him, the more you may, for <note place="margin">Prov. 5. 19.</note> there is no end of his perfections, his love, his mercy, his bowels towards you, there is no ſearching of them, you may go yet deeper and deeper, and find a ground for the increaſe of your love ſtill; you love Relations, Husband, Wife, Children, and more for relation, then for any excellency in them: many times fond we are: O that we could be ſo fond of Jeſus Chriſt! how ſick of love was <hi>Rachel,</hi> yea ſick to the death for children? and ſo is many a fond mother; O we cannot live without <note place="margin">Gen. 30. 1.</note> them: Ah how few are thus ſick of love to Jeſus Chriſt! well, lobour to love him, and to this end.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Labour to preſent the Lord and Jeſus Chriſtas moſt lovely to thee; while thou entertaineſt hard thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt, thou canſt not love him; if thou thinkeſt thus with thy ſelf, I would fain have him, but he is not willing to have me; if thou look upon him as rigorous and cruel, and one that delights in your blood, it is impoſſible that you ſhould love him: O no, labour to preſent him to your ſelves, as one whoſe bowels are continually yearning over poor ſouls, poor ſinners, one full of compaſſions, full of mercy and tenderneſs: he deſires not the <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 16.</note> death of a ſinner; the Lord Jeſus Brethren, is altogether lovely; it is true for his holineſs, his purity, as well as his grace and mercy: but this is that which moſt moveth to love, at leaſt while we are under weakneſs, it is an high pitch to love him for the beauty of Holineſs that is in him. Think often then ſeriouſly upon it, what dear thoughts the Lord Jeſus had to poor ſinners; that rather then they ſhould periſh, he would interpoſe between them and the everlaſting burnings, though be were ſorely ſcorched for it; O will not this draw love! look upon him with his precious blood trickling down, and one drop overtaking another; O what haſte did love make! O how laviſh was his love! he would not ſpare any pains, any travel of ſoul, that ſinners might live; and can you but love him then? O what an heart muſt that creature have, that can look upon the Lord Jeſus wreſtling with ſtrongeſt wrath of his

Father, ſo that he needed the Miniſtry of Angels at that time, and yet not love him? try, ſee whether ſuch conſiderations as theſe will not heighten your love to him? we complain of want of love; Brethren, we cannot love a thing we know not, or that we conſider not: ſee then if you do not find ſtill ſome new beauty in him, for which you ſhould love him yet the more.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let it be much upon your hearts, how much he hath forgiven thee. Alas ſaith the poor ſoul, if I knew that, that my ſins were forgiven, I ſhould love him indeed abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: It may be thou haſt not a full perſwaſion of it; but haſt thou not a good hope through Grace? and ſuch a lively hope, as ſetteth a working out the ſcum, the pollution of thy heart more and more? Is not this cauſe of great love to him? why, he hath not left thee to ſink in deſpair, and periſh: O how <note place="margin">Luke 7. 47.</note> much did that ſinner love him! <hi>becauſe he had forgiven her much, therefore ſhe loved much.</hi> Dear friends, could this be, think you, without her heart dwelt upon this conſideration? it was freſh upon her ſpirit: O the more ſhe conſidered it, the more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent were the riches of Grace towards her: O ſo many Devils caſt out of me! would the Lord Jeſus have ſuch precious thoughts toward ſuch a wretch as I? what, an Harlot, a filthy, unclean wretch, and would he think upon me? and pitch his love upon me? and paſs by many others that had it may be but one devil, and make love to me that had ſeven? O ſhe could not hold; her bowels within her were ready to break; ſhe muſt love him, ſhe muſt hang upon him, even upon his feet; ſhe muſt waſh him with her tears, and wipe them with the hairs of her head; though before as harlots uſe to do, ſhe had been much in tricking and trimming her head, yet now they ſhall be diſhrifled, and now they ſhall be a Towel to wipe the feet of Jeſus Chriſt: O here is love! kiſs his feet, if ſhe may not kiſs his lips, and bleſſed ſoul that had ſuch an heart given her! Now Brethren, conſider this, have not ſome of us had ſeven devils, have there not been ſeven abominations in our hearts? O it may be, we have been <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9, 10.</note> fornicators, adulterers, filthy unclean wretches, as vile wretches as ever breathed; now conſider this often, is it ſo indeed? hath the Lord looked upon ſuch as we have been, pitched his love upon the vileſt of us, and to make us ſo nigh to himſelf, and ſhall

we not love him? O where are ſuch workings of love towards the Lord Jeſus, as that poor woman manifeſted! our hearts are dead and dry: So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, His love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him;</hi> O he was the chief of Sinners, and the Lord did <note place="margin">1 Tim 1. 13, 15.</note> ſo eminently ſave him, and call him out of darkneſs, when he was in the very height of his wickedneſs, that then mercy ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O this lying upon his ſpirit, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear his ſoul to Jeſus Chriſt. Ah dear Friends, I beſeech you conſider this; ſome of us ſure, that hear this, this day, our hearts do tell us, we have been the chief of ſinners, never viler then we: and hath the Lord met with us? not as an enemy, but poured out upon us ſuch a ſtream of love, as we could no longer withſtand it? and yet do we not love him accordingly? O la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to grow in love to Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Mind the particular experiences thou haſt had of his love and tenderneſs to thee. So the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I love the Lord,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 1 16. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>becauſe he hath heard my voice;</hi> when he was in diſtreſs, then he cryed to the Lord, and he heard him, therefore he would love him; how many deliverances hath the Lord wrought particularly for us? ſpecially he hath kept us from ſinning ſuch a time, and ſuch a time, ſo that thou didſt not go on to the wounding of thy conſcience, the diſhonour of his name, and wilt thou not therefore love him? O dear friends, how often hath he ſhaken the rod over thee, and yet hath ſpared, and canſt thou not love him? yea, though a child thinks the rod cannot ſtand with love, yet when he cometh to lay away childiſh thoughts, and to underſtand as a man, he loveth his father ſo much the more, that he hath chaſtened him, and not ſuffered him to take the way of his own heart; ſo ſhould it be in this caſe. But conſider, how many ſweet experiences haſt thou had of his love? which it may be many a poor creature would have given a world for one of them; many a kiſs of his lips: thou ſcarce ever appeareſt before him, but thou haſt a ſmile from him, ſome refreſhing, ſome melting; doth not this indear thy heart? conſider theſe things; there is many a poor child of God, that ſcarce ever findeth ſuch ſenſible refreſhings,
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:115245:373"/>
and yet hang upon him, and loveth him; and O it is pure love indeed, when we hang upon him, though he frown upon us, though he ſeem to ſhake us off, not to heed us nor regard us; yet our ſouls it may be are ſick of love for him, we muſt follow him ſtill. But thou that haſt ſuch fore-draughts of his love ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, yea many times, O the remembrance of theſe me thinks ſhould much increaſe love to him. Now this is of very great moment, for it will make us more abundant in the work of the Lord, and with much more eaſe it will come off: <hi>Paul</hi> laboured <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> more abundantly then they all, and it was nothing to him, O he loved much; and ſo it will be with us if we could get our hearts to it. What was it think you, that carried our Saviour ſo chearfully through all his travels, and griefs, and ſlightings of men? O it was his love, nothing is hard to love, therefore labour to be like-minded, to grow in love to the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly, <hi>To grow in love one towards another,</hi> this is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of rejoycing to the ſaithful over-ſeers of the Church of <note place="margin">2.

I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I am of</hi> Apollo, <hi>and I am of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I am of</hi> Chriſt; <hi>are you not carnal?</hi> that is to ſay, I could not write to you as ſpiritual, as grown men, but as carnal, as unto babes in Chriſt, ſuch in whom the fleſh did much prevail; ſurely Brethren, the way of love is the edifying-way, and therefore the body is ſaid to edifie it ſelf in love; knowledge puffeth up, and from that <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16.</note> pride cometh contention, as the wiſe man ſpeaks; but love edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies. O how would the Church grow, and the Saints grow, if all the heat, and zeal, and pains which is laid out in maintaining breaches, factions, ſeparations one from another, did all run in one ſtream to build up one another in our moſt holy faith, to make that our buſineſs? It is ſweet when the members have that care one of another, that out of a pure ſpirit of love to conſider <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 25.</note>

O if there were but more love in Miniſters to people, how would they do more then they do? or at leaſt, in another manner then they do. And ſo in people, if they would be more earneſt for their Miniſters then they are; therefore if we would grow indeed, <hi>labour to grow in love to all the Saints, wherever indeed the image of Chriſt is, and to love them with a pure heart, unfeignedly,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>

                        <hi>in this alſo.</hi> Ah where are bowels, Brethren, towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſouls? with what tenderneſs did the Apoſtle ſtand over the ſouls of thoſe poor people, warning them day and night with tears? And our Saviour over <hi>Jeruſalem; now I tell you again weeping,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. O that God would give ſuch a heart to us, and ſuch a heart to his people! indeed there is little ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and bowels one towards another, little pittying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while under temptation; we can rather raiſe our hearts one againſt another, ſtomack one another, entertain prejudice one <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> againſt another upon this account; but a ſpirit of meekneſs, and love, and tenderneſs, in reſtoring, ſetting one another in joint, if we be faln, is not found among us, or very little: O labour to grow here, and then to abound in works of mercy, to give, and give much, liberally, and do it with a tender heart, an upright heart, out of obedience to God, not for oſtentation.</p>
                     <p>But fifthly, <hi>Labour to grow in ſoftneſs of heart,</hi> to ſee the ſtone waſting day by day. I do not mean by ſoftneſs of heart, only an aptneſs to melt into tears, for many an one may have a ſoft heart, that cannot weep at all, though moſt diſpoſitions are apt to it: and where it is, it is a ſweet expreſſion of the heart towards Chriſt often-times; though I muſt tell you, there may be much of this, and yet much hardneſs of heart; many tears ſhed, and it may be upon the conſideration of ſin, and yet the heart hard to this day; the ſoftneſs of the heart, Brethren, lies moſt what in the plyableneſs and yielding of the ſpirit to God, <hi>when we are ready to do all the will of God;</hi> as <hi>David, I have found</hi> David <hi>my</hi>

And ſo he cometh with rod upon rod, blow after blow, and yet doth it gently, and all to foften and make the poor creature more plyable to him; it affecteth a little ſometimes, but is not the heart as ſtubborn, as unteachable, as far from yielding to God in all things as before? O this is the ſoftneſs; as a piece of joyners work, it is all glued together, one part to another. Now then it is diſſolved and broken, when the glue, the ſoder is melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and one piece falls from another; ſo it is here, our hearts and their ſinful objects are glued together by carnal affections; now then the heart is ſaid to be broken to a ſoftneſs, when theſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are diſſolved, when our hearts and our objects of ſin fall aſunder each from the other; labour to grow herein, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>To be more ſpiritual in holy duties, more inward in our Communion with God;</hi> you have heard this ſpoken to in the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. O labour then to grow in ſpiritualneſs, in prayer, to pray with more faith, with more fervency, with more purity of heart, not to ask any thing to ſpend it upon our luſts.

I ſee, I feel, that I do believe, that I have choſen the Lord Jeſus for my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore he is mine and I am his; I have many ſealings of his love to me, many kiſſes of his lips, it is given to me to believe, to be upright with him, I can approve my ſoul to him as <hi>Peter, Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee;</hi>

thus the ſoul by laying up thoſe experiences that it hath of God and laying them together, doth from all come (through grace) to be able to conclude, that the Lord Jeſus is his, to a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hope and faith; and what an heaven upon earth is this? Well, labour after it, though your conditions may be ſafe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, yet not ſo comfortable to your ſelves, nor ſo honourable to him, nor ſo profitable likely to others, all which conſiderations, if well weighed and improved, I preſume are motives enough to it.</p>
                     <p>You have the firſt thing in this general Exhortation, and that is, wherein we are to labour, to grow and increaſe. Now for the Motives in a few particulars; and truly the firſt ſhall be that in the very Text, we muſt labour for it, becauſe he hath promiſed it; therefore we muſt pray for it, and uſe all other means, for prayer is one, as afterward we ſhall ſpeak; God had promiſed he would bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they muſt fight for it firſt, to diſpoſſeſs the <hi>Canaanites:</hi> and ſo he promiſeth health and ſtrength to his people as choice mercies, but they muſt eat, and drink, and uſe Phyſick as often as occaſion ſerveth; and it is an encouragement ſo to do, becauſe God hath promiſed us thoſe things ſo far as good for us, therefore uſe the means; he promiſeth fruitfulneſs to the earth; what, ſhall the plough-man therefore caſt the plough in the hedge and never ſtrike ſtroak? it is true, if God bid them ſtand ſtill, and only ſee the ſalvation of God, it is ſomewhat, elſe they muſt work, and ſerve provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the uſe of means; ſo here it is promiſed, <hi>O,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling, for it is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>he that worketh:</hi> Labour to be more ſpiritual in prayer, to grow therein, for it is his Spirit that beareth the heavier end of the burthen, he helpeth our infirmities; let this be an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> to ſtir up our ſouls to it, becauſe it is promiſed; think not Brethren, it is enough to ſit ſtill, and wait when this will fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your mouths, or that an idle complaining will do it; no, no, you muſt be up and doing, and labouring to uſe the means, and the more, becauſe he hath promiſed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Every man would grow and come on in other things, therefore we ſhould much more labour to grow in the beſt things; you would your ſelves, and have your children come on and thrive in body, you think their meat is not well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed,

(as we uſe to ſay) if they ſhould not proſper at all, but ſhould devour, like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean kine, and be never the fatter; you would grow in your names, and in your eſtates, and every man would be adding bag to bag, houſe to houſe, land to land, and here they never think they are come to a full growth. O that the Lord would but make you half ſo dilgent in taking half the pains to grow in grace, as they do that grow in the world, how ſhould we proſper? It is obſervable, that the Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>Gaius</hi> that good man, <hi>he wiſheth he may proſper,</hi>

You are fat and flouriſhing, and feed your ſelves <note place="margin">Iude 12.</note> without fear, much pampering of the fleſh, but the poor ſoul, O how lean, and thin, and <hi>conſumpſit</hi> it is? what fat purſes, and lean ſouls? Brethren, whatever you profeſs while it is thus, I muſt tell you there is much prepoſterouſneſs in your endeavours, that all this ado ſhould be made for a lump of clay, and the ſoul, the precious ſoul, the price of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt neglected; men can riſe at midnight, and with end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, Conſider, if you grow not, you decline; either you increaſe or decreaſe, either you ebb or flow, wax or wain, for it is like a man that rows againſt the ſtream, if he go not forward, he is carried backward. So it is here, we have a ſtream of luſts to row againſt, and if we go not forward, be ſure we go backward, and therefore if you obſerve it, the Apoſtle doth threaten the <hi>Hebrews</hi> upon this account (becauſe they went not forward) <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4.</note> with Apoſtacy, they were in danger of falling away quite from God that go not forward, therefore conſider this ſeriouſly, and ſurely it will put us on to look to our growth; there is not an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance wherein we appear before the Lord, but either we ſoften or harden, we get ſomething or loſe ſomething by it, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth not in vain, not the Word, nor any other appointment of his.</p>

Fourthly, Another ſhall be this, we cannot elſe withſtand enemies, bear croſſes; alas, a child is over-born by a touch, he cannot withſtand a potent enemy, therefore we muſt labour to be ſtrong men, <hi>whom reſiſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſtedfaſt in the faith;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 9.</note> there is no ſtedfaſtneſs but by faith, nor any reſiſting but by this ſtedfaſtneſs; if we give ground, the Devil will purſue the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if we turn our backs upon him; now we cannot keep our ground except there be ſome ſtrength. Its true, every child of God is born with his armour on him, as is fabled of the race of thoſe Giants; ſo the Saints have their breaſt-plate of faith to keep the heart, and the ſhield to preſerve the body, but as they grow in ſtrength, ſo are they able to weild their ſhield, yea it groweth ſtronger and more able to bear off a blow. Alas, our Saviour ſaw his Diſciples were not able to bear a temptation at that time, <hi>John</hi> 18. 8. therefore, let them go, ſaith he, to them that ſought for him, if ye ſeek me; let theſe go; as yet they were not grown to that ſtedfaſtneſs; but now, what if the Lord ſhould for holy ends give Satan liberty to ſift thee to the very bran, and thy faith be weak? O what ſad work will there be then in thy ſoul? therefore our Saviour prayed, that <hi>Peters</hi> faith ſhould not fail him; but yet you ſee how near it was, and what it coſt him; and ſo except we be grown in wiſdom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, we ſhall be ignorant of his devices; and he will take us alive at his pleaſure, becauſe we know not where he will have us, nor what his methods of deceiving are, that there we might watch. And ſo for croſſes, it is not a child can bear the croſs, ſpecially if great; ſome little affliction they may bear, as you ſee our Saviour did train up his Diſciples to it by degrees: at firſt only they threatned them, and charged them not to preach <note place="margin">Acts 4. u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                     <p>Fifthly, Becauſe the ſtronger our graces are, the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable they will be; this was hinted before in the arguments of the point, and this will put an end to many ſad complaints
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:115245:377"/>
that a child of God maketh concerning himſelf, when his grace becometh more viſible, not only to others, but to himſelf, by reaſon of the greatneſs of it, and the Spirit of God ſhining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to diſcover it. O how comfortable may ſuch an one walk!</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Conſider the end of all the Miniſtry and Ordinances God hath given, it is for our growth, as in that place, <hi>therefore he gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Evangeliſts, ſame Paſtors, for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>of the body of Chriſt;</hi> now, hath the Lord been at all this pains, riſing up early, and ſending meſſengers upon meſſengers, one after another, and pouring out the gifts of the Spirit, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them for that work, and all to build us up, and yet we are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and dwarfs? What a ſhame is this to us, and what a grief is this to God? and is not this the way to make him repent of the good he hath done unto us, and to withdraw them?</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, A very hypocrite, Brethren, may grow in ſome things, and therefore we had need look to it, to go beyond them in our growth; an hypocrite may grow in parts and gifts, may learn to pray and preach moſt plauſibly; may make long prayers, with thoſe hypocrites, though they grow not inwardly at all, therefore take heed of ſticking here: or becauſe thou groweſt more civilly, eſcapeſt the pollutions of the world, and yet alas, art the ſame in diſpoſition, a ſwine in nature; yea, there may be a growing in aſſent to the truth, ſuch a ſaith as the Devils have, which maketh them tremble, and ſome kind of affection too, as <hi>Herod</hi> had; but by how much we ſee there is danger of being deceived, by ſo much the more narrowly we had need to look to it, that we grow there, where there is no deceit; grow in the ſpiritualneſs of ſervice and duty, in that of ſelf-denyal, humility, and ſaving-faith, and love.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, Wicked men grow worſe and worſe, and why ſhould not we grow better and better? Shall Satans Kingdom ſo increaſe and grow ſtrong, and ſhall not the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt grow ſtronger alſo? how much the more need had we to ſtir up our ſelves in this reſpect, conſidering how many grow worſe and worſe?</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, The ſtronger we grow in the habits of grace, the more eaſie will our acting of grace be to us; we come off ſo hard with a duty, as with prayer, or the like; what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:115245:377"/>
but becauſe we are ſo weak in the Grace of prayer, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with it: O how a man delights to do the things which he is befitted for, and habituated to! O how quickly are ſome mens ſpirits up in duty, like tinder to the fire of the Spirit; or like the ſpirits of wine or oyl, quickly fired: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would have the fat offered up, it would quickly take fire; and when our ſervices come off with delight and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, then the Lord is pleaſed with it; ſo you ſee, <hi>They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced they were counted worthy to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 5. 41.</note> and yet a little before, were ſo weak, that they all forſook him; what a difference is here? and ſo they rejoiced that God had given them ſuch a willing heart to lay out themſelves upon the Temple, <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.</note> to build an Houſe to the Name of God; when a mans love and mercy is weak, what he giveth, it cometh hardly from him, like drops of blood (as we ſay) but afterward he can freely, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emptie his purſe for Chriſts ſake; this is one way Brethren, to make the Commands of God not ſo grievous to us, as they ſeem to be, until we be thus grown.</p>
                     <p>Again, We muſt grow to our pitch, before we can enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom: <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 3, &amp;c. Therefore upon all theſe conſiderations, let us be exhorted to make it our buſineſs to improve, to grow, to wax ſtronger and ſtronger day by day; But thus much for the Motives.</p>
                     <p>For Helps, that will be the next enquiry what we ſhould do to grow in Grace; ſince it is ſo neceſſary a work lying upon us all? And I might ſpeak diſtinctly, Firſt, To the Grace which is inherent in us, wherein our holineſs conſiſteth; and Secondly, That wherein our comfort conſiſteth, even the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our relative ſtate to God; But the main thing is that holineſs, thoſe ſeveral Graces of the Spirit, each whereof ſhining with its own luſtre, and yet by the ſymmetry and conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the reſt, make up the perfect beauty of Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then in general, If thou wouldſt grow indeed, and art in good earneſt in this matter, thou muſt exerciſe Grace, if thou wouldſt grow; what a rich treaſury is that of the Mind, above that of a mans Che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How did the Talent increaſe but with the uſing? that is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by putting them out to the Changers; and ſo the Talent or <note place="margin">Luke 19.</note>

Pound gained five Talents, or ten; therefore it is obſerved by ſo me, that the Scripture in commanding or requiring any Grace of us, doth directly and immediately command the Acts and the Habits obliquely, as the Fountain to the Stream: So <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith. The way to get away our indiſpoſedneſs to Prayer, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> is to pray it away: exerciſe that Grace according to the ability given, and thou ſhalt find it grow: it is much to be preferred before an idle complaining, a diligent ſoul that is up and doing; thou findeſt thy Faith is weak, it may be thou canſt ſcarce call it any thing, but unbelief: labour to act it, put it forth often: the nature of it lies in the ſouls ſincere willingneſs to take Jeſus Chriſt, to have him for a Saviour and Lord, to ſave from iniquites, as well as from the condemnation of ſin now, though weakly put forth, the acts of willing Jeſus Chriſt, as he hath offered himſelf, and thou ſhalt find it will grow: often be rowling thy ſelf and thy burthen, poor bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened ſoul upon the Lord Jeſus: caſt thy ſelf upon him, and thou ſhalt find as much reſt in it for the preſent, ſo alſo an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of faith, and a feeling alſo, that thou doſt believe after a time. And ſo for other things: alas, is there a day that goeth over our heads, but there is uſe for Faith? it is the very life of a Chriſtian: <hi>The life I now live, I live by the Faith of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Son of God;</hi> and therefore as much need of the exerciſe of it daily, as of any vital acts whatſoever; and you ſhall find, you have occaſions for it, either ſome temptations from your own hearts, ſome corruptions ſtirring and diſquieting your peace, or ſome ſcourgings from without, ſome buffetings of Satan, ſome deadneſs and ſecurity growing upon you daily: O there is daily need of acting Faith, as there is to eat and drink; therefore <hi>Iſrael,</hi> their Manna was their daily food; and if they were daily ſtung, they muſt daily look up to the Serpent; and <note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note> which of us is not? though you have a Lamp lighted; Brethren, There was enery morning daily a triming of the Lamps of the <note place="margin">Exod. 30. 7.</note> Sanctuary, and pouring oyl into them afreſh: you know, they will not continue, but go out in obſcure darkneſs, except there be a feeding of them with oyl; this we may do, and this we ought to do; and indeed, a man that exerciſeth not his Grace, is, as if he had none; neither hath the ſtrength, nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his Grace; for Habits are for Acts, and then Acts
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:115245:378"/>
ſtrengthen the Habits again. The Learned <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, A wiſe man differed nothing from a fool, if he exerciſed not his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and ſaith the Wiſeman, <hi>Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wiſe;</hi> the Act is that chiefly commanded, and that chiefly rewarded of God; the exerciſing of Grace, and that whereby it groweth, which is the main thing here I mind: Hath not every day its evil ſufficient to it? now if faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e not <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 34.</note> upon the wing, what a condition is that ſoul in? therefore exerciſe it: uſe legs, and have legs And ſo for love; put it forth, exerciſe it toward the Lord Jeſus daily, and toward his people, that is the way to grow. Brethren, how do benummed limbs that have no feeling nor ſtrength, gather ſtrength, but by rubbing, and chaſing, and exerciſing of them? though a mans legs be ſo benummed, falling for a ſtep or two, he can ſcarce ſet them to the ground, yet uſe them a little, and they will come to themſelves again: If Merchants money lie ſtill, it is a dead thing, it increaſeth not; but they muſt turn it up and down, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it, uſe it, and exerciſe their trade with it, and it groweth. And truly I am perſwaded, it is the great reaſon we are many of us ſo weak as we are, we lie complaining and making ſad moan before the Lord of our weakneſs, and yet are careleſs in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Grace wherein we pretend we would grow: <hi>The deſire of the ſlothful killeth him; for his hands refuſe to labour;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 12. 25.</note> we may mourn our ſelves away off our legs, and ſpend our days in lamentable complainings, and ſhall never be the better, except we put forth into act, what we have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; if we be not faithful in trading with a little, will he give us more? action and motion increaſe heat: if you ſee a poor creature lie ſtarving, ready to periſh for want of fire, his legs are ſtiff, cannot hardly move them, is that the way to help him? no, up to the fire, up, and exerciſe your limbs, rub them, chafe them, if you would get heat and agility into them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, See to it, that we exerciſe one as well as another: for there is ſuch a ſweet harmony and dependency of the Graces one upon another, that they do one ſtrengthen another; the acts of our Graces, do, (as I may ſay) co-operate, and ſweetly conſpire to the promoting one of another, (that is to ſay) of the acts, and theſe acts then ſtrengthen the habits. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:115245:379"/>
you ſee in an Arch, one ſtone ſtrengthens another, take away one of them, and all the reſt are ready to fall upon your head; and therefore the Apoſtle exhorts ſo earneſtly, <hi>That they ſhould add to Faith, Temperance,</hi> &amp;c. not as if they could add <note place="margin">2 Pet 1. 5. to 12.</note> one habit to another, for they are infuſed together, but the acts are to be added one to another; <hi>For if ye do theſe things,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>then ye ſhall not be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: yea, you ſhall never fall: yea, you ſhall have an abundant entrance into the everlaſting kingdom;</hi> The ſtrength of a building, you know, lies not in the ſtrength of one piece, but in the due compacting of it, and joyning part to his part; if there be never ſo ſtrong beams, if the other parts be weak, the rafters, the wall-plates, or ſuch conſiderable pieces, and not well joyned together, the building is weak, and will eaſily fall: therefore if you would be ſtrong, and grow indeed, look that we exerciſe all the Graces of the Spirit we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received; not only Faith, nor only Love, nor only Humility, nor only Self-denial, but all: labour to act them all: and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Heavenly-mindedneſs, &amp;c. and you ſhall find, that as each Grace doth grow by the exerciſing of it ſelf, ſo by the exerciſing of them all; they will have a mutual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence each upon the other, to ſtrengthen one another: the act of Faith will ſtrengthen the acting of love, and that will ſtrengthen faith again, and ſo for the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If you would grow in Grace, You muſt be much in prayer: for a man of much Prayer, is a man of much Grace, and therefore the Prophet puts them both together: <hi>He will pour out the Spirit of Grace and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>

Firſt, Becauſe in Prayer, there is the greateſt exerciſing of Grace, of all Grace uſually, of any other ſervice we do to God: there our repentance is exerciſed, for you alwaies find the Saints in drawing nigh to God: <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> and others, that ſtill they begin with bewailing their iniquities, expreſſing their

                        <note place="margin">Gen 32. 12. &amp; v. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>do me good, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo in many other places: <hi>Remember thy Word to thy Servant, whereupon thou haſt cauſed me to hope:</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) That this doth not increaſe Faith, and ſo the acting of Love: increaſe it therefore. <hi>Luther,</hi> a man of much Prayer, was a man of much Grace, of much Courage, and Zeal, and Faith, and Diligence in the Service of God. And that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Servant of God, Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> It is ſaid of him, that ſix times a day he prayed: and ſo others: obſerve it when you will, where you ſee a growing Chriſtian indeed, follow him to his Cloſet, you ſhall find that man a man of much prayer; So <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But Secondly, There is another reaſon for it: Becauſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er doth carry the ſoul to a nearer communion with God: O it is the gaining acquaintance with God; acquaint thy ſelf with God, that thou mayſt have peace with him, and thou ſhalt <note place="margin">Iob 22. 21.</note> have proſperity: and therefore when <hi>Job</hi> diſcovered ſuch weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his impatiency, ſaith that friend of his, <hi>Surely thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrainect prayer from the Almighty;</hi> if thou didſt maintain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:115245:380"/>
with God, it would not be thus with thee. Now whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 5.</note> ſhould we go with empty veſſels, but to the fountain? whither ſhould poor, weak, wounded, lame, feeble creatures go, but to him that hath all power to heal and ſtrengthen them? God hath treaſures of grace, it is true, and he is not ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, he giveth liberally; but the treaſury is lockt, and prayer <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 5.</note> is the key, and faith the hand that turns it; we muſt to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, if we would be rich in grace, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom; which of us would be poor, if we had a warrant to go to the Treaſury, to fetch what we pleaſe? O what pains would there be, the Treaſurer ſhould have imployment enough: if God would but perſwade us it is ſo in this caſe, we ſhould viſit him more, <hi>the great Treaſurer of heaven, the Lord Jeſus, in whom all treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge are hid;</hi> yea, and of faith and all grace, <hi>for of his fulneſs we receive grace for grace.</hi> O how <note place="margin">Col. 2. 3.</note> would we ply him, give him no reſt, he would have much more of our company, but that we have ſlight perſwaſions of theſe things, and make uſe of prayer as a duty and a task many of us, and not a ſingular means of improving our graces: Brethren, were we but as much in Communion with God as <hi>David,</hi> we might have the ſtrength of <hi>David;</hi> it is but <hi>ask and have, knock and it ſhall be opened;</hi> the Spirit which works all this, will not be <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 9.</note> denyed, if you ask, and ask not amiſs, as you heard lately. God <note place="margin">Iam. 4. 3.</note> will expend willingly his treaſures of grace upon us, and pour out the fulneſs of his Spirit upon us, but he will be enquired of for theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Well then, if we would grow in grace, we muſt be much in prayer; I do believe ſome of us can ſpeak it but too experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, that when we have found corruptions prevail, and our ſelves foyled and brought under, this hath been the reaſon, we have reſtrained prayer from the Almighty; either we have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this duty, or elſe we have been ſlight and ſlubbering, ſhuffled it, if not out of doors, yet to the very door; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obſerve it, we can more eaſily find time for any thing then for prayer, every other buſineſs hath its hours to attend upon, but if any thing be neglected, it muſt be prayer, or elſe poſted over. Whereas, alas, it would no more hinder our buſineſs then our meal-times do, which muſt be had: and I know, Brethren, that ſome of us are able to ſay it, that we have ſeen when the
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:115245:380"/>
proſpering preſence of the Lord hath been with us, we have come on more, and done more in a ſhort time, then at another time, in many times as long a time; and yet ſo wretched hearts we have, that we content our ſelves with any thing in this duty, if we appear before the Lord, we think it is enough; we do not ſtrive unto prayer, and watch unto prayer, and labour by blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the green wood, that will hardly kindle, to get it on a flame, before we go out of his preſence. O <hi>Jacob</hi> would not let him go without a bleſſing: Brethren, in what a ſad manner do we many <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> times riſe off our knees, with our hearts further off from God then we came: is this to obtain a bleſſing? no, no; we muſt take pains in this work, if we would grow: the Lord perſwade our hearts.</p>
                     <p>Alas, you will ſay, you have prayed, and prayed, and yet for ought you can perceive, you grow not: To this I might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer many things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Doſt thou find that hereby thou never getteſt thy heart in a better frame? art thou never wrought up to ſome ſweet frame of heart in reſpect of faith, and love, and humility? Why here is an improving, this is the main thing in prayer; when we can find our hearts wrought up to ſuch a frame, it is the very growth it ſelf in a great part, therefore thou art miſtaken.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If thou do not find it may be ſometimes ſuch warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and notwithſtanding all the pains, thon haſt ſometimes been blowing at the coal, until thy arm ake with holding the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; and thy heart akes, and yet thou canſt not get thy faith and thy affections into a frame, but thou art as dead and dull as before. Now in ſuch a caſe obſerve it, doſt thou not gain thus much by it, to have viler, lower thoughts of thy ſelf, to ſee the neceſſity of an high-Prieſt the more feelingly; this humbleth, <note place="margin">Exod. 28. 38.</note> this emptyeth of ſelf more, and is not this a growth in grace? Yea, and no ſmall improvement.</p>
                     <p>But thirdly, If thou be put to wait for an anſwer, know, it is the excellency of faith to wait upon him, to hold out as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled all night with God. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 15. Gen. 32. Dan. 10. 12.</note> his anſwer cometh not as ſoon as he began to pray, but he muſt wait a while, he muſt go through with his duty, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the anſwer cometh; if the Lord give thee a heart to wait
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:115245:381"/>
upon him, to hang upon him, not to give him over; Brethren, you are growing, and you are not aware of it, it is no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to wait upon God. Alas, a poor ſinner in a mood ſometimes, and in a flaſh under a ſtirring Sermon, O he will go and pray, and if an anſwer come not preſently, there is an end, it dyeth; but a child of God, he waiteth upon God, he will have no nay, if he will not anſwer at one time, he will to it again and again; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſought God thrice for the removing the Thorn, before <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> he had an anſwer. And ſo <hi>Elias,</hi> ſeven times his ſervant was ſent, and brought an anſwer of nothing appearing, and at laſt <note place="margin">1 King. 18. 42.</note> but a little cloud; and his prayer was fervent too, as appears by the ſtory.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, You muſt grow upon God, knock harder; if he come not at the firſt, cry louder, cry out ſo much the more; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity will overcome him at the laſt; yea if by the delay of <note place="margin">Luk. 11.</note> an anſwer, as thou thinkeſt, thou be kept praying, and more and more fervently; there is nothing, Brethren, wherein we more grow then in prayer it ſelf, where the Lord exerciſeth us with ſuch occaſions, as put us on to ſtir up all our ſtrength to wreſtle with him. Well, the Lord perſwade our hearts to a diligence in this duty, for we are as averſe from it as from any. O how our hearts do hang back? and if the Lord perſwade us not, and by the invincible bonds of the Spirit, bind us cloſe to it, we ſhall ſee by woful experience, how quickly our ſlippery hearts will either ſhift themſelves out of it, or elſe into a formality in the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Obſerve your anſwers alſo; take heed of being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way complaining, as if we had received nothing, or were nothing grown, whereby God loſeth the glory of what he hath done for us already, this is not the way to procure more, this is the way indeed to grieve Gods Spirit, which is the Spirit of prayer; and then if he be grieved, we ſhall find a woful declining in prayer, and then our growth will go on but very ſlowly. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you pardon me for ſtanding ſo much upon this point, to preſs it upon you, I know many of you cannot but ſee the neceſſity of it; and truly obſerve it, ſince theſe times of outward proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people of God, mind it in your own caſes, lookers on may eaſily obſerve it, and ſince our hands have been ſo full of the world, if there be not a declining; and indeed I think (If I am
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:115245:381"/>
miſtaken, I ſhould be glad to be miſtaken) that this is the main thing wherein we are hurt, we are ſo upon hurries, and ſo thronged, our hearts, and heads, and hands ſo full of the world, that we cannot have thoſe times and ſeaſons to work our hearts up in this duty; it is ſad when our hearts have moſt need of pains-taking with them, as in ſuch caſes they have, that we ſhould find leaſt time to do it in: What can become of this think you?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Another help to this growth in grace will be this; Conſcientiouſly and diligently to uſe the Ordinances, all of them, as well as that of prayer; I ſpeak to that particular, becauſe it is of ſo general concernment, running along with all the reſt, for ſanctification of them to us. You heard before, that knowledge is the great means whereby our grace doth grow; it is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the underſtanding, the conſent of the will to cloſe with Chriſt, it is greater or leſſer according to the apprehenſions which the mind hath of Chriſt, of his goodneſs, his lovelineſs, the neceſſity of him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore, <hi>grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt, and whom beholding as in a glaſs, we are changed into his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 17. 2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>image;</hi> this glaſs, what is it but the Ordinances of God? O, how fat do men grow that fare deliciouſly every day? is there not great difference between feeding upon husks when the kernel is gone, and feeding upon the fineſt of the wheat? how quickly will the weakeſt man grow ſtrong, feeding upon the one; and the ſtrongeſt weak, when he feedeth upon the other? Alas, when it came to that, the Prodigal was almoſt beaten off his leggs: Why the Ordinances of God, they are a feaſt, <hi>a feaſt of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 25. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>fat things, marrow and wines upon the less well-refined; in this mountain ſhall the Lord of hoſts make to all people a feaſt of fat things, a feaſt of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well-refined;</hi> What are theſe but the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God? theſe are the green paſtures and ſtill waters, with <note place="margin">Pſal. 23.</note> theſe he promiſeth to ſatiate the ſoul of the Prieſt with fatneſs, <hi>and my people ſhall be ſatisfied with my goodneſs, ſaith the Lord: And my ſoul ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>houſe,</hi> there it is; and in the 63. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the Pſalmiſt longs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 8.</note> the enjoyment of God in his Ordinances, in his Sanctuary, <hi>O,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied with marrow and fatneſs:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 5.</note> What can be ſaid more, Brethren? Is not this the way to grow
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:115245:382"/>
fat, to increaſe? and did not God give therefore Paſtors and Teachers to diſpence the Ordinances for the edifying of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? in that place to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> Well, but all this will not do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we make uſe of theſe Ordinances; mind you, they are the fat things of the houſe of God, we muſt have them in the ſtall, in the coop, in the fold, in the houſe of God, that is to ſay, the Church of God, if we would flouriſh indeed; as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>they that are planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 92. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>in the Courts of our God;</hi> and therefore the Spouſe in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> was ſo earneſt, <hi>Shew me where thou feedeſt thy flocks, where</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>thou makeſt them reſt at noon:</hi> Alas, many poor Believers may be to ſeek where the Lord Jeſus feedeth his flocks, ſpecially in theſe daies, wherein there are ſo many pretences to the way of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which is but one; but at leaſt, me thinks this will follow from thoſe Scriptures, <hi>that the houſe of the Lord, the Courts of his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 92. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>houſe is the Church of God;</hi> therefore we ſhould inquire where the flocks are fed, that we may walk with them and among them, it is the way where the Lord Jeſus is found then ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and indeed I do deſire to pitty ſuch as yet cannot ſee this; but this is not all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is the uſe and improvement of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which is much more neceſſary then the other; <hi>deſire the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk of the Word:</hi> milk, for ſweetneſs and nouriſhing; and <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 2.</note> ſincere, without mixture of errour or humane wiſdom: Alas, Brethren, if we come not to it with deſires, get our affections up when we come to it, and look not to it that we digeſt it when we have heard it, we are not likely to grow by it: Alas, alas, no marvel we are ſo lean in our ſouls ſome of us, as if God bad in heavy diſpleaſure ſent the curſe upon us: what is the matter? we come to hear the Word, but with what affections? come reeking out of the World into it, with our heads, and hearts full of it: the ſtomack is full already, there is no room for the Word to take place in our hearts: and we are much for hearing, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt but little. Ah Brethren, this meditation upon what we hear, we are all of us ſhort in: that is the man that groweth indeed, as in the firſt <hi>Pſalm, he ſhall flouriſh that meditates day and night:</hi> For my own part, I am perſwaded, that upon a Sabbath-day, it is not ſo much how much we hear, to ſpend our whole time in it, that there is no time left for chewing upon it, for working
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:115245:382"/>
it upon the heart by meditation: No plough-man would do ſo, think he never plougheth and ſoweth enough, and never maketh uſe of the harrowing. Alas, much of it is ſtoln away, he hath little increaſe; we go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ow out of the preſence of God, and into the world again over head and ears, without any care to work the Word upon our ſouls; how can you expect to proſper in your ſouls? you may have fat purſes, but you are like to have but lean ſouls, you digeſt not your meat; a Phyſitian will tell you it is not how much you eat, but how much you digeſt, that tends to health and growth. And ſo for the other Ordinances of the Supper, <hi>there is meat indeed, and drink indeed;</hi> but do we look to it to improve that Ordinance for ſtrengtheuing of faith, to <note place="margin">Iohn 6. 55.</note> get our graces up, our appetites up, our faith, our love upon the wing when we come, to act faith and love in the Ordinance, to draw from the Lord Jeſus, to drink and drink abundantly? Alas, <hi>wiſdom hath killed her beaſts, and mixed her wine, and furniſhed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>her table among us;</hi> and we come indeed, but without wedding-garments many times, and without appetites, and ſo we are caſt <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 11.</note> out, and inſtead of receiving Chriſt, more and more of him, we are more hardened, Satan entereth into ſome poor ſouls. Ah, no marvel then if they grow not in grace. If we had not the fat things of the houſe of God, Brethren, it were ſomething, but the Lord hath not denyed them to us, his table is richly furniſhed; the dainties are the ſame, though the Maidens that are ſent forth now to call you are weak and unworthy, that ſhould not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the eſteem of the feaſt; now what can we ſay for our ſelves? if we will play with our meat, if we will not fall on when we come to it, if we matter not for digeſting it, where Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, will the guilt lie? O be humbled for that we have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this ſalvation ſo much as we have done, though it may be we have not miſt an opportunity, yet that we make no better uſe of them then we have done, that is the firſt ſtep to a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it: Do you think this vvere a pleaſing carriage of a child, vvhen he is poor, and lean, and ill-favoured, his Father provideth a rich banquet, royal dainties for him, ſetteth them before him, intreateth him to fall on, he complains of his vveak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and faintneſs, and yet vvill not eat; this is frovvardneſs, it is not pleaſing to God, vvho hath ſo richly provided for us; to hear his people complaining alvvay of their vveakneſs in faith,
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:115245:383"/>
and vveakneſs in love, and all graces of the Spirit; and though he hath provided ſuch dainties for them in his Ordinances, as never eye ſavv, nor any taſted, but a Believer, and they might be fat and flouriſhing, if they vvere not vvretchedly vvanting to themſelves; they complain, and complain, but never mind it; to eat, to feed, to improve the Ordinances for this their grovvth: I have ſpoken the more largely here, becauſe I knovv, Brethren, I knovv it is our ovvn vvretched neglect of our ſelves in this caſe, that is the great cauſe of our vvant of grovvth.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Another help ſhall be this, labour to get the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of your ſouls healed, that hinder your grovvth: it is impoſſible vvhile a man hath a Woolf in his fleſh, or a greedy vven that ſucks all the nouriſhment from the body, that he ſhould grovv: Alas, every one of us can beſt tell vvhere our diſeaſes are. Some have obſtructions betvveen the head and the heart, the paſſages are not opened, and ſo they grovv indeed in the head, but the heart is poor, and dry, and vvithered, all notion, and no affection; hovv little affection have vve the moſt of us? nothing anſvverable to vvhat vve apprehend of the riches of grace in Jeſus Chriſt, all is not vvell vvith us, Brethren. Alas, hovv many of us have ſurfeited of the vvorld and the comforts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>? and ſo our appetites are loſt to theſe dainties and fat things of the houſe of God, vvhereby we ſhould grovv up <hi>like Calves of the ſtall.</hi> O for Chriſts ſake, and as you love your ſouls, take heed of the vvorld and love of it. Ah, vve little knovv hovv cloſe it ſticks to us, and hovv indiſcernably it inſinuates it ſelf upon us? It may be we conſume all upon our luſts, make all we have received but a ſtepping-ſtone to raiſe our proud ſpirits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how apt we are to be admiring our ſelves? this was well done, and that was well done by us: inſtead of admiring rich grace to ſuch poor duſt and aſhes as we are; this dammeth up the fountain, Brethren, this provokes God to withdraw his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and preſence, and alas, what can vve do then? then vve ſee vvhat vve are. Well, if we would grow, we muſt begin at the right end, we muſt labour to get theſe luſts that do prevail, down; if a child have ſuch a diſeaſe as the Rickets, or ſome other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe upon it, you may give it all the nurſing, and tending, and feeding that can be, it will never grow uniformly, but all runs into the head. It is in vain to complain of the want of growth,
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:115245:383"/>
the way is to go to the Phyſitian, get ſome preſcription for the healing of the diſeaſe; and ſo we muſt look to it, Brethren, if any object come between the Lord Jeſus and your hearts, and ſo interrupt the ſweet and ſaving influences of Chriſt from you, you cannot grow; you ſee that ſhrubs in the Wilderneſs, that never ſee where good cometh, or plant a Tree or Plant in ſuch a dark place where the Sun never cometh, but is kept off by this or that hinderance, it will not grow; and ſo under trees that ſhade the Sun, and keep the rain from the ſeed, moſt herbs will not grow; and ſo it is in this caſe; therefore look to this Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, as ever you hope to recover your ſelves, and to grow indeed.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Labour to make ſpecial uſe of the promiſes of God, that particularly concern this matter; I know this is reducible to that former head of exerciſing-grace, and particularly the grace of faith, becauſe this is a ſpecial object whereupon the act is to be exerciſed; but for orders ſake, we ſhall put it diſtinctly by it ſelf in this place; is this the grievance of thy ſoul indeed, that thou groweſt not? Why here is a rich Treaſury in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which if it were drawn out, cannot but much further our growth.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, ſearch out theſe promiſes, they are many, I cannot give you them all, a taſte I will, to help the weak; What a ſweet promiſe is that in the firſt <hi>Pſalm?</hi> look upon it as ſuch, <hi>they ſhall be like the tree planted by the rivers of water;</hi> Brethren, nothing ordinarily kills trees more then drought, I think, and thus to have moiſture with heat, they muſt needs grow and flouriſh; therefore in that place of <hi>Job, a tree, though cut down, yet through the ſcent of water it will ſprout again:</hi> Now there is a ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to that end; and ſo, <hi>they that are planted in the houſe of the Lord, they ſhall flouriſh;</hi> this in the Text, <hi>they ſhall go forth,</hi> (it is <note place="margin">Pſal. 92. 12.</note> a promiſe) <hi>they ſhall grow up as Calves of the ſtall.</hi> And that in <hi>Hoſ. 14. 5. God will be as the dew unto Iſrael, and he ſhall grow up as the Lilly, and ſpread his roots as</hi> Lebanon; <hi>grow in rootedneſs, and grow quickly, and grow in beauty and ſweetneſs, the ſmell ſhall be as</hi> Lebanon; here the growth is ſet forth under that metaphor of a tree, or plant; the dew, you know, upon the mown graſs, maketh it ſpring again, elſe it would wither; and the corn for a time as dead under the clod, yet the dew maketh it grow up; or
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:115245:384"/>
as the corn that ſeemed to wither away, the dew refreſheth it, and maketh it revive indeed. I will not burthen your memories, take but one more, and that is in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, to them that have no might he increaſeth ſtrength, and he giveth power to them</hi>

                        <hi>that faint; to them that have no mights,</hi> the original is very empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, the plural with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as ſome note, when it is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, ſetteth forth the abundancy, the eminency or excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of any quaility or vertue, as wiſdoms for wiſdom, in many places in the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> that is to ſay, the moſt excellent wiſdom or abundance. So in the negative, it often ſignifieth the great want in an eminent degree of ſuch or ſuch a qualification, as here, <hi>ſuch as have no ſtrength;</hi> that is to ſay, very little, none at all, ſuch as faint and languiſh, then you know ſtrength is very little. So again, <hi>they are a people of no underſtandings,</hi> in the plural <note place="margin">Iſa. 27. 11.</note> number; and again, <hi>there is no ſafety, or ſalvation, or deliverance wrought in the earth:</hi> there is no deliverance at all: the meaning is not, there are not many deliverances, but there is not any at all; and ſo here, ſuch as have <hi>no mights</hi> it is in the Original, and we read ſuch as have <hi>no might.</hi> Alas they have no ſtrength, to thoſe he will increaſe might.

Sure <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when he meditated upon the Word of God, and his medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſweet to him, were not only the commands but the promiſes: theſe indeed are the honey-ſuckles to dwell upon; theſe <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 34.</note> you ſhall find much refreſhing in: break the bones if you would have the marrow in them.

of a man that is poring alway upon low things, and God is very little dwelt upon. It is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is the ground <note place="margin">Exod. 2. 11. Heb. 11.</note> of it, <hi>he waxed great,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>not only in body, but in mind and Spirit; he waxed ſtrong in Spirit, was a man of a great mind; his eye was upon him that is inviſible, the great God Jehovah Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him, who giveth being to his promiſes, keepeth Covenant with his people, and is Mighty, Almighty, can do what he will do in heaven and earth, and all deep places:</hi> This made him ſo great: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was above the fears of the Kings wrath, he cared not for it; Before indeed he was afraid and fled, he then had not had ſo much converſe with God, and contemplation of him, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, as afterward he had. Well then, you ſay your faith is weak, you know not how to get it ſtrengthened, lift up your thoughts to this great object, do but peruſe his name a little now and then, yea often, <hi>the Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful,</hi> &amp;c. See if there be not an abundance there to ſwallow up all thy doubts and fears; O thou art a miſerable <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 7.</note> creature! it is true, but he is a merciful God, and thy miſery is but the miſery of a creature, and his mercy is the mercy of a Creator, a God; and what are thy thoughts of thy miſery, when thou haſt aggravated it to the height as much as can be? they are but finite thoughts, and his thoughts of pardon and mercy, they are the thoughts of a God, infinitely above thy thoughts, either of miſery or mercy; if his thoughts of mercy and pardon were not more then ours, we were in a ſad condition, for then they would never anſwer his thoughts of our miſery, which are infinitely above ours of our own miſery. Alas, but I am the moſt vile unworthy wretch in the world, O you know not what I am; alas, is it for ſuch an one as I to believe? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo; he is gracious: O it is moſt free, infinitely free what he giveth, he looks for nothing at thy hands, only acceptance. O but ſure I have wearied out his patience, he hath waited upon me ſo long; he is long ſuffering. O but I have ſuch an abundance of ſin, my heart is ſo full: there is an abundance of goodneſs, abundantly pardon in him, yea and truth alſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas, but I ſhall never hold out, nor keep my heart with him, I ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly back-ſlide: But he it is that keepeth mercy for thouſands; O if our hearts were but much in meditation of God, his name, <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs;</hi> and this name, his works, the great

things that he hath done, how would it raiſe our ſpirits to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and how would it increaſe our love to him, and our fear of him? <hi>There is mercy with thee, that thou mayſt be feared;</hi> we ſhould <note place="margin">Pſal. 30. 4.</note> find a very great influence upon all our Graces, to increaſe them, even from the greatneſs, the fulneſs, the riches of this Object: O his Almighty Arm! whereby he laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heavens and earth, and hanged the earth upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and what then, though thou be nothing, he can lay a foundation of eternal comfort, and an heavenly Kingdom, as well as the earth upon nothing; and beſtow his riches of Grace, as well as his power and wiſdom upon nothing: therefore labour much to improve this great Object. O it will take the heart much off theſe poor little nothing vanities of the world, it will make us contented with our portion, it will arm us againſt all the fears of men and lights of the world; what will it not do, if the Lord be pleaſed but to breath upon our endeavours, in fixing our hearts upon this ſo high an Object?</p>

I do believe, Brethren, ſome of us may with thankful hearts bleſs the Lord, that ever we ſaw the faces of ſome of his people, that we have by their examples, and by their words been much quickened, much ſtirred up, much provoked; therefore if we would grow, converſe with ſuch; if thou be weak in faith, find out ſome of the people of God whom he hath made eminent, ſtrong in Faith, converſe with them; and if they be not very communicative, as ſome are more reſerved, whereby they are not ſo profitable to others, draw it out from them, dive into their experiences, how they came to that meaſure of Faith, wherein they can ſo glorifie God, and walk ſo chearfully before him. And ſo for Humility and Tenderneſs: where thou findeſt any eminent in theſe, make an improvement of them, joyn thy ſelf to them in a more ſpecial manner; labour to get ſomewhat from them, this is a ſpecial help to growth in Grace. And for knowledge of your relative State, lay together your experiences you have had of God; beg his Spirit to ſhine upon them, elſe you will ſee nothing but by his light; but a word or two more to this afterward. Thus much for the General Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>I have a double Exhortation, which is more particular: and then a word of Comfort, and ſo ſhut up all. For the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Exhortation.</p>

                        <hi>in the meaſure of every part.</hi> I doubt many of us that ſhould be as the eye to the body, have much leſs light in us then other parts of the body; and ſuch as ſhould be as the arm and hands to work, alas, are like little fingers for growth, come on poorly: How ſhould Magiſtrates grow, and Miniſters grow, and ſuch as bear an Office in the body of Chriſt? they ſhould be much more grown, their Faith ſhould be much more ſtrong then other mens, becauſe they have greater works lying upon them then <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 5.</note> other men; and who is their ſufficiency, but Jeſus Chriſt? and how is he ſtrong to any of us, but according to the meaſure of Faith? If <hi>Paul</hi> had not had a ſtrong Faith, he had never done the works of his condition with ſuch unwearied pains; no, nor <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor <hi>Joſhua; Faith it works by Love:</hi> a weak Faith can do little, and is not this the reaſon that ſome of us in theſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> alas, act ſo poorly for Chriſt? our faith is weak, and ſo our knowledge is weak: few <hi>Apolloes</hi> mighty in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, able to convince gain-ſayers, therefore the Apoſtle exhorts young <hi>Timothy to give attendence, do his diligence in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well as in Exhortation; give thy ſelf wholly to theſe things, that thy profiting may appear to all men.</hi> As <hi>Jerom,</hi> I think, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 15.</note> ſaid he did, <hi>diſcere &amp; docere,</hi> as he learned a leſſon, ſo he taught it to them; there is a double ſcore then, upon which Miniſters are to labour to grow.

                     <p>But there are others alſo that ſhould be exhorted to look to their growth, that it be proportionable to the means of Grace you have, and do enjoy, according to your time of ſtanding in the Church of Chriſt; how long haſt thou been planted in the houſe of the Lord? many years: you ſhould be Fathers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Mothers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>Deborah</hi> was; and is it ſo with you? Brethren, It is very ſad to conſider, that ſome among us that have hoary heads, found in the wayes of righteouſneſs, and have ſo long been in that way, and yet are ſo heavy, and ſo dull, and ſo ignorant, and ſo little Faith and Heavenly-mindedneſs, that there are many Chriſtians that are but of yeſterday, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip them in many things; is not this a ſhame? therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to anſwer your mercies, your experiences, your light and means you have enjoyed by your growth, for this is expected; aſſure your ſelves, there is not a Talent but ſhall be accounted for; and if you periſh not, yet you are not like to have a full reward, you will ſuffer loſs: for a Calf of the Stall to grow no fatter then another, that hath not ſuch feeding, it will not be born: to be like <hi>Pharoahs</hi> lean kine, devouring all before us, and yet be never the fatter, but as poor, and lean, as if we had never lived under a lively ſearching Miniſtry, as you of this

place for the moſt part have done; aſſure your ſelves, Brethren, your guilt is very great; to be watered every moment, and yet be as dry, and hard, as if you had never ſeen when good had come.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Another particular Exhortation ſhall be to help one another; Brethren, were we not wanting one to another in this reſpect, we ſhould be a people much more ſtrong in the Grace which is in Jeſus Chriſt. But alas, you will ſay, is this in our power to help one another to grow? all the ſupply comes from Jeſus Chriſt the Head; It is true, it doth ſo principally, <hi>Phil. 1. 19. Joh. 1. 16. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 18. But he communicates by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of inſtruments, there is a ſupply of every part, by that which every part ſupplyeth, (ſaith the Apoſtle) as you ſee the <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16.</note> ſpirits conveighed from the head to the loweſt parts, it is by mediation of the other parts between the head and the foot; before it cometh thither, it paſſeth through ſome others. I know the Lord Jeſus is not bound up to any inſtruments, he can teach by his own Spirit, yea, and always doth, ſometimes without means, ſometimes breathing in the means, and this is moſt ordinary; and therefore ſomething we muſt look to it, that we ſupply every one of us; you have heard it is the end of all Chriſtian Society to build up one another, and it is the end wherefore the Lord intruſteth us with ſuch Talents, to lay them out for the good of others, whereby our own Talents grow in the uſing, and we are inſtruments in the hand of God, to improve others; hath the Lord then: revealed himſelf to thee? thou waſt in an horrible pit, where there was no ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; thou ſunkeſt yet lower and lower: hath the Lord ſet thy feet upon the Rock? what then, wilt thou keep this alway to thy ſelf, when called to ſpeak of it? mind you, Chriſt and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>

If it be thus, that ſuch as upon whom the Lord Jeſus is ariſen, they are in ſuch a growing condition, then what ſhall I think of my ſelf? alas, I am weak, am very feeble, am at a ſtand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For anſwer, I ſhall ſay a few things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There are ſeveral ſtates and ſtatures in Chriſt, there are babes in Chriſt, and ſuch as have need of milk, and not ſtrong meat; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ye have need of milk: I could not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 13, 14.</note> 
                        <hi>ſpeak to you as to ſpiritual, but as to carnal, as to babes in Chriſt;</hi> that is to ſay, ſuch in whom the fleſh was very ſtrong and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> So the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> writeth to all the Saints under three ſtates, ſome were babes, ſome young men, in their ſtrength and vigour, ſome old men, Fathers of grown experience in the waies of Chriſt; Fathers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Mothers in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſome are but juſt entred into the School of Chriſt, ſome are of a middle form, ſome of the higheſt, ſome are but gotten within the door of the houſe of God, and happy it is for them that are but once within, for then they ſhall go further and further: Others are gone further, into the inner Chambers, and are acquainted with the Lord Jeſus in the moſt inward manner; What then, wilt thou conclude, that becauſe thou art not a man the firſt day, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, therefore thou art no child of grace? No, ſuppoſe thou art but a child, and weak, and every temptation over-turns thee, draweth thee aſide, yet remember thou art a child: though thou be not a ſtrong deeply rooted <hi>Cedar,</hi> yet thou art planted it may be lately: though yet for the time we might be men <hi>spiritual, perfect,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, to bear the wiſdom of God in a myſterie, and yet are babes; it is matter of humiliation, but not of deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another is this, that the people of God, though they are in a growing condition, yet it is not ſo to be underſtood, as that every moment they grow, they have their declining fits; trees and plants, you know, have their Winters, and children have their ſickneſſes and fits, when they are at a ſtand, though afterward haply they ſhoot out ſo much the more for it; and ſo many times the people of God do, they are under a diſtemper
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:115245:389"/>
for a while, and decline, and a man would think they were even withering and dying, but it reviveth again; many times grace in the hearts of the children of God, through corruption, are like the light of a candle ready to go out, even in the ſocket, but yet afterwards they are ſtirred up, they trim up their Lamps, ſhine more clearly and ſweetly then before: I ſay, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore thou art no child of God, becauſe it is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thee as it hath been: thou haſt found thy heart much more large toward God, much more tender, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Brethren, we may loſe our firſt love, and grow cold and dead, yea and it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 4.</note> for a child of God to dye under ſuch a condition, and yet not miſcarry in the main, though it is not ſo comfortable for him, nor ſo honourable for God; therefore take heed of concluding your ſtate by what you feel at preſent; it may be ſome tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath prevailed, ſome diſtemper is upon thee, therefore thou muſt heal that, get that removed, and thou ſhalt ſee thou wilt grow.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Even then thou mayſt be growing in the root, for there muſt be a time for that, Brethren: when we are leaſt in our ſelves, and ſee we are nothing, can do nothing, ſpecially being ſenſible of it: O how this humbles us! we are no loſers by this, our roots cannot be too much ſpread, nor the foundation too much ſtrengthened; this driveth us the more to Chriſt, maketh us the more ſeriouſly inquiſitive after our ſtate, to be ſure to look to our grounding and eſtabliſhing upon him, and this will fit us for further growth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In the next place know this, that even then, when there is nothing appearing, thou thinkeſt thou art nothing, haſt nothing, all ſeems to be withered, no fruit appears, even then the Lord ſeeth the root in the ground: though wee ſee it not, he takes notice of it, and is pleaſed with it; though <hi>Jobs</hi> friends think he was a withered branch, cut off from Communion with God, yet he had the root of the matter within him: come into a garden in the ſummer, how pleaſant and how glorious it is furniſhed with all variety of plants and flowers; in the winter there is nothing appeareth, they are under ground; but now the Gardener, he knoweth what roots he hath there, though they appear not, and he can tell you what plants he ſhall have ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in the ſpring, and he is choice and tender of the places
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:115245:389"/>
where they grow, as if they did appear and put forth; the Lord knoweth, if there be but the root of the matter in thee, if never ſo ſmall, if right, he knoweth it, and he knoweth the thoughts afar off, long before we think them, he knoweth our works afar off, <hi>I know</hi> Abraham, <hi>he will command his houſe after him, to keep</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 2. Gen. 18. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>my Commandments;</hi> the Lord knoweth what ſinners would be if they lived, and therefore many times cuts them off; and he knoweth what his people would be and will be, though for the preſent under a temptation, under a cloud, and ſeem to be all withered and dryed up. Is this nothing? Brethren, he knoweth what root, what ſeed he hath ſown in the heart, and that it will put forth; Say not then, ſurely thou art not regarded of God, becauſe thou doſt not appear to thy ſelf to grow at every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Alas, but you will ſay, if I did come on thus and thus, as ſuch an one doth, it were ſomething like. I anſwer, it is good to follow the pattern of fruitful and growing-Chriſtians; but what if God will not give thee that meaſure that he giveth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? What if thou be but as a little finger in the body, and ſuch an one is as an arm? canſt thou expect then to grow as much as ſuch an one? is not he wiſe, and knoweth beſt what meaſure is good for us? Secondly, For that thy deſires are yet higher then thy growth, it is good for thee, deſire growth as much as thou wilt; and I could wiſh your deſires were more earneſt, for then your endeavours would be more anſwerable then they are; but if thy deſires be in good earneſt, and thou makeſt it thy work to grow and come on, and yet canſt not reach thy deſires; ſhould this diſcourage? No; thou ſhouldſt be encouraged, and bleſs the Lord that thy deſires are kept up after more and more; that you ſay not <hi>ſufficit,</hi> for this is the way appointed of God for growth, that ſtill the deſires of his people ſhould be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and for my own part, I think there is not a better ſign of a growing, then an eager ſtomack, except it be a diſeaſe, which can hardly be in ſpirituals, though a man may deſire alſo to hear more then he digeſts. See, the Church was following Chriſt, and yet ſaith ſhe, <hi>Draw me, I will run;</hi> We go after thee, but we <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 4.</note> would run.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Growth is not ſenſible, is not viſible until afterward; that degree which is in the motion is not perceived until after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:115245:390"/>
you ſee trees, and plants, and children, they have grown, but if you ſit by them, ſet your eyes upon them to ſee them grow, and cannot diſcern it, and ſhould complain, alas, they grow not; would you not bewray much weakneſs? So it is in this caſe: A Merchant, it is true, caſts up his daily accounts, what cometh in, what goeth out, but he doth take the ſtate of his condition but now and then: So ſhould we, though daily we examine our ſelves, how we gain or loſe, ſuch a day, in all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; yet to examine the ſtate of our growth in the general every day, is to little purpoſe, as I told you before; <hi>the Kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation; both the Kingdom of God in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 110. Hoſ. 14. Mar. 4. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>the adminiſtration of it groweth inſenſibly, as the falling of the dew from the womb of the morning; thou haſt the dew of thy youth, and God will be as the dew to Iſrael.</hi> So the ſeed ſown, is ſaid to grow while he that ſowed it ſleepeth, he knoweth not how; it is vain to obſerve it while it is growing, but afterward it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Though it may be thou grow not in affections ſo much as thou thinkeſt, thou maiſt grow notwithſtanding in the underſtanding, and in the will, in the main part of the ſoul; for the paſſions indeed, they are the loweſt part, and yet we are apt to place moſt in them. O if we can be but ſo and ſo affected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> a rapture of joy, a melting into tears, it may be with many of us, is more then a ſweet yielding Spirit to the will of Jeſus Chriſt; this is a great miſtake. It may be heretofore, when the matter was new to thee, thou waſt more affected with it paſſionately then now thou art; as you ſee new things do affect our nature moſt, which, as ſome well obſerve, is the reaſon wherefore chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are taken and affected with every thing at the firſt, becauſe every thing is new to them, which men are not, except with things which are ſo to them. Beſide, as the blood groweth cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in old age, and the ſpirits are not ſo agile, there cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that vigour of affection in old perſons, and weak, and ſick perſons, as in young<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſons, this is the caſe. Beſides, theſe paſſions they are wonderful unconſtant, and there is no judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by them at all, they do ſo ſtrangely ebb and flow; ſome mens natures are more paſſionate, apt to grieve, to be affected with every little thing, and there a little matter will ſet their paſſions afloat; others are more ſtock-like, it is much that
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:115245:390"/>
moveth their affection: Now a little thing will not move them. But ſuppoſe that thou doſt not grow in theſe ſo much, how is thy underſtanding? doſt thou grow there, abound in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? before thou waſt empty, knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt very little; now thou haſt a Treaſury of knowledge, and thou goeſt on herein: do we grow in our judgements, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? doſt thou not value Chriſt and grace at a higher rate then before, counting all things droſs in compariſon of him? doſt thou not cleave to the Lord with more full and ſtrong purpoſe of heart then before? this is growth indeed to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, If thou grow not in bigneſs, doſt thou grow in ſweetneſs? this is growth Brethren. At firſt, Chriſtians run up <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> to a great height, a pace they grow in knowledge, but afterwards they grow in the ſanctifiedneſs of that knowledge: Alas, when they know much, they know little as they ought: Now thou comeſt to know it as thou oughteſt, ſo as to humble thee, ſo as to endear thee to Chriſt more: Now thou art more peaceable, more apt to forgive, leſs cenſorious, haſt not ſo much of that dividing ſpirit that formerly thou hadſt: doſt thou grow, I ſay, in ſweetneſs therefore, if thou grow ſo? ſo much in heat? this is the fatneſs and the ſweetneſs of the growth, and there is great comfort in this.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, In the laſt place, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of the Covenant of God, and his family, <hi>though he make it not to grow,</hi> yet ſaith he, <hi>this is all my hope, and all my ſalvation;</hi> yet he truſted in him. <note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 5.</note> It is God that maketh it to grow (Brethren) and he is free, and rich in his influences; and what if he make it not to grow for a time? what then? wilt thou queſtion all his work in thee? No, no, but rather labour to believe it away: Here are many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, truſt in him, though he make it not to grow; hang upon him ſtill for this growth, and if he ſtill make it not to grow, yet ſtill make this thy ſalvation, his Covenant: if he ſee not ſuch a meaſure fit for thee, be humbled for what thou findeſt to be the obſtruction, but caſt not away thy confidence, though he make it not to grow: and thus much for this.</p>

Well, our Saviour now going to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples upon the Sea, and when he came into the ſhip, it was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with aſhore; O how ſweetly and ſwiftly doth any work of Chriſt or for Chriſt go on when he himſelf is with us; the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude they follow him, their bellies all this while were their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, their gods and their guides; <hi>ye follow me becauſe of the loaves,</hi> ſaith our Saviour; and therefore he takes this occaſion to ſtir them up, <hi>to ſeek for that food that periſheth not;</hi> they were ſenſible of the hunger of their bellies, and were taken with his power to make ſuch proviſion for the body, even where there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon. O, but their poor ſouls were in a ſtarving condition! and they were not ſenſible of this; and therefore our Saviour endeavours to raiſe their apprehenſions ſomewhat higher, ſpending much of the Chapter afterwards, in ſetting forth himſelf, the true, the ſpiritual Shew-bread, or bread of faces, if they had but ſtomacks and appetites ſuitable to the neceſſities of their poor periſhing ſouls. But alas, <hi>they had not aſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye, nor a hearing ear, nor a believing heart;</hi> when they heard of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> bread, <hi>of which, if they did eat, they ſhould never hunger; Lord give us this bread,</hi> ſaid they, but they knew not well what they ſaid; for alas, this bread was tendered to them, but they had no mind to it; as the fountain of water was near to <hi>Hagar,</hi> but ſhe ſaw <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 15.</note> it not; ſo the bread of life was now offering himſelf to them, but they knew it not, and therefore our Saviour reproveth them, <hi>you alſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have ſeen me, and yet believe not; this bread is ſpiritual, I am the bread, but ſpiritually underſtood, for it is the Spirit that quickeneth, but the fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> (ſaith he)

even to his own Diſciples, who were already ſtumbled at this Sermon of his, concerning eating his fleſh and drinking his blood; but (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>ye believe not;</hi> that is to ſay, ye will not take of this bread, eat of it, receive and apply the benefit of my death, and reſurrection, and aſcention, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and all I underſtand by this bread in a ſpiritual ſenſe, whereby the ſoul is nouriſhed to eternal life, and this was a ſad ſymptom unto them, that they were not belonging to Gods purpoſe of grace, they had little ground to conclude it as yet; for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>all that the Father hath given me ſhall come;</hi> as yet ye believe not, ye have not come to me with hungry ſouls, though you have followed me with hungry bellies for the loaves; but if you belong to the election, if you be of thoſe the Father hath given to me from eternity, you ſhall come, <hi>and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Well, but this hearing and learning of the Father, is as much as being taught of God, which in order goeth before the converſion of a ſinner, or his coming to Chriſt, whatever it be in time; and if this Scripture would prove the needleſneſs of Ordinances now to grown Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, it would prove it as well to new Converts, for theſe are taught of God as well as grown Believers, or elſe they could never come to Chriſt; and if they be not neceſſary, neither for the one nor for the other, to what end did the moſt wiſe Governor of the world and of the Church appoint them for? nothing? but that by the by. I ſay, this is as much as being taught of God, as the Evangeliſt ſheweth in the 45. verſe, bringing that Prophecy, <hi>they ſhall be all taught of God;</hi> and making this inference from it, <hi>whoſoever therefore heareth and learneth of the Father cometh unto me:</hi> Again, this being taught of God, it is nothing elſe but the drawing of the Father, as you have it in the 44. verſe, <hi>no man cometh unto me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him;</hi> it is written in the Prophets, <hi>they ſhall be all taught of God;</hi> therefore I conceive that this hearing and learning may be underſtood thus.</p>

Firſt, By hearing, I underſtand the uſual means of ſalvation, and working of Faith, and that is the Word of Chriſt, the Goſpel of Salvation. <hi>How can they believe in him of whom they</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>have not heard?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>And Faith cometh by hearing,</hi> and therefore it is called the word of Faith, <hi>and therein the righteouſneſs of God is revealed from Faith to Faith</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: wherein? even in the Goſpel preached, of which the Apoſtle was not aſhamed: by the preaching thereof poor <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> creatures were brought to believe in the Lord Jeſus: and ſo the righteouſneſs of Chriſt was revealed therein to them, and conveighed to them by Faith. I know not what courſe the Lord holds with the Heathen, to whom the Goſpel is not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men like themſelves, nor hath the Lord given us a poſitive account of his dealing with them, and therefore I meddle not with it; but this is the ordinary way of Gods working of Faith in them who come to be capable of hearing the Word, and underſtanding of it; therefore uſually, if God intend to bring <note place="margin">Ioh 12. 32. The brazen Serpent lifted up. Num. 21. 6.</note> on ſuch a ſoul, or ſuch a ſoul, he will bring them under the Word, either to dwell under it, or the Word accidentally to be among them. It is obſervable, that in <hi>Pauls</hi> converſion, only he himſelf heard the voice of him that talked with him, not the men that were with him, becauſe God intended this viſion for <hi>Paul,</hi> and not for them; they are ſaid in another place, to hear a voice, but not the voice of God, but the voice of <hi>Paul,</hi> and wondered to hear him ſpeak, and heard no body ſpeaking to <note place="margin">Acts 9. 7. &amp; chap. 22. 9.</note> him: hearing then of God, is hearing him ſpeak in his Word, for it is he that ſpeaks therein.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By the hearing may alſo be underſtood yet further, ſome whiſperings and motions, and ſecret workings of his Spirit, which many a man hath many times in hearing of the Word; the Spirit paſſeth by, and breatheth in the Word upon one ſoul, and upon another, putting on the ſoul to faſten upon ſuch a a truth, or ſuch a truth, as ſweet and precious; inwardly ſpeaking to their underſtandings, that they are ſure the men concerned in ſuch a threatning, in ſuch a promiſe; and this is a <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 3.</note> part of Gods ſtriving by his Spirit with rebellious ſinners that do not believe nor obey. Now this is a more inward hearing then the former; ſome ſit under the ſame Sermon, and the Sword of the Spirit maketh no more entrance upon them, then
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:115245:394"/>
upon a brazen wall; and it muſt be a ſharp ſword indeed, that muſt divide an heart of ſtone: many a blow is laid at a ſturdy Oak, an old grown ſinner, before his heart beginneth ſo much as to ſhake: and this is the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Then for the learning, which is the main thing, which goeth before the coming to Jeſus Chriſt; this I take to to be when the Lord not only by his Meſſengers maketh his word plain before us, lays it to our Conſciences, as the Ax to the root of the Tree, but when he opens our underſtandings, plucks open our eyes to behold the light, teacheth us indeed; he teacheth a poor ſoul in ſpecial theſe two or three things.</p>
                     <p>1. That he is loſt, a ſon of perdition for ought he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: many a poor Creature in the Ship, like <hi>Jonas,</hi> though ready to ſink; he was aſleep, if the Ship had ſunk, it had been all one to him; they come and awake him up, thou ſleeper, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14.</note> doſt thou not ſee thou art ſinking, thou art dying, thou art pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing? ſo the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus takes a poor, ſleepy, dead ſinner by the underſtanding, tels him, thou art the man condemned, wrath abideth upon thee particularly; what doſt thou mean? wilt thou have the flames of hell about thy ears, before thou wilt ſtir a foot? what, wilt thou bring the blood of Jeſus upon thy head? thus the Spirit cometh, and ſhaketh a poor ſoul out of his ſleep in ſin, he never dreamed what his condition was before; this is the Spirits convincing a man of ſin, ſetteth his ſins in order before him, ſetteth a man upon the ſearch into his condition, then repreſents all his ſins in their bloody guilt and condemning nature: every one of them with <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 10.</note> a mouth like hell, ready to ſwallow him up: this is a part of the cords of a mans convictions.</p>
                     <p>2. It teacheth him yet further, now no longer to lie ſecurely in that condition: if he continue here, he muſt periſh: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now he beginneth to look about him: O what ſhall I do? to whom ſhall I turn my ſelf? is there no hope of pardon, no mercy for me? <hi>O what ſhall we do</hi> (ſaid they in <hi>Acts 2.) to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 2. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>be ſaved?</hi> if the Ship be ſinking, now it is time to look about for a Plank, a Maſt, ſomething to lay hold upon, ſomething to ſtop the leak; if now Brethren, granadoes be caſt into the ſoul, and be broken, and tearing all to pieces, the very flames of hell have caught hold upon ſuch a poor creature, there is no
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:115245:395"/>
delay; now the Spirit of the Lord working with a mans natural principle for ſelf-preſervation, puts him on to enquire for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to quench it; now he beginneth to cry out, fire, fire, in his ſoul; O he cannot hold it!</p>
                     <p>3. It teacheth yet further, and the poor ſoul learneth this alſo effectually, that there is no help for him in the creature, neither in himſelf, nor in any other; if he take the quinteſcence of all his works, which we uſually before have a high eſteem of, and temper them together, alas, they will not make a balſom for this wound; now all the Spirits in all the Creatures in the world, if they could be extracted, I mean the comforts that might ariſe from the enjoyment of them, would not keep the poor languiſhing ſoul from fainting and dying, waters of the fulleſt cup, let them overflow never ſo much; if a man have rivers of pleaſures in the enjoyment of creature-comforts, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, relations, parts, learning, gifts, whatſoever they be, alas, the poor creature is now taught, they will not quench this ſpark that is gotten into the conſcience; I mean, they will not allay the trouble of his ſpirit, will not heal the wounds of his ſpirit, ſo that now he knoweth not what to do; the Hart, they ſay, if ſmitten with an arrow, goeth to her herb to cauſe the arrow to fall out; and other creatures being poyſoned, ſtung, ſick, diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, run to their cure by a natural inſtinct; but now, when God hath ſhot this arrow into a poor ſoul, it wounds too deep, ſticks too faſt for the teeth of any creature to pluck it out, or for the vertue of any creature; yea they are ſo far from healing, that rather the conſideration of them, are as oyl to the flame, to vex and wound ſo much the more: well, this is much to be taught; he that learneth this effectually, and not in the notion only, goeth far; there are many convinced of their wounds, their bleeding, dying condition, but they imagine there is help to be had in ſomething elſe: they run to a duty of their own, as if a day of faſting would make amends for all, run to this or that, unfaithful Shepherds that will daub and heal them deceitfully, get it skinned over a little, and ſo the world will do it, building, and planting, and marrying, and drinking, and paſtimes, theſe may skin over the wound, but it heals not; and miſerable is the condition of poor creatures, ſo deluded; but now they that are taught of God, and learn, they learn this
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:115245:395"/>
effectually and practically, that there is nothing in the creature that can do it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They learn this alſo, that though all the world be <note place="margin">Now the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

O when the Lord ſetteth a ſoul in his ſight, and looks upon him as a conſuming fire, with his eyes as a flaming fire, ready with a <note place="margin">Iaa. 25. 4.</note> ſight of him to devour him, and he cannot get out of his ſight. O now the world, all their comforts will not skreen them from his eyes: but what will? only the Lord Jeſus, he can be a cooling ſhadow, to ſhadow us from this ſcorching heat, and this the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 8.</note> of the Lord perſwadeth the ſoul; we all of us will talk of it, O Jeſus Chriſt is our help and hope, and look for ſalvation in no other, but in him; it is grown now ſo cuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>omary a thing among us, that it is in every mans mouth; but to how few hath the Lord ſpoken this to our hearts that thus it is?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Again, another thing that we are taught of God, before we come to Jeſus Chriſt, is this: that he is willing to let out of his oyntments to heal: he is willing to expend that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> upon us, elſe the ſoul will never come to him: it is that that keepeth off many a ſoul a long time; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord perſwadeth the poor ſoul, that though he hath <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 4.</note> been an enemy to Jeſus Chriſt, and grieved him, and torn his wounds, and rent his fleſh with horrid oaths and blaſphemies, trampled his blood under foot, have been never ſo horrid a tranſgreſſor, yet he perſwadeth him that the Lord Jeſus is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive ſinners without exception, if they come to him. Suppoſe there was a Phyſitian, whoſe skill were ſo great, and his ſtore of Medicines ſo inexhauſtible, and ſoveraign, and his heart ſo large, as that he proclaimeth to all, that whoſoever is wounded, though never ſo deſperately; whoſoever is ſick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death, one of the Stone, another of the Gout, another of the plague, I will cure you all; O then, if poor creatures did believe this, were perſwaded of it, they would come, and not before; O ſaith one, mine is a plague ſore, and it is paſt cure; mine is an hereditary diſeaſe, ſaith another, and ſo far gone, I cannot be cured; they come not, and periſh; O mine is ſuch
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:115245:396"/>
a diſeaſe; it will coſt more pains and charge then I think he will be willing to be at to cure, and therefore he cometh not to him, and ſo periſheth; juſt ſo it is in this caſe, except the Lord do ſecretly inſinuate it into the ſoul, how willingly the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus writ it upon his Spirit, and that the Lord Jeſus is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to heal, to ſave the ſoul that will not come to him; but thus much for theſe things, which in the order of nature go before a coming to Chriſt; now for the acts wherein it formally conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, when the heart is thus made ſenſible of what is in himſelf working to death, and what is not in himſelf, nor in any other creature to ſave, then I ſay, there is from the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart, how able and willing the Lord Jeſus is, there ariſeth a deſire in the ſoul after the Jeſus Chriſt; not as if this did flow or were produced by the former apprehenſions of a mans own neceſſities of Chriſt, and of the fulneſs in him, as a fountain, and the openneſs of the fountain, which is ſealed to none that come; for alas, one grace, though never ſo habitual and deeply rooted, cannot produce another, no not faith it ſelf produce love, but the Spirit which works faith, works love in our hearts alſo; much leſs then, can a conviction be the cauſe of a conviction, or a turning unto the Lord Jeſus; but it is the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, when he hath ſo opened the eyes of an <hi>Hagar</hi> to ſee the fountain opened that was near her before, but ſhe ſaw it not; and let us ſee that our bottle is dryed up, and all other hopes in the creature periſhed, then I ſay, the Spirit inclineth the Will to come to Jeſus Chriſt; then he works ſweetly, though ſtrongly, an inclination, a deſire after him. It is not in theſe things as in nature, an ordinary providence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the actings of the creature, according to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. When <hi>Hagar</hi> ſaw the fountain, ſhe needs no further perſwaſion to go unto it, her neceſſity was a cord ſtrong enough to draw her, yea a weight, a ſpring to carry her ſwiftly to it; but alas, when we ſee the bottles dryed, ſee that the creatures ſay, <hi>it is not in us to be had:</hi> and ſee there is a fountain opened, yet ſuch is the waywardneſs of our hearts, yea ſuch the enmity in our hearts againſt the Lord Jeſus, though the ſtreams of his love toward us were as ſtrong as death, that we will not yet come to him, we had rather ſit down, as you ſee ſome ſullen creatures taken from their damms, will rather periſh then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:115245:396"/>
food at the hand of man, ſuch an indiſpoſition and averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to man there is; and ſo it is in this caſe, except the Lord Jeſus come in by another act of his Spirit, and bow the will, and make us deſirous of himſelf; O then, when this act of power is put forth, the ſoul beginneth to long, to deſire after Jeſus Chriſt, O that I had him, O that I might but have a ſight <note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 3. Luk. 19. 4. Pſal. 119. 20. Cant. 2. 5. Pſal. 42. 2.</note> of him; then there is getting upon the tree by a low <hi>Zacheus,</hi> then there is an aſcending in this Ordinance and that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and everywhere the deſire of the ſoul is for Jeſus Chriſt; this is a coming, for the affections are to the ſoul as the feet to the body, that which carryeth the ſoul in and out in all, to this object, or from that object; O then when ſhall I come and appear before him!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In this coming to Chriſt is included a paſſing all other ſtands and reſts on this ſide Jeſus Chriſt; many a poor ſoul cometh near to Chriſt, and to the Kingdom of God, and yet falls ſhort of him; as an arrow not drawn up to the head, falls ſhort of the mark, and there it ſticks where it faſtens, goeth no further: So here, ſome upon their convictions, the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their conditions, run to this Ordinance, to that; to this duty, to that; as things that of themſelves, as performances, ſhould give reſt to them: and alas, they are but bottles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if Chriſt be not in them, and there found to a ſoul, and ſought by a ſoul, they are dry and ſapleſs; when many a rich man in hearing a Sermon, hath a qualm cometh over his heart, and he beginneth to be a little ſick of ſin, which the Word hath lanced, and it ſtrikes to the heart; what doth he do? alas, he chears himſelf with this, Surely if I were ſuch a ſinner, God would not regard me, God would never have bleſſed me as he hath done, therefore this is but a fooliſh melancholly fit: The drunkard and the wanton can eat, and drink, and ſing, and dance down twenty ſuch pills as theſe; though they troubled them a little at the firſt, they make a ſhift to claw it off; The civil good-natured man, though he ſee and know himſelf to be a ſinner, yet he is none of the worſt, he doth much good in the place where he is; yea, he prayeth, and heareth, and keepeth Sabbaths, and thinks this ſhall make amends for all, and ſo walks in the ſparks of his own kindling; but alas, the end of theſe things will not be reſt, <hi>for they ſhall lie down in ſorrow, and ſhall</hi>

                        <hi>have it from the hand of God too; &amp; then, who can reſiſt it when lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, or heal his blow when it is given?</hi> I tell you, Brethren, I doubt this is the grand impoſture of moſt of our hearts, for it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, but we muſt ſometime or another be convinced our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by nature is very ſad and forlorn, and men are not men, if they be not carried forth to ſeek ſome courſe-for their eſcaping; and how few alas, reach the Lord Jeſus? therefore we mnſt needs ſtick ſomewhere ſhort of him. Ah, the Lord grant that none of us, who think upon more probable grounds then others, and others think ſo of us too, that we are ſuch as come to Jeſus Chriſt; that we ſit not down in any thing on this ſide him, for if we do we periſh: Therefore I ſay, the ſoul that cometh to Jeſus Chriſt, goeth out of all; alas, if he have never ſo much of the world, profits, pleaſures at will, he is as rich as another, <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13.</note> and hath as much content in relations ſuitable to his hearts as another, and it may be as much in praying, faſting, hearing, uſing of the Ordinances, as another; and yet all this is nothing to him, ſatisfieth him not, he cannot take up with it, they are but husks, they will not ſatisfie, however they may fill.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is a coming unto Jeſus Chriſt, it is not a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards him, but a coming to him; this is builded much what upon the willingneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to receive them; this deſire after him, haply more fitly may be annexed to the power of Chriſt to ſave to the utmoſt. O when the ſoul knoweth this, <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> O then that I had him, that I were in him; but now when the ſoul cometh to underſtand, is perſwaded he is willing to receive all that come: Well then, the Spirit quickning, perſwading; the ſoul reſolves, I will venter upon him, I will go and caſt my ſelf upon him, and bear my ſelf upon him, hang all my weight upon him; and this alſo he is taught of God, this is impreſt upon his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, this is the drawing nigh, yea not nigh to him, but coming unto him; this is the touch of faith, if it be never ſo ſecret, a touch of faith that others take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <note place="margin">Mat. 14. 36.</note> of; yea, that a poor ſoul through the fears and troubles that are upon him, and earneſtneſs of Spirit to have all quieted and cleanſed, and done away forthwith, thinketh he doth not, he hath not touched the Lord Jeſus, yet he may have touched him, and be come unto him, if he be carried out in his affections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and in truth beyond all; count all as nothing, as dung and <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8, 9.</note>

                     <p>Fourthly, He cometh to him with words too, at leaſt heart-words, if not words of confeſſion (I will wrap up <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 1.</note> theſe things as faſt as I can, I doubt I ſtay too long in the firſt part) words of confeſſion, and words of petition; of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, ſo the poor Prodigal, <hi>I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> O I have <note place="margin">Lok. 15. 19.</note> ſinned from the womb, conceived in ſin, born in iniquity, I have ſinned before thee, not regarding thy all-ſeeing eye, deſperately, againſt light, againſt knowledge, againſt mercy, againſt the blood of the Lord Jeſus, againſt all that grace whereby thou haſt waited upon me to be gracious, <hi>O I am no more worthby to</hi>

Ah, ſo it is with many a poor ſoul, he deſerveth not to be owned by the Lord, nor by any of his; if he fall upon me as a mill-ſtone, to grind me to power, he doth me no wrong.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, With words of petition to him, that he would have mercy upon us, that he would pardon, and heal, and give himſelf to us indeed, that he would be our God; a ſoul that is throughly ſenſible of his want of Chriſt, cryeth our after him; not with a ſtill liſtleſs deſire, but the heart maketh a noiſe unto the Lord, O give me Chriſt or elſe I dye; Lord Jeſus ſave <note place="margin">Gen. 13. 1. Luk 8. 24.</note> my poor ſoul, elſe I periſh; O ſin is ready to ſwallow me up; O the grave and hell are ready to ſhut their mouths upon me, ſave me or elſe I periſh, as they to Chriſt; the waves and bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of thy diſpleaſure are the ſhaking and breaking of many poor ſouls. O what mone many times will a poor ſoul that wants the Lord Jeſus make to him, <hi>lead me to the rock that is higher then I:</hi> O how he ſucks the promiſes, and every argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he can fetch out of them, he cometh with it, and laies it before the Lord, yea every letter of his name, <hi>the Lord, the

                     <p>Fifthly and laſtly, it is a cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, as he is offered, not by the halves, <hi>Chriſt is not divided,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, his righteouſneſs from his holineſs, nor his holineſs from his righteouſneſs; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>as you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk in him:</hi> O here many are <note place="margin">Col. 2. 6.</note> deceived, they would have Chriſt, but they will not be his; what a ſtrange unreaſonable thing is this, they would have the benefit of having him to be their Father, and be heirs, but they will not be ſubject as children; they would have all the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, <note place="margin">Pſal. 7. 23. Can. 2. 16.</note> and priviledges, peace, and proſperity of ſoul under him as a King, but they will not ſubmit themſelves to him as King and Lord; they would have him for an husband, and yet will not obey. O this is not a coming to Jeſus Chriſt, this is to ſerve our ſelves upon him; but the Lord Jeſus will ſearch this out, keep it as cloſe as we can from others, that they may think well of us, yea from our ſelves alſo, through the juglings of our hearts, we cannot keep it from him, he knoweth where there is a ſoul that takes the Lord Jeſus without any reſerve and equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; <hi>Aug. Is non modo durus,</hi> was no good ſign of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at that time, though afterward it was otherwiſe, for we find he acknowledgeth it, &amp; bewails it; the Lord grant that the doom of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> reach not to many of our ſouls, for pretending to give up the whole to Jeſus Chriſt, and yet reſerve part to our ſelves; yea, pretend to come to Jeſus Chriſt, and yet divide him. Well, you ſee Brethren, what this coming to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is; it is not then every one that ſaith, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> nor cryeth out, <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> that
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:115245:398"/>
come to Chriſt; it is not the having a few faint wiſhings and wouldings, which like the untimely birth of a woman, like a bable, periſh and never appear more, that is a coming to Chriſt; it is not your ſucking ſweetneſs from your own duties, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, Ordinances, priviledges, any thing ſhort of Chriſt that is coming to him. Dear Lord Jeſus, how many of us loyter, and take up our reſt ſhort of thee? It is not a bare acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our being ſinners in the general, and a <hi>Lord have mercy</hi> from the mouth, without any ſenſe of our condition upon our hearts, that is a coming to Jeſus Chriſt. It is not a deſire to be pardoned alone, for then none of us ſhould miſcarry; and O that it were ſo if the Lord ſee it good: But it is the earneſt breathings of a poor, broken, loſt ſoul, the moan of a poor wounded creature, the pantings of a poor languiſhing heart after Jeſus Chriſt, a making him alone our ſtay, a reſigning our ſelves to him, that is the coming to him here ſpoken of, and ſuch a ſoul he will not caſt out. Pardon me, I know I am too ſlow for the acute, and I wiſh I be not as much too ſwift for many of us that are dull of underſtanding, ſlow of heart to underſtand and believe theſe things; the condition of people now a daies, I take it, doth call upon us to ſpeak oftner and more fully to beat it upon poor creatures, the nature of this coming to Jeſus Chriſt, then any other thing; as I find ſtill in all the preachings of the Apoſtles, they did endeavour to make good that truth moſt neceſſarily, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, becauſe that was moſt oppoſed in thoſe daies; ſo now this being granted by all, and already, that we are ſinners, the main work lies herein, to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive poor creatures, who think all is well enough with them; and therefore I am the more large in this part, and indeed much more large then I thought to be.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing then is, what is meant by this not caſting out, wherein lies the marrow, and fatneſs, and ſweetneſs of this Scripture; and indeed I think the whole Book of God doth not afford a more refreſhing word, a more eſtabliſhing word to a poor weak creature then this is: O then let us ſee what it is!</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he will not caſt him out, he will not caſt him out of his heart, that is the firſt: not out of his love, for we muſt know this all of us, this day, which may be a comfort to many a

doubting, trembling, miſgiving-heart, that if the Lord Jeſus have done this in us and for us, hath given us thus to come to him in truth: for degrees of the things formerly ſpoken of, I intend not them as to make up the nature of our duty, it may be in a weaker and a ſtronger meaſure; but if in truth it can be found, that ſo we come, know for thine everlaſting comf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     <p>Thirdly, He will not caſt out; that is to ſay, he will not ſend away empty, caſt them out of his preſence when they come to him; neither at our firſt coming, no nor our after-coming unto him: Not at our firſt coming; where is the ſoul that can ſay, that he did thus come to Jeſus Chriſt and was refuſed, was ſent away? it may be thou cameſt full, full of thy ſelf, not with ſuch an empty hand to take him; it may be thou cameſt with a falſe heart, and then well might he caſt thee cut, for he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how the heart ſtands towards him: it may be thou waſt troubled only with the ſmart of ſin, and not the filthineſs, the putrifaction of the wound and loathſom nature of it, and wouldſt have Chriſt only to have ſerved thy turn, and then wouldſt have turned thy back upon him: alas, he knoweth this, and therefore he reſiſteth the proud, a man of a Phariſaical ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 6.</note>

Now Brethren, our hearts are ſo vain, we can ſcarce ſettle upon it, to think of the woful condition that will be, to be caſt out from the Lord Jeſus; but no man that cometh to Chriſt ſhall be caſt out. O then, it is not greatneſs ſhall enter in, nor riches, nor beauty, nor learning, nor gifts, nor any of all theſe, but meerly the coming unto Jeſus Chriſt; he will never caſt out ſuch a ſoul.</p>
                     <p>You have ſeen already, what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is to come to Jeſus Chriſt, in many particulars, and what is neceſſarily preſuppoſed, and ſuch he will not caſt out, no, in no wiſe or ſort whatſoever; but alas, the difficulty is to perſwade poor creatures of this, that are upon the turning pin; many can ſay, <hi>Lord, if thou wilt,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>thou canſt make me clean;</hi> but the willingneſs of Chriſt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of poor ſinners, is that we many times doubt very much of; and it is not the tongue of men nor Angels that can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a man to this; and well it is for us that it is ſo, for then the Faith of poor creatures would conſiſt in the wiſdom of men, and not in the power of God only: let me lay before your hearts, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 5.</note> and my own, a few conſiderations from Scripture, which, if the Lord be pleaſed to breath in them, may be a ſupport to Faith in this.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, The Lord Jeſus hath promiſed, that if any man come to him, he will in no wiſe caſt them out; And ſhall men that are lyars, yet count it their honour to make good their <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 17.</note> word; and do you think Jeſus Chriſt his honour is not as dear to him, as the honour of men is to them? is he not the <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithful and true Witneſs? all that he ſaith is <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in him; is it not his own nature to be true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? is he equal, or equals with his Father? (as ſome critically <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 6.</note> note) that is to ſay, in all his perfections eſſential: and is he not equal with him in truth?

                        </gap> break with any poor ſoul, though never ſo unworthy? which is the great plea of poor creatures: did he ever caſt out any? hath he not been as good as his word? <hi>And is he not the ſame</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>yeſterday, to day, and for ever?</hi> But thus much for the firſt: it leads to the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould caſt out any poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he would plainly be argued to be changable: for I ſhewed you before, that none that came to him, but they were in his heart before the world was, <hi>and his delight was with the ſons of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>men:</hi> and is he now ſo changed, as when they do come, he will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caſt them out? did he before the world, (as I may ſay) pleaſe himſelf with the thoughts of it, that he ſhould be a Saviour to his people, to ſave them from their ſins, and from wrath to come, and when they come to him, to the fountain opened for ſin and for uncleanneſs, he ſhould refuſe them? would not this be more then a ſhadow of turning, if his heart, that once was ſo toward them, ſhould now be turned ſo againſt them, as to diſown them when they follow after him? O ſurely <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> this cannot be!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If ſo, It would be rather a ſlighting of his Fathers gift; for he hath given them to Jeſus Chriſt even before the world was; in which reſpect, <hi>They are ſaid to be choſen in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world: all that the Father hath given to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4, 5.</note> 
                        <hi>me, ſhall come; and as many as were ordained to eternal life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 13. 48.</note> and therefore, now when a poor ſoul cometh with his mouth in the duſt, with a rope about his neck, with a word of confeſſion, petition, with ſighs and groans, with mournings over Chriſt, and mournings after Chriſt, and he ſhall now ſhut up his mercy from him, caſt him out, turn his back upon him, would not this be an high undervaluing of the gift of the Father, and ſlighting of it? you know that gifts are not given from one friend to another, but as tokens of reſpect and love, and ſo he gave a number of poor creatures to his Son for him to redeem and purchaſe to himſelf, and if he ſhould
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:115245:401"/>
ſlight them now, his Fathers love would be much underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It would be failing in his truſt: for the Lord Jeſus <note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 19.</note> is the great undertaker for his poor people, and help was laid upon this mighty one, mighty to ſave to the utmoſt; for this end I ſay, he undertook the ranſoming and redeeming of a people to himſelf, and to his Father, and his Father committed the charge of it to him; <hi>He came not to do his own Will, but the Will of him that ſent him;</hi> (as he ſaith in that place) <hi>I delight</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 38, 39. Pſal. 40. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>to do thy Will;</hi> the Will of his Father: and what was that Will? That is, <hi>That none that come to Jeſus Chriſt ſhould miſcarry: This is the Fathers Will that hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but raiſe it up at the laſt day,</hi> (that is to ſay) as Mediator, as by the influence of an Head unto the Members; ſo to raiſe them up, is here meant: Well, <hi>Of, all that he hath given me,</hi> either in his purpoſe of Grace, or actually in their Calling, which is an evidence of the ſecret purpoſe of God, <hi>I ſhould loſe none: now none can come to Jeſus Chriſt, except he be given to Chriſt of the Father;</hi> that is clear, by comparing the words of the Text with the former: <hi>Ye will not come to me, or ye have ſeen me, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not:</hi> but though you believe not, <hi>All that the Father hath given me, ſhall come, ſhall believe in me:</hi> well, <hi>As many as were ordained, believed, came to Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> as we have expounded <note place="margin">Acts 13. 48.</note> this coming the laſt time. Now I ſay, if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould not take up every poor ſoul that cometh, he would not diſcharge his truſt, do the Will of his Father which he hath undertaken; and then what a Saviour ſhould we make of him?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Then the Lord Jeſus ſhould ſlight and undervalue his own blood: he only knew what a value his Godhead put upon it, and therefore accordingly, he only can bear a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable eſteem of his blood; did he not ſhed his precious blood, <hi>That whoſoever believeth, might not periſh, but have everlaſting life?</hi> or whoſoever cometh to him, might not periſh? for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, if it be not convertible with coming to Chriſt, yet it is doubtleſs comprehended in it, as a main part of it. And what then, when a poor ſinner laden with iniquity, whoſe burthen is too heavy for him to bear, cometh to Chriſt, groaning and panting for eaſe and refreſhing, rowls himſelf upon him, hangs
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:115245:402"/>
all his weight upon him, lies at his feet in his wearineſs of ſpirit under it, if he now caſt out this poor creature, would not this be an undervaluing of his blood, and the price of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? would it not appear that he was laviſh of his blood? Brethren, is the Lord Jeſus ſo angry with ſinners for trampling <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note> his blood under their feet, and for neglecting ſo great ſalvation, <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 3.</note> as he hath wrought out for them, (as you have not long ſince heard) and will he (think you) be guilty of ſlighting his own moſt precious blood? O ſurely no: And would it not be a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of the ſalvation, to improve the price he hath laid down, if he ſhould exclude any poor ſinner that cometh to him, though he have not been what he might be? ſurely if ever our bleſſed Saviour would have balked it, it would have been when he was to lay down the price, his life, his blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſinners, when <note place="margin">Mark 14. 33.</note> he was amazed at the apprehenſion of his Fathers diſpleaſure, when that cup of trembling and aſtoniſhment was to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand, to be drunk off to the very dregs; but yet he willingly undertook this, took it off to the bottom, that nothing might remain of the dregs to his people; which potion put him into a bloody ſweat, filled him with horror, and even aſtoniſhed him; but hath he done all this, and is it poſſible he ſhould now ſlight it, by caſting out any poor ſoul purchaſed with ſo dear a rate, that now cometh to him? O ſurely it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Becauſe this would be to undo what the Father hath done; For it is the Fathers work to draw a poor ſoul, to teach them, (as you have heard) before they can come to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 44.</note> 
                        <hi>draw him;</hi> you could not have a deſire towards the Lord Jeſus, not a breathing after the water-brooks, the Fountain of life, which is in Jeſus Chriſt, but that the Father hath breathed it into thee; now the Lord Jeſus, if he ſhould caſt out a poor ſoul that cometh with ſuch breathings after him, would quench the Spirit, would put out the light of Iſrael, ſhould deſtroy the works of his Father, inſtead of deſtroying the works of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 8.</note> therefore ſurely it cannot be, that he ſhould caſt out any poor ſoul that cometh to him, that his Father hath drawn with the cords of a man, and with the cords of love: Is it the work of a Saviour to cut the cords, whereby poor creatures
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:115245:402"/>
are drawn to him, and not rather of a murderer, a ſoul-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer? and can we have ſuch hard thoughts of Chriſt our deareſt Saviour? O far be it from us! this cannot be.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, He would hereby bring upon himſelf the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of deluſion, and mocking of poor ſinners, not only becauſe of his Promiſe, and offers of Grace, but in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects among others; for I will not dwell too long upon theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe of the many invitations that he hath made to poor creatures to come to him. O mind, how he proclaims it to every one that thirſteth: <hi>Come, come, buy wine and milk</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 1.</note>

I beſeech you, (ſaith the Apoſtle) as if God did beſeech you by us, to be reconciled to God, ye rebels, for ſo we are all <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, ye run-aways, what <note place="margin">2 Cor 5. 20. Ezek. 18. 31.</note> do you mean? why will ye periſh? <hi>Why will ye dye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> why now if a rebel turn, and his heart relent, and he would fain cloſe with this Prince of Peace, that would fain be at peace with him, do you think he will turn his back upon him Surely no: he might have done it to the thief upon the Croſs, that truly repented and believed, as to any, if he would; but if he ſhould do ſo, then ſinners had ſomething to anſwer indeed, that there is reaſon wherefore we ſhould not come to thee; who would come to be mocked, to be deceived, tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, <note place="margin">Zach 13. 1.</note> to have the fountain opened, and ſtand open for any to come that will come, and when we are willing, then to rowl a ſtone upon it, is not this deceiving? the Jews indeed took Chriſt to be a deceiver, and therefore they came not to him; I wiſh we be not many of us Jews in heart, though we be Chriſtians in name, our converſation witneſſeth to our faces; for why elſe do not ſinners come to Jeſus Chriſt, except they
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:115245:403"/>
look upon all theſe invitations of Chriſt as deluſions; but take heed, that as they periſhed, ſo we alſo periſh not in the ſame gain-ſaying.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He would be convicted of impoſture, if he ſhould reject any poor ſoul that cometh to him, becauſe it is he alſo that draweth them as well as the Father, elſe they could not come. So he ſaith, <hi>When I am lifted up, I will draw all men unto me;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>all that the Father hath given me, I will draw</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 12. 32. Mat. 24. 28.</note>

Now doth the Lord Jeſus draw and perſwade men, ſend forth his Spirit, which is his arm unbared and ſtretched out, to lay hold upon the hearts of ſinners, to draw them, to make them willing to accept of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 10. Iſa. 53. 1.</note> and ſalvation in him, from the filthineſs and power, as well as from the guilt of ſin, and when they come, will he ſhut them out? were not this horrible deceit? O, ſurely Jeſus Chriſt cannot ſo deceive poor creatures, theſe are moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thoughts of him!</p>
                     <p>Eighthly and laſtly, It is inconſiſtent with his bowels and tenderneſs, which naturally he hath to poor ſinners, ſpecially ſuch as the Father hath given unto him; could the Father ſhut out the Prodigal Son when he returned to him? his bowels would not bear it, <hi>he ran and met him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joſeph</hi> made it a little ſtrange at the firſt to his Brethren, and ſpake a little roughly to <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 18. Gen. 42. 17.</note> them, but mind you, he could not hold, he was fain to go into a place to weep, <hi>egerere dolorem,</hi> to empty his affection into tears for them, to ſee thoſe Brethren of his that had done him ſo much wrong, dealt ſo hardly with him; O when he heard them confeſs what they had done, and their conſciences ſmit them for it, then doubtleſs his bowels were rowled together within him; and for a while, I ſay, he made a ſhift to cover it, and put ſome of them into priſon, but all this while his bowels were moved; and was he not a type of Jeſus Chriſt in this? haply, as I may ſay, in other reſpects I ſhall not determine it, but when a poor ſinner cometh to Jeſus Chriſt, that hath ſold him for a luſt, dealt hardly with him, crucified him, and now
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:115245:403"/>
he is convinced of it, he mourns for it, and mourns over him; did <hi>Joſephs</hi> bowels yearn, and do not the Lord Jeſus his bowels? is the love of women to be compared to the love of Jeſus Chriſt? O ſurely no; he may ſeem for a while to turn his back upon a poor creature, but all this while the fire of love is burning within, and will burſt out into a flame; all this while what workings there are in the heart of Jeſus Chriſt towards a poor ſinner; as a Father, that for a time to humble his child, will make it ſtrange to him; O how full is his heart, how much ado hath he to hold, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his Brethren! O it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of Jeſus Chriſt, when poor ſinners do come to him to ſee his ſeed, to ſee his blood that was ſowed, and his <hi>Semen Eccleſiae</hi> to come up, it is his rejoycing; and will any Husband man in the world, that ſows precious ſeed, when it puts forth, beat it down again, nip off the buds, the tops of it? it cannot be: he is grieved when poor creatures will not be perſwaded to come, through hardneſs of heart, and unbelief, and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs: we will not come to the fountain, but ſit down, it may be, ſome of us with <hi>Hagar,</hi> weeping over our empty bottles, and making ſad moan and complaints for want of <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 15.</note> righteouſneſs, becauſe of ſin, and yet come not to him; this is a grief to him, as it was among the Jews: O did he ever in the daies of his fleſh refuſe any poor creature that came to him, either for healing of ſoul or body, which is the leſſer; yea, when they came ſome of them for the healing of the body, did he not heal the ſoul? and all out of the abundant riches of his love to poor creatures. O ſurely then, now he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, at the right hand of the Father, being no leſs tender of his poor people, if any come now, <hi>he will in no wiſe caſt them out.</hi> Well, the Lord write theſe arguments upon our hearts: it may be ſome of us may have occaſion, or have at preſent need of them to perſwade us of this truth.</p>
                     <p>We now come to the Application.</p>

him, what need all this ado to make poor creatures willing to come to Jeſus Chriſt? O, what is the reaſon! what a ſtrange enmity is in our hearts againſt the Lord Jeſus, that we run away from him inſtead of coming; yea, though he follow with a Pardon in his hand, purchaſed with his blood; O I am Jeſus who dyed for you, turn unto me, my heart is toward you, <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 5.</note> turn unto me, I delight not in your death, turn unto me; O why will ye die? and yet poor creatures will not be perſwaded to come to Jeſus Chriſt: O what is it? what is it Brethren, that can keep us off thus from Jeſus Chriſt? in our unwillingneſs to cloſe with him, to come unto him, have not many of us many times clearly been convinced that our condition hath been ſlark naught? that we ſtand guilty before God, and he will by no means clear the guilty: and convinced that in Jeſus Chriſt there is a doing away of this guilt, a bloting out of the hand-writings that are againſt us, and contrary to us; if we will but come to him? No, we are like ſullen creatures, will rather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh then come to Jeſus Chriſt. I do not believe but many of us are convinced, and what ſhift can we make to ſmother our convictions?

through the pride of our hearts to take the ſhame of our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities? Haply ſomething of this nature kept off the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal: Is it not more ſhame to do ſin, then to acknowledge it when it is done? what is it, Brethren? how ſtrange a thing is it, that men ſhould take ſuch pains to hew out broken Ciſterns to themſelves that will hold no water? dig deep into the world to find ſome reſt there; exhauſt their ſtrength in duties, in <note place="margin">Ier. 2. 13.</note> prayers, and tears, as many ſelf-Saviours do, ſpecially the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; and I wiſh there be none among us, rather then they will come to Jeſus Chriſt to accept of that righteouſneſs, that pardon, which ſhall coſt us nothing but acceptance: O the pride of our hearts; O the enmity of our hearts, againſt the Lord Jeſus; and is there ſuch an heart in every one of us, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? Yea, even in the beſt, until he overcome us with his loving-kindneſs; and is not this a thing worthy to be bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

                     <p>The ſecond <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> ſhall be, to ſhew us the grievous nature of the ſin of unbelief, and haply this may make poor creatures afraid of ſtraining curteſie with Chriſt, and afraid to come to him becauſe of their vileneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to complement with him.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Conſider but the unreaſonableneſs of the ſin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief above other ſins indeed; though all ſin be unreaſonable, other ſins they have ſome pretence of profit, or pleaſure, but this hath nothing but wo and miſery attending it, condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 2.</note> But that I ſhall not inſiſt upon, for there is hardly any thing but Satan and a mans carnal reaſon will put a ſpecious pretence upon it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore conſider this unreaſonableneſs; Firſt, in reſpect
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:115245:405"/>
of our ſelves, that being plunged into ſuch a depth of diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and miſery of ſin, and guilt, and wrath, that when we are ſinking and drowning, we will not ſo much as put out the hand to lay hold upon a twig, upon ſomething held out to us; is not this unreaſonable, and unnatural? it raceth out the principle of ſelf-preſervation that is in every man by nature; ſo that I will be bold to ſay, the greateſt reaſon in the world improved to keep off a poor ſoul from Jeſus Chriſt, is unreaſonable; it is the depravation of our carnal reaſon: had it not been unreaſonable if <hi>Hagar,</hi> having a fountain opened her before her eyes, and ſhe languiſhing for thirſt, and muſt periſh without it, and yet would ſit ſtill, is not this unreaſonable?</p>
                     <p>Again, If we look upon the Lord Jeſus, who ſeeks to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth us to accept of him, of mercy, of pardon in his blood, the Creator cometh down to the creature, poor worms who have our being by his Word, and might be diſſolved with his Word, and yet we ſtand it out, and will not accept of him, who would beſtow himſelf and his infinite all-ſufficiency upon us, and we will not; is not this unreaſonable? that a Prince ſhould ſeek to a worthleſs rebel to be reconciled, and he will not hear of it: If he had any need of us, and upon that account would have poor ſinners to come to him, to make a ſupply of his wants, it were ſomething; but all the want; the indigency is on our part, and therefore unbelief is the more unreaſonable thing: O how might we here break out and ſay, <hi>hear ye heavens, and give ear O earth,</hi> for the Lord Jeſus, the Lord of both, heir of all things, the offended Majeſty ſeeks to poor rebelling worms to be reconciled, but they will not hear of it, they come not in, they cloſe not with him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As the unreaſonableneſs of the thing, ſo alſo we may take notice of the injuriouſneſs of this ſin of unbelief; I would a little inſiſt upon this ſin, the more, becauſe that though I find many a poor heart ſeemeth to be weary of ſin, and afraid of ſinning againſt God in other kinds, yet ſeeth not in the mean time how exceedingly he ſins againſt him by his unbelief, not cloſing with Chriſt, and coming to him; therefore ſee in the ſecond place, the injuriouſneſs of this ſin of unbelief, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious it is to Jeſus Chriſt, Brethren? for if the truth were known, what is the reaſon wherefore we need ſo much ado, why
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:115245:405"/>
we come not in to him? We either think he cannot ſave us; our ſins are ſo great; O ſaith one, there was never ſuch a wretch as I, though he have accepted of great ſinners, ſuch as <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Magdalen,</hi> yet there was never ſuch a wretch as I; O ſurely, my wounds are ſuch, there is no healing for them: What is this, but to make Jeſus Chriſt weak, and a Phyſitian of no value? Is there any ſin higher then the imbrewing their hands in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf? and ſuppoſe thou be ſuch an one, and this is that thou cryeſt out of, thou haſt come ſo often to the Lords Supper with a common heart, which is to be guilty of his blood, acceſſary to his death: and cannot his blood cleanſe, even from the guilt of them that ſhed it? were not many of the Jews ſenſible oſ this? how diſhonourable is <note place="margin">Acts 2. 32.</note> this to Jeſus Chriſt, when we will be meaſuring of him by our ſelves? we are apt to think of pardon, and mercy, as far as a mans, a creatures bowels and thoughts will reach: mind, there is an end, not minding that he is God as well as man; this is an high wrong unto our Saviour: O, he will not, ſaith the poor ſoul, if he can, yet he will not, ſure, receive ſuch an one as I; O I am ſo laden and ſo loathſom a wretch; what ſhould he do with ſuch an one as I? What, is it poſſible thou ſhouldeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how many promiſes, how many invitations, how many expoſtulations he hath made; what intreaties to poor creatures to be reconciled to him, and yet call in queſtion his willingneſs! why, what do you make of Jeſus Chriſt? O, how doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, in effect, dethrone Jeſus Chriſt, diſgracing the Throne of his Glory, robbeth him of his mercy, of his power, his love, his bowels, of that which he moſt glorieth in; and is not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious then to thy dear Saviour? Would not you think it a wrong to you, from one of your children, that had offended you as highly as you can imagine? ſuppoſe he had ſought your life, as <hi>Abſolom</hi> did <hi>Davids,</hi> and now the Father ſeeks, thou ſueſt to thy ſon; O how many promiſes thou heapeſt up, one upon another, backeſt them with oaths, wooeſt him, intreateſt him to be reconciled, to accept of a pardon: No, he believeth you not, notwithſtanding all you can do or ſay, that you are real in the thing; is not this injurious? doth he not wrong exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in this, as well as in the former; and is not this the very caſe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="678" facs="tcp:115245:406"/>
Thirdly, See how much unkindneſs there is in this ſin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, as it is directly againſt the love, the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, which ſound toward poor creatures in the Goſpel, in every intreaty, to be reconciled to him: Brethren, what could the Lord Jeſus do more for us, then he did? was not his life dear to him, even to the death ſor poor ſinners, that there might be a pardon for us? and do we thus requite him, even to ſlight it, never to mind it? or if we do ſometimes a little, yet to ſtand out and not to cloſe with him: What unkindneſs was it in the Jews? it is ſo recorded of them, <hi>he came to his own, and his own received him not;</hi> that is to ſay, his own fleſh and blood; and ſo <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 11.</note> he is ours as well as others; but he came of them according to the fleſh in a nearer manner, and ſent to them in the firſt place, <hi>they received him not:</hi> But to come to Us poor Gentiles, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts, <note place="margin">Eph. 2 13.</note> that were ſtrangers, afar off, with a deſire to make us near in his blood, near to his Father and to himſelf, is this love nothing to be thus ſlighted? for how few among us do believe in the Lord Jeſus, notwithſtanding all this? nothing breaks the heart of a creature more then unkindneſs: and ſurely Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, me thinks the thoughts of this, if our hearts were not ſtony, ſhould be a breaking of our hearts, that we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſo many of us, dealt ſo unkindly with Chriſt as we have done.</p>
                     <p>But fourthly, ſee the dangerouſneſs of this ſin of unbelief, that we may be ſet a trembling by reaſon of this ſin, as well as any other, and be weary of this, as well as any other.</p>
                     <p>1. Other ſins have but their own particular guilt, each of them particularly binding over a poor ſoul to wrath, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayling the curſe of the Law upon a poor ſinner; ſo every ſin doth, every oath, every lie, every unclean thought, wanton look, adultery, fornication of the body, the heart or eye; but unbelief is that which binds the guilt of all other ſins upon the ſoul, beſides its own proper guilt, which is not the leaſt, as you have heard before: I ſay, it binds all upon the ſoul; if <hi>Paul</hi> had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, all the guilt of his perſecution had yet lain upon his head. O, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>if ye believe not, ye ſhall dye in your ſins;</hi> not only in your unbelief, but in all your ſins, ſo that this unbelief, it is the very edge, as I may ſay, of all other guilt
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:115245:406"/>
whatſoever, and therefore how dangerous a ſin it is, judge ye; you are terrified and affrighted with your grievous abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, rebellions, filthineſs of your waies, you never think of it haply, but your heart ſinketh within you: why know this, this day, that unbelief is that which keepeth all this upon the ſoul: if that thou wouldſt but aceept of deliverance in Jeſus Chriſt, take him, cloſe with him, come to him, he would not caſt you out, he would not turn you away without a pardon: but the reaſon of your burthens upon you, is becauſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is dangerous, becauſe above other ſins, it brings a mans blood upon his own head; that is a ſad word (me thinks) that of the Apoſtle, <hi>I take God to witneſs, that I am pure from</hi>

                        <hi>the blood of all men; if you periſh, your blood will be upon your head:</hi> that is to ſay, you are guilty of your own death, your own murther, your own damnation, and everlaſting ſeparation from God; much more may our bleſſed Saviour ſay, I am free from the blood of you all, ſinners, I have dyed for you, made an All-ſufficient ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of my Father, for all ſins, laid down a price, enough to ranſom you, and yet you would none of me, you cared not for it; I have made this known to you, elſe you had had ſome excuſe, ſome cloak, but you have no cloak for your ſins, for your unbelief; If I had not wooed you, intreated you to be reconciled by my Meſſengers, then it had been ſomething to ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nuate at leaſt; but alas, he hath done all this, and more, Brethren, infinitely, then I am able to ſpeak, for poor ſinners, and yet they will not cloſe with him; why then, Jeſus Chriſt is clear from your blood, he hath done what he undertook to do of his Father, ſpared not himſelf to the leaſt drop of wrath, and of his own blood, and yet we will not come to him. O this muſt needs bring poor ſinners blood upon their own heads.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This unbelief brings the blood of Jeſus Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our heads, for if after all this that he hath done and ſaid to perſwade us to make us willing to cloſe with him, we ſtand it out, are we not guilty of his blood, as well as of our own? If an unworthy receiving of the Lords Supper bring a man under <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 29.</note> this guilt, will not an unbelieving heart, in hearing of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, bring a man under the ſame guilt? for is it not the ſame
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:115245:407"/>
Jeſus that is held forth broken for ſinners? and the ſame blood ſhed for ſinners, that is held forth in the Lords Supper to the eye, and in the Goſpel Preached to the ear? even ſo plain as if it were before their faces, as the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Galathians;</hi> O, me thinks this ſhould make us afraid of reſting any longer in this condition of unbelief, and make us look about us; the Jews, as hard-hearted as they were, could not endure: their conſciences prickt them I believe, and did flie in their faces, and therefore would not endure the Apoſtles to Preach Chriſt: ſay <note place="margin">Acts 5. 28.</note> they, ye would bring upon us the blood of this man. O me thinks this ſtirs the ſtouteſt ſinners among us; I delight not to bring to you, Brethren, ſuch ſad things as theſe are, nor to bring the blood of Jeſus upon your heads, but let us take heed we do it not our ſelves, for we ſhall find that this will be the dregs of the cup of wrath, if we will not be reclaimed, that ever we have ſo much under-valued the Lord Jeſus, as to caſt his love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us by our unbelief.</p>
                     <p>The third <hi>

O that the Lord Jeſus, who hath received the tongue of the Learned for this end, <hi>to ſpeak a word in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſalah 50. 4.</note> would ſpeak by the mouth of his poor unworthy Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſuch hearts! What is the reaſon that thou wilt not come to Jeſus Chriſt? art thou reſolved to ſit languiſhing over an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty bottle and periſh, when there is refreſhing to be had in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? O no, ſaith the poor ſoul, I would not ſit ſtill and periſh if there be healing and mercy to be had; why, doſt thou <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> not believe that he is able to ſave to the utmoſt? where ſin
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:115245:407"/>
hath moſt abounded, there Grace can ſuperabound; yea, it is the glory of his Grace ſo to do. If I thought there were any <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 14.</note> ſtuck at this, I would ſpend a few words upon it, but conſider thoſe Scriptures fore-mentioned; but the main thing is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeſus Chriſt will accept of ſuch a wretch as I have been, ſaith one: O you know not the vileneſs of my heart, the horrid pollutions of my ways, elſe you would have harder thoughts of me, therefore thou art ready to conclude that he will not look at thee ſure. Let me here propound a few Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to thee.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Conſider how injurious it is to Grace, to meaſure it by our thoughts; limit not the holy one of Iſrael; it is the Glory <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 8.</note> of God, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful,</hi> and that whereby he infinitely tranſcendeth all other gods and men; <hi>Who is like unto thee? pardoning iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin;</hi> and canſt thou comprehend the Glory of God in thy poor narrow thoughts? thou it may be thinkeſt, O if any man had ſo offended me, I could not have born it, I could never have been reconciled to him again; but if thou canſt not, it may be another can; it is much that the Lord enables his people to love, to pray for, to be ready to embrace thoſe that in the moſt bloody manner ſeek their lives, if they come and cloſe with Chriſt, as the Diſciples did <hi>Paul;</hi> and doubtleſs <hi>Stephen</hi> would have hug'd them in his boſom, if any of them had then had their hearts changed; and what then can, and will the Lord Jeſus do, when ſuch as have been guilty of his blood, trampled it under feet, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their backs upon him, crucified him, when they come to him? So in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Thou thinkeſt, if thou wert but ſuch a ſinner, if thou hadſt not ſinned againſt ſuch love and mercy, he would have pardoned, he would have accepted; when thy thoughts are at an end and loſt, then is infinite Grace beginning to be Glorious.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Conſider this, that he hath left thee altogether without excuſe; he hath cut off all pretences that ſinners might make for their keeping off from Chriſt, both here and in other places. O ſaith one, <hi>He hath waited ſo long upon me, ſtretched out his hands all the day long to me;</hi> While I have been <note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 18. Rom. 10. ult. Rev. 3. 20.</note> rebelling, the Lord Jeſus hath been intreating me to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; he hath ſtood ſo long at the door knocking, that now ſure he is gone; he will not come to my ſoul, nor take my ſoul into
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:115245:408"/>
fellowſhip with himſelf. I am an old ſinner, as long as ever I could arm my heart, and boy up my ſelf with any thing, carnal reaſonings, moral ſervices, vain delights, and creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, I would never come to him: what though the Lord Jeſus is ready to receive when ever thou come to him? <hi>Had not the poor Woman in the Goſpel ſpent all upon the Phyſitians, before ſhe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 5. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>came to Chriſt?</hi> if ſhe could have had balm any where elſe, ſhe would never have gone to <hi>Gilead</hi> for it, nor for that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, and doth he caſt her out notwithſtanding? ſurely no: <hi>He giveth liberally, and upbraideth not:</hi> he hits her not in the <note place="margin">Iames 1. 5.</note> teeth with her unworthineſs to come to him, but when ſhe cometh, he healeth her diſtemper. Was not this the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals caſe? would he ever have gone to his Father, if he could have gotten husks, or any thing? and what, doth his father up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him with it? what, thou be received now, that haſt ſtood out as long as ever thou couldſt? it is neceſſity, and not love that hath driven thee home, therefore take thy courſe, I have no bread for thee; O this would have broken the heart quite, and for ever diſcouraged him for coming; no, he meeteth him by the way notwithſtanding, and how ready he is to receive him, and embrace him, that Parable ſetteth forth. O but ſaith another, I am ſo poor, miſerable, have nothing at all in me but ſin and miſery: ſuppoſe ſo, thou haſt the more need of Jeſus Chriſt, and he is moſt ready to reveal himſelf to them that need him moſt, yea thou art the more fit to come to Chriſt; for while thou haſt any thing to ſubſiſt upon, thou wilt not come off thy ſelf clearly and fully as thou oughteſt; beſides, remember this, that the Lord Jeſus is able to beſtow his riches upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as he did at the firſt make a world of nothing: ſo in the new Creation in the ſoul, he can, he will beſtow the riches of his Grace upon nothing; it is like thou haſt as much as the Prodigal had in his returning; O but he cannot but abhorr me, my ſins are not ſlight ſcars, and races, but deep wounds, and feſtering wounds, running ſores, bloody iſſues, loathſom in his ſight: did the woman with the bloody iſſue in the Goſpel find a repulſe, becauſe of the loathſomneſs of her diſtemper? or the Lepers, becauſe of theirs? or <hi>Lazarus,</hi> becauſe of his? ſurely no: therein is the great commendation of his love to poor ſinners, that though in their blood, yet he loveth them,
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:115245:408"/>
yet he receiveth them. In one word for all, to ſtop the mouths of theſe clamours, the Lord Jeſus hath ſaid it, and will he not be as good as his word? he hath ſaid, <hi>That if any man come to him, he will in no wiſe caſt him out,</hi> be his diſtemper what it will, be his uuworthineſs what it will, he will in no wiſe caſt him out: therefore never make that an obſtruction, but rather an argument to put thee on to go to Chriſt, becauſe thy want of him is ſo great, more then is found in others.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Conſider that theſe hard thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt, before thou haſt tryed, and had experience of a repulſe from him, are but a prejudice againſt the Lord Jeſus; how glad is the enemy of our peace, if any way he can keep poor ſouls off from Chriſt; will you judge a man to be ſo hard-hearted, and unkind to you, before you have tried him? and ſhall we judge ſo of Jeſus Chriſt? O this is to add ſin to ſin, and much wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens our condition daily.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Conſider this poor ſoul, and add to thy own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the experience of all the Saints; ask of them, and they will tell thee, O never was there viler wretches then they themſelves were! they had as vile and baſe thoughts of themſelves as thou, and were as much diſcouraged as thou art; and yet when they came to Jeſus Chriſt, they did obtain mercy, they found Grace in his ſight, the Scepter was held out to them. Ask of <hi>Paul,</hi> who though dead, yet ſpeaketh, and he will tell thee, thou never waſt ſuch a wretch as he, imbrewing his hands in the blood of the Saints, a perſecutor, blaſphemer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious. Ask but <hi>Magdalen,</hi> and ſhe will tell thee, that ſhe had ſeven Devils for one haply that thou haſt. And ſo will <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> O thou never hadſt thy hand in blood, in adultery, in denying the Lord Jeſus, theſe found mercy; <hi>And is not Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>ever?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Thou canſt have no good evidence, that thou art one given of the Father to Chriſt, before the world began, until thou comeſt to Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>All that the Father hath given me, ſhall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>come.</hi> What then, ſhall ſinners abuſe this doctrine, to ſet light by it, caſt off all care of their condition, becauſe if they be given of the Father, they ſhall come? no: But ſadly conſider this, if thou be not yet come to Jeſus Chriſt, thou art not as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:115245:409"/>
to be one that is given to Chriſt; and if not given to the Son, thou art a ſon of perdition; and wo is thee that thou waſt ever born; and as yet thou art not come to Chriſt, and how knoweſt thou, thou ſhalt ever have an opportunity, or an heart to believe, or come to him? Faith is not at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nor Chriſt at your command for poor ſinners; O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this ye that forget God, and forget your own welfare; <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed;</hi> the reſt were <note place="margin">Acts 13 48.</note> hardened.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, A rational Motive ſhall be this; In other diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a poſſibility of relief will make poor Creatures put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon extream hazards, when it is not poſſible they ſhould eſcape without ſuch a hazard running; how much more then in the buſineſs of our ſouls, ſhould we be willing to run an hazard, if there were any, where there is probability, yea, certainty of ſpeeding if we come. So the Lepers, you know their argument, <hi>If we ſtay here, we muſt periſh; if we go, we may eſcape.</hi> So <hi>Eſther,</hi> ſhe knew if ſhe went not into the King at <note place="margin">2 Kings 7.</note> that time, her neck was upon the block, as well as the reſt, and if ſhe did go in, ſhe might haply ſpeed and proſper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ventures hard; if the Scepter had not been held out to her, it had coſt her, her life there; but the body did lie at the ſtake, as being ſtarved for want, or elſe deſigned to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by enemies; but here ſoul and body lie at the ſtake, and are <note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap>her 14. 16.</note> in danger of periſhing for ever; there was only a poſſibility of eſcaping, here is a certainty of eſcaping: he will not in any wiſe caſt him out. O how cheerfully would <hi>Eſther</hi> have run to the King, if there had been ſuch a Law, that when ever the Queen cometh, the Scepter ſhould be held out to her; ſo it is here: there they ran a very deſperate hazard, but here is no hazard run, here is a ſure word of promiſe for it, <hi>That hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhall paſs away, before a tittle of it ſhall paſs away: whoever cometh to Chriſt, he will in no wiſe caſt him out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, It is a grief to the Lord Jeſus, that we ſhould be thus wayward, that we will not be perſwaded of his good will toward us, if we come to him; that we ſhould have ſuch unworthy thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt, that he ſhould make no more of his Word of promiſe, his death his blood, then to ſlight all, falſifie all, when poor ſinners come to him according to his invitation; <hi>he was
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:115245:409"/>

                        <hi>their hearts;</hi> It is ſaid of the Jews, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. he wept over it, when nothing would do to perſwade them to cloſe with him; thou art grieved, and Chriſt is grieved by this frowardneſs of thine; Suppoſe the Father of the prodigal ſon in the Goſpel had invited him to come to him, promiſed him all the inheritance, to put him in his boſom, confirm his love to him; no, ſaith he, I have miſpent all, I have undone my ſelf, fed upon husks as long as I could get them, and now I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to periſh not being able to procure them: here I will ſit and dye, I cannot believe that thou wilt accept of me, that thou canſt ever love me, or receive me more: would not this grieve the father think you? I know poor mourning ſoul thou wouldſt not grieve the Lord Jeſus; I tell thee, if thou wouldſt not, thou muſt come to him, accept of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love, believe his faithfulneſs, and truth, and ſo thy ſoul ſhall be eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>

Hoſ. 11. 4.</note> what it is, you have heard already formerly; Brethren, this is abundance of Grace, yea, more he hath promiſed, and doth, and will perform; whoever cometh to him, he will in no wiſe caſt him out. If the Lord Jeſus had limited himſelf to ſuch or ſuch a ſort of ſinners, that he would receive all that ſhould not continue ſo many years in ſin, or ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

caſt him out. Are there not many ſouls in the preſence of God, that can ſet to their ſeals that this is a truth in Ieſus? if he would have caſt out any, what would become of thee and me, who are the chief of ſinners? if he would have <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 10.</note> caſt out ſuch as have been drunkards, covetous, unclean, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, what had become of them in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6? Such were ſome of you: and what would have become of ſome of us, if he would have caſt out all that have been bloody perſecutors, what would have become of <hi>Paul?</hi> Ah poor ſoul! bethink thy ſelf in what filth and blood thou didſt wallow, before he put off his own comlineſs upon thee? and then think, if the Lord Ieſus had limited his receiving of ſinners, that come to ſuch or ſuch a meaſure, what then had become of thee? O what abounding Grace is in the Lord Ieſus towards poor ſinners! let us exalt it, meditate much of it, labour to heighten it in thy thoughts; there will be no thoughts more ſweet, or profitable, more melting of that ſtone in thy heart, we ſo ſadly complain of, more indearing and engaging of the heart to the Lord Jeſus, then theſe are.</p>

O bleſſed boſom, which will never ſhut out the poor ſoul that is once gotten in to it! and if the Lord Jeſus caſt us not out when we come, what can? It may be, ſome will ſay that we our ſelves may do it, Chriſt will not do it; I, but the ſinner himſelf may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

his boſom, warmed with his love; it is true, if a ſinner were his own keeper, it were ſomewhat like; if it were left to the liberty of our wils, whether we would abide in Chriſt, yea or no, we ſhould quickly be loſt again; but it is not, the Lord Jeſus doth not only not caſt us out, except we caſt our ſelves out, but he holds us in his hand, and the Father holds us in his hand, and they are ſtronger then all: <hi>None ſhall be able to pluck them out of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 28, 19.</note>

But what then, doth the Lord Jeſus hold us to himſelf whether we will or no? No Brethren, <hi>But he maketh us willing in the day</hi>

ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant: it is time enough to repent, Jeſus Chriſt is ſo tender and ſo merciful to poor ſinners, that when ever we come to him, he will not caſt us out; and though we do treaſure up many bags, and fill up the meaſure of ſin fuller then others, he hath made no <note place="margin">Rom 2.</note> limitation; if we come to him, he will not caſt us out: what a lamentable condition is that man in, whoſe ſtomack turns an honey-comb into poyſon to him! here is the moſt precious cordial, the very Spirits of the Goſpel in this our Doctrine, and ſee how ſinners do turn it into a deadly potion to their ſouls! what Spiders are we, that can ſuck venom out of the ſweeteſt flowers? but ſuppoſe this be true, that when ever thou comeſt to Jeſus Chriſt, thou ſhalt be received, and not caſt out in any wiſe; is there any truth in the Hypotheſis that lies hid, which is either this, that thou haſt power to come of thy ſelf at any time, thy will at command, if it be proper to ſay ſo of that which is the commanding faculty in the ſoul; or elſe this, that God will draw thee hereafter, and give thee a will to come to Jeſus Chriſt, when thou haſt lived a while longer in the pleaſures of ſin: Ah poor ſoul, thou little knoweſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin, and of thy own heart; what is the reaſon that thou art not now willing to receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? is it not becauſe thou art held ſo faſt in the embraces of thy darling luſts?

                        </gap>d Chriſt is waiting upon you, and ſtriving with you, and then it had been better for you, you had never been born.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another caution ſhall be to them that have come to Jeſus Chriſt, and are found in him, that they take heed they abuſe not this grace to wantonneſs. If we ſhall not in any wiſe <note place="margin">Iude 4.</note> be caſt out of Chriſt, what need ſo much ado? O what viperous natures have we, that are ready to turn all to poyſon! this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is in every heart among us, therefore watch over it: The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is Chriſts, a truth in Jeſus, and therefore in its own nature hath no tendency to ſuch a froward walking before God, there is nothing in its own nature doth more tend to kil ſin then grace, the abundance of grace in Jeſus Chriſt: &amp; truly, if grace &amp; love will not do it, nothing will do it; nothing runs the old man to the heart ſo home, as this unſearchable love of God in Chriſt, that if we come to him, he will in no wiſe caſt us out. It is a wretched, graceleſs concluſion, to ſay no more of it, to continue in ſin that grace might abound; the Apoſtle was well taught in <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> Chriſts School, and both by Revelation from Chriſt, and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal experience in his own caſe; he knew the power of the love of God in Chriſt, the exceeding abundance of his grace, and how doth he argue from mercy to duty? So our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who beſt knoweth the end of his grace, of which he is the Author and Finiſher, <hi>come to me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I will give you reſt:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> And what then? may they ſit ſtill and take their eaſe, never trouble themſelves more concerning their ſouls, never care how to walk in well-pleaſing to Chriſt? No, the next words are, <hi>take my yoak upon you, for it is eaſie, and it is light:</hi> It is no great matter he expecteth of us, in compariſon of what he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and in reſpect of the recompence of reward; a <hi>Belial</hi> is a Monſter in the Church of Chriſt, a man without yoak, like a wild-Aſs, ſnuffing up the wind, and doing according to his own hearts luſt. I will be bold to ſay, let men pretend to what they will, that man that hath drunk deepeſt of the love of God in Chriſt, and is moſt firmly rooted in him, and this free-grace of
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:115245:412"/>
God in him, brings forth fruit in the greateſt abundance of any other whatſoever, therefore take heed of this abuſe of the grace of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 7. Seventhly, Then let the people of God make this the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the ſtay of their hearts, that to which they have recourſe in all their doubts and fears, the Lord Jeſus will never caſt them out; labour to ſet a high price upon this promiſe, it is worthy to be written in every heart of a Believer in golden letters; we are too often too apt to turn aſide to our broken Ciſterns for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings when troubles ſeize upon us; but alas, how do they by their emptineſs quickly cauſe the heart to fall off from them? as a Bee cometh to a flower, abideth not, becauſe it quickly emptyeth, it ſucks out all the ſweetneſs, and then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and truly, ſuch are all things in the world, when we go to drink at them, to refreſh our weary ſpirits: but here you may drink, and drink abundantly, theſe are waters that never fail; never any were occaſioned to fall off from Chriſt becauſe of emptineſs in him, nor yet becauſe of ſatiety, as the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leach when gorged full: No, no, Chriſts breaſts are full of milk, full of grace, abundant conſolation do they miniſter; thou ſhalt never need to fear that hunger or thirſt ſhall force thee away from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Nor yet ſecondly, will theſe comforts ever forſake thee, ever caſt thee out; relations come together, and much delight they take each in other; and many a man is much taken up with the imbraces of this well-favoured harlot, the world; what between the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and pride of life; but alas, Brethren, beſides the killing of the imbraces, the ſinner muſt leave them, or they will leave him; and what then? O but once get into the arms of the Lord Jeſus, and thoſe imbraces cure inſtead of killing, and thou ſhalt never be caſt out more. O me thinks, Brethren, one rowling of this ſweet morſel under the tongue, were enough to ſweeten any
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:115245:412"/>
condition in the world; happy ſoul that hath the enjoyment of the Lord Jeſus, and the ſenſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Yea more, if he have not caſt thee out at the firſt coming, much leſs afterward in thy after-comings to him for more of his fulneſs of grace, he will not caſt thee out, not ſend thee away empty; if he would have ever thrown thee off, it would have been at the firſt, while thou waſt a ſtranger to him; yet when thou cameſt to him in a weary, burthened condition, he had reſpect to thy condition, had pitty on thee, gave thee reſt, admitted thee with all thy ſin, and guilt, and took it away; will he not much more have now bowels towards thee? can he caſt thee out now for thy defects and deformities? O ſurely no. Brethren, you that have Fathers and Mothers hearts to your children, tell me, you that have a poor child, though by his own untowardneſs he falls, wounds himſelf, bleedeth, fainteth, deformeth himſelf, cometh to his father, O father pitty, father help, father heal, I have what in me lies undone my ſelf; though he be angry at his miſcarriage, yet the bowels work towards him, he doth not upon this account caſt him out: And it is worth noting, when our Saviour was offended with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for their little faith in the ſtorm, they came and awaked him, ſaying, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh;</hi> his tenderneſs was ſuch, before he rebuked them for their unbelief, he rebuked the Sea <note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

O Brethren, ſurely, ſurely the Lord Jeſus his tenderneſs towards his people, is a feaſt of fat things, here are the wines on the lees to revive and refreſh the poor drooping ſpirits; loſe not the comfort of your condition for want of meditating upon it.</p>
                     <p>Object. But ſome will ſay, <hi>If this be ſo, it is ſad with me, for I have thought I came to Jeſus Chriſt, and have found comfort and refreſhing, and reſt in him, and yet alas, now he hath caſt me off; and therefore ſurely I was never truly in him, for none that come to him doth he in any wiſe caſt off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For anſwer to this, I conceive it is but a miſtake, ſuch qualms as theſe ſeize upon the people of God ſometimes, when we <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 7.</note> will needs live by ſight and not by faith: And ſometimes the
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:115245:413"/>
Lord may pleaſe to hide his face from his own people, and then no marvel if they be troubled; <hi>in a little wrath I hid my face,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 30. 7.</note> &amp;c. Sometimes our luſts come and ſteal away our Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaveth us of his preſence, at leaſt the ſenſibleneſs of it; and then we know not where they have laid our Saviour, is our ſad complaint; then we mourn, as children, thinking themſelves forſaken, if the Mother be but ſtept aſide haply on purpoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome neceſſary occaſion. So <hi>David, I ſaid I am caſt out of thy ſight.</hi> So <hi>Jonas, What, hath the Lord ſhut up his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, hath he taken his leave of me, and will he be gone for ever?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iona. 2. 4.</note> all this while the Mother is behind the Curtain, takes notice of every ſigh, ſeeth every tear fall from the child, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every expreſſion of longing and breaking deſires after her, and ſo doth the Lord; this is not a forſaking, a caſting out, but a fitting the poor ſoul for the receiving more of his love afterward. Why art thou then ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, poor ſoul, and droopeſt, as if there were no more hope nor help for thee in Chriſt, becauſe he hath a little turned his face away from thee? O happy ſoul, that canſt not bear his abſence, that followeſt ſo hard after him, that mourneſt after him, it is a ſign he hath left ſome ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the heart to draw thee after him, he hath not caſt thee off; but by this means would work thee more <note place="margin">

                     <p>2. Object. <hi>Alas but I know not whether I have ever yet come to Jeſus Chriſt; I am perſwaded that ſuch as come to him aright, he will never caſt them out; but my ſcru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>le yet ſticks, I am afraid of deceiving my ſelf, and thinking I come to him when I come not, for I have thus long come and followed after Chriſt, and never yet got a ſmile from him to this day; therefore he ſeemeth to ſhake me off, and caſt me out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let me ſpeak a few things to this.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That though he hold thee off a while, and ſeem
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:115245:413"/>
not to own thee, in reſpect of the comforts his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, yet in the mean time he doth ſtay and ſupport thee, there is his ſtrengthening preſence, elſe thou wert ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to endure to hold out mourning after him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When thy heart is ſo drawn out after Jeſus Chriſt, that thou canſt not live, nor be ſatisfied without thou mourneſt, pineſt, languiſheſt after him, this is a coming, a true coming to Jeſus Chriſt; when thou haſt all things elſe that heart can wiſh, it may be thou haſt relations, eſtate, name as good as others, yet thou canſt not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, all is nothing without intereſt in him; thou runneſt from Ordinance to Ordinance, from one Congregation to another, from reading to prayer, yet findeſt no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all: I will ſay to that ſoul, Thou haſt an evidence, and a clear one too, he hath indeed received thee, or thou wert never able thus to breath after him; and though he may hold thee off for a while, yet he will not ſhut thee out.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Hath the Lord made thee willing indeed to have him, to receive him as King and Saviour, to be purified by him, ſubdued to him, as well as ſaved by him? Alas, I know not whether I am or no: if not, what then meaneth all thy ſtuffing thy bed with groans? What mean thoſe Rivers of tears ſhed over him? what meaneth thy following ſo hard after him? What, is it poſſible that any man ſhould make ſuch heavy moan, as ſome poor ſouls do for Jeſus Chriſt, and yet not be willing to have him? If thou wouldeſt not have him, me thinks thou wouldeſt rather run away from him, then run after him: what aſcending is there up into this tree and that tree, as the Lord Jeſus paſſeth by in an Ordinance, to get a ſight of him, and yet the poor ſoul will not be perſwaded that he would have, fain have the Lord Jeſus; when one ſight of him would be ſo refreſhing to them: O go away rejoycing and triumphing in the Lord Jeſus, that ever he hath looked upon thee, to make thee willing
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:115245:414"/>
in the day of his power, for ſurely thou art a willing ſoul who art ſo affected towards him; and this willing, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <note place="margin">John 1. 12.</note> ſurely is the very receiving of Jeſus Chriſt, it is the cloſing with him, thus taking with one hand Chriſt for pardon, and giving up a mans ſelf to him with the other hand, which is the thing thy ſoul groans for; now if Chriſt Jeſus be ſo willing to receive poor ſinners, and thou be ſo willing to receive him, what can interpoſe to hinder or break the match? ſurely nothing.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Thou muſt be content to wait a while hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before thou have the comfort of thy coming to Chriſt; before, I ſay, thou ſhalt ſuck the ſweetneſs that floweth from him to thy ſoul, for thou haſt broken thy bones with ſin, which brought wrath upon thy ſoul, as <hi>David</hi> complains; O there was no reſt in his bones, and they muſt have a time to knit again. A man will rather lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bed a Priſoner a few daies, then be a Cripple all the daies of his life; therefore they ſay a Horſe leg is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable if broke, he will not endure to be bound, to lie quiet.</p>
                     <p>Submit to the Chyrurgians hand and skill, the Lord Jeſus will do it, it is doing; but alas, ſuch broken bones heal but ſlowly through many humors; by reaſon of the abundance of ſin in the ſoul may be it will be the longer, but wait; Remember the pains that <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſervant took to go up and down that ſteep hill <hi>Carmel</hi> with weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeven times, and brought news of nothing at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at laſt, he ſees a little cloud which filled the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: So it may be with thee, and it will recompence all; at laſt there will be abundance of rain to refreſh thy weary parched ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Be frequent in acting of faith, putting forth the acts of thy willingneſs to receive the Lord Jeſus, if he be willing to receive thee, for hereby the habit of faith will grow ſtronger, the little grain of Muſtard-ſeed thou ſhalt ſee take ſtrong rooting and ſpread it ſelf, and
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:115245:414"/>
then the acts will be ſtronger, and thoſe will yet again ſtrengthen the habit, and by this means the grace will appear more viſible: So that at the laſt thou ſhalt even feel in thy very ſoul, that thou doſt believe, if thou often <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 10.</note> put forth this act of recumbency upon him, caſting thy ſelf upon the Lord Jeſus, into his arms, at his feet; and ſee if thou find it not, that at laſt thou have not this witneſs in thy ſelf, that thou doſt believe in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. And then happy ſoul, thou mayeſt take the comfort of that condition; <hi>Thou ſhalt never be caſt out.</hi>
