            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>In this extremitie, behold, a comfort: for loe, a poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring man, ſeruant vnto a miller, dwelling two miles diſtant from the place where he receiued his wounds, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching for the ſtraied beaſtes of his ſaide maiſter Miller, happened by great chance to ouerheare this wofull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint: which ended, ſtanding halfe amaſed to heare ſo ſweet a voice, caſting many waies in his ſimple minde the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ſubtilties of ſpoiling miſcreants, ſuppoſed verily that it had bin a deuiſe of ſome villaine, lurking there abouts of purpoſe to betray traueilers, and to bring them within their compaſſe to rob them.

ſtanding thus in his dumpes, deuiſing whether it were beſt to touch them or no: caſting his eies ſtedfaſtly on them, ſuruaieng their grieuous woundes. <hi>Andrugio</hi> faint and full of paine with the extreamitie of his woundes, breathed ſoftlie: which being noted of this ſwaine, drewe neere vnto him, layeng tenderly his hand on the ſtomach of <hi>Andrugio</hi> felt a panting ſhort wind withn him, whereat the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat ioyfull, rubbed his temples, ſo by litle and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle recouered him.</p>

But to agrauate ſtill his extreame

griefe and torment of body: the Captaine (as one bent to ſeeke his vtter deſtruction, prouided yet a more greater torment both bytter and cruell: for loe, when time had brought their paſtimes to end, This mercileſſe tormenting Captaine, inuited all the Captaines to a banquet aboord his Gallie: at the end whereof, he cauſed <hi>Andrugio</hi> to be caſed in the raw hide of a new ſlaine woolfe, which with the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogges from euery Gally, baited him beaſtlike, in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they had like to haue wearied him, ſometimes tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his armes and legges, otherwhile the other partes of his bodie, which crueltie of the dogges, vexing poore <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drugio,</hi> bred ſuch content to the barbarous villaine, that his heart was more ioyed with the ſight thereof, than if hee had receiued a noble victorie againſt his enemies: ſuch deadly hatred had the cruell tyrant conceiued againſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drugio.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The noble man mooued with pitie and compaſſion at the Pyrates ruthfull tale, thought euery minute of an hower a day, vntill he might come to the preſence of thoſe two

VVhere, in the moſt earneſt manner that hee coulde, beſought the Princeſſe and the Kinges of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Swethland</hi> to procure his freedome, either by intreatie, or for ranſome, at his charge, to what ſomme ſoeuer it amounted.</p>
               <p>The princes hearing this dolefull diſcourſe, mooued to pitie his miſerie, ſent for the gouernour, and beſought him, that as their welcomes had bene great, and their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment exceeding, ſo they might craue his friendſhip in a ſuit they had to impart vnto him.</p>
               <p>The Gouernour glad to content thoſe princes with all the fauours he might, did not only by his word aſſure what they deſired, but deepely ſware they ſhoulde obtaine what they craued: holding himſelfe highlie in their fauour, that they would demaund any thing that lay in him to performe, beſeeching to know what their ſuit was.</p>
               <p>The princeſſe thanking him for his kindneſſe, and fauor, told him that their ſuit was for the libertie of a ſlaue, a poor man, and what ranſome hee would demaund, he ſhould haue with thankes.</p>
               <p>My gracious Lords (quoth the Gouernour) not one, but all the priſoners and ſlaues in this place ſhall bee at your highnes command: and therefore I humblie beſeech you to let me knowe his Captaines name, and the perſon, and hee ſhall preſently be ſent for.</p>
               <p>The noble man whoſe deſire was to haue <hi>Andrugio</hi> his libertie, very glad to heare his ſuite growe to ſo good effect, gaue thankes to the gouernour, deſcribing vnto him what he was, and in what Gally, but his name he could not remember, which by the eſpeciall notes giuen, was well knowen vnto the Gouernour, who with all ſpeed diſpatched

               <p>Thus when <hi>Andrugio</hi> by the appointment of the Gods had remained a while at libertie, and that the princes had well repoſed themſelues, prouiſion was made for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture vnto the Barbarian King, of whome they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected long, by reaſon of ſome of their Fleet arriuing in his countrie. all things being ready for them, a faire gale blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they take their leaues of the Gouernour, whome they reward with great and bountifull preſentes, with much courteſie and thankes for their royall entertainment, the which they vowed ſhould neuer be forgotten.

               <p>This mariage performed, and ſome time ſpent in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as tilting, maſking, and other paſtimes in honor of the wedding, the Duke with his new adopted Princeſſe than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their friendly Hoſt for their entertainment, bad him farewell, departing towards their owne pallace, wher they were of the citizens (wher he kept his court) moſt royallye receiued, each one crieng with a generall voice, God ſaue their Duke and Ducheſſe.</p>
               <p>The tearme of two yeares and ſometime more was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in exceeding ioyes betwene thoſe kind Louers, in which time God ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two ſaire &amp; goodly children, to wit, one ſome and one daughter to their great ioy, and reioycing of all the commons. But as the vertuous bee alwaies moſt ſubiect to the enuie of the worlde, ſo in time the fire of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which had bene long ſmochering in the boſomes of <hi>Gonſalo</hi> and <hi>Flodericus,</hi> two Nobles of <hi>Saxony</hi> began to breake foorth into hot burning flames, in ſuch ſort that ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their tenants, kin, and followers, perſwading them their intents were honorable, and for the benefite of their common wealth. Thus they aſſembled a great armie and
<pb facs="tcp:1721:41"/>
encamped themſelues within two ſmall miles of the court, ſeeking by al the meanes they could to draw vnto them ſuch as fauoured the Duke and his.</p>
               <p>The newes of this rebellion brought vnto Court, the Duke marueiling much what ſhould be the cauſe: preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preuent inſuing miſchiefes, as well as for his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, diſpatcheth with all ſpeed poſtes for all his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, commanding them with al the power they could make to repaire to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court.

Wherefore Her aught (quoth <hi>Flodericus)</hi> ſay thus vnto the Duke, that if he wil condeſcend vnto ſuch demandes of our, as wee ſhall ſet downe, we ſhall accordingly ſubmit our ſelues vnto him and acknowledge our duties: otherwiſe we are reſolued to die in that cauſe which we haue taken vpon vs to maintain.</p>
               <p>The Her aught hauing heard their anſweres, certified the Duke of their intentes, wherewith hee was not a litle grieued: yet as one tendering carefully his Ladies loue and welfare, he ſtill concealed the ſame from her, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining

               <p>To be briefe, ſo ſtrong were thoſe two Rebels, that they beſieged the citie round about in ſuch wiſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſhort a time their victuals began to wax ſcarſe, and no remedie, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they muſt all ſtarue, or trie their fortunes by the ſword. The Duke thus reſolued with his company, aſtying on him that in many miſeries had bene his protector, yſſued out on vnawares vpon his enemies and fought with them a ſharpe and grieuous battell, in which many of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie miſcaried, and hee compelled to flie, loſing the field: at which time his enemies taking their aduantage, purſuing them that ſled towards the citie, entered pell mell commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting great ſlaughters of his people, in the end being quietly poſſeſſed of the ſame, they ſought for the Duke, who was not to be found. Wherefore to be reuenged on the Duches, they determined to put her to the ſword, for whoſe life the common people with one generall voice made earneſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, at whoſe requeſt ſhe was preſerued, but baniſhed with her two Infants, commanded vpon paine of her life neuer to returne againe, within any part of the regiment of the Dukedome of <hi>Saxonie.</hi>

               <p>This wofull Lady baniſhed in ſuch wiſe as you heare, her onely companions were two wayting women, which for her loue exiled themſelues, departed the Citie, ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged

For loe, as he by chance was ſtragling, to gather roots and hearbes to relieue his hungrie ſtomacke, hauing no other ſuſtenance, hee heard the pitifull lamentation of a woman, complayning her hard fortune, and bitterly weeping ouer her tender babes, beſeeching God to ſhew that mercie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diſtreſſed wretche, in her aduerſitie, to grant the duke to meete them.</p>

After he had long debated with himſelfe, what was beſt to be done in ſuch an exigent, he entered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where his Ladie ſate, rocking on her knee the ſweete babe, which was a daughter: whoſe face, when the good Ladie beheld howe ioyfull ſhee was I neede not relate, onely this let me tell you, his preſence exiled from her heart the greateſt griefe. After this ioyfull meeting, and that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted one to the other, their miſhaps, <hi>Andrugio</hi> as one carefull for his Ladie and infantes, more then for himſelfe, bethought manie waies of one eſpeciall, by which they might haue comfort: calling to minde his friend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, <hi>Galaſtino</hi> now duke of Millaine, he determineth not to reſt in anie place vntill he could recouer his countrie.

               <p>This is the tryall of true friendes: how many liueth at this day like thoſe: Ah none, the more may our harts grieue to think thereon. Ambition, couetonſneſſe, pride, and hatred are ſo crept into the hearts of men, that they contemne God

and his dooings, their fathers, kin and welwillers. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men liue in theſe daies, that for a kingdome would not murder his prince, if he might do it without feare of death, which is a terrour to moſt men? How many men be there that for riches will not ſticke to rob Temples, prophane the name of God, vſe periurie, to the confounding of the honeſt and their poſteritie? yea, to inioy what their owne fathers haue, ſeeke vntimely to cut of their liues that firſt gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breath?

Further, it is a vice of exceſſe, and contrary to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie: for that man (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) is modeſt, which deſireth honor as he ought, and as becommeth him, but hee that deſireth it by vnlawfull meanes is ambitious. Howe many treaſons hath there bin by ambitious men conſpired againſt their ſoueraignes? We read of <hi>Frederick</hi> the third who after hee had raigned thirtie yeares, was miſerably murthered by <hi>Manfroy</hi> his baſtard ſonne, whom hee had made prince of <hi>Trantinum,</hi> and after he had committed this paracide, poyſoned his owne brother <hi>Conradus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might make himſelfe king of <hi>Naples, Antonius</hi> &amp; <hi>Geta</hi> ſucceſſors in the Empire to <hi>Seuerus</hi> their father, could not ſuffer one the other to enioy ſo large a monarchy: for <hi>Anton.</hi> flue his brother <hi>Geta</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a dagger y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might rule alone. <hi>Soliman</hi> king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turks, when he heard the ſhowtes of his armie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they made for <hi>Sultan Muſtipha</hi> his ſon, he cauſed him to be ſecretly ſtrangled in his chamber: &amp; preſently (being dead) to be caſt out before his army, cauſing this ſpeach to be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a loud voice, there was but one God in heauen, and one <hi>Sultan</hi> vpon earth: within two daies after he cauſed his ſecond ſonne <hi>Sultan Soba</hi> to die, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wept for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> his third ſonne becauſe he fled for feare, leauing but one of his race aliue to ſucceed him.</p>
               <p>

Theſe are but the familiar examples of ambition in reſpect of thoſe that cauſe men to put innocentes to deathe, that they may the ſurer grow and increaſe: but no doubt for the moſt part, iuſt puniſhment follow the ambitious, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to others, whereof there are vnfaigned hiſtories, which mention the ſame. <hi>Marcus Craeſſus,</hi> the richeſt man of his time, iealous of <hi>Caeſars</hi> glorie, at the age of threeſcore yeares, lead with a vaine hope of conqueſt, vndertooke the warres againſt <hi>Arſaces,</hi> king of the Parthians, in which warres himſelfe was miſerably ſlame, with twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his men, and ten thouſand taken priſoners. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Marlius</hi> was for the like occaſion throwne downe from a rocke, and brake his necke. Oh that men would conſider the fruits of ambition? who would then willingly offend? for as the wiſe man ſaith, (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring them to ſmoke diſperſed with the wind) deſire nothing more then to runne out their race in continuall cares, and miſeries and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, depriuing themſelues of all liberty, and which is worſt, pawning their ſoules, to an eternall and moſte miſerable thraldome.</p>

They indure la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in procuring, but want the pleaſure of inioying: they inioy: neither reſt nor libertie, whiche is of wiſe men moſte deſired, but liue alwaies like ſlaues to their riches.

I am nowe drawne to the like in the behalfe of thoſe two children of my friend: the noble duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> for whom (on my honor) my care is as much as for mine own, neither wil I alter my determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> herein, to be made a monarche of the worlde, but to my vtmoſt power, will ſo proſecute, what I determine herein, that in the cauſe I wil aduenture my perſon, where ſuch as loue me, will follow me.</p>
            <p>The nobles which noted howe earneſt the duke was in vttering his long oration, thought it no time to delay their opinions, what they iudged of the enterpriſe, yet were they driuen to a <hi>non plus,</hi> what to anſwere ſo ſodainly: to denie his demandes and earneſt requeſt, might bréede ſuſpition of their loyaltie, then which they rather chuſe to die: againe to aggrauate him, to the attempt which was before, ſo hote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent, was but to put oyle to quenche the fire, wherefore after ſmall deliberation, they anſwered.</p>

            <p>The Nobles gone, the Duke calleth his captaines, and men fit for charge, geuing them warrant for leuieng his power, with great command that his company ſhould bee of the beſt and ableſt men in the Dukedome, which with care they ſee fulfilled, according to the truſte repoſed in them.</p>
            <p>The Ducheſſe for whoſe ſake thoſe preparations were made, conceiued ſuch ioy at the ſame, that ſhe thought euery moneth a yeare, and euery day a moneth, vntil ſhee ſaw to what happy end the Dukes pretended iorney would happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto, often commending in her heart the faithfulneſſe of the Duke of Millaine to his friend.

The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of whom was likely diuers times to bereaue her of life, yet in the midſt of her ſorrowes, when ſhe beheld the yoong prince, a liuely picture of the exiled Duke, how often with ſweet imbracings woulde ſhe kiſſe the tender youth, bathing his tender cheeks with teares diſtilling in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, thorow extreame griefe of heart from her eies, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping yet before death ſhould ſhut thoſe eyes of hers to ſee him, and once againſt to inioy his companie.</p>
            <p>The yoong prince growing to ſome diſcretion, beeing

thirteen yeares of age, well noting the ſorrowe and heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his mother, would by cyrcumſtances enquyre of the Duke his father, of his country, and the cauſe why hee left the ſame, with many other queſtions, of which when the Ducheſſe had reſolued him, &amp; made relation of each thinge which he demanded, deſcribing alſo at full, how dearly hys ſubiectes loued him, and in what regard they held her, it would moue the prince often to ſhed teares, wiſhing that his years had bene ſuch that he might haue remembred his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of power to reuenge his wrong, vowing if it bee the pleaſure of God to endow him with life, ſo thorowly to requite thoſe iniuries vpon the vſurping traitors, that al the chronicles in the world ſhould record the ſame in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And ſo comforteth his mother in the beſt ſort hee could, praying her a while to be content, till God had placed him in his right, whereof he hoped in ſhort time to bee poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>Thoſe wordes of comfort proceeding from ſo greene a head: the Ducheſſe did much admyre, &amp; no doubt had greate pleaſure in her ſonne, of whom ſhe had no litle ioy, whoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation was anſwerable to his byrth, hauing learned men of all ſciences to read vnto him, by whome hee profited in learning ſo excellently, that it was rare to finde any in Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, or the whole Dukedom comparable vnto him for ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and other agility of the body, for which he bare the prize from al of his yeares, whoſe conditions were ſo anſwerable to the noble Duke his father, that if any man did know the one, would ſuppoſe ſoone who the other ſhould be.</p>

            <p>The nobles &amp; citizens, that hard his ſorrowful proces al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they hated him to the death, was moued with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Hauing ſet all thinges in order, The nobles who before had determined to receaue him in very braue maner depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the citie, to the Campe of the Duke, who hearing by an embaſſadour, before diſpatched, of their comming, came out to meete them, whome on their knees, the Lordes and Citizens, beſeeche of mercie, and in their Dukes

behalfe, whoſe by right it was, to enter the citie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the gouernment.</p>
            <p>Small intreatie ſerued to perſwade the Duke, who ſought not their harmes in any ſort: wherefore taking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for his armies, acompanied with the chiefeſt of hys traine and Captaines, he entered the citie, where hee was royally entertained, and conducted to the Courte where <hi>Flodericus</hi> and his company with ſorrowe attended the ſentence of death.</p>
            <p>The duke being thus with honor in their princes behalf entertained, gaue thankes vnto them all, exhorting them to continue truſty and faithfull to their duke and his lawful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor, aſſuring them, that God who had euer defended the right, would alwaies fauour the innocent, and ſubuert the Traitor. Great ioy was there throughout the region of Saronie for this happy tydings, where <hi>Alphonſus</hi> ſon and heir to <hi>Andrugio</hi> was proclaimed duke, at which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man reioyſed.</p>
            <p>The Duke ſeeing all thinges brought in ſuch happy maner to his content, &amp; ſaw that the people in faithfull wiſe were linked to the prince, he diſcharged the moſt of his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and gaue order to his nobles for the prince <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> whome with the Ducheſſe he commanded with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might be, ſhould come to receiue their right, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſing them by letters of his good ſucceſſe, and how the peoples heartes were bent to honor them.</p>
            <p>This done he commanded <hi>Flodericus</hi> to be brought to his preſence, whome honorablie he vſed, commanding him to ſit down by him, where hee declared how vnhonorablie he had dealt by his noble friend Duke <hi>Andrugio,</hi> in exiling him and his children, vſurping his right, whereunto he had no tytle, with many examples howe God had puniſhed the like offences in many, and that doubtleſſe God would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh an offence ſo hainous on him and his poſteritie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flodericus,</hi> whoſe conſcience accuſed him of as much as the Duke had ſaid, could not excuſe his fault, which was too

            <p>The Duke whoſe heart was mooued to pitie, taking no pleaſure in his death, neither the ſubu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Flodericus</hi> hearing the iudgement of the Duke, was ioyed at the heart to eſcape with life, which had deſerued death in the moſt extreameſt maner, wherefore humblie yeelding thankes for his gracious clemencie, he departeth his preſence.</p>
            <p>The Duke hauing taken this order with <hi>Flodericus</hi> hearing <hi>Sextillius Gonſalo</hi> his ſonne had not yet diſlodged his campe, ſommoneth him by a Her aught to come and yeeld to his mercie, or otherwiſe without fauour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his deſert the Her aught omitting no time til he came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> campe of <hi>Sextillius,</hi> deliuereth his meſſage, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

now vpon tearms, but made proclaimation that euery man ſhould depart to his home, and he himſelf would procure the Dukes pardon for them all, or yeeld his life for them, this done, enerie man at the firſt warning, glad to bee eaſed of their toile, and more ioyful of their yoong Dukes returne, preſently depart with bag and baggage.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Sextillius</hi> came before the Duke, who had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the cauſe of his inſurrection to be in the reuenge of his father, murdered by <hi>Flodericus,</hi> hee was the ſooner perſwaded to receiue him to mercie: wherefore in hope that he would become a dutifull ſubiect and acknowledge <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi> ſonne and heire to <hi>Andrugio</hi> his lawfull prince and ſhow the like ſigne of obedience, he pardoneth his fault &amp; honorablie entertaineth him, pardoning alſo al ſuch as had offended with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sextillius</hi> ſeeing the noble minde of the Duke of Myl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, humbly thanketh his excellencie for this vndeſerued fauour, &amp; taking oath for his loyaltie had leaue to depart at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The fortunate ſucceſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Millain Duke was brought vnto the Ducheſſe <hi>Suſania,</hi> whoſe heart you may ſuppoſe was not alitle ioy full to heare the ſame: wherefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dukes pleaſure ſhe haſtneth to him with as much ſpeede as might be.
