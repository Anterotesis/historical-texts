            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I came into the world nor when I ſhall goe out: mortall, and miſerable: whoſe dayes paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as a ſhadowe, whoſe life glaunceth away as a ſhadow by Moonelight, growing as a floure vpon a trée, and fading out of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againe, now floriſhing and by and by withering againe. My life (I ſay) is a fraile life, a fléeting life, ſuch a life as the more it lengtheneth the ſhorter it is: the further it goeth, the néerer it draweth vnto death. A deceitfull and ſhadowiſh life, full of ſnares of death. Now I am merie, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none I am ſorie. Now I am lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, &amp; anone I am weake.

Here withall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth feare, trembling, hunger, thirſt, heate, cold, faintneſſe, and grief.

He choketh ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with water, and ſtrangleth other ſome with a halter. He makes a hand of ſome men by fire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth otherſome with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> téeth of wild beaſtes. He fleas this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

with the ſword, deſtroyes that man with poyſon, and cauſeth ſome other man to finiſh his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable life with nothyng, but ſome ſodein feare. And yet there is one great miſerie aboue all theſe: namely that whereas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more certeine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, yet doth not a man know when he ſhall dye.

For a man knoweth not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where or how he ſhall dye, &amp; yet is he ſure that he muſt néedes dye. Sée Lord how great mans wretchedneſſe is, wherein I am, &amp; yet miſtruſt it not: how howge the miſerie is which I indure, &amp; yet am not greued, nor make any moue to

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am the chief among the ſinners whom thou haſt ſaued, that I may be an example vnto
<pb facs="tcp:427:50"/>
others of thy moſt mercyfull lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng kyndneſſe. I will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy great benefites vnto thée: for thou haſt plucked me out of the bottom of hell, once, &amp; twyſe, and thrice, and a hundred tymes, &amp; a thouſand tymes. Yea I alwayes made towardes hell, and thou didſt alwayes bring me backe againe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou mighteſt iuſtly haue damned me if thou hadſt would. But thou wouldeſt not O Lord my God, bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> loueſt mens ſoules, and beareſt with mens ſinnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might repent: all thy wayes be full of mercy. Now therfore O Lord my God I ſée theſe thynges and diſcerne them by thy light, &amp; my hart is aſtoniſhed at thy great mercy towardes me, in that thou
<pb facs="tcp:427:51"/>
haſt deliuered my ſoule from the bottome of hell, and brought me backe agayne to lyfe. For I was ſtarke dead, and thou haſt made me throughly aliue again. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am I altogether beholden to thee for my life, and whole as I am I yeld my ſelfe wholly vnto thée. Let my whole ſpirite, my whole hart, my whole body, and my whole life liue vnto thée my ſwéete lyfe: for thou haſt deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me whole, that thou mighteſt poſſeſſe me whole: y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt made me whole new agayne, that thou mighteſt haue me whole againe. And therfore let me loue thee O Lord my ſtrength, let me loue thée O my vnſpeakable ioy, and let me liue hence forth, not to my ſelfe, but vnto thée. All my whole
<pb facs="tcp:427:51"/>
life which was periſhed in myne owne wretchedneſſe, is reuiued agayne in thy mercy: for thou art a pitifull and mercyfull God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many are thy compaſſions toward thouſandes, in them that loue thy name. And therfore O Lord my God, thou my ſanctifier haſt commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded me in thy law, that I ſhould loue thée with all my hart, with all my might, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bottom of my hart, at all houres &amp; tymes wherin I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefites of thy mercy. For I ſhould periſh for euer, but that thou ruleſt me euer. I ſhould euer dye, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou euer quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt me: yea euery moment thou byndeſt me vnto thée, in as much as euery mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thou beſtoweſt thy great benefites vppon me.
<pb facs="tcp:427:52"/>
Therefore lyke as there is no houre or inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of time in all my life, that I haue not the vſe of thy benefites: ſo ought there to be no moment wherin I ſhould not haue thée in remembraunce before myne eyes, and loue thée to thée vttermoſt of my power. But this am I not able to do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou make me able, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth euery good gift &amp; euery ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellent gift: for y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> art the father of light, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge nor intercourſe of darknes: for to loue thée co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not of our own will, or of our own running, but of thy mercy.

For in aſmuch as y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> art vnſpeakable, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt in no wiſe be put in writing or comprehended. Thou art the fountaine of godly light, and the ſunne of euerlaſting brightneſſe. Thou art great without quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and therfore vnmeaſurable. Thou art good without qualitie, &amp; therfore very good &amp; ſouereinly good, and no man is good but thou
<pb facs="tcp:427:101"/>
alone. Whoſe will is a worke, for thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt do what thou liſteſt. Thou haſt created all thinges of nothing, and by thine onely will haſt thou made them. Thou poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeſt all thy creatures without any want of them, thou gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt them without payne, thou ruleſt them without wéerines, &amp; there is nothing that may trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the order of thy gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, from the higheſt thinges to the loweſt. Thou art in all places without place, confeynyng all thinges without incloſure, and being preſent euery where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſetting or remouing. Thou art not the author of any euill, for y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> canſt do none euill. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou canſt do all thinges, thou haſt not done any thing wherof
<pb facs="tcp:427:102"/>
it can forthinke thée. It is of thy goodneſſe that we be made, of thy iuſtice that we be puniſhed, and of thy mercy that we be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Whoſe almightineſſe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ruleth, &amp; filleth all thinges which it hath made. Yet meane I not by thy filling of all things, that they conteine thée, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that thou conteineſt them. Neither filleſt thou all things by parcel meale, neither is it in any wiſe to be thought that ech thing receiueth thée accordyng to the proportion of it owne bigneſſe, that is to wit the greateſt things more, and the ſmalleſt thinges leſſe: but rather that thou thy ſelfe art whole in all things, and all things in thée: whoſe almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe incloſeth all thinges, and
