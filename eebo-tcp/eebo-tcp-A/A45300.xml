         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>VVorthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou thinke it ſtrange that
I ſhould ſalute you from
hence; how can you
chooſe, when I doe yet
ſtill wonder to ſee-my
ſelfe here? My intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and this place are
ſuch ſtrangers, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enough marvell how
they met. But, howſoever, I doe in all humility
kiſſe the rod, wherewith I ſmart, as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whoſe hand it is that wields it; To that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
juſtice who can be innocent? but to my
King and Country never heart was, or can be
more cleare; and I ſhall beſhrew my hand if it
ſhall have (againſt my thoughts) juſtly offended
either; and if either ſay ſo, I reply not; as having
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63681:3"/>
learned not to conteſt with thoſe that can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Legions.</p>
            <p>In the meane time it is a kind, but a cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
that you pity me; an affection well pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
where a man deſerves to be miſerable; for
me, I am not conſcious of ſuch merit. You tell
me in what faire termes I ſtood not long ſince,
with the world; how large roome I had in the
hearts of the beſt men: But can you tell me how
I loſt it? Truly I have in the preſence of my God
narrowly ſearcht my owne boſome; I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
ranſackt this fagge-end of my life, and
curiouſly examined every ſtep of my wayes;
and I cannot, by the moſt exact ſcrutiny of my
ſaddeſt thoughts, finde what it is that I have done
to forfeit that good eſtimation, wherewith, you
ſay, I was once bleſſed.</p>
            <p>I can ſecretly arraigne and condemne my ſelfe
of infinite tranſgreſions, before the Tribunal of
heaven: Who, that dwels in an houſe of clay,
can be pure in his ſight, that charged his Angels
with folly? O God, when I look upon the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings
betwixt Thee and my ſoule, and find my
ſhamefull areres, I can be moſt vile in my own
ſight, becauſe I have deſerved to be ſo in thine:
Yet, even then, in thy moſt pure eyes, give me
leave, the whiles, not to abdicate my ſincerity;
thou knoweſt my heart deſires to be right with
thee, what ever my failings may have been; and I
know what value thou putteſt upon thoſe ſincere
deſires, notwithſtanding all the intermixtures of
our miſerable infirmities: Theſe I can penitently
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63681:3"/>
bewaile to thee; but in the meane time, what
have I done to men? Let them not ſpare to
ſhame me with the late ſinfull declinations of my
age, and fetch bluſhes (if they can) from a wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
face.</p>
            <p>Let mine enemies (for ſuch I perceive I have,
and thoſe are the ſureſt monitors) ſay what I
have offended; For their better irritation, my
cleare conſcience bids me boldly to take up the
challenge of good <hi>Samuel, Behold, here I am; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
againſt mee before the Lord, and before his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed;
Whoſe Oxe have I taken? or whoſe Aſſe have
I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I
oppreſſed? or of whoſe hand have I received any bribe
to blinde mine eyes therewith? and I will reſtore it you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can they ſay, that I bore up the reyns of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too hard; and exerciſed my juriſdiction in a
rigorous and tyrannicall way, inſolently Lording
it over my charge? Malice it ſelf, perhaps, would,
but dare not ſpeak it; or, if it ſhould, the atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſo grave and numerous a Clergie would
choak ſuch impudence; Let them witneſſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were not ſtill entertained by me with
an equall returne of reverence, as if they had
been all Biſhops with me, or I onely a Presbyter
with them; according to the old rule of <hi>Egbert</hi>
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Yorke; Intra domum Epiſcopus colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gam
ſe presbyterorum eſſe cognoſcat;</hi> Let them ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought here looked like deſpoticall, or ſounded
rather of imperious commands, then of brotherly
complying; whether I have not rather, from ſome
beholders, undergone the cenſure of a too hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63681:4"/>
remiſneſſe; as perhaps ſtooping too low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the eminence of Epiſcopal dignity; whether
I have not ſuffered as much in ſome opinions, for
the vvinning mildneſſe of my adminiſtration, as
ſome others for a rough ſeverity.</p>
            <p>Can they ſay (for this aſperſion is likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
that I barred the free courſe of religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
by the ſuppreſſion of painfull &amp; peaceable
Preachers? If ſhame will ſuffer any man to object
it, let me challenge him to inſtance but in one
name; Nay, the contrary is ſo famouſly known
in the Weſterne parts, that every mouth will
herein juſtify mee. What free admiſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
have I alwayes given to all the Sons
of peace, that came with Gods meſſage in their
mouthes? What miſ-ſuggeſtions have I wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
What blowes have I borne off in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of ſome of them, from ſome gain-ſayers?
How have I often and publiquely profeſſed, that
as well might we complain of too many ſtars in
the skie, as too many Orthodox Preachers in the
Church?</p>
            <p>Can they complain that I fretted the neckes
of my Clergie with the uneaſie yoake of new,
and illegall impoſitions? Let them whom I have
thus hurt blazon my unjuſt ſeverity, and write
their wrongs in marble: But, if diſliking all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
devices, I have held cloſe to thoſe ancient
rules which limited the Audience of our godly
Predeceſſors; If I have grated upon no mans
conſcience by the preſſure (no not by the tender)
of the late Oath, or any unpreſcribed Ceremonie;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63681:4"/>
If I have freely in the Committee, appointed by
the moſt honourable Houſe of Peeres, declared
my open diſlike in all innovations, both in doctrine
and rites, why doth my innocence ſuffer?</p>
            <p>Can they challenge me as a cloſe, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaire-friend
to Popery or Arminianiſme, who
have in ſo many Pulpits, and ſo many Preſſes,
cryed downe both? Surely, the very paper that
I have ſpent in the refutation of both theſe, is
enough to ſtop more mouthes then can be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this calumnie.</p>
            <p>Can they check me with a lazie ſilence in my
place, with infrequence of preaching? Let the
populous Auditories where I have lived, witneſſe,
whether having furniſhed all the Churches neare
me with able Preachers, I tooke not all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of ſupplying ſuch courſes, as I could get,
in my Cathedrall; and when my tongue was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
let the world ſay whether my hand were
idle.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſince no man can offer to upbraid me
with too much pompe, which is wont to be the
common eye-ſore of our envied profeſſion; Can
any man pretend to a ground of taxing me (as I
perceive one of late hath moſt unjuſtly done)
of too much worldlineſſe? Surely, of all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
forbidden in the Decalogue, there is no one
which my heart upon due examination can leſſe
faſten upon mee then this: He that made it,
knowes that he hath put into it a true diſregard
(ſave onely for neceſſary uſe) of the world, and
of all that it can boaſt of, whether for profit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
or glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63681:5"/>
No, no; I know the world too well to dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; Whiles I am in it, how can I but uſe it?
but I never care, never yeelde to emjoy it. It
were too great a ſhame for a Philoſopher, a
Chriſtian, a Divine, a Biſhop to have his thoughts
groveling here upon earth; for mine, they ſcorn
the imployment; and look upon all theſe ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
diſtractions (as upon this mans falſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure)
with no other eyes then contempt.</p>
            <p>And now; Sir, ſince I cannot (how ſecretly
faulty ſoever) gueſſe at my owne publique ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances,
I beſeech you, where you heare my
name traduced, learne of mine accuſers (whoſe
Lyncean eyes would ſeeme to ſee farther into
me then my owne) what ſingular offence I have
committed.</p>
            <p>If perhaps my calling be my crime; It is no
other then the moſt holy Fathers of the Church
in the Primitive and ſucceeding Ages, ever ſince
the Apoſtles, (many of them alſo bleſſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs)
have been guilty of; It is no other then
all the holy Doctors of the Church, in all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
ever ſince, have celebrated, as moſt
reverend, ſacred, inviolable; It is no other, then
all the whole Chriſtian world, excepting one
ſmall handfull of our neighbours, (whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
denyed them the oportunity of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment)
is known to enjoy, without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
How ſafe is it erring in ſuch company?
If my offence be in my pen, which hath (as it
could) undertaken the defence of that Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
inſtitution, (though with all modeſty, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63681:5"/>
faire reſpects to the Churches differing from
us) I cannot deprecate a truth: and ſuch I
know this to bee: which is ſince ſo cleared by
better hands, that I well hope the better-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
world cannot but ſit downe convinced;
Neither doubt I, but that, as metals receive the
more luſtre with often rubbing, this truth, the
more agitation it undergoes, ſhall appeare every
day more glorious. Onely, may the good ſpirit of
the Almighty ſpeedily diſpell all thoſe duſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie
prejudices from the mindes of men, which
may hinder them from diſcerning ſo cleare a
light.</p>
            <p>Shortly then, knowing nothing by my ſelfe,
whereby I have deſerved to alienate any good
heart from me, I ſhall reſolve to reſt ſecurely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the acquiting teſtimony of a good conſcience,
and the ſecret approbation of my gracious God;
who ſhall one day cauſe mine innocence to
breake forth as the morning light, and ſhall give
me beauty for bonds, and for a light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany
affliction, an eternall weight of glory.
To ſhut up all, and to ſurceaſe your trouble. I
write not this, as one that would pumpe for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and reputation from the diſaffected multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
(for I charge you, that what paſſes private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betwixt us, may not fall under common eyes)
but onely with this deſire, and intention, to give
you true grounds, where you ſhall heare my name
mentioned, with a cauſeleſſe offence, to yeeld
mee a juſt and charitable vindication. Go you on

and therefore give me leave (for I will take
it) a little more to betray you to the eyes of men,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63681:7"/>
and more openly to unvaile your baſhfull inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
            <p>I cannot without a vocall compaſſion, behold
your injured vertue, the moſt remarkable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the malignity of our times; which, when
I looked it ſhould receive its crowne from God
and men, quite contrary to my expectation, I
finde caſt downe, and trampled in the duſt.</p>
            <p>It is not full two yeares agoe, when in that
innovating age you ſuffered under ſtorms and
threats from over-buſie inſtruments: every ſtep
waited on by intrapping ſpyes and informers;
and brought ſo far into the mouth of danger, that
that <hi>Accuſer, Kilvert,</hi> durſt openly threaten you,
to be the next man deſigned for his Inquiſition.
How often have you ſtood as a ſhield betweene
thoſe men and danger, who can now complain
you are a Biſhop; when, if you had not been
ſo, where had they been at this houre? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of thoſe Antiprelaticall men, even the moſt
rigid of them, have we heard bleſſing God for
ſuch a Dioceſan, by whoſe proviſion and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
great hath been the company of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;
and acknowledging the Sun of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
with your approach, ſetting in your Weſtern
Sea, or rather riſing there, in more perfect lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre,
when the world juſtly complained it went
downe in ſome other parts of the Kingdome?
What prayers, what praiſes, what wiſhes were
then, on all ſides, poured out for you? I ſhould
be accounted your flatterer, ſhould I but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
them: Whereas now in theſe dayes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63681:7"/>
when you might juſtly expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of your former ſufferings, as deſerving
(let me confidently ſpeak it) the greateſt ſhare,
I ſee you as much driven at, one the other ſide,
by an ignorant fury of thoſe you defend, and
ſmarting as an enemy to that truth, the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of which hath raiſed againſt you ſo many
dangerous adverſaries. I find you ſtill the ſame
man you were before; and yet, what is ſtrange,
groaning under the ſame burthen of cenſure, and
worſe, from quite contrary hands; even from
thoſe, whoſe duty it is to promote and vindicate
you; and yet who think they doe that very truth
you maintaine good ſervice, in puniſhing you its
defender. A miſerably miſguided zeale! <hi>Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> In the
meane time, what have they to anſwer for, who
when they can finde no reall blemiſh upon you,
dare like the Romiſh Imagers in <hi>Q. Maries</hi> dayes,
paint fiends and faults upon your coat; as thoſe
cunningly-cruell men, in the Primitive times,
cloathing the harmleſſe Chriſtian Martyrs with
the skins of ſalvage Bears and Bulls, that they
might be baited, and torne by the deceived Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiffes,
which would have fawned upon them,
had they appeared in their owne ſhapes: But I
forbeare; Onely this, my Lord, if you thus ſink,
and ſuffer under evill and killing tongues, happy,
thrice happy are you; you know one hath ſaid
it, that will make it good: I ſhall not, I ſeriouſly
profeſſe, pity, but envy you, for having this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
honour to expire among ſcoffes, and unjuſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63681:8"/>
ignominy, with our great Maſter. And therefore
now, rouze up thoſe drooping ſpirits, which age
and reſtleſſe labours have left you; fixe your eyes
ſtedfaſtly, with bleſſed <hi>Stephen,</hi> upon heaven,
and reſt your thoughts there, as no doubt you
doe, with a calme and ſmiling confidence; and
know, every ſtone is throwne at you, ſhall turn
a precious one, to deck your crowne of glory.
Into the boſome of our gracious God, whom we
have thus long ſerved, and enjoyed together, I
ſecurely commend you; And, till I meet you in
another world, however this world judge of you,
ſhall continue a conſtant lover of your tryed
goodneſſe.</p>
