            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

His haire stood a little upright, and the sweet cast, and motion of his eyes made him very gracefull. He was sober, and temperate in his Diet, contenting himself with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meates; and when once in his sicknesse, his <hi>Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> advised him to eate a <hi>Thrush,</hi> and none could be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, a Friend told him, that <hi>Lucullus</hi> (a certain great man) kept them all the year, where he should be sure not to fail; he replyed, <hi>What then?

               <hi>Pompey</hi> being a young man, and in the Field with his Father, who was in Armes against <hi>Cinna,</hi> there lay with him in his Tent a Companion of his, called <hi>Lucius Terentius,</hi> who being corrupted with money, promised <hi>Cinna</hi> to slay <hi>Pompey,</hi> and other of his Confederates had promised to set their Generals Tent on fire. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was discovered to <hi>Pompey</hi> as he sat at supper, which nothing amazed him, but he drank freely, and was merrier with <hi>Terentus</hi> than ordinary:<note place="margin">His cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Presently after his Fathers death,<note place="margin">He is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.</note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> being his heir, he was accused for robbing the common Treasury, and in particular for taking certain toiles, and cords of Hunters nets: He confessed the having of them, and that his Father gave him them when the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Asculum</hi> was taken; but that he had since lost them, when <hi>Cinna</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> with his Army, at which time the unruly Souldiers, breaking into his House, plundred him of all that he had. This matter had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes of hearing before it was determined, in which time <hi>Pompey</hi> shewed so much courage, and Prudence in managing of it, that he wan such credit, and favour by it, that <hi>Antistius,</hi> who at that time was <hi>Praetor,</hi> and Judge of the cause, fell into such a liking of him, that secretly he offered him his Daughter in marriage, and <hi>Pompey</hi> liked so well of the match, that the parties were privately made sure each to other:<note place="margin">And cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> And not long after, through the care, and paines of <hi>Antisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> when the Judges came to passe Sentence, <hi>Pompey</hi> was cleered.</p>

               </hi> succeeded; and at this time the <hi>Romans,</hi> being grievously oppressed by one Tyrant after an other, thought themselves happy in the change of Governours. For their City was brought into such mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as hoping no more to see <hi>Rome</hi> recover her lost liberty, they desired yet a more tollerable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sylla</hi>'s time <hi>Pompey</hi> was at a place in <hi>Italy</hi> called <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </note> in the Marches of <hi>Ancona,</hi> where he had certain Lands, but much more the love and favour of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens for his Fathers sake. He seeing that the most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men of <hi>Rome</hi> forsook their Houses, and estates to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the camp of <hi>Sylla,</hi> as unto a place of safety, he also resolved to go thither, yet not in a base manner, like a Fugitive, but purposed to raise an Army, and to go in an Honourable manner as one that could doe <hi>Sylla</hi> good service. So he made tryall of the good will of the <hi>Picentines,</hi> who readily joyned with him, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there was amongst them one <hi>Vindius,</hi> who opposed <hi>Pompey,</hi> saying, <hi>That a Boy that came from School but the other day, must now in hast be a Captain,</hi> the rest of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens were so incensed against him, that they ran upon him and slew him.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> being but twenty three years old, not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying for Commission from any man, took upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Authority, and causing a Tribunall to be set up in the mid'st of the market place of <hi>Auximum,</hi> a great, and Populous City, he commanded the two Brethren, called the <hi>Ventidians</hi> (the chiefest men of the City, but his enemies) presently to avoid the City: Then began he to leavy men to constitute Captaines, Leiutenants, Sergeants, and such other Officers as appertain to an Army. And from thence he went to the other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Cities, where he did the like, so that in a short
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109804:4"/>
space he had gotten three compleat Legions together, as also Amunition, Carts, and all other necessaries,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> raised an Army,</note> for them.</p>
            <p>In this sort did <hi>Pompey</hi> advance towards <hi>Sylla</hi>; not in hast,<note place="margin">He goes towards <hi>Sylya.</hi>
               </note> as a man that was afraid to be met with by the way, but by small Journeyes, lodging still where he might have the best advantage against an enemy, causing the Cities wheresoever he came to declare against <hi>Carbo,</hi> and for <hi>Sylla.</hi> Yet three Captains who adhered to <hi>Carbo, Carinna, Caelius,</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> did in three severall places compasse him in on every side, thinking to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed him. <hi>Pompey</hi> was nothing amazed hereat, but marshalling his Army, he first set upon <hi>Brutus,</hi> having placed his Horsemen (amongst whom himself was in Person) before the Battel of his Footmen,<note place="margin">His dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by the way.</note> and when the men at Armes of his enemy (who were <hi>Gauls</hi>) came to charge upon him, he singled out the chiefest amongst them, and ran him through with his Spear, and slew him. The other <hi>Gauls</hi> seeing their Champion slaine,<note place="margin">His Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> turned their backs, and in their flight, over ran their own Footmen; so that at last they all fled for their lives.</p>
            <p>Then the Cities round about, being terrified with this overthrow, came in and yeilded themselves to <hi>Pompey</hi>: Afterwards <hi>Scipio</hi> also the Consul, coming against <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> to fight him, when the Battels were ready to joyn, before they threw their Darts, <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Souldiers saluted <hi>Pompey,</hi> and went over to his side, whereupon <hi>Scipio</hi> was faign to fly. And lastly <hi>Carbo</hi> himself sending di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Troops of Horse against him by the River <hi>Arsis, Pompey</hi> charged them so furiously, and drave them into such a place of disadvantage, that being neither able to fight nor fly, they delivered up themselves with their Horses, Armes, and all to his mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylla</hi> all this while heard nothing of these overthrows which <hi>Pompey</hi> had given to his enemies, but understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his danger, being environed with so many Armes,

            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> being informed of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s approach, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Captaines to Arme themselves and to set their Army in good array, that their Generall <hi>Sylla</hi> might see how bravely they were appointed. For he expected that <hi>Sylla</hi> would do him great honour,<note place="margin">He meets <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </note> as indeed he did, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven beyond his expectation: For when <hi>Sylla</hi> saw him afar off, coming towards him, and his Army marshalled in such good order of Battell, and his men so bravely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing themselves, being elated with their late Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he alighted from his Horse; and when <hi>Pompey</hi> came to do his duty to him, and called him Emperour, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Prince, <hi>Sylla</hi> resaluted him with the same Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which made all that were present to wonder that he would give so honourable a name to so young a man as <hi>Pompey</hi> was,<note place="margin">

For when <hi>Pompey</hi> at any time came to him, he would rise up, and put off his Cap to him, which he did not to any other Noble man that was about him: Yet was not <hi>Pompey</hi> puffed up with all this, nor the prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for it.</p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Sylla</hi> would have sent <hi>Pompey</hi> into <hi>Gaul</hi> (now <hi>France</hi>) because that <hi>Metellus,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall there, was thought to have done no exploit worthy of so great an Army as he had with him: But <hi>Pompey</hi> answered, that there was no reason to displace an ancient Captain that was of greater fame, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence then himself,<note place="margin">His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.</note> 
               <hi>Yet</hi> (said he) <hi>if</hi> Metellus <hi>himself be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and will desire it of me, I will willingly go, and help him to end this War. Metellus</hi> being informed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wrote for him to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> then entering <hi>Gaul,</hi> did of himself wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full explots, and so revived the courage, and valour

of old <hi>Metellus,</hi> that the War prospered exceedingly in their hands:<note place="margin">His acts ni <hi>Gaul.</hi>
               </note> But these were but <hi>Pompey</hi>'s first beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and were wholly obscured by the luster of those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wars, and great Battels which he fought after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Sylla</hi> had over come all <hi>Italy,</hi> and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>Dictator,</hi> he rewarded all the great Captains, and Leiutenants that had taken his part, and advanced them to honourable places, and Dignities in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, freely granting whatsoever they requested of him; But for <hi>Pompey,</hi> highly esteeming him for his Valour, and thinking that he would be a great support to him in all his Wars, he sought by some meanes to ally him to himself, <hi>Metella,</hi> his Wife being also of the same opinion,<note place="margin">His se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond marriage.</note> they both perswaded him to put away his Wife <hi>Antistia,</hi> and to marry <hi>Aemilia,</hi> who was Daughter to <hi>Metella</hi> by a former Husband, though she was married to an other, and now with child by him. These marriages were wicked, and Tyrannicall,<note place="margin">Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings</note> fitter for <hi>Sylla</hi>'s time, than agreeable to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s nature, and condition. And truly it was a shamefull thing for <hi>Pompey</hi> to forsake his Wife <hi>Antistia,</hi> who for his sak?, a little before had lost her Father, that was murthered in the very Senate House upon suspition that he took part with <hi>Sylla</hi> for his Son <hi>Pompey</hi>'s sake: and to take <hi>Aemilia</hi> from her lawfull Husband, by whom she was great with child, and to whom she had been married not long before: which also caused the Mother of <hi>Antistia</hi> to lay violent hands upon her self, seeing her Daughter to receive such open and notorious wrong. But God who hates such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, and cruelty, followed <hi>Pompey</hi> with this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that his Wife <hi>Aemilia</hi> died miserably presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in childbirth in his House.</p>
            <p>About this time newes was brought to <hi>Sylla,</hi> that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penna</hi> was gotten into <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and had brought all that Island into subjection to him, where he might safely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain all <hi>Sylla</hi>'s enemies: That <hi>Carbo</hi> also kept the Seas thereabouts with a certaine number of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>Against all these was <hi>Pompey</hi> sent by his Father in Law with a great Army,<note place="margin">He is sent into <hi>Sicily.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> dealt as cruelly also with <hi>Quintus Valerius,</hi> a man of rare parts, and excellent Learning, who being brought to <hi>Pompey,</hi> he took him aside, and walked a few turns with him, and when he had learned what he could of him, he commanded his Guard to take him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and dispatch him. <hi>Pompey</hi> indeed was compelled to make away all <hi>Sylla</hi>'s enemies that fell into his hands: But for the rest, all that he could suffer secertly to steale away, he willingly connived at it, and would not take notice of it, yea, himself did help many to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by flight.</p>
            <p>

            <p>After this <hi>Pompey</hi> being informed that his Souldiers did kill divers in the high-wayes,<note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> he caused all their Swords to be sealed up, and whose s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> being returned to <hi>Vtica,</hi> he received Letters from <hi>Sylla,</hi> willing him to discharge his Army, and to retain on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one Legion with himself till the comming of another Captain that was to succeed him in the Government of that Country.<note place="margin">He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to disband his Army.</note> This grieved him not a little, though he made no shew of it at all: But the Souldiers were much offended at it, and when <hi>Pompy</hi> prayed them to depart, they gave out broad speeches against <hi>Sylla,</hi> and told him directly that they were resolved not to leave him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever became of them, and that they would not leave him to trust to a Tyrant. <hi>Pompey,</hi> seeing that he could not prevaile with them,<note place="margin">His Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers love to him.</note> rose out of his seat, and went into his Tent weeping: But the Souldiers followed him, and brought him again to his Chaire of State, intreating him to remaine there, and command them, and he desired them to obey <hi>Sylla,</hi> and to leave their mutinies. In fine, he seeing they were resolved to presse him, swore that he

would kill himself rather then they should compel him, yet scarce did they leave him thus.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it was reported to <hi>Sylla</hi> that <hi>Pompey</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled against him; which when he heard, he said to his Friends, <hi>Well, I see then that it is my destiny in my old age to fight with children.</hi> This he said, because of <hi>Marius</hi> the yonger, who had done him much mischief, and had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endangered him.

               </note> and hearing that all generally in <hi>Rome</hi> would go to meet <hi>Pompey,</hi> and receive him with all the honour they could, he resolved to go beyond them all in shew of good will: wherefore going out of his House to meet him, he embraced him with great affection, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed him home, calling him <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>Pompey</hi> required the honour of a Triumph, which <hi>Sylla</hi> opposed, affirming that this honour should be granted to none but to such as had been Consuls, or at least <hi>Praetors</hi>: He told him also, that if he should stand for it he would oppose him. <hi>Pompey</hi> was not discouraged herewith, but boldly told him, <hi>That all men did honour, not the setting, but the rising Sun. Sylla</hi> heard not well what he said, and therefore enquired, and when it was told him, he wondred at the Confidence of so young a man, and cryed out twice, <hi>Let him then Triumph on Gods Name.</hi> Yet many were offended at it,<note place="margin">His first Triumph.</note> but <hi>Pompey</hi> to anger them more, would be brought in his Triumphant Chariot drawn by four Elephants, many of which Beasts he had taken from the Kings, and Princes whom he had subdued: Howbeit the Citie Gates being too narrow for them, he was faign to leave his Elephants, and to be drawn in with Horses.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Sylla</hi> also discovered his ill will to <hi>Pompey,</hi> in that when he made his Will, he gave Legacies to every one of his Friends, and left <hi>Pompey</hi> wholly out: yet did <hi>Pompey</hi> take it well enough, and whereas <hi>Lipidus,</hi> with some others,<note place="margin">

This Victory so encouraged <hi>Pompey,</hi> that he hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fight with <hi>Sertorius</hi> himself before <hi>Metullus</hi> came to him, that he might have the sole Glory of the Conquest. So they both met by the River of <hi>Sueron</hi> in the evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:109804:9"/>
both fearing the comming of <hi>Metellus,</hi> the one that he might fight alone, the other that he miget fight with one alone. But when it came to triall, the Victory fell out doubtfull, for either of their wings had the upper hand: <hi>Sertorius</hi> wan great honour in this Battell, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all before him wheresoever he went: and <hi>Pompey</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering a great man at Armes, cut off one of his hands, yet he escaped by turning up his Horse with very rich caparisons amongst <hi>Pompey</hi>'s followers, and whilest they were contending about the Horse, he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped.</p>
            <p>The next morning very early, both the Generals brought their Armies again into the Field, to confirme the Victory, which either of them supposed that he had gotten: But <hi>Metellus,</hi> comming to <hi>Pompey</hi> at that present, <hi>Sertorius</hi> retreated, and dispersed his Army. <hi>Pompey</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meet <hi>Metellus</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they came near, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Sergeants, and Officers to put down their bundles of Rods, and Axes which they carried before him, to honour <hi>Metellus</hi> the more, being a better man than himself: But <hi>Metellus</hi> would not suffer it, but in every thing made <hi>Pompey</hi> his equall, only when they Camped together, <hi>Metellus</hi> gave the watch word to all the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sertorius</hi> with a running Army, cut them short of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, spoiling the Country, and keeping the Sea-side, so that they were foced to divide themselves and to goe into other places for provision. <hi>Pompey</hi> in the mean time having spent most of his estate in this War, sent to <hi>Rome</hi> for money to pay his Souldiers, threatening that if they would send him no money, he would return with his Army into <hi>Italy. Lucullus</hi> being now Consul, though he was <hi>Pompey</hi>'s enemy, yet procured the money for him, that himself might the better prevaile to be sent against King <hi>Methridates</hi>: for he feared that if <hi>Pompey</hi> returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> he would procure to have that imployment.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Sertorius</hi> died, and <hi>Perpenna,</hi> who was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the chiefest man about him, supplied his room. But

though he had the same Army, the same meanes, and the same power, yet had he not the same wit, and skill to use it. <hi>Pompey</hi> therefore marching directly against him, quickly discovered his insufficiency, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> remained in <hi>Spain</hi> till he had pacified all tumults, and then went with his Army back into <hi>Italy,</hi> and arrived just when the War of the Bondmen and Eencers, led by <hi>Spartacus,</hi> was in the greatest fury. Upon <hi>Pompey</hi>'s comming, <hi>Crassus</hi> being sent Generall against them, made haste to give them battell, wherein he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them and slew twelve thousand and three hundred of these fugitive slaves.

The <hi>Romans</hi> receiving these Letters, were very glad of the newes for the love which they bore to him.

went forth to meet him out of fear, as out of good will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But when he told them, that he would disband his Army so soon as he had Tryumphed, then his ill-willers could blame him for nothing, but that he inclined more to the People than to the Nobles; and because he desired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Tribuneship to the People, which <hi>Sylla</hi> had pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the love which they had shewed to him. This was the second Tryumph, and the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship which the Senate decreed to <hi>Pompey,</hi> which made him neither the greater, nor the better man. Yet was it such an Honour, as <hi>Crassus</hi> (the richest, greatest, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentest man in <hi>Rome</hi>) durst not demand before he had requested <hi>Pompey</hi>'s good will therein: And truely <hi>Pompey</hi> was very glad of the request, having of a long time sought an opportunity whereby to gratifie him, and therefore he made earnest suit to the People for him, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them that he would as much thank them for making <hi>Crassus</hi> his fellow-Consul, and Colleague, as he would for making himself Consul.</p>
            <p>Yet when <hi>Pompey</hi> had obtained his request, and they were both created Consuls, they were in all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to the other, and never agreed in any one thing whilest they ruled together: <hi>Crassus</hi> had the more authority with the Senate, and <hi>Pompey</hi> with the People: for he restored to them the Office of Tribunes, and passed by Edict, that the Knights of <hi>Rome</hi> should have power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to Judg in Causes both Civil and Criminall. This wonderfully pleased the people, when himself came in Person to the Censors, and pray'd that he might be dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with for going to the Wars.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Gellius</hi> and <hi>Lentulus</hi> were the Censors, who being honourably set in their Tribunal seats, taking a view of all the <hi>Romane</hi> Knights that mustered before
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109804:10"/>
them, they marvelled when they saw <hi>Pompey</hi> comming, with all the Ensignes of a Consul borne before him, and himself (as other Knights did) leading his Horse by the bridle: and when he came neer, he commanded the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants that carried the Axes before him, to make room for him to pass by the Barrs with his Horse,<note place="margin">His Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty·</note> where the Censors sate. This made the People to flock about him, wondring and rejoycing with great silence: the Censors themselves also were marvellous glad to see him so obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Law, and did him great reverence. Then did the elder of the Censors examine him thus; <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, <hi>I pray thee tell me, if thou didst serve so long in the war as the Law doth appoint? Pompey</hi> answered aloud, Yes verily have I done, &amp; that under no Captain but my self. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hearing this, shouted aloud for joy, and the Censors themselves came down from their seats, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pompey</hi> to his House, to please the great multitude that followed him, clapping their hands for joy.</p>
            <p>At the end of their Consulship, grudges growing high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er between <hi>Crassus,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> there was one <hi>Gaius Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> a Knight, who till then had never spoken in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assembly: He getting up into the Pulpit for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, told the People openly, that that night <hi>Jupiter</hi> had appeared to him, and commanded him to tell both the Consuls from him, that they should not leave their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice before they were reconciled together: Yet for all this <hi>Pompey</hi> stirred not: But <hi>Crassus</hi> took him by the hand, and spake thus before the People; <hi>My Lords! I think it no disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to me to give place to</hi> Pompey, <hi>sith you your selves have thought him worthy to be called</hi> the Great, <hi>before he had any haire on his face, and to whom you granted the honour of two Tryumphs before he came to be a Senator.</hi> Having thus spoken, they were reconciled together, and so gave up their Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crassus</hi> after this, retired to his former manner of life, and <hi>Pompey,</hi> as much as he could, avoided pleading mens causes in publick, and by degrees withdrew himself from frequenting the Market-place, and came seldom abroad,

but when he did, he had alwayes a great traine following him.<note place="margin">His pride.</note> It was a rare thing to see him to be familiar with any one, or to come abroad but with a great company of attendants.</p>

For they did not only rob and spoil all Marchants by Sea, but plundred Islands, and Cities upon the Sea-coast, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as men of great Nobility, and Wealth joyned with them, and they set up store-houses in divers places, and had Beacons to give warning by fire all along the Sea-coasts, which were well watched: they had also great Fleets of Ships well furnished, with excellent Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liots, skilfull Pilots, and Marriners: their Ships were swift of Sail, and Pinnaces for discovery. All the Sea-coast over there was Musick, singing, and rioting amongst them: Prizes were daily brought in, Persons of quallity taken prisoners, and put to great ransome. Their Ships were a Thousand in number, and they had taken four hundred Towns. They had Spoiled and destroyed many Temples that had never been pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They had many strange Sacrifizes and Ceremonies of Religion amongst them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all other insolences and injuries which they did the <hi>Romans</hi> by Sea, they often went on Land, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and destroyed their Country Houses; and once they took two <hi>Roman Praetors</hi> in their purple Robes, with their Sergeants and Officers, and carried them quite away. At another time they surprised the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Antonius</hi> (a man that had the honour of a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph) as as she was walking in the Fields, and put her to a great Ransome. And further to dispite the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they had taken any of them, and they told them that they were Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> they would cloath

them like <hi>Romans,</hi> and putting out the Shipladder they would bid them be gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> and if they refused they would throw them overboard, and drown them.</p>
            <p>These Pirats had all the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas at their command, that a Marchant durst scarce look out, or traffique any whether. This moved the <hi>Romans</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a famine by their means) to send <hi>Pompey</hi> to recover the Dominion of the Seas from them. The first man that moved that <hi>Pompey</hi> might not only be made Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall at Sea,<note place="margin">

It gave him power also to choose out of the Senate fifteen Leiutenants,<note place="margin">His large Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</note> and to give to every of them severall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in charge, and also to take money out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sury to defray the charges of a Fleet of two hundred Saile, with full power besides to leavy what men of War he thought good, and as many Galliots, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners as he pleased.</p>
            <p>This Law was confirmed by the People. Yet the Nobility, and chiefe Senators thought that this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity did exceed, not only all envy, but that it gave them apparent cause of fear to give such unlimited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to a single Person: whereupon they were all against it but <hi>Caesar,</hi> who promoted it, not so much to favour <hi>Pompey,</hi> as to ingratiate himself with the People. But the Noblemen fell out with <hi>Pompey,</hi> and one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls was very hot with him, told him that he sought to follow <hi>Romulus</hi> his steps, but peradventure he would come short of that end he made: This so provoked the People that they had thought to have killed him: But <hi>Catulus,</hi> a worthy man, spake also against this Edict, yet spake much in the praise of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

avised the People not to adventure a man of so great account in such dangerous Wars; <hi>For</hi> (said he) <hi>if you chance to lose him, whom have ye then to put in his place?</hi> The People cried out, <hi>Your selfe.</hi> After this, seeing how the People were bent, he spake no more.</p>
            <p>Next after him <hi>Rosoius</hi> would have preswaded them to have sent an other with <hi>Pompey</hi> as his Colleague, but the People made such an outcry against him, that a Crow flying over the Market place fell to the Ground.<note place="margin">His Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> Upon the day when the Decree was to be fully passed, <hi>Pompey</hi> went forth of the City, and when he understood that it was confirmed, he returned the same night pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, to avoid the envy they would have borne him if the People should have flocked in multitudes to have waited on him home.</p>
            <p>The next morning he came abroad, and Sacrificed to the Gods, and audience being given him in a publick meeting, he so handled the matter that they much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his power, almost doubling the preparations, which were at first Decreed to him. For it was ordained that he should have five hundred Ships, one hundred and twenty thousand Footmen, and five thousand Horsemen. He chose also twenty four Senators, all of them having been Generals of Armies, and two Generall Treasurers. Whilest these things were preparing, the price of Victuals fell, which rejoyced the People much, and they said openly, that the very Name of <hi>Pompey</hi> had almost end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the War already.</p>

               <hi>Pompey</hi> divided all the Sea into thirteen Divisions, and in each of them he appointed a certain number of Ships, and a Leiutenant over each of them:<note place="margin">His Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</note> and by thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersing his Navy all abroad, he brought all the Pirates Ships that were in a Fleet within his danger, and when he had taken them, he brought them all into an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

            <p>Before <hi>Pompey</hi> was chosen Generall against the Pirates, young <hi>Metellus</hi> was sent <hi>Praetor</hi> into <hi>Creet,</hi> who finding it to be a den of these Thieves, he took many of them, and put them to Death: the rest that escaped, being straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly besieged by him, sent unto <hi>Pompey,</hi> craving pardon, and desiring him to receive them to mercy: <hi>Pompey</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly pardoned them, and wrote to <hi>Metellus,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him to give over that War, commanding the Cities also that they should not obey <hi>Metellus.</hi> He sent also <hi>Lucius Octavius,</hi> one of his Leiutenants, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Towns besieged by <hi>Metellus,</hi> and fought against him in the behalfe of the Pirates. This act of

               <hi>Pompey</hi> procured him much ill will, for that he fought for the common enemies of the world,<note place="margin">His envy.</note> who had neither God nor Law, and that only to deprive a <hi>Roman Praetor</hi> of his Triumph, who had done such good service against them.

The Senate stuck not so much at the injury offered to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> depriving him of the honour of his doings, and giving it to another, but that which most grived them was, to see <hi>Pompey</hi>'s power established into a plain Tyranny: Hereupon they encouraged one another to oppose it to the uttermost: yet when the day came for the passing of this Law, they all drew back for fear of angring the People, and none durst oppose it: Only <hi>Catulus</hi> inveied against it a long time together: But say what he could, the Decree passed by the voices of the Tribes.

            <p>When <hi>Pompey</hi> by Letters from <hi>Rome</hi> was informed what Law the People had past in his behalfe, he seemed to be much grieved that such great Offices, and charges should be laid upon him one in the neck of another, and clapping his hand on his thigh he said, <hi>O Gods! shall I never see an end of these troubles?</hi>

               </gap>nds contention between him and <hi>Lucullus,</hi> which his deeds forth with discovered.</p>
            <p>Hereupon he sent forth his Precepts into all quarters, requiring all Souldiers immediatly to repaire to him,<note place="margin">His Prid.</note> and caused all the Kings, and Princes within his juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to attend him, and so, going through all the Countries, he changed all that <hi>Lucullus</hi> had before esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. He also released the penalties that were imposed upon them, and took from them, all the favours that <hi>Lucullus</hi> had granted them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucullus</hi> finding himself so hardly dealt with, Friends on both sides mediated a meeting betwixt them, that they might talk together, and accordingly they met in <hi>Galatia,</hi> having their Sergeants, and Officers with Rods wreathed about with Lawrell carried before them, which shewed that <hi>Pompey</hi> came to take <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from him. Indeed <hi>Lucullus</hi> had been Consul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pompey,</hi> and was the older man, yet <hi>Pompey</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in Dignity, having Triumphed twice.

            <p>
               <hi>Lucullus</hi> when he was gone, divided the Lands in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia</hi> which he had conquered,<note place="margin">He crosses <hi>Lucullus.</hi>
               </note> and bestowed other gifts upon them. <hi>Pompey</hi> on the other side, Camping hard by him, commanded the People every where not to obey him: He took his Souldiers also from him, leaving him only sixteen hundred, choosing out such
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109804:14"/>
as he thought would do him small service. He ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished his Glory also, telling every one that <hi>Lucullus</hi> had fought only with the shadow and pomp of those two Kings, and that he had left him to fight with all their force, and power. <hi>Lucullus</hi> on the other side said, that <hi>Pompey</hi> went only to fight with such as himself had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and that he sought the honour of Triumph over <hi>Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> as he had formerly practiced to Triumph for overcoming a few Slaves and fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucullus</hi> being now gone, <hi>Pompey</hi> sent strong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons into all the Sea coast from <hi>Phoenicia</hi> to the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> and then marched towards <hi>Methridates,</hi> who had in his Camp thirty thousand Footmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and two thousand Horsemen, yet durst he not fight, but encamped upon an high Mountain till he was forced to leave it for lack of Water.<note place="margin">His<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wars with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Pompey</hi> built a City in the place where he gained this Victory betwixt the Rivers of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Araxes,</hi> situate in <hi>Armenia</hi> the Lesse,<note place="margin">He builds a City.</note> which he called <hi>Nicopolis.</hi> This City he gave by the consent of his Souldiers, to such of them as were old, lame, sick, wounded, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded: to whom many of the Neighbours afterwards repairing, the <hi>Nicopolitans</hi> lived after the manner of the <hi>Cappad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> finding this troublesome War to be so easily ended, presently left <hi>Arabia,</hi> and by speedy marches he came to the City of <hi>Amisus.</hi> There he met with great Presents which were sent him from <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dead Bodies of the Kings kindred, and the Body of <hi>Methridates</hi> himself, who was known by certaine scars in his face.<note place="margin">His poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> would by no meanes see him, but to avoid envy he sent him away to the City of <hi>Sinope.</hi> He much wondred at his rich Apparrell, and Weapons: The Scabbard of his Sword cost four hundred Talents: His Hatt also was of wonderous workmanship. <hi>Pompey</hi> having here ordered all things according to his mind, he went homewards with great pomp, and Glory.

            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:109804:19"/>At his return into <hi>Italy</hi> he expected to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived very honourably, and longed to see his Wife,<note place="margin">He returns into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> and Children, thinking also that they longed as much to see him: But God so ordered it, that in his own House he met with occasion of sorrow: For his Wife <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> in his absence had played the Harlot.

            </p>
            <p>But when <hi>Pompey</hi> came to <hi>Italy,</hi> calling his Souldiers together,<note place="margin">He dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands his Army.</note> he made an Oration to them as the time and occasion required, and then commanded them to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and every one to returne to his own home, and to follow his businesse till the time of his Triumph.

            <p>At this time there was a Law that no man should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Rome</hi> before his Triumph, wherefore <hi>Pompey</hi> sent to the Senate, requesting them to defer the choise of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls for a few dayes, that he might further <hi>Piso,</hi> who sued for the Consulship that year: But through <hi>Catoes</hi> meanes they denyed his request. <hi>Pompey</hi> marvelling to hear of his boldnesse and free speech, was very desirous to make him his Friend. So <hi>Cato</hi> having two Neeces, he desired to marry one himself, and to have the other for his Son;<note place="margin">He seeks to win <hi>Cato.</hi>
               </note> but <hi>Cato</hi> flatly denied him, though his Wife, and Sister

were angry that he refused to make alliance with <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Pompey</hi> being desirous to prefer <hi>Afranius</hi> to be Consul, he caused money to be given to the Tribes of the People which being reported abroad, made every man speak evil of him, as having put the Consulship to sale for money, whereas himself had Purchased it by his Noble and valiant deeds.</p>
            <p>The time for his Triumph being come, the stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and magnificence was such, that though he had two dayes to shew it,<note place="margin">His second Triumph·</note> yet lacked he time to produce all.

Moreover he had replenished with Inhabitants thirty nine desolate Towns. These Tables also declared, that the Revenue of <hi>Rome,</hi> before these his Conquests, arose but to five thousand Myriads, but now he had improved them to eight thousand, and five hundred Myriads.

But when his Father in Law was accused, he sent for three hundred and sixty Judges home to his House, praying them to help him, which the accuser of <hi>Scipio</hi> understanding, let fall his suit. <hi>Plancus</hi> also being accused, <hi>Pompey</hi> (contrary to the Law) spake in his commendation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Cato,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</note> who was one of the Judges, stopped his ears, saying, that he would not hear an offender praised, being contrary to the Law: <hi>Plancus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by all the Judges to the great shame of <hi>Pompey.</hi> Yet otherwise he set all things in good order, and chose his Father <hi>Scipio</hi> for his fellow Consul for the five last moneths. Then he caused the Government of his Provinces to be assigned to him for four years more, with commission to take out of the Treasury a Thousand Talents yearly, for ro defray the charges of his Wars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends seeing this, moved that some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration might be had of him also, who made great Wars for the Commonwealth, and by his good service had deserved either to be chosen Consul again, or else that they should prolong his charge, and Government, that no other successor might reap the fruit of his labours; Much stir arose about this matter: But <hi>Pompey</hi> said, that he had received Letters from <hi>Caesar,</hi> by which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested a successour, and to be discharged of this War: adding, that he thought it fit they should grant him the priviledge to demand the second Consulship though he was absent. This <hi>Cato</hi> stoutly withstood, saying,

               <hi>Curio</hi> tequested in the behalfe of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that they would either cause <hi>Pompey</hi> to disband his Army, or else licence <hi>Caesar</hi> to have his Army as well as he.

Yet <hi>Curio, Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Piso</hi> procured that the Senate should decide the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, saying, <hi>All they that would have</hi> Caesar <hi>disband his Army, and</hi> Pompey <hi>to keep his, let them go to the one side of the House, and such as would have them both to disband, let them stand on the other:</hi> by this meanes it was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Pompey.

            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> was not present to see the good will of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators to him; but <hi>Marcellus</hi> stood up and said, that he he would not stand trifling, and hearing Orations, when
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109804:25"/>
he knew that ten Legions were already passed over the <hi>Alps,</hi> intending to come in Armes against them, and that he would send a man that should defend their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try well enough. And so going through the Market place unto <hi>Pompey,</hi> being followed by all the Senators, he said openly: <hi>Pompey, I commnad thee to help thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with that Army thou hast already,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>and also to leavy more to aid thee. Lentulus</hi> also used the same speech to him, who was chosen for the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pompey</hi> went to leavy Souldiers in <hi>Rome,</hi> some would not obey him, and others went very unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the most part of them crying out Peace, Peace. <hi>Anthony</hi> also, against the Senators minds, read a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the People sent from <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The fruits of divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> wherein he seemed to make reasonable requests to draw the affections of the Common People to him.

            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> liked not this motion, and so all treaty of Peace was cut off. In the mean time newes came to <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>Caesar</hi> had won <hi>Ariminum,</hi> a large and strong City in <hi>Italy,</hi>

               </note> Or let us put all to the hazard, and so passed on with his Army.</p>
            <p>Newes hereof comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> never was there such a consternation and fear seen amongst them. For all the Senate ran immediatly to <hi>Pompey,</hi> together with all the rest of the City Magistrates, and <hi>Tullus</hi> asked him, what power he had in readinesse to resist <hi>Caesar</hi>? He answered (but something faulteringly) that he had his two Legions that came from <hi>Caesar,</hi> and with those that he had levied in hast, he thought he should make up thirty thousand fighting men. Then <hi>Tullus</hi> cryed out, <hi>Ah! thou hast mocked us</hi> Pompey; and thereupon ordered Ambassadors to be sent to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> repoach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> 
               <hi>Phaonius</hi> also, a bold man, said, <hi>Stamp now with thy foot upon the ground,</hi> Pompey, <hi>and make those Armies come which thou hast promised. Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> patiently bore this mock. Then <hi>Cato</hi> thought good that they should make <hi>Pompey</hi> Leiutenant Generall of <hi>Rome,</hi> with full and absolute Power to command all, saying, <hi>They that knew how to doe the greatest mischief, know best how to remedy the same.</hi> And so immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he departed to his Government in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Also all the other Senators went to the Provinces whereunto they were appointed.</p>
            <p>Thus all <hi>Italy</hi> being in Armes, no man knew what was best to be done: For such as were out of <hi>Rome</hi> came flying thither out of all parts, and such as were in <hi>Rome,</hi> fled out as fast, where all things were in disorder.

               </gap>would they suffer <hi>Pompey</hi> to order things as he would, because every one followed his own fancy, yea, in one day they were in diverse minds. All this while <hi>Pompey</hi> could hear no certainty of his enemies, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports being so various; and when he saw the tumult, and confussion so great at <hi>Rome</hi> that there was no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility

            <p>Shortly after <hi>Pompey</hi> was gone out of the City, <hi>Caesar</hi> came into it,<note place="margin">

               </note> who spake very friendly to all whom he found there, labouring to quiet their fears: Only he threatned <hi>Metellus,</hi> one of the Tribunes, because he would not suffer him to take any of the Treasure of the Commonwealth, saying, <hi>That it was not so hard a thing for him to kill him as to speak it.</hi> Thus having put by <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and taken what he pleased out of the Treasury, he prepared to follow <hi>Pompey,</hi> intending to drive him out of <hi>Italy</hi> before his Army should come to him, out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> in the meane time took <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and having gotten some Ships together, he caused the two Consuls presently to embark,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> at <hi>Brundu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium.</hi>
               </note> with thirty Companies of Footmen, which he sent before to <hi>Dyrrachium.</hi> He sent also his Father in Law <hi>Scipio,</hi> and his Son <hi>Cneius Pompeyus</hi> into <hi>Syria</hi> to provide him Ships. Then did he fortify <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and guarded the Walls with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, commanding the Citizens not to stir out of their Houses. He cast up Trenches also within the City at the end of all the streets, saving those two which led to the Haven, and filled those Trenches with sharp-pointed stakes, and when at leasure he had imbarked all the rest of his Souldiers, he by a signe, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off those which guarded the Walls, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received them into his Ships,<note place="margin">He leaves <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> he hoisted Sailes and departed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> finding the Walls of <hi>Brundusium</hi> unguarded, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently suspected that <hi>Pompey</hi> was fled, and rushing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, he had certainly falne into the pits,<note place="margin">

he fetched a compasse about to go to the Haven, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, he found all the Ships under saile save two, wherein were a few Souldiers. Some judged this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of <hi>Pompeys</hi> the best Stratagem of War that ever he used: But <hi>Caesar</hi> marvelled that being in so strong a City, and expecting his Army out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Master of the Seas besides, he would so easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake <hi>Italy.</hi> Thus <hi>Caesar</hi> within threescore dayes became Lord of all <hi>Italy</hi> without bloudshed. He was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous speedily to have followed <hi>Pompey,</hi> but having no Ships ready, he was forced to stay. Then did he hasten into <hi>Spain</hi> to joyn <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army with his own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> in the mean space had gotten a marvellous great power together both by Sea,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi>'s power by Sea.</note> and Land. By Sea he had five hundred good Ships of War, besides multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Galliots, Foists, and Pinnaces. By Land he had all the flower of the Horsemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of all <hi>Italy</hi> to the number of seven thousand, Valiant men, and of great Houses: But his Footmen were raw and untrained Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whom <hi>Pompey</hi> continually exercised at the City of <hi>Beraea,</hi> taking as much paines therein as if he had been in his youth. It was great encouragement to others to see <hi>Pompey,</hi> being fifty eight years old, fighting on foot compleatly Armed,<note place="margin">His indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and activity.</note> and then speedily to mount on Horseback, and in his full Career to draw, and put up his Sword, to cast his Dart with as much agility and strength, and point blank, that few young men could do the like.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Pompey</hi> there came diverse Kings, Princes, and Lords of great Countries: and of <hi>Roman</hi> Captains, who had born Office, to the number of a whole Senate. Amongst these,<note place="margin">Many came to him.</note> there came also <hi>Labienus,</hi> who formerly had been <hi>Caesars</hi> great Friend, and an assistant to him in his Wars in <hi>Gaul.</hi> There came also to him <hi>Brutus,</hi> a very Valiant man, who had never before spoken unto <hi>Pompey,</hi> because he thought him guilty of his Fathers Murther, but now he willingly joyned with him as a defender of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109804:27"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberties. <hi>Cicero</hi> himself also, who had written, and given counsel for Peace, thought it a shame not to be amongst the number of those who would hazard their lives in the defence of their Country. There came also <hi>Didius Sextus,</hi> though he was an old man, and lame of one of his legs, whom when <hi>Pompey</hi> saw comming (though others laughed him to scorn, yet) he rose up and went to meet him, judging it a signe of much love when such old men chose rather to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him in danger, than to remaine at home in safety.</p>
            <p>The chief of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army, sitting in Counsel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that no Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> should be put to death, but such as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ell in Battel: That no City subject to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Rome</hi> should be sackt, which made <hi>Pompey</hi>'s part liked the better: And most judged those, enemies both to the Gods, and men, that did not wish him the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Caesar</hi> also shewed himself very courteous,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> curtesy, and mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> and mercifull; for having taken all <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army in <hi>Spain,</hi> he set all the Captaines at liberty, and only reserved the Souldiers to himself: Then comming over the <hi>Alps</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he passed through all <hi>Italy,</hi> and came to <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium</hi> in the Winter time, and from thence, passing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sea he came to the City of <hi>Oricum</hi>: and having <hi>Vibius,</hi> one of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s familiar Friends: with him, whom he had taken Prisoner, he sent him to <hi>Pompey</hi> again to desire that they might meet, and both of them disband their Armies within three dayes, and being reconciled, and having given their Faith each to other, to returne into <hi>Italy</hi> like good Friends together. But <hi>Pompey</hi> durst not trust to these fair words, judging them but snares to entrap him. He therefore suddenly removed to the Sea coast, and took all the places of strength neer to the Sea side, safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lodge his Camp in, and all the Ports, Harbours, and Creeks, fit for Ships to lie in, so that whatsoever Wind blew, it served his turne to bring him either men, Victuals, or money.</p>
            <p>

            <p>For this end <hi>Pompey</hi> preswaded his men to be quiet, and not to stirre: But when <hi>Caesar,</hi> after this last bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being scanted of Victuals, raised his Camp, and departed to go into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> through the Country of the <hi>Atham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some in a jollity would needs saile to <hi>Lesbos,</hi> where <hi>Pompey</hi> had left his Wife <hi>Cornelia,</hi> to carry her the good newes that the War was ended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> calling a Councell, <hi>Affricanus</hi> thought it best to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to win that, as being the chiefest mark they shot at in this War: For whosoever had that, was sure of all <hi>Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Gaul</hi>: He said also, that it was a dishonour to <hi>Pompey</hi> (who should be very tender of his credit) to suffer their Country to be in such bondage, and subjection to slaves, and base flatterers of a Tyrant when as it offered it self as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109804:28"/>
it were, into their hands. But <hi>Pompey</hi> thought it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable for him to fly from <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to make him follow him, since he now had him in chase, nor lawfull before the Gods now to forsake his Father in Law <hi>Scipio,</hi> and many others, who had been Consuls, and who were dispersed up and down <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Thessaly,</hi> who by this meanes would certainly fall into <hi>Caesars</hi> hands, together with their Riches, and Armies. He said also, that they had care enough for the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by drawing their Armies farthest from it, so as they remaining safe and quiet at home, not feeling the miseries of War, might joyfully welcome him home that remained Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>With this determination he followed <hi>Caesar,</hi> not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to give him Battel, but to besiege him and so to cut him short of Victuals: But whilst he pursued him faire and softly, his men cryed out of him, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to War against <hi>Caesar,</hi> but against his own Country, that he might still keep the authority in his hand. <hi>Phaonius</hi> also mocked him, and went crying up and downe, <hi>My Masters, I give you notice that you are like to eat no</hi> Tusculan <hi>Figs this year.</hi> With these and many others such lewde speeches,<note place="margin">Folly.</note> they compelled <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> to submit to their rash and giddy desires, contrary to his more Prudent purpose, and determination, which yet a Generall over so many Nations, and Armies, should not have done. These little considered that he with whom he was to fight, was <hi>Caesar,</hi> who had taken a thousand Townes, and Cities by assault, had subdued above three hundred severall Nations,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> great Victories.</note> had won infinite Battels of the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> and was never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: Had also taken a Million of men Prisoners, and had slaine as many in diverse Battels. Yet <hi>Pompeys</hi> men still vexing him with their importunity, when they were come into the Fields of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> caused him to call a Counsel. There <hi>Labienus</hi> the Generall of the Horsemen, swore before them all, that he would not rerurne from the Battell till he had driven his enemies
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109804:29"/>
out of the Field: and the like Oath did all the rest of the Commanders take.</p>
            <p>The night before the fatall Battel there were heard sudden and fearfull noises in <hi>Pompeys</hi> Camp, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked all the Souldiers. At the changing of the fourth Watch,<note place="margin">Prodigies.</note> there was seen a great light over <hi>Caesars</hi> Camp, like unto a burning Torch which came and fell in <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peys</hi> Camp. In the morning <hi>Caesar</hi> intending to raise his Camp, and to remove to the City of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, whilst his Souldiers were busy in sending away their Bag, and Baggage, some brought <hi>Caesar</hi> word that they saw much Armour, and many weapons carryed too and fro in their Enemies Camp, and heard a great noise and bustling, as of men that were preparing to fight. His Scouts also brought him word that <hi>Pompeys</hi> Van was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready set in Battel array. <hi>Caesar</hi> much rejoyced when he heard this, saying, <hi>Now the day is come that we shall no longer fight with hunger, and want, but with men,</hi> and thereupon gave order that they should presently put out the red coat of Armes upon his Tent, which was the signe used amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> when they were to fight. The Souldiers when they saw that, left their Tents, Carriages and all, and with great Shouts of joy, ran to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so without noise or tumult they were by their Captaines put into Battel array.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> himself led the right wing of his Battel against <hi>Anthony.</hi> The middle Battel he gave to <hi>Scipio</hi> his Father in Law which was right against <hi>Domitius Calvinus</hi>:<note place="margin">The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of <hi>Pharsalia.</hi>
               </note> His left Wing was led by <hi>Lucius Domitius Aenobarbus,</hi> which was guarded by the men at Armes; for all the Horsemen were placed there, to distresse <hi>Caesar</hi> if possibly they could, and to overthrow the tenth Legion, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the valiantest Souldiers that <hi>Caesar</hi> had; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom himself alwayes used to fight in Person. <hi>Caesar</hi> seeing the left Wing of his enemies so strong with the guard of Horsemen, brought six Companys of Foot for a reserve, and placed them behind the tenth Legion, commanding them to stand close, that they might not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109804:29"/>
be discovered by the enemy: and commanded them when the Horsemen should charge upon them, that they should not throw their darts strait forward but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at their faces: For (said he) <hi>These brave Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and fine Dancers, will not endure to have their faces marred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> being an Horseback rode up and down to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how both Armies were marshalled, and perceiving that his enemies stood still in their ranks, expecting the signall of Battel, and that his own Battel waved up and down disorderly, as men unskillfull in the Wars, he feared that they would fly before they were charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore he commanded his Van to stand sleadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their ranks, and to defend themselves in a close fight when they enemy should assault them. But <hi>Caesar</hi> disliked this devise: for thereby (said he) the force of their blowes was lessened, and by with-holding them from giving the charge, that courage was taken away which the assailant carrieth with him when he comes on with fury, it made them also more faintheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in receiving the enemies charge. In <hi>Caesars</hi> Army there were about twenty two thousand fighting men, and in <hi>Pompeys</hi> above twice so many.</p>
            <p>When the signal of Battel was given on either side, and the Trumpets sounded an Alarme, every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look to himself: But a few of the chiefest of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and some <hi>Grecians</hi> that were amongst them, that yet were not entred into the Battell, perceiving the imminent danger, began to bethink themselves to what a sad passe the ambition, and contention between these two great Persons had brought the State of <hi>Rome</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, where were kinsmen against kinsmen, and Brethren against Brethren imbrewing their hands each in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bloud. Whereas, if they could have been contented quietly to Govern what they had conquered, the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire was big enough for them both. Or if that could not have quenched their insatiable desires and thirst after Glory, they had occasion enough offered them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109804:30"/>
against the <hi>Germans,</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi>: Or else they might have proceeded to Conquer <hi>Scythia,</hi> and <hi>India,.</hi> For what <hi>Scythian</hi> Horsemen, or <hi>Parthian</hi> Arrows, or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Riches, could have withstood the power of seventy thousand <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, especially being led by two such Captaines as were <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> whose Names were famous through the World.</p>
            <p>Now when the Fields of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> were covered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> with Horse and men in Armes, after the Signall was given, the first man of <hi>Caesars</hi> Army that advanced forward to give the charge, was <hi>Caius Crassinius,</hi> a Captain of one hundred twenty and five men: and this he did to make good his promise to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who having asked him that morning what he thought of the event of the Battel? he said, <hi>Oh</hi> Caesar! <hi>Thine is the Victory, and this day thou shalt commend me either alive or dead.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he brake out of his rank (many others also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him) and ran into the midst of his enemies,<note place="margin">Valour.</note> making a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> did not make his left wing to advance over suddenly, but staid to see what his Horsemen would do, who had already divided themselves, intending to compasse in <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to force his Horsemen (who were fewer in number) to give back upon his squadron of Foot men, and thereby to disorder them. But on the other side, <hi>Caesars</hi> Horsemen gave back a little, and the six Companies of Footmen that he had placed secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behind them (being three thousand in number) ran suddenly to charge the enemy in the flank and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neer to <hi>Pompeys</hi> Horsemen, they threw their Darts (as <hi>Caesar</hi> had appointed them) full in their faces. The young Gentlemen, being raw Souldiers, and little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting such a manner of fight, had not the hearts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, nor could abide to be hurt in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but turning their heads, and clapping their hands on their faces, they fled shamfully. They being thus
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109804:30"/>
routed, <hi>Caesars</hi> men made no account to follow them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but went presently and charged his Infantry, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally where they had no guard of Horsemen, by which meanes they might be the easiler compassed about. Thus they being charged by these in the Flank and in the Van also by the tenth Legion, finding themselves (contrary to their expectation) compassed about by their enemies, whereas they thought to have environed them, they could no longer make resistance, but were put to the rout also.</p>

Then understanding that his Army by Sea was yet whole, and that <hi>Cato</hi> had gathered together a great number of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers after the overthrow, whom he had transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him into <hi>Africk,</hi> he complained to his Friends for that they had compelled him to fight by Land, and not suffered him to make use of his Fleet, wherein he was the stronger, and that he kept not his Army neere to the Sea, that in case he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried at Land, he might presently have repaired to his Fleet at Sea, and thereby have resisted his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> being driven to atempt somewhat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his small ability, to some Cities he sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, to others he went himself to gather money, wherewith he armed and manned some Ships. But fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sudden approach of his enemie, before he could be in readiness to resist him, he bethought himself to what place he might retire for his better safety, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved that there was never a Province of the <hi>Romans</hi> that was able to secure him, and for other strange Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he thought none safer for him to retire into than <hi>Parthia,</hi> which was able to aid and help him. Some

advised him to go into <hi>Africk</hi> unto King <hi>Juba.</hi> But <hi>Theophanes</hi> the <hi>Lesbian</hi> said, that it was great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> This Speech altered <hi>Pompey</hi>'s mind, and made him resolve to flie into <hi>Egypt:</hi> and so with his wife <hi>Cornelia,</hi> he departed from <hi>Cyprus</hi> in a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Seleucia.</hi> The rest of his Train, imbarked also, some in Galleys, others in Merchants Ships, and so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Sea without danger.</p>

               </note> he steared that way, and sent a messenger before to the King, to certifie him of his arrivall; and to entreat him to give him entertainment: King <hi>Ptolomey</hi> was at this time but a young man, and under him, the whole Realm was governed by one <hi>Photinus.</hi> He therefore assembled a Councell of the chiefest,<note place="margin">A Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell about <hi>Pompey.</hi>
               </note> and wisest of his Court, and when they were met, <hi>Photinus</hi> in the Kings name commanded every man to declare his Judgment about the reception of <hi>Pompey</hi> whether they should inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him or not; and truly it was a sad thing that <hi>Photi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> an Eunuch, and <hi>Theodotus</hi> of <hi>Chio,</hi> who was the Kings Schoolmaster for <hi>Rhetorick</hi>

            <p>All this while <hi>Pompey</hi> rode at Anchour near to the shore, expecting the resolution of this Councell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom their opinions were various, some were for, others against his reception; But <hi>Theodotus</hi> the <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> to shew his eloquence, perswaded them that neither the one, nor the other was to be done.

            <p>This being concluded, <hi>Achillas</hi> took with him <hi>Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> (who had sometimes served under <hi>Pompey</hi>) and <hi>Salvius</hi> a Centurion, and two or three other Souldiers, and so made towards <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Galley, about whom there were at this time the chiefest of his Traine to see what would be the issue of this matter. But when they saw what intertainment he was like to have, and that they came not in that Princely manner, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the hopes that <hi>Theophanes</hi> had put them in, seeing so few men comming towards him in a Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat, they began to mistrust the sequell, and advised <hi>Pompey</hi> to turne back, and to launch again into the sea, whilst he was yet out of the reach of their Darts.

            <p>At this time they saw afarre off diverse of the Kings Gallies which were arming with all speed pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and all the shore was full of Souldiers, so that though <hi>Pompey</hi> and his Friends would have altered their minds, yet they could not tell how to escape, and if they had discovered their mistrust of them, they had given the mutherers a cloak for their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> takes his leave of his Wife and Son.</note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> therefore taking his leave of his Wife <hi>Cornelia,</hi> who lamented his Death before his end, he commanded two of his Centurions to go down before
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109804:33"/>
him into the Boat, and took with him onely <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> one of his Slaves enfranchised, with another Slave called <hi>Scynes.</hi> When <hi>Achilles</hi> reaching out his hand to receive <hi>Pompey</hi> into his boat, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to his Wife, and Son, and repeated these verses of <hi>Sophcoles:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>The man that into Court comes free,</l>
                  <l>Must there in state of bondage bee.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>These were the last words which he spake to them. The Land being far off, when he saw never a man in the boat speak friendly to him, he said unto <hi>Septimius,</hi> Me thinks, my Friend, I should know thee, for thou hast served under me heretofore: the other nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with his head, but gave him no answer. <hi>Pompey</hi> observing these things, took a little Book into his hand, wherein he had written an Oration that he ment to make to King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and began to read it. As they approached to the shore, <hi>Cornelia,</hi> with her Friends about her, stood up in great fear, to see what would become of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and she hoped well when she saw many of the Kings People on the shore, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards <hi>Pompey,</hi> as it were to receive, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him at his landing. But even as <hi>Pompey</hi> took <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> by the hand to rise more easily, <hi>Septimius</hi> came behind him, and thrust him through with his Sword: <hi>Salvius,</hi> and <hi>Achillas</hi> also made at him with their Swords. <hi>Pompey</hi> did no more but took up his gown, with which he covered his face, and took the wounds in a manly manner, only sighing a little.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> is slaine.</note> Thus ended he his Life the very next day after his Birth, being fifty nine years old,</p>
            <p>They which rode at Anchor in their Ships, when they saw him thus murthered, gave such a fearfull cry that it was heard to the shore: And weighing their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors with speed, they hoised Sail and departed, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lusty gale of Wind to help them.

               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:109804:34"/>
had thought to pursue them, but when they, saw they were past their reach, they let them go. Then striking off <hi>Pompeys</hi> Head they threw his Body overboard, where it was a miserable spectacle to all that desired to behold it. <hi>Philip,</hi> his infranche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Bondman, stirred not from it till the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had glutted themselves with looking upon it. Then having washed it with Salt water, and wrapped it up in an old shirt of his own, he sought about the sands, and at last found a piece of an old Fisher-boat, scarse enough to burne all the Body: and as he was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pieces of this Boat together, there came to him an old <hi>Roman,</hi> who in his youth had served under <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> saying, <hi>O Friend, what art thou that preparest the Funerals of</hi> Pompey <hi>the</hi> Great? <hi>Philip</hi> answered, that he was a Bondman of his infranchised. <hi>Well</hi> (said he) <hi>thou shalt not have all this honour alone, Pray thee let me accompany thee in this devout deed, that I may not altogether repent me that I have dwelt so long in a strange Country, where I have endured much misery; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence me, let me have this good happe to touch</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peys <hi>Body, and to help to bury this most famous Captain of the</hi> Romans.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Lucius Lentulus,</hi> not knowing what had happened, comming out of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> sailed by the shore side, and perceiving a Funeral fire, and <hi>Philip</hi> standing by it, he asked him whose Funerall it was? But straight fetching a great sigh, alas (said he) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is <hi>Pompeys</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi> Then he landed a little, and was presently slaine.

               <hi>Caesar</hi> not long after came into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where there were great Wars, at which time <hi>Pompeys</hi> Head was presented to him, but he turned aside and would not see it, abhorring him that brought it as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable murtherer.<note place="margin">The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Then looking on his Signet Ring where on was engraven a Lion holding a Sword, he burst out a weeping. <hi>Achillas</hi> and <hi>Photinus</hi> he put to
