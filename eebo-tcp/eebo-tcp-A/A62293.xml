            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

great Perfection, among whom this famous Master <hi>Vincent Scamozzi,</hi> Chief Builder of the Magnificent City of <hi>Venice,</hi> deserves to be placed in the first and chiefest rank by the consent of all Judicious Artists. Therefore for the benefit of our own Nation, and that it may be made most useful for all Artificers in Building, and Lovers and Practitioners in this most useful Art; who are or may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Royal and Magnificent Structures. The larger Book is here reduced into a smaller Volume, and the Author his given Parts divided into Minutes; whereby the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Rules of Architecture are made plain to ordinary Capacities by <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achym Schuym</hi> an Ingenious Artist. And for your better understanding, take notice, that by Model is signified the Measure of the whole Diameter
<pb facs="tcp:53342:3"/>
of the Column: as for example: Let the Diameter be 18, 16, or 12 Inches, which shall be the Model divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 60 Equal Parts or Minutes, (as you may see in the Diagonal Scale ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) by using which Measure all the Parts of the said Column shall be Proportionable: And this dividing of the Column into 60 Equal Parts or Minutes shall be used to all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns. Also here is added the Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Use of an Ordinary Joynt-Rule fitted with Lines for the ready finding the Lengths and Angles of Rafters and Hips and Collar-Beams in any Square or Bevelling Roofs at any Pitch, and the ready drawing the Architrave, Frieze and Cornice in any Order, with other useful Conclusions by the said Rule.</p>

                     <p>THE height of the uppermost Line AB is taken from the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Cornice (in the sixth Plate) and is divided into 4 ⅞ parts: draw a Line straight up so long as you will, as CA, and divide into 5 equal parts, then divide the uppermost fifth part into 8 parts, and take 7 of them, and setting one foot of the Compasses in the Point C, and the other foot to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost seventh part, draw an Arch of a Circle from that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth part so far as the Line AB may be set on it from A to B, and draw a Line sloping from B to C, and draw every fifth part with the Compasses between the two Lines AC and BC; the undermost drawn Line GL is 1 part, HM 2 parts, IN 3 parts, KO 4 parts of the Line AB divided into 4 ⅞ parts: then to divide the parts so, you must see what use you have thereof in your Cornice, and divide the Line AB into so many parts as there is occasion, as in 3 parts: so draw a Line ⅓ from the point C, and into 4 parts, and draw a Line ¼ from the point C, and then into 5, and draw a Line ⅕ from the point C. Then to strike out the small members of the Cornice, set the Compasses from H to the Line ⅕, the which will give ⅖ parts of the Line AB, then follows ⅙: therefore set your Compasses on F and the Line ⅓, then have you the ⅙ part, next follows the part 1: therefore set your Compasses from G to L, the which is 1 part: then set the Compasses on G and the Line ⅕, the which is then ⅕ parts, then set your Compasses on F and ¼, and add that to GL, and it makes together 1 ⅛ parts, then follow two parts ⅕, then set the Compasses from I to the Line ¼, the which is ¾ parts, then on F and ⅓, which is ⅙ parts, then on H and 1/<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Author gives well the dividing the members in general of the Ornament, Impost and Arch with the Base and Cimacia, but not so plain in particular how much every member must be. There have been several Lovers of the Art have endeavoured to find out the dividing of the minutes. So I thought necessary to put the minutes to it, and of the same to make a Scale. And for to make the Scale right, divide your Model into 6 parts on one side, and divide the other side into 10 parts, and so draw your Lines Diagonal ways, after the manner of the draught of the Diagonal Scale in the next leaf ensuing. So is your Scale made by which all the members are easily and rightly divided.</p>

                  <p>THere are several Rules or Precepts laid down by Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects concerning the Art of well Building, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the situation or total posture of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as that it be in a good and healthy air, not subject to foggy noisomeness or mineral exhalations, or malign influence; that it be not far from some navigable River or arm of the Sea; that it have a pleasant prospect, and the first salutation of the Spring: But I pass over these, accounting them rather wishes than precepts.</p>
                  <p>Other Rules there are touching the placing of the several parts of the Building: As that all the principal Chambers of delight, all Studies and Libraries be towards the East, the morning being a friend to the Muses; all Offices that require heat, as Kitchins, Stillatories, Stoves, Rooms for Baking, Brewing, Washing or the like, towards the South. All that need a cool and fresh temper, as Cellars, Pantries, Butteries, Granaries, to the North: As also Repositories for works of Rarities in Pictures, or other Arts that require a steady light. But in this, regard is to be had to the nature of the Region, every Nation being tyed above all Rules to a discretion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding against their own inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>The Rules concerning the work it self, some respect the materials, and some the form; as concerning the material part it will not disgrace an Architect, which doth so well become a

Philosopher, to look into the properties of Stone and Wood, as that Firr-Trees, Cypress, Cedars, and such other aspiring Plants (which being naturally inflexible downwards) are fittest for Posts and Pillars, or such upright use; on the other side Oak and the like true hearty Timber being strong in all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, may be better trusted in cross and traverse work for Sommers, or girding and binding beams, as they are termed And so likewise to observe of stone, that some are better within than other to bear weather; nay to descend lower, to examine Sand, Lime and Clay, of all which things <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> and other new Writers have discoursed without any dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness. And in this the <hi>Italians</hi> are very careful, burning their firmest Stone, and even fragments of Marble, where it is plenty, which in time become almost marble again, or at least of indissoluble durity, as appeareth in their standing Theatres: whereas to make Lime of any refuse stuffe, as we too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do in <hi>England,</hi> is an error of no small moment in our Buildings. I shall close with this principal caution, That sufficient stuff and mony be ready before we begin to Build; for when we build now a piece and then another by fits, the work dries and sinks unequally, whereby the Walls grow full of chinks and crevices; this pawsing humour is condemned by all Authors. In the form is to be considered the general figuration, and then the several members. Figures are either simple or mixed, the simple figures are either Circular or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and of Circular either complete or deficient as Oval: Now the exact Circle is in truth a very unprofitable Figure in private Buildings, being the most chargeable, and much room being lost in the bending of the Walls, besides an ill distribution of the light except from the Center of the Roof, so as it is not usual, save in some Temples and Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres; the Oval and other imperfect Circular Forms have the same exceptions and less benefit of capacity.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Angular it is a true observation, that this Art doth neither love many Angles nor few, for first the Triangle which hath of all others the fewest sides and corners, is of all other the most condemned, being indeed both inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and infirm, and likewise more soluble into any other Form than it self in the inward Partitions: As for Figures of five, six, seven or more Angles, they are fitter for Military
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53342:7"/>
Architecture, where the Bulwarks may be laid out at the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the sides serve for the Curtains then for civil use, though there is a famous piece at <hi>Caparola</hi> belonging to the House of <hi>Farnese,</hi> cast by <hi>Baraccio</hi> into the form of a Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone with a Circle inscribed; where the Architect did inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously wrestle with divers inconveniences in disposing of the Lights and in saving the vacuities: but such designs as these do aim more at Rarity than Commodity, and are rather to be admired than commended. Therefore by the precepts and practice of the best Builders we resolve upon Rectangular squares, as a mean between too few and too many Angles, and are through the equal inclination of the sides (which make the right Angle) stronger than the Rhomb or any other irregular square; but whether the exact Quadrat or the long square be the better, is not well determined, though I prefer the latter, provided the length do not exceed the Latitude above one third part, which would much diminish the Aspect; as shall appear when I come to speak of Symmetry and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of mixed Figures, partly Circular and partly Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. There is a proper Objection, that they offend unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, yet these seeming opposites, Uniformity and Variety, may be reconciled; as we see in our Bodies, the great pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Nature, which are most uniform in the whole figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, each side agreeing with the other in the number, the quality and measure of the parts, and yet some are round as the Arms, some flat as the Hands, some prominent, and some more retired, so the limbs of a noble Fabrique may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent enough they be various, provided always we do not run into certain extravagant inventions, whereof I shall speak more largely when I come to the parting and casting of the whole work. We ought likewise to avoid enormous heights of six or seven stories, as well as irregular Forms, and the contrary fault of low distended Fronts is as unseemly, or again when the face of the Building is narrow and the flank deep. Thus much for the general Figuration or Aspect of the work.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the parts in several, all the parts of every Fabrick may be according to <hi>Baptista Alberti</hi> comprised under five Heads, and they be these.</p>

                  <p>About all which I purpose to gather the principal Rules, and as I pass along touch, the natural Reasons of Art.</p>
                  <p>First concerning the Foundation, which requireth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actest care; for if that happen to dance, it will mar all the mirth in the House. Therefore that we may found our Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation firmly, we must first examine the bed of Earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we will build, and then the underfillings or suba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, as the Ancients did call it, advising us not to rest upon any appearing solidity, unless the whole mould through which we cut have likewise been solid. But how deep we should go in this search, is not certainly determined, depending more upon discretion than regularity, according to the weight of the work; yet <hi>Andrea Palladio</hi> alloweth a sixth part of the height of the whole Fabrick, unless the Cellars be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground; in which case he would have us found some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lower.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Italians</hi> do prescribe, that when they have chosen the floor or plot, and laid out the limits of the work, we should first of all dig Wells and Cisterns and other under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducts and conveyances for the suillage of the House, whence may arise a double benefit; for both the nature of the mould or soil would be safely searched, and moreover those open vents will serve to discharge such vapours as having otherways no issue might peradventure shake the building; This is enough for the natural grounding, which though it be not a part of the solid Fabrick, yet it is here fittest to be handled.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the substruction or ground-work of the whole Edifice, which must sustain the Walls, about which are these Rules, first that the bottom be precisely level, where the <hi>Italians</hi> therefore commonly lay a platform of good board, then that the lowest ledg or row be meerly of stone, and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53342:8"/>
broader the better, closely laid without mortar, which is a general caution for all parts in building that are contiguous to board or timber, because lime and wood are insociable, and if any where unfit confiners, than most especially in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; thirdly, that the breadth of the substruction be at least double to the insistent Wall, and more or less as the weight of the Fabrick shall require; for Discretion may be freer than Art.</p>
                  <p>Now the Foundation being searched; and the substruction laid, we must next speak of the Walls.</p>
                  <p>Walls are either entire and continual, or intermitted, and the intermissions be either Pillars or Pilasters; concerning the entrie Walls there are these considerations. That the Walls be most exactly perpendicular to the ground-work; for the right Angle (thereon depending) is the true cause of stability both in artificial and natural positions, a man likewise stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmest when he stands uprightest. That the massiest and heaviest materials be the lowest, as fitter to bear than to be born. That the work as it riseth, diminisheth in thickness proportionally for ease both of weight and expence. That certain ledges of more strength than the rest be interlayed like bones to sustain the Fabrick from total ruine, if the under parts should decay. Lastly, that the Angles be firmly bound, which are the Nerves of the whole Edifice, and therefore are commonly fortified by the <hi>Italians</hi> even in their brick build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, on each side of the corners with well squared stone, yielding both strength and grace. And so much touching the entire or solid Wall.</p>
                  <p>The intermissions (as hath been said) are either Pillars or Pilasters.</p>
                  <p>Pillars, which are commonly called Columns, of them there are five Orders.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53342:9"/>And the <hi>Compound Order,</hi> or as some call it, the <hi>Roman,</hi> others more generally the <hi>Italian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which five Orders I will first consider their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and then their Proprieties.</p>
                  <p>Their Communities (as far as I observe) are principally three: First, they are all round; for though some conceive <hi>Columna Atticurges</hi> mentioned by <hi>Vitruvius</hi> to have been a squared Pillar, yet we must pass it over as irregular, never received among these Orders, no more than certain other licentious inventions of wreathed and vined and Figured Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are all diminished or contracted insensibly more or less, according to the proportion of their heights from one third part of their Shaft upwards, which <hi>Philander</hi> doth prescribe by his own precise measuring of the ancient remainders as the most graceful Diminution. And here I must blame a practice familiar in some places, of making Columns swell in the middle as if they were sick of some Timpany, unseemly to the very judgment of sight, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Original and Natural Type in Trees, which at first was imitated in Pillars, as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they have all their Undersettings or Pedestals in height a third part of the whole Column comprehending the Base and Capital, and their upper Adjuncts, as Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trave, Frize, and Cornice, a fourth part of the said Pillar. Which rule of singular use and facility I find setled by <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobo Baraccio</hi> a very good Author. These are their most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Communities and agreements.</p>
                  <p>Their Proprieties or Distinctions will best appear by some reasonable and plain description of them all with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitraves, Frizes and Cornices.</p>
                  <p>First therefore the <hi>Tuscan</hi> is a plain massy rural Pillar, resembling some sturdy well-limbed Labourer homely clad, as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> makes the Comparison: The length thereof shall be six Diameters, or as <hi>Scamozzi</hi> makes it, six and a half of the grossest of the Pillar, being a very natural proportion. The distance or Intercolumniation may be near four of his own Diameters, because the materials com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly laid over this Pillar were rather of Wood than
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53342:9"/>
stone, through the lightness whereof the Architrave could not suffer though thinly supported, nor the Column it self being so substantial. The Contraction aloft shall be (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the most received practice) one fourth part of his thickness below. To conclude, the <hi>Tuscan</hi> is of all the rudest Pillar, and his principal Character simplicity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dorick Order</hi> is the gravest that hath been received into civil use, preserving in comparison of those that follow a more Masculine Aspect, and little trimmer than the <hi>Tuscan</hi> that went before, save a sober garnishment now and then of Lions heads in the Cornice, and of Trigliphs and Metopes always in the Frize, sometimes likewise, but rarely, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neled, and a little slight sculpture about the Hypotrachelion or neck under the Capital: the length seven Diameters, and according to <hi>Scamozzi</hi> seven and a half, his rank or degree is the lowest by all congruity, as being more massie than the three, and so better able to support. The Intercolum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation thrice as much as his thickness below; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction aloft one fifth of the same measure, he is best known by his place when he is in Company, and by the peculiar Ornament of his Frize before mentioned when he is alone.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ionick Order</hi> doth represent a kind of Feminine slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, not like a light Housewife, but in a decent Matron-like dressing. The length eight Diameters in degree as in substantialness next above the <hi>Dorick,</hi> sustaining the third, and adorning the second story, the Intercolumniation two of his own Diameters, the contraction above one sixth part. And is best known by his trimmings, for the body of this Column is perpetually channeled like a thick plaited Gown; the Capital dressed on each side, not much unlike womens Wires in a spirial wreathing, which they call the <hi>Ionian Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luta</hi>; the Corniee indented; the Frize swelling like a Pillow, these are his best Characters.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Corinthian</hi> is a Column lasciviously decked like a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan, and therein participating (as all Inventions do) of the place where they were first born, <hi>Corinth</hi> having been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controversie one of the wantonest Towns in the World. This Order is of nine Diameters, his degree one stage above the <hi>Ionick,</hi> and always the highest of the simplest Orders.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53342:10"/>
The Intercolumniation two of his Diameters, and a fourth part more, which is of all other the comliest distance. The contraction one seventh part. In the Cornice both Dentils and Modiglions. The Frize adorned with all kinds of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and various Compartments. The Capital cut into one of the beautifullest leafs that Nature doth yield, which is the Acanthas of <hi>Branca Vrsina,</hi> Bears Foot. In short, a Plainness did characterize the <hi>Tuscan,</hi> so must Delicacy and variety the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pillar, besides the height of his Rank.</p>
                  <p>The last is the Compounded or <hi>Roman Order,</hi> his name being a brief of his nature; for this Pillar is nothing in effect but a medly of all the precedent Ornaments, and though, the most richly trimmed, yet the poorest in this that he is a borrower of all his beauty. His length a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Ionick</hi> and <hi>Corinthian</hi> according to <hi>Scamozzi</hi>: though some will have him the highest, as of ten Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the contraction one eighth part less above than below, his degree should be the highest, but few Palaces ancient or modern exceed the third of the Civil Orders; you may easily know him by the mixture of his Ornaments. And so much touching the five Orders of Columns, which I shall conclude with two or three not impertinent Cautions.</p>
                  <p>First, that where more of these Orders than one shall be set in several Stories or Contignations, there must be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite care to place the Columns precisely one over another, that so the solid may answer to the solid, and the vacuities to the vacuities; as well for beauty as strength of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick; and by this Caution the consequence is plain, that when we speak of the intercolumination or distance which is due to each Order, we mean in a <hi>Dorick, Ionical, Corinthian</hi> Porch, or Cloister, or the like of one Contignation, and not in storied buildings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let the Columns above be a fourth part less than below, saith <hi>Vitruvius</hi>; which doth appear a strange Precept, and would seem reasonable rather to make them a fourth part bigger, because according to the Optick Rule that the higher they are the less the diminution aloft should be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Eye doth naturally contract all objects more or less according to their distance; but <hi>Vitruvius</hi> acquits himself
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53342:10"/>
like a wise Mechanick, the Natural reason before the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.</p>
                  <p>That therefore they above should be a fourth part less, that those beneath may better sustain them.</p>
                  <p>A third Caution shall be, That all the projected or Jutting parts (as they are termed) be very moderate, especially the Cornices of the lower Orders; for while some think to give them a beautiful and royal Aspect, by their largeness they sometimes hinder both the light within, and likewise detract much from the view of the Front without. I need say no more concerning Columns and their Adjuncts, only answer one familiar Objection: It will perchance be said, that this Doctrine touching the five Orders were fitter for the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Asia</hi> which yielded one hundred and twenty seven Columns of sixty foot high to the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Temple, or for <hi>Numidia</hi> where Marbles abound, then for the Spirits of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who must be contented with more ignoble materials. To which I answer, that this need not discourage us. For I have often at <hi>Venice</hi> viewed with much pleasure an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porch after the <hi>Greek</hi> manner raised by <hi>Andrea Palladio</hi> upon eight Columns of the Compounded Order, the Basis of stone without Pedestals, the shafts or bodies of meer brick three foot and a half thick in the Diameter below, and consequently thirty five foot high, than which mine eye hath never yet beheld any Columns more stately of stone or marbles; for the Bricks having been first formed in a Circular mould, and then cut before their burning into four quarters or more, the sides afterwards joyn so closely, and the points concentre so exactly, that the Pillars appear one entire piece; which short description I could not omit, that thereby may appear how in truth we want rather Art than Stuffe to satisfie our greatest fancies.</p>
                  <p>After Pillars the next in order are Pilasters, touching which I will briefly collect these Notes. Pilasters must not be too tall and slender, lest they resemble Pillars; nor too dwarfish and gross, lest they imitate the Piles or Peers of Bridges; smoothness doth not so naturally become them as a rustick superficies, for they aim more at State and Strength than Elegancy. In private Buildings they ought not to be narrower than one third, nor broader than two parts of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53342:11"/>
whole vacuity between Pilaster and Pilaster; but to those that stand at the corners may be allowed a little more Latitude by discretion for strength of the Angles: In Theaters and Amphitheaters, and such weighty works, <hi>Palladio</hi> observeth them to have been as broad as the half, and now and then as the whole Vacuity; he noteth otherways, and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with him, that their true proportion should be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act square; but for lessening expence and inlarging of room, they are commonly narrower in flank than in front. Their principal grace doth consist in half or whole Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars applyed unto them; in which case it is well noted by Authors, that the Columns may be allowed somewhat more than their ordinary length, because they lean unto so good supporters. And thus much shall suffice touching Pilasters, which is a Cheap, and a Strong, and a Noble kind of Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
                  <p>Now because they are oftner both for Beauty and Majesty found Arched than otherwise: I am here orderly led to speak of Arches, and under the same head of Vaults, for an Arch is nothing indeed but a contracted Vault, and a Vault is but a dilated Arch.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to handle this business both compendiously and fundamentally, I will resolve the whole business into a few Theorems.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="theorem">

                     <p>All solid Materials free from impediment do descend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly downwards, because ponderosity is a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the Center of the world, and Nature perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her motions by the shortest lines.</p>

                     <p>Bricks moulded in their ordinary Rectangular form, if they shall be laid one by another in a level row between any supporters, sustaining the two ends, then all the pieces between will necessarily sink even by their own natural gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53342:11"/>
and much more if they suffer any depression by other weight above them, because their sides being parallel they have room to descend perpendicularly without impeachment, according to the former Theorem: Therefore to make them stand, we must either change their posture, or their figure, or both.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="theorem">

                     <p>If Bricks moulded or Stones squared <hi>cuneatim</hi> (that is wedg-wise broader above than below) shall be laid in a row level with their ends supported as in the precedent Theorem, pointing all to one Center, then none of the pieces between can sink till the Supporters give way: because they want room in that figuration to descend perpendicularly: But this is yet a weak piece of structure, because the supporters are subject to much impulsion, especially if the line be long; for which reason this Form is seldom used but over Windows or narrow Doors; therefore to fortifie the work, as in this third Theorem we have supposed the Figure of all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials different from those in the second, so likewise we must now change the posture, as will appear in the Theorem fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>If the materials figured as before wedg-wise shall not be disposed levelly but in form of some Arch or proportion of a Circle pointing all to the same Center: In this case nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pieces of the said Arch can sink downwards through want of room to descend perpendicularly, nor the supporters or butments (as they are termed) of the said Arch can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer so much violence as in the precedent flat posture, for the roundness will always make the incumbent weight rather to rest upon the supporters than to shove them; whence may be drawn an evident Corollary, that the safest of all Arches is the Semicircular, and of all Vaults the Hemisphere, though not absolutely exempted from some natural weakness, as <hi>Barn.

Baldi</hi> Abbot of <hi>Guastalla</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Aristotles</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks doth very well prove; whence I note, That when any thing is Mathematically demonstrated weak, it is much more Mechanically weak; errors ever more occurring more easily in the management of gross materials than lineal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</p>

This observation I find in <hi>Leon.

                     <p>Upon these five Theorems all the skill of Arching and Vaulting is grounded: As for those Arches which our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans call of the third and fourth point, and the Tuscan Writers <hi>di terzo,</hi> and <hi>di quarto acuto,</hi> because they always concur in an acute Angle, and do spring from the division of the Diameter into three, four or more parts at pleasure; I say, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus of my first Partition of the parts of every Fabrick into five heads; having gone through the two former and been incidently carried into this last Doctrine touching Arches and Vaults, the next now in order are the Apertions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which term I do comprehend doors, windows, stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases, chimnies, or other conducts; in short, all Inlets or Outlets, to which belong two general cautions.</p>

First, That they be as few in number and as moderate in dimension as possibly may consist with other due respects; for in a word, all openings are weaknings.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That they do not approach too near the Angles of the Walls, for it were indeed a most essential Solecism to weaken that part which must strengthen all the rest: A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept well recorded but ill practised by the <hi>Italians</hi> themselves, particularly at <hi>Venice,</hi> where I have observed divers <hi>Pergoli</hi> or <hi>Meniana</hi> (as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> seemeth to call them) which are certain ballised outstandings to satisfie curiosity of sight) very dangerously set forth upon the very point it self of the Mura<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Before I come to the casting and comparting of the whole work (being indeed the very definitive sum of this Art, to distribute usefully and gracefully a well chosen plot) I shall collect some Notes belonging to these particular Overtures.</p>

                     <p>These Inlets of men and light I couple together, because I find their due dimensions brought under one Rule, by <hi>Leon. Alberti</hi> (a learned searcher) who from the School of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (where it was a fundamental Maxim, that the Images of all things are latent in numbers) doth determine the comliest proportions between breadths and heights, namely the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of two to three in their breadth and length, in others the double, as two to four, there will indubitably result from either a graceful and harmonious contentment to the Eye. Our Master <hi>Vitruvius</hi> seems to have been an extream lover of luminous Rooms, and indeed I confess that a frank light can misbecome no Edifice, yet on the other side we must take heed to make a House all Eyes like <hi>Argus,</hi> which in Northern Climates would be too cold, in Southern too hot. Besides there is no part of Building more expenceful than Windows, or more ruinous, not only for that vulgar reason as being exposed to all wind and weather, but because con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of so different and unsociable pieces, as Wood, Iron, Lead and Glass, and those small and weak, and easily shaken.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53342:13"/>Of Doors there is this distinction; some were called <hi>Fores,</hi> some <hi>Valvae</hi>; Those, as the word may seem to import, did open outwards, these inwards, and were commonly of two leaves or panes (as we call them) thereby requiring indeed a lesser Circle in their unfolding, and therefore much in use among the <hi>Italians</hi> at this day. But I charge them with an Imperfection, for though they let in as well, yet they keep out worse.</p>

                     <head>Of Stair-Cases.</head>
                     <p>To make a compleat stair-case is a curious piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture; the vulgar cautions are these.</p>
                     <p>That it have a liberal light against all Casualties of slips and falls.</p>
                     <p>That the space above the head be large and airy, because a man doth spend much breadth in breathing.</p>
                     <p>That the half paces be well distributed at competent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances for reposing on the way.</p>
                     <p>That to avoid Encounters, and besides to gratifie the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, the whole stair-case have no niggard Latitude, that is, for the principal Ascent in Royal Buildings at the least ten foot.</p>
                     <p>That the breadth of every single step or stair be never less than one foot, nor more than eighteen inches.</p>
                     <p>That they exceed by no means half a foot in their height or thickness, for our legs do labour more in elevation than in distention.</p>
                     <p>That the steps be laid where they join somewhat sloping, that the foot may in a sort ascend and descend together; which though observed by few, is a secret and delicate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the pains in mounting.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, to reduce this doctrine to some Natural or at least Mathematical ground, <hi>Vitruvius</hi> borroweth these proportions that make the sides of a Rectangular Triangle; that is, three for the Perpendicular from the stair-head to the ground, four for the-ground-line it self or recession from the Wall, and five for the whole Inclination or slopeness in the Ascent. There are likewise Spiral or Cocklestairs, and sometimes running about a Pillar, sometimes vacant, wherein <hi>Palladio</hi> (a man very expert
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53342:13"/>
in this point) was wont to divide the Diameter of the first fort into three parts, yielding one to the Pillar and two to the Steps of the second, into four whereof he gave two to the Stairs, and two to the Vacuity, which had all their light from above, and this in exact Oval is as a Master-piece. You have here insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Types of several Stair-Cases with their Ichnography; one whereof is a piece of Rarity, being a pair of double Stairs, whereon two persons, the one ascending, the other descending, shall not come at one another, made by <hi>Peidro del Bergo</hi> and <hi>Iehan Cosin</hi> at <hi>Sciamburg</hi> in <hi>France</hi> in the Kings Palace.</p>

                     <head>Of Chimnies.</head>
                     <p>The <hi>Italians,</hi> who make frugal fires, are not in this case the best Counsellors, therefore from them we may better learn how to raise fair Mantles within, and how to disguise gracefully the shafts of Chimnies abroad; therefore shall lay down the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of <hi>Phil. de l' Orme,</hi> a man diligent in this part of work.</p>
                     <p>First he observeth, that who in the disposition of the Building will consider the Region and the Winds that ordinarily blow from this or that Quarter, might so cast the Rooms, which need most fire, that he should little fear the incommodity of Smoke. But if the Error lies in the Structure it self, then he makes a Logical Enquiry, That either the Wind is too much let in above at the mouth of the Shaft, or the Smoke stifled below. If none of these, then there is a repulsion of the Fume by some higher Hill
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53342:14"/>
or Fabrick that overtops the Chimny; if likewise not this, then he concludes that the Room is little and close, so as the Smoke cannot issue wanting a supply of Air; and so having a Natural Reason of the Cause, we apply sutable Remedies.</p>
                     <p>Touching Conducts for the Suillage and other Necessities of the House, (which how base soever in use, yet for the Health of the Inhabitants are as considerable as the rest) I find in Authors this Counsel, that Art should imitate Nature in those ignoble Conveyances, and separate them from sight (where there wants a running Water) into the most remote, and lowest, and thickest part of the Foundation, with secret vents posting up through the Walls, like a Tunnel to the wi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d Air aloft.</p>
                     <p>Thus, having considered the <hi>Apertions</hi> and <hi>Overtures</hi> according to their particular Requisites, I come to the Contexture of the whole work under the term of <hi>Compartition,</hi> into which (being the mainest piece) I cannot enter without a few general Precautions.</p>
                     <p>First, Let no man that intendeth to build, settle his fancy upon a Draught of the Work in Paper, how exactly soever measured or neatly set off in perspective, without a Model or Type of the whole Structure, and of every parcel or partition in Board or Wood.</p>
                     <p>Next, That the said Model be as plain as may be without Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours or other beautifying, lest the Pleasure of the Eye preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Judgment.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, The bigger this Type is, the better; not that I would persuade a man to such an Enormity, as that Model made by <hi>Ant. Labaco</hi> of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> containing 22 foot in length, 16 in breadth, and 13 in height, and costing 4184 Crowns, the price of a reasonable Chappel. Yet in a Fabrick of 30 or 40 Thousand pounds, 30 pounds may be expended in an exact Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del; for a little Penury in the Premisses may easily breed some Absurdity of a far greater Charge in the Conclusion.</p>
                     <p>Now after these Premonishments, I come to the <hi>Compartition</hi> it self, by which is understood a graceful and useful Distribution of the whole Ground-plot, both for Rooms of Office and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or Entertainment, as far as the Capacity thereof and the nature of the Country will comport.</p>
                     <p>The Gracefulness will consist in a double Analogy or Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency, First, between the Parts and the Whole, whereby a great Fabrick should have great Partitions, great Lights, great Entrances, great Pillars or Pilasters; in sum, all the Parts great.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53342:14"/>
The next between the Parts themselves, not only considering the breadth and length, as before when we spake of Doors and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, but likewise their height, a point hardly reducible to any general Precept.</p>
                     <p>True it is, the Ancients did determine the Longitude of all Rooms which were longer than broad, by the double of their Latitude; and the Height half as much more as the Latitude, which Dimensions modern Architects vary upon discretion: sometimes squaring the Latitude, and then making the Diagonal or overthwart Line from Angle to Angle of the said square; the measure of the Height sometimes more, but seldom lower, than the breadth it self.</p>
                     <p>The usefulness consists in a sufficient Number of Rooms of all sorts, and their apt Coherence without Distraction, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, that it may be well united, and may appear airy and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritous, fit for the welcome of chearful Guests; about which the greatest difficulty will be in contriving the Lights and Stair-cases; in which respect the ancient Architects were at much ease; for both the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> (of whose private Dwellings <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> hath left some Description) had commonly two Cloistered open Courts, one serving for the Womens side, and the other for the Men, who now adays would perchance take so much separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unkindly. Howsoever by this means the reception of Light into the body of the Building was very prompt both from without and from within, which we must now supply by some open form of the Fabrick, or among graceful refuges by Tarrasing any story which is in danger of Darkness, or lastly, by perpendicular Lights from the Roof, of all others the most natural: For the second difficulty, which is casting the Stair-Case, which is no hard point of it self, but as they are incumbrances of room for other use, I have marked a willingness in the <hi>Italian</hi> Artizans to distribute the Kitchin, Pantry, Bake-house, washing Rooms, and even the Buttry likewise under ground next above the Foundation, and sometimes level with the Floor of the Cellar, raising the first Ascent into the House fifteen foot or more for that end, which besides removing Annoys out of sight and gaining much room above, doth also by the Elevation of the Front add Majesty to the whole Aspect; and with such a disposition of the principal Stair-Case which commonly doth deliver us into the plain of the second Story, there may be wonders done with a little room.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53342:15"/>
But though petty Offices may be well enough so remote, yet by the natural Hospitality of <hi>England</hi> the Buttry must be more visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we need perchance for our Raunges a more spacious and luminous Kitchin than the aforesaid Compartition will bear, with a more competent nearness to the Dining Room. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise necessary to contrive a Room for a Conservatory of the Meat that is taken from the Table till the Waiters eat, which with us by an old fashion is more unseemly set by in the mean time.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the distribution of Lodging Chambers, I must here reprove a Fashion, which hath prevailed through. <hi>Italy,</hi> without antient Examples: Namely, that they so cast their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, as when all Doors are open, a man may see through the whole House; which doth necessarily put an intolerable servitude upon all the Chambers, save the inmost, whence none can arrive but through the rest, or else the Walls must be extreme thick for secret Passages. And yet this will not serve the turn, without at least three Doors to every Room, a thing most insufferable in cold and windy Regions, and every where no small weakning to the whole Work; being only grounded upon the fond Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of displaying to a Stranger all our Furniture at one sight: there being another defect, which necessarily follows such a servile disposing of inward Chambers, that they must be forced to make as many common great Rooms, as there shall be several Stories; which (besides that they are usually dark, a point hardly to be avoided, running as they do through the middle of the whole House) do likewise devour so much Place, that thereby they want other Galleries and Rooms of Retreat. Thus having given you general Lights and Directions, and discovered some Faults, the rest must be committed to the Sagacity of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, who will be often put to divers ingenious shifts, when he is to wrestle with Scarcity of Ground: as sometimes to damm one Room (though of good use) for the benefit and beauty of all the rest; another while to make those fairest which are most in sight, and to leave the other (like a cunning Painter) in shadow. I will close this Part, touching <hi>Compartition,</hi> as chearfully as I can, with a short Description of a feasting or entertaining Room after the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> manner, who seem (at least till the time of <hi>Vitruvius</hi>) from the antient <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> (whence all Knowledge did flow) to have retained with other Sciences in a high degree, also the Principles and Practice of this magnificent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53342:15"/>
Art; there being no Form for such a Royal use comparable ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined like that of the aforesaid Nation.</p>
                     <p>Let us conceive a Floor or Area of goodly length (for example at least of 120 Foot) with the breadth somewhat more than half of the longitude: About the two longest sides and head of the said Room shall run an Order of Pillars, which <hi>Palladio</hi> doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Corinthian,</hi> supplying that point out of <hi>Greece,</hi> because we know no Order proper to <hi>AEgypt</hi>; the fourth side I will leave free for Entrance: On the foresaid Pillars was laid an Architrave, which <hi>Vitruvius</hi> mentioneth alone, <hi>Palladio</hi> adds thereunto (and with reason) both Frize and Cornice, over which went up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Wall, and therein half or three-quarter Pillars, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly to the Order below, but a fourth part less; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these half Columns above, the whole Room was win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed round about.</p>
                     <p>Now from the lowest Pillars there was laid over a Contignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Floor born upon the outward Wall and the head of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns with Tarrace and Pavement <hi>sub dio,</hi> saith our Master, and so indeed he might safely determine the matter in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> where they fear no Clouds; therefore <hi>Palladio</hi> (who leaveth this Tarrace uncovered in the middle and ballised about) did perchance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue him rightly, though therein discording from others. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways we must understand a sufficient breadth of Pavement left between the open Part and the Windows, for some delight of Spectators that might look down into the Room. The Latitude I have supposed contrary to some former Positions a little more than half the Length; because the Pillars standing at a competent distance from the outmost Wall, will by interception of the sight, somewhat in appearance diminish the breadth: In which cases (as I have said before) Discretion may be more licentious than Art. This is the Description of an <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Room for Feasts and other Jollities; about the Walls whereof we must imagine intire Statues placed below, and illuminated by the descending Light from the Tarrace, as likewise from the Windows between the half Pillars above. So as this Room had abundant and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Light; and besides other garnishing must needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much State by the Height of the Roof, that lay over two Orders of Columns.</p>
                     <p>And so having run through the four Parts of my first general Division, namely, <hi>Foundation, Walls, Apertions,</hi> and <hi>Compartition:</hi>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53342:16"/>
The House may now have leave to put on his Hat, having hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been uncovered it self, and consequently unfit to cover others; which point, though it be the last of this Art in Execution, yet it is always in Intention the first; for who would build but for shelter? I shall now only deliver a few of the properest, and (as I may say) naturallest Considerations that belong to this remaining Piece.</p>
                     <p>There are two Extremities to be avoided in the Cover or Roof, that it be not too heavy nor too light, the first will suffer a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Objection of pressing too much the Under-work. The other containeth a more secret Inconvenience, for the Cover is not only a bare Defence, but likewise a kind of Band or Ligature to the whole Fabrick, and therefore would require some reasonable Weight; but of the two a House top-heavy is the worst, next, there must be a care of Equality, that the Edifice be not pressed on the one side more than on the other. And here <hi>Palladio</hi> doth wisely advise that the inward Walls might bear some good share in the Burthen, and the outward be the less charged. Thirdly, the <hi>Italians</hi> are very careful in giving the Cover a graceful Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or Slopeness, dividing the whole breadth into nine parts, whereof two shall serve for the Elevation of the highest Top or Ridg from the lowest. But in this point, the quality of the Region is considerable; for as our <hi>Vitruvius</hi> insinuateth, those Climes that fear the falling and lying of much Snow, ought to provide more inclining Pent-houses, and Comeliness must yield to Necessity.</p>
                     <p>Thus have you briefly laid down, from the best Authors, the Ground-Rules of the Art of Building; which being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, may be of great use to the ingenious Architect in the managing of any Royal or Noble Design.</p>

                  <p>FIrst, The Rule is an ordinary Jointed Rule of a Foot long when shut together, or two Foot being opened to a straight Line. And the Lines delineated thereon for this purpose, are
<list>
                        <item>1. First, a Line of Lines, drawn Sector-wise from a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on both Legs of the Rule, but continued to 30 at the end in stead of 10 the old usual manner, and every single Integer of the 30 is divided into 12 parts, to represent every particular Inch of the 30 Foot according to the common reckoning by Feet and Inches.</item>
                        <item>2. There is another Scale of Equal parts also, of the same length lying as near to the other of 30 as may be, on one Leg only, which is divided into 40 parts, to represent 40 Feet: and each of those 40 Feet, parted into 6 parts to represent every two Inches only, because the room for one Foot, will not admit of more parts.</item>
                        <item>3. In the same place on the other Leg is divided a Line of natural Sines and Tangents to 45, but numbred as a Line of Chords to 180 Degrees, to set the Rule to, or to find the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of any Angle, in the proper terms of expression (all the world over) degrees and minutes.</item>
                        <item>4. On the innermost Line of the 30 Scale that runs to the Center is set 20 pricks, beginning at 2 at the Center-pin at 30, and so proceeding with 3, 4, 5, and 6 at the Center-pin at 15, and then 7, 8, 9, 10, and so forwards to 20, towards
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53342:33"/>
the Center; which serves to divide a Circle into any number of parts, very useful and ready in the practice of Drawing or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much for Description; the Uses follow.</p>
                  <p>The Uses of this Line of Lines; or Scale of equal parts to 30, drawn from the Center, is of a general and manifold use: as Mr. <hi>Gunter</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Sector</hi> hath shewed.</p>
                  <p>A brief touch whereof take in the first place, as by the way, and then the use of the Rule to the business intended.</p>
                  <p>And for the better doing hereof, it is needful to explain three or four terms, for the avoiding of many words, and needless repetitions in this brief, yet plain Discourse.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. First, by the word Lateral is meant any distance taken, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Feet and Inches, on the 30 Scales or degrees and minutes on the Chords, taken and counted from the Center, in the midst of the head of the Joint-Rule along any one Leg: as thus; Suppose I would take out 15 Foot Laterally, set one point of the Compasses in the Center at the head, and open the other to 15 on any one Leg on the 30 Scale; this extent I call a Lateral Extent of 15 Foot. Also if you take the Lateral Chord of 60 Degrees, you shall find the extent of the Compasses from the Center to 60 to be the same as from the Center to 15 Foot, on the 30 Scale of Feet and Inches.</item>
                     <item>2. By the word Parallel, I mean any distance taken, by setting one point of the Compasses in any number of Feet and Inches on one Leg, and the other point in the same, or any other number on the other Leg, across from one Leg to the other; as thus the Rule being opened, then the extent of the Compasses from 20 on one Leg, to 20 on the other Leg, is a Parallel extent.</item>
                     <item>3. In all Parallel Extents, you must set one point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes in the Common Line on one Leg, to the Common Line on the other Leg, which Common Line is that only of the 30 Scale which runs to the Center, in which the Center-pins at 15 and 30 are.</item>
                     <item>4. The nearest distance from a point to a Line is only thus; Set one point of the Compasses in the point given, and open or shut the other being turned about, till the other will but just touch or cleave the Line, that I call the nearest distance.</item>

                     <p>Take the Number given laterally from the 30, or 40 Scale from the Center, and that is the Line required.</p>
                     <p>But if these Scales are too great, or too small, then take your Number of parts, and the length thereof Laterally.</p>
                     <p>As for Example; suppose I would have 3 Inches to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent 30 Foot, take out 3 Inches between your Compasses, and make it a parallel in 30 and 30, and the 30 Scale is set to your desire.</p>

                     <p>Take the given Line between your Compasses, and make it a parallel in the parts thereof; then the parallel extent of the parts you would have it increased, or diminished to, is the Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Diminution, which was required.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example,</hi> Let 3 Inches represent 8 Foot, and to the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion I would have 10 Foot, or 5 Foot, <hi>viz.</hi> more or less.</p>
                     <p>Take 3 Inches between your Compasses, and make it a parallel in 8, and 8 on the 30 Scale; then the parallel distance between 5 and 5, doth diminish the Line, and the parallel between 10 and 10 doth Increase the Line to the proportion required.</p>

                     <p>Take the given Line, and make it a parallel in the parts on the 30 Scale into which you would have it divided, then the parallel extent between 1 and 1 shall divide the Line accordingly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example,</hi> Let 4 Inches be a Line to be divided into 9 parts, take 4 Inches, (or any distance whatsoever) and make it a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel

in 9 and 9 on the 30 Scale; then the parallel distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 1 and 1 shall divide 4 Inches into 9 parts required: Note, that for more exactness and conveniency, you may Double 9, or Triple 9, <hi>viz.</hi> 18, or 27, and then if you make the Line to be divided, a parallel in Triple the Number you must take out 3 in stead of one, and that shall divide the Line into the parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example,</hi> I would have 5 Inches put into 10 parts, take 5 Inches between your Compasses, and make it a parrallel in 30, and 30 the Triple of 10, then take out parallel 3, and 3 the Triple of one: and that shall divide the Line given being 5 Inches into 10 parts or models exactly: the like for any other.

                     <p>Take 2 Inches the measure of one Line, and measure it Laterally on the 30 Scale, and it gives 5 Foot ½ an Inch, then take out 5 Inches the supposed length of the other Line, and it gives Laterally 12 Foot 8 Inches; then I say one Line is 5 Foot and half an Inch, and the other is 12 Foot 8 Inches of a Scale of 30 Foot in 11 Inches 3 quarters length.</p>
                     <p>Or if you conclude on the Term or number of one Line, then make that Line a parallel in the parts thereof, then take the other Line, and carry it parallelly till it stay in like parts, on both Legs in the common Line, and that shall be the Denomination of the other Line.</p>

                     <p>Take both the Lines, and lay them laterally on both Legs, and note the Feet and Inches to which they do extend as in the last.</p>
                     <p>Then take out the lateral extent of the second Line, and make a parallel in the terms of the first Line, keeping the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Line at that opening, then the parallel extent from the terms of the second Line, shall be the lateral 3d Term or Line in Proportion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example,</hi> Suppose I have one Line 3 Foot long, and another 5 Foot, and I would have another to bear proportion to 5, as 3 doth to 5 increasing, being in numbers thus; as 3 is to 5, so is 5 to what? Here note that 3 is the first number, and 5 the second.</p>
                     <p>The first Line laid from the Center, on the 30 Scale, extends to 7 Foot 7 Inches, and 5 Inches; the second Line gives 12 Foot 8 Inches.</p>
                     <p>Now the lateral second Line, <hi>viz.</hi> 5, or 12 Foot 8 Inches, made a parallel 7 in Foot 7 Inches, the terms of the first Line, then take out the parallel extent from 12 Foot 8 Inches (the measure of 5) and it shall give 21 Foot 1 Inch laid laterally from the Center, for a third Proportional required; which, measured on the Inches, is 8 Inches and a third, the answer required; for as 3 is in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to 5, so is 5 to 8, and a third part.</p>
                     <p>But by the Line of Numbers, having the quantity of the Lines given in Numbers, do thus:</p>
                     <p>The extent of the Compasses from the first Number 3, to the second Number 5, shall reach the same way from the second Number 5, to 8.33 the third proportional Number required.</p>

                     <head>Use XIII. The Breadth of any Frame being given, to find the Length of the Rafter and Perpendicular by Inspection only.</head>
                     <p>In being a General received Rule, that the Length of the Raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters should be three-quarters the breadth of the House, (or Frame) for true pitch, and 40 the Feet in one Scale, being equal in length to 30 the Number of Feet in another Scale, and 30 being 3 quarters of 40. Therefore,</p>
                     <p>If you seek for the breadth of the House on the 40 Scale, then right against it, on the 30 Scale, is the length of the Rafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Also if you seek the length of the Rafter on the 40 Scale, on the 30 Scale, right against it, is the height of the Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar required, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Raising-piece to the top of the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble end or Rafter required.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example,</hi> If a House be 30 Foot broad, the Rafter ought to be 22 Foot 6 Inches, and the Perpendicular 16 Foot 9 Inches and a ½; for right against 30, counted on the 40 Scale, on the 30 Scale is 22—6 the Rafter, and right against 22—6 on the 40 Scale on the 30 is 16—9 ½ the Perpendicular.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Also by the Line of Numbers, the Extent of the Compasses, from 20 to 15, will reach the same way from the Breadth of any House to his proprotionable Rafter at true pitch.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And the Extent from 20 to 18, turned the same way from any Breadth of a House to his proportionable Hip-Rafter, in square Frames.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Also the Extent from 20 to 11 18/100 will reach the same way from the width of any House to his proportionable Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, at square and true pitch.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And the Extent from 20 to 28—28, will reach from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther House Breadth to his proportional whole Diagonal Line re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, at square and true pitch.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And the Extent from 20 the breadth to 26—63 the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est distance at that breadth, shall reach from any other breadth to his proportional nearest distance required, if it were needful.

                     <head>Use XIV. The Breadth of the House and the Height of the Perpendicular being given to find the Rafters Length, the Hips Length, the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal Line, from Corner to the King-post, and any Angle required, in square Frames. What the Perpendicular Height of the Gable end ought to be at true pitch by the last Rule you may readily see, and the better make estimate of the quantity of alteration. Which being once resolved on, then thus proceed.</head>
                     <p>First open the two 30 Scales to a Right Angle by making Lateral 21 Foot 2 Inches ½ a parallel in 15, and 15 in the brass Center-pins.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then count half the Breadth of the House on one Leg, and the Length of the Perpendicular resolved on, on the other Leg, then the parallel distance between them, measured Laterally from the Center,<note place="margin">Rafter.</note> shall give the true Length of the Rafter required.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <note place="margin">Hips.</note>2. For the Hips Length count the Length of the Rafter last found on one Leg, and the half Breadth of the House on the other Leg, and take the parallel distance between, and measure it from the Center Laterally, and it shall be the true Length of the Hips required.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <note place="margin">Diagonal.</note>3. For the Diagonal Line, count the half Breadth of the House on both Legs, and take the parallel distance between, and measure it from the Center, and it shall be the Length of the Diagonal Line, from the Corner to the King-post.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Hips Length.</note>4. Again for the Hips count the Diagonal Line last found on one Leg, and the Perpendicular height on the other Leg, and the parallel distance between shall be the Hips true Length measured as before from the Center.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example.</hi> In a House of 20 Foot wide at true pitch. See Fig. 1. let ABCD represent a Frame of a House 20 Foot wide, BI the half width, BA and CD equal to BC the whole width being 2 points to draw the Diagonal Lines by. IE being equal to IB, and the half EI laid from E to G gives IG the true Length of the Rafters, and GB or GC the Length of the Hips.</p>
                     <p>Or thus, Three quarters of CB, <hi>viz.</hi> CH gives CF and BF the Rafters Length; the same extent also laid upon the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53342:37"/>
Line from I to G, gives CG and BG the Hips Length, IF is the Perpendicular Height, E is the Point of the Diagonal Line or King-post, perpendicularly opposite to or right under the meeting point of the 2 Hips, and the 2 Rafters when raised and set in their places.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for Illustration what to do, now for Application how to do.</p>
                     <p>The Width of the House is always given, the Length of the Rafter, or the Height of the Perpendicular is next resolved on, which in our Example being true pitch is also resolved on, either by Inspection as before, or else by operation in this manner.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Breadth of the House being 20 Foot, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular resolved on to be 11 Foot 2 Inches ½. To find the Rafters Length, work thus,</p>
                     <p>Open the 30 Scale to a Right Angle (by Use the seventh) count 10 the half Breadth of the House on one Leg,<note place="margin">For the Raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Length.</note> and the Perpendicular Height 11 2 ½ on the other Leg, (<hi>viz.</hi> both on the 30 Scale from the Center) and take the parallel distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, (on the common Line) and measure it from the Center, and it shall give just 15 Foot the Length of the Rafter required CF.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if according to the Width of any Frame, you resolve on the Rafters Length, and would have the Perpendicular Height of the Gable end, then thus:</p>
                     <p>Count the Length of the Rafter from the Center, and take the Lateral Extent thereof (being 15) between your Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the Compasses being so set,<note place="margin">For the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular.</note> set one point in 10 the half Width of the Frame, and turn the other point parallelly to the common Line, and there it shall shew 11 Foot 2 1/7 Inches, the true Height of the Perpendicular at true pitch required. IF 11 Foot 2 Inches 1/7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the Length of the Hips, Count the half Breadth of the House on one Leg, and the Rafters Length on the other Leg, and take the parallel distance between, and it shall give the true Length of the Hips required.<note place="margin">For the Hips Length.</note> As here, the parallel distance between 15 and 10, shall be Lateral 8, the true Length of the Hips required in a Square Frame 20 Foot wide true pitch.

                     <p n="5">5. Otherwise for the Hips Length, Count the half Diagonal on one Leg 24 1 ⅝ and the Perpendicular 11 Foot 2 In.

                        <p>When the Rule stands square in the 30 Scale, then lay any streight piece to the Compass points, when one stands in the half breadth, and the other point in the Perpendicular; then if you apply a Bevel severally, to that streight edge, and the 30 Scale at each end, the one is the Angle at Foot 48—10, and the other the Angle at Head, <hi>viz.</hi> 41—50.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For the Angle at Head or King-post, and Foot of the Hips, do thus; the 30 Scale being set square, set one point of the Compasses in the half Diagonal-line; on one 30 Scale, and the other point in the Perpendicular on the other 30 Scale, and to those points lay any streight piece, then set a

                        <p>First, you must find the nearest distance from one Corner to the opposite Hip set up, or from a point in the raising piece, as far from one Corner as the House-end is broad, as the point K or L in the Figure may be done thus.</p>
                        <p>Count the length of the Hip on one Leg, (and also take it between your Compasses) and count the breadth of the House on the other Leg, and set one point of the Compasses in the Hips length on one Leg, and the other point in the breadth of the House on the other Leg, altering the 30 Scales, but not your Compasses; then when the 30 Scales are so set, one represents the Raising-piece, and the other the Hip set up.</p>
                        <p>Then the nearest distance from the breadth of the House on one 30 Scale, to the Common-line on the other 30 Scale, is the nearest distance required, being measured from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 16-7-½.</p>
                        <p>Then take the whole Diagonal Line, <hi>viz.</hi> CL, or BK from the Center Laterally, and make it a Parallel, in the nearest distance last found; and that shall set the 30 Scales to the Angle of the outside of the Hip required, which you may measure in degrees thus: take Parallel 15 as the Rule stands, and lay it from the Center, and it shall reach to 116 Degrees on the Chords, next one 30 Scale, the Angle of the outside of the Hips required.</p>

                     <p>First, when the Frame is broader at one end than the other, then the middle breadth is to be the guide for the Rafters Length, and the Perpendicular to be equal to the middle Raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters perpendicular on both ends; though one pair of Rafters is longer than another, and the Roof in winding thereby: Which winding may many times be remedied by some convenient artifice or other, as the ingenious Workman will soon perceive. As thus in brief:</p>
                     <p>Let ABCD represent the Frame of a House Bevelling at both ends, and broader by 2 Foot at one end than the other; as here in the Bevelling figure, being 20 Foot on one side, and 24 Foot on the other side at one Bevel-end 10 Foot 4 Inches, and at the other end 8 Foot 1 Inch ½, but at the nearest distance over, only 10 Foot and 8 Foot.</p>

at each end a Bevel, and set it according to the Rule and 30 Scales, it shall give the true Angle of the Hips at the Raising-piece and King-post, which 8 Angles in these 4 Hips are exprest by the Lines and Letters in the Scheme thus: PAS and PBS, PDO and PCO the 4 Angles at the Raising-piece.

                        <p>Or for more proof thus also by the Rule, as before in Square Roofs.</p>
                        <p>Set the 30 Scales Square, and take the Parallel Extent, from 7 Foot 2-¾- the Rafters length at the broader end, on one 30 Scale, to 6 Foot 2 Inches more, then ½ the Bevel-end by 1 Foot the half quantity of Bevelling, and it shall give 9 Foot 6 Inches for the Hip AP, and from 7-2-¾- to 4-2, one Foot less than the half Bevel-end, to 8 Foot ¼ the Hip BP. Also the Par. extent from 6 Foot 5-½ the Rafters Length at the lesser end, to 5 Foot 0-¾ one Foot more than 4-0-¾ the half little Bevel-end, shall give 8 1-½ for the Hip PC. And the Extent, from 6-5-4/8 the Rafters length, to 3-0-¾ 1 Foot less than the half Bevel-end, gives 7-1-½ the Hip DP, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>Note, That by the working these 3 ways, you may be sure to prevent any mistakes that may happen in working one way only.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, For the Angles on the outside or backs of the Hips.</p>
                        <p>Take every several Hips Length laterally between your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, and set one Point in the Length of the Bevel-end, (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a mean between AB the Bevel-end, and MM at the greater end, or CD and NN at the lesser end) and open or shut the 30 Scales till the other Point falls on the Hips Length that you work for, then for the longer Hip count more, and for the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hip less, by half the Inches Bevelling, then the whole breadth over, at the end, and take the Parallel nearest distance from thence to the 30 Scale for a nearest distance, which nearest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance you must keep.</p>
                        <p>Then take the whole Diagonal Line Perpendicular to the

Hip, wrought for (<hi>viz.</hi> the shortest Diagonal Line for the longest Hip at each end) between your Compasses, and make it a Parallel in the nearest distance last found, and then the 30 Scales are set to the Angle of the back of the Hip required.</p>

                        <head>Example in this Figure for the longest Hip.</head>
                        <p>Take 9 Foot 6 Inches, the Hips Length AP between your Compasses, and set one point in 10 Foot one Inch (a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween AB 10 Foot 4, and MM 9-10 ½) and open or shut the Rule, till the other point stands in 9 Foot 6, the Hips length first taken. Then the nearest distance from 9 Foot 4 Inches, one Foot less than 10 f. 4 Inch. the Bevel-end distance over, to the other 30 Scale shall give 7 10 a nearest distance from the point b to AP the Hip raised over AS the Diagonal.</p>
                        <p>Then the Lateral Extent Bb of the whole Diagonal Line 12 f. 7 Inch. being made a parallel in 7 10 the nearest distance last found, shall set the 30 Scales to the Angle at R the back of the Hip required measured by taking Parallel 30, and measuring at laterally on the Chords it is about 108 Degrees.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Take 8 f. 4 Inches, the other Hips Length between your Compasses, and setting 1 point in 10 f. 1 Inch as before, open or shut the Rule till the other point falls in 8, 4 the Hips Length.</p>
                        <p>Then the nearest distance from 11 Foot 4 Inches, 1 Foot more than 10 Foot 4 Inches the distance of the Bevel-end to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Line of the other 30 Scale shall be when measured Laterally from the Center 9 Foot <hi>fere,</hi> for a nearest distance.</p>
                        <p>Then 15 Foot 8 Inches the longer Diagonal Line being made a Parallel in 9 Foot <hi>fere,</hi> the nearest distance last found, sets the 30 Scales to 121 Degrees the Angle required, the back of the shorter Hip required.</p>
                        <p>The same work serves for the other end, being near the same Angles: Which you may prove by M. <hi>Will. Pope</hi>'s excellent way, thus: find the middle between S and A, or S and B at Q, then the nearest distance from Q to BP or AP near lay to R, and draw the Lines RE, RM for the Angles at R the back of the Hips required.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if you raise 4 Perpendiculars cutting the Points O and S, the two places of the King-posts being perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the Raising-pieces AC end BD, as the 4 Prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines

                        <p>Then ♍ ♌ and ♉ ♊ are the two Ridges when turned right over OS, and C ♋ D is the least Hip, and A ♈ B is the greater Hip, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> hath well shewed. Thus much for Hipt Roofs.</p>

                     <head>Use XIX. To find the Lengths and Angles of Rafters, and Purloyns in Bevel Frames.</head>
                     <p>The Length of the Rafters is shewed before, to find it by the half breadth of the Square or Bevel-end, and the Perpendicular answerable to that Roof, (as afterwards in the Example.) And the Angle of the Foot, and outsides or backs of the Bevel-end Rafters, and the upright of the Gable end, must be to an Angle less and more than 90 degrees by the Angle at the corner of the Frame where that Rafter is to stand, being more at the sharp Angle, and less at the blunt Angle, as in Figure IV you may see; the true quantity of which Angle is thus found by the Rule.</p>
                     <p>Take the Length of the Rafter for the Bevel-end in Feet and Inches, and make it a Parallel in 15, then half the quantity of Feet and Inches Bevelling, taken from the same Scale, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried parallelly till it stay in like parts, shall shew right against it in the Tangents the Degrees and Minutes required.</p>
                     <p>And this is the Angle that the blunt corner is to be laid in Legement more than a square, and the sharp Angle less than a Square or 90 Degrees, both out of Level, and out of square also, when you tumble or stripe in, the Tenons of the Purloins, the thing desired.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example,</hi> Let AB represent the Bevel-end of a Frame, being out of Square from the Line AC 6 foot, as the Line CB sheweth; then if AC be 20 foot, AB will be 20 Foot 10 Inches. Then draw EL the middle Line of the Frame, and GM and HK, the Lines at three quarter of the breadth of the Frame, then take ED the half Bevel, and lay it from G to F, and from H to I, and draw the Lines AF and BI, for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side Lines of the two Bevel-end Rafters: end the two other Lines parallel to them, according to the Breadth or Scantling of your Bevel-end Rafters, as here in the figure 8 Inches broad.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53342:44"/>
Thus the Lines AF and BI represent the two end Rafters, laid in Legement to fit in the Purloins, as for their lying out of Square from the Raising-pieces. And to the same Angle they are to be laid out at Level, that the cutting of the Purloin ends may fit the Rafter sides, when erected in their places, according as the ends F and I of the Bevel-end Rafters are, according to the Angl<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s AFG and AFM, the one being 11 degrees and 20 minutes under, and the other 11, 20 above 90 degrees.</p>
                     <p>Also, Note that if PK and OM do represent a pair of square Rafters, at any intended distance from A, then TS and RQ will give the true Length of the Purloins fit for those places, RQ being the shortest Purloin, and TS the longest Purloin.</p>
                     <p>To find by the Rule only how long the Purloin must be on the outside more or less than the distance on the Raising-pieces, where you intend the two Square Rafter feet shall stand, do thus: set the 30 Scales to the same Angle that the Bevel-end Rafters lie out of Square, when they lie in Legement, to frame which here is to 11 degrees and 20 minutes.</p>
                     <p>Then count from the Center the quantity of Feet and Inches you intend to make the Mortise-holes from the Rafter Foot, in the Rafters, for the Tenons of your Purloins; and take from thence to the nearest distance to the other Line, and that shall shew the quantity that the one Purloin is to be longer, and the other shorter, than the distance between the Rafter-feet on the Raising pieces. Example thus:</p>
                     <p>Set the 30 Scales to the Angle GAF, then count AS the place for the Mortise-hole from A on the Rafter, and take the nearest distance from thence to the other 30 Scale that shall give SV, the quantity how much TS is shorter than AO, and how much RQ is longer than PB.</p>
                     <p>Note, that if you count 3 quarters of 20 Foot 10 Inches, being the Length of the Bevel-end, that then you will make the Rafters too long by 4 Inches and a half, as in the Figure you may see: therefore the surest way to find the Rafters Length is to set the Scales to a Square, and then to take the Parallel Extent from the Common Perpendicular, to the ½ breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the place for the Rafter-feet on the Raising-piece: So that the Length of the Rafters for the Bevel-end at true pitch, is AF 15 Foot 3 Inches, and not AW 15-7-½, which is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53342:45"/>
just 3 quarters of AB the Bevel-end over which the two Rafters are to stand. For then the top of the Bevel-end Rafters would be too high for the top of the Square Rafters being cut just 15 Foot, three quarters of 20 Foot the breadth of the Frame.</p>
