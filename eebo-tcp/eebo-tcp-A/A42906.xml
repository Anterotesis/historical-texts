            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:154380:3"/>
being perſwaded to it, I was rather diſſwaded from it, leſt I by writing too tartly might offend ſome. To do which, after ſerious perpenſion, I was eaſily inclin'd, knowing it to be a weighty Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to appear in Publick, eſpecially with a Phyſical Diſcourſe. Beſides, I oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reflected on my years, and was thereby mightily diſheartned, for all the many Advantages I had in a faithful Tutor, knowing that ſuch a Diſcourſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther became ſome <hi>Gray-headed</hi> Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, than one ſo young as my ſelf. And for that cauſe I aſſure thee I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have declin'd it, could I have had peace in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>For though I knew I had wrote nothing diſſentaneous with Truth, yet I ſuſpected I might incur the anger of ſome ſelfiſh <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> as alſo of ſome incurious <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries,</hi> whoſe own Conſciences would tell them I wrote the Truth, and that they were ſuch I ſpoke of, <hi>Selfiſh Phyſicians,</hi> I ſay, and <hi>Careleſs Apothecaries:</hi> For I

However, toucht or not toucht, I regard it not; and may well be allowed to find fault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing my moſt dear Father (I being young) was kill'd, <hi>Secundum Artem,</hi> through the deceit of the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Apothecary, by taking a Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Purge: And ſeeing that I my ſelf alſo in my younger years, had my Vitals ſo much weakned by their poiſonous and debilitating Methods, that I believe, as long as I live, I ſhall fair the worſe for it: But if they will not allow me to find fault, <hi>I</hi> am reſolved to do it whether they will or no, whilſt mens Lives and Healths are ſo little ſet by, and that Money is the only thing ſought after, whilſt 'tis little minded what Medicines are given for Relief to the Sick, ſo Money can be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by giving them; and ſo that if they die, we can but lay the blame on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and pretend we walkt according to
<pb facs="tcp:154380:4"/>
Art and Method: And whilſt Sincerity and Charity are no Ingredients in Phyſick, and to act the good <hi>Samaritans</hi> part is out of faſhion.</p>
            <p>As to the ſtudy of Phyſick, <hi>I</hi> will aſſure you 'twas not my juvenile Deſign, nor did I enter on it till about ſeven years ſince, in the twentieth year of my Age. When coming to be intimately acquainted with a true-hearted <hi>Chymical Phyſician,</hi> and having been from my Youth a great lover of Art and Science, I, for diverſion-ſake, whilſt I Tabled in the Doctor's Houſe, and had his <hi>Phyſical Library</hi> at command, addicted my mind to the ſtudy of it: Hoping thereby onely to acquire ſo much knowledg in Medicine, as to keep me from being kill'd, as my Father had been by a <hi>Poyſonous Doſe:</hi> and to preſerve my own health for the future, which had been formerly much impaired by <hi>bad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I proceeded, and before many years were paſt, my Fancy and Genius
<pb facs="tcp:154380:5"/>
was wholly inclin'd to it, nor was there any Art or Science under the <hi>Sun</hi> which I ſo much fancied as <hi>Medicine;</hi> though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when my <hi>Phyſical Studies</hi> had brought a weariſomeneſs, I now and then, for ſome years together, ſtudied <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;</hi> but finding it a conjectural Art, and a thing that broke my peace, I wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd it. Then with the greater eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I fell on the ſtudy of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> nor regard I my Moneys; ſo that I, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>otchery, might have real Art: But ſpent hundreds of pounds <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> to that end; which once attained, I hoped in my mind I might be profitable in my Generation, and benefit the miſerable Sick.</p>
            <p>But when after ſeveral years were paſt thus in ſtudy, I ſeriouſly conſidered the danger of working with ſuch <hi>Phyſical Tools,</hi> or ſuch Medicines as Books (the which are for the moſt part a Maſs of Tranſcriptions, and things taken upon truſt from one another) could afford me; forasmuch as many of thoſe <hi>Recipe</hi>-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
<pb facs="tcp:154380:5"/>
not only through their <hi>Earthy,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Poyſonous</hi> Qualities, do more harm than good; but alſo through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedneſs of their Compoſition. I ſay, when I ſeriouſly conſidered this, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to attempt, being very loth to turn Experimenter; and as the <hi>Phraſe</hi> has it,
<q>
                  <p>Ludere cum corio humano.</p>
               </q>
I was alſo more frightned from it, by the untimely death of my Father, and by obſerving the <hi>Errors</hi> of <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> I then thought upon <hi>Helmont,</hi> and believed he wrote not ſo ſharply for nothing, as alſo that <hi>Medicine</hi> (as he ſaid) was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed. Which made me, having been hurt by <hi>Phyſick,</hi> know the better how to pitty the Sick, and avoid all means of hurting them.</p>
            <p>But at length the <hi>Almighty</hi> favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and my good Friend dearly loving me: He confer'd his whole Knowledg in <hi>Pharmacy</hi> on me, and the reſult of above
<pb facs="tcp:154380:6"/>
twenty years diligent ſearch in <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry:</hi> Nor was I wholly ungrateful.</p>
            <p>So that then being not the verieſt Botcher in <hi>Medicine,</hi> and having the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty daily to diſcourſe with the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> and the advantage to raiſe various Objections, and have them anſwered: I by diligent obſervance, by Operating, and by ſtudying for ſeveral years, not ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhly, having gain'd the knowledg of ſome Injuries in <hi>Phyſick;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> for thy benefit (my <hi>Tutor</hi> being deceaſed) I have thought it fit to make them publick. If thou ſhalt ask whether or no I am or ever was a Member of the Univerſity, <hi>(for that is a thing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a great face with it)</hi> I ſhall tell thee, Yes: But moreover aſſure thee, I was more happy than to ſpend years there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> and ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Notions and Arts, that could not at laſt teach me how to cure a cut Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger radically, much leſs a violent <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:154380:6"/>
Yet truly I exceedingly honour them, as they are <hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> and could wiſh they did not mind Words more than Things.</p>
            <p>And prethee, <hi>Reader,</hi> don't ever the more under value this Diſcourſe, becauſe thou findeſt it neither dedicated to ſome <hi>Great Man,</hi> nor yet ſet off with flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes in commendation of me and my Work. The laſt I diſeſteem, becauſe though ſome ingenious <hi>Phyſical Tracts</hi> at a chance comes forth with ſome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, yet almoſt every Maſs of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,</hi> or Bundle of <hi>Inſignificancies,</hi> have them to perſwade the Reader to buy it. I am therefore reſolv'd to have mine come ſimple and naked, that if thou likeſt it ſo, thou mayeſt buy it; if otherwiſe, let it alone.</p>
            <p>Nor did I not <hi>Dedicate</hi> it through want of thoſe to whom I might have ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it, or thoſe who would willingly
<pb facs="tcp:154380:7"/>
have accepted on't: But that which made me not do it, was an unwillingneſs to ſooth and flatter any Man, and to follow the cuſtom of aſcribing all Vertues to One ſcarce acquainted with them. For I am ſomewhat of an humour differing from the generality, in that whilſt they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all Vertues to a Rich Man, I am prone to aſcribe all Riches to a Vertuous Man: And to account him that is Wealthy and Vertuous, (for ſome ſuch there are) to be rich in a two-fold mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. However to the moſt Vertuous of them, without <hi>Your moſt humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Sir</hi> in the cloſe of it, I ſhould have tendred an unacceptable Gift: And therefore did not Dedicate, whilſt I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring more of a Ruſtick than a Courtier, could never yet frame my mouth to ſuch <hi>artificial Speeches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, if I had dedicated it to the moſt <hi>Noble and Wealthy,</hi> be could not have preſerv'd it from the cenſures of
<pb facs="tcp:154380:7"/>

of the Stomach the prime preparer of nouriſhments. For doubtleſs, as <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the Various Arteries and Veins which it has, are beſtowed on it, to nouriſh it, and that it may reap ſome of the fruit of its own Labour, after the ſubſervient Digeſtions have fully maturated it. Which thing conſidered: how hurtful is Phlebotomy that takes away the Blood which gives vigour to the Stomach?</p>
            <p>And if the Blood is grown bad through a weakneſs in the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> and Scorbutick impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity introduc'd; think you ever to remove it through renewed Weaknings, and taking away from the Stomach part of that Blood which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorates, enlivens, and nouriſheth it? Which you do when ever you breath a vein, ſeeing whilſt it runs out or ſoon after, through the Bloods circulation, all parts are co-ſharers in the loſs. Therefore is <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> the direct way to make the Blood worſe inſtead of taking away the Scorbutick impurity of it; becauſe the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach being debilitated through a loſs of that Crimſon-juice will be more diſabled for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: whereby through weakneſs a worſe Chyle being made, a worſe nouriſhment will be ſent through the <hi>Venae Lact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:154380:10"/>
is as equally ridiculous, as if one pretending to defend a Country already invaded, ſhould take away from them a great part of their Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Weapons.</p>
            <p>To declare which more amply I will venture to Tautologize, and tell you 'tis unfit to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Blood, unleſs better can be put in its place. Which can no waies be rationally expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe from a loſs of that lively juice, a weakneſs (<hi>as I ſaid before)</hi> is confer'd on the Stomach's, and other digeſtions, all parts being nouriſht therewith. But we ought rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the cauſe of its impurity: to wit, whether it had its Original from the Air being ſo, or from any precedeing Digeſtions of the body caus'd by an <hi>Ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, the Digeſtions being debilitated, will be hindered from thorowly concocting what ſhall be taken for nouriſhment, and thereby damnify the whole maſs of blood, and produce a greater weakneſs, if the party be not vigorous, and active.</p>

            <p>But if the bloods impurity is from an error in the firſt ſhops of digeſtion, caus'd by thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities mentioned, what good does Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy ſo long as the cauſe is not remov'd, and the Digeſtions ſend immature aids through debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? For if it be granted that we make ſeveral ounces of blood daily, &amp; diſmiſs as much through the Pores of the Skin; likewiſe that the blood is ſubject to mutation, by adhering to what ſuccours are ſent from the Stomach, as truly it is; and that through deficiency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and debility impurity enters the blood; is it not agreeable and conſentaneous to Reaſon, that after a thorow and perfect ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthening it, and removing the occaſional cauſe, the ſame Crimſon-juice ſhould grow healthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whilſt all digeſtions are gradually cleanſed? Yes 'tis. But this can no waies be better, and ſafelier done than by Spirituous, Valiant, and Innocent Healers, ſeconded by a regular Diet. By ſuch Healers I ſay as are aſſiſtant to Nature, and may help her to expel the Diſeaſie leaven,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154380:11"/>
and inſinuate into the private receſſes of Life; ſuch as may ſubvert all Forreign, Hoſtile ferments without craving the aſſiſtance of the Lancet.</p>
            <p>For notwithſtanding the Taunts and Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>careleſs Men,</hi> ſuch Medicines are to be found; but I can aſſure them not by ſleeping, nor only reading of Books; which may be the cauſe ſome meer <hi>Notioniſts</hi> ſay thus of themſelves, and diſcover their own Sloth by their Scoffs.</p>
            <p>For all the boaſtings and Vain talks of theſe <hi>Chymiſts</hi> (ſay they) we can find no Remedies that can Diſſipate a Fever certainly, and cure Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick affects, without having recourſe to Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy; much leſs in a Pleuriſy to deliver a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the Jaws of Death that is almoſt ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with blood. For ſurely had there been any ſuch Medicines, we ſhould have known them who have tumbled over ſo many Volumes.</p>
            <p>But they ſhould conſider, that although to be well-read is a thing needful, and ſo requiſite that he which is not deſerves not the Name of a Phyſician; yet that he, who on the contrary is ſo incumbent on his Books, as to neglect that moſt Material part of Pharmacy, the making &amp; impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Medicines by Pyrotechny, may doubtleſs paſs for a good Scholar unleſs he be egregiouſly Dull, but will ſcarce work Wonders in Phyſick. Becauſe good, vertuous and lively Medicines muſt cure the Sick, for all words: and ſuch are not obtain'd without practice in making.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:154380:11"/>For if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> were well-ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and good Linguiſts: yet 'tis to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that they ſpent not their whole time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Nominative caſe and the Verb,</hi> or in Readings only, and ſubſcribing to the errors of their Predeceſſors: but the greateſt part in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Medica,</hi> and in procuring ſuch noble Remedies as might credit a Phyſician, and cure the Diſeaſes of their Age.

            <p>But ſeeing that as Generations ſucceeded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies were entail'd on the world as wel as lands, and do ſtill grow worſe and worſe, through the intruſion of ſeveral Diſeaſes, whoſe foot-ſteps were unknown to the Antients: it muſt needs be neceſſary, to exalt the Vertues of Medicines as much, as Diſeaſes are exalted in Malignity, by

making them innocent, piercing, and lively; and by with-drawing all nauſeous, and hurtful qualities from them, whilſt Agents are duely apply'd to Patients.</p>
            <p>And for a Phyſician to affirm, or think, that no man is a Poſſeſſor of ſuch lively innocent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, as may ſafely, and certainly cure Diſeaſes without Phlebotomy; becauſe through either his Neglect, want of a <hi>Phyſical genius,</hi> or a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Tutor,</hi> to communicate the reſult of twenty or thirty years experience in <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> he never was owner of ſuch: or becauſe he hath unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfully tried, ſome weak if not <hi>miſchievous</hi> Chymical Remedies, ſuch as <hi>Apothecaries</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently buy of <hi>incurious</hi> and mercenary Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to wit, Spurious Mercurial, and ill-made Antimonial ones, that will purge and vomit unreaſonably, or have the Mercury unſlain: That are rather diſturbers than aiders of Nature, and that were at their firſt entrance baniſht the Laboratories, and Repoſitories of the Ingenious; who will harbour no Medicine that may not be ſafely taken by the healthy.

               <p>This I thought meet to hint for the good of ſuch, who are ſo extreamly <hi>Lapified,</hi> that meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the account of getting the <hi>Lapis Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorum</hi> (though they oftner get the ſtone in the <hi>Kidneys</hi>) attempt the ſtudy of Chymiſtry: thereby loſing much Silver in catching of Gold, &amp; in unfortunately plundering the Golden fleece.</p>

               <p>But as I ſaid before, he ſometimes viſiting this Grave Man, amongſt many other things, would oft exceedingly pleaſe himſelf in talking <hi>Tara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan-tara</hi> about the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal Gold,</hi> and gazing in our faces would magnify <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Antimony,</hi> and tell us there was a noble thing in'em; to which the Grave <hi>Doctor</hi> would ſay, <hi>ſo; what then;</hi> or <hi>nod a little;</hi> and that was as much as he could get. Thus at laſt when he had told out a Tale of two or three hours long, home he would go as Wiſe as he came.

               <p>But to proceed; many ſuch viſits being paſt, to work he went on <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamized the firſt with the laſt; conjoyn'd them with <hi>Antimony</hi> after a previous preparation; and firmly reſolv'd, after he had made it into a <hi>Cinnabar</hi> that it ſhould be <hi>Horizontal Gold:</hi> and enumerating praiſes in no wiſe due to it, ſtriv'd to recompenſe the fewneſs of its vertues by a

I verily believe believ that ſome, and thoſe not a few, receiv'd great benefit by it. <hi>But yet ſome others were very much injured.</hi> For when ſuch <hi>Mercurial</hi> Medicines do meet with a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach whoſe Ferment goes to work and reſolves them, and by conſequence ſets the <hi>Mercury</hi> at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, then is't that the <hi>Villain, Mercury</hi> plays knaviſh Tricks, and makes the <hi>Patient</hi> wiſh him out of his body: and if I my ſelf were Sick, and ſhould ſend for a Phyſician, if he give me a <hi>Mercurial</hi> Medicine that ſix others before me had done well after, whilſt their Stomachs did not reſolve it; yet my Stomach through the <hi>propriety</hi> of its Ferment, ſetting the <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> at liberty (which none of theirs could) it might be a means to Kill, or miſchief me.

               <p>A young Man falling Sick was perſwaded by ſome Viſitants to accept of our <hi>piece of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnedneſs</hi> for his Phyſician, and accordingly took as I was inform'd a Doſe of a certain pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which, by its deſcriptions, I deem'd was either the <hi>conterfeit Horizontal,</hi> or ſome ſuch hazardous <hi>Mineralline</hi> production. But in ſhort, the young Mans head ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſwell'd very much (<hi>Oh Noble Mercury and Antimony</hi>) alſo his Tongue black, and ſo ſwell'd as not to be eaſily contain'd within its limits; and thus being in very great Miſery he breath'd his laſt.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>cure</hi> though leſs miſchievous than the former was on a Gentleman of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of the ſame Neighbourhood; one that for many years together had been a Patient to my <hi>Sober Tutor.</hi> By whom having now for ſeveral years been kept ſound, through taking when need required ſuch <hi>innocent,</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> remedies as were meet: was at length overper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded (thinking perhaps any one might be a Chymiſt, and that all Medicines call'd Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical were ſafe) to accept of our <hi>piece</hi> of <hi>Unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedneſs</hi> for his Phyſician; and when his Body required converſe with Medicines, to take ſome of him, which he did. But after a few months following his ill-contriv'd mixtures, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to that weakneſs, that his Legs ſeem'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſupport his Body. Thus being tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a daily declining of his ſtrength and an almoſt inceſſant gnawing in his Stomach, (<hi>Oh Noble Mercury and Antimony!</hi> He ſends his Wife to his former Chymical Phyſician, with requeſts to ſend ſomething to give him eaſe, foraſmuch as he ſuppoſed, and ſo did his Wife, that the Medicines taken from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; had exceedingly weaken'd him, and were

the cauſe of that <hi>Gnawing.</hi> His deſires were anſwered, as to obtaining eaſe, and getting ſtrength; but not a <hi>real</hi> Cure: <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Antimony</hi> ſcorning to be baffled after that pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful rate, whilſt the very texture of his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and other vital bowels was vitiated.

               <p>But leting our <hi>Piece of Unleardneſs</hi> paſs I will give you another relation. <hi>A Learned Phyſician</hi> my very familiar acquaintance, who from his Infancy was educated in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and chiefly in <hi>Pyrotechny;</hi> accidentally about the one and twentieth year of his Age, met with an <hi>Author</hi> that magnifies ſome <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial</hi> preparations, and impertinently ſtyles on an <hi>All-curer,</hi> This the ſtudious young Phyſician reading, was no little animated to follow the <hi>Authors</hi> preſcrib'd proceſs, and prepare this Medicine: but before hand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints his experienced Father with his deſign, and accordingly was diſſwaded from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nor was it without cauſe; for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been deceived in his Junior ſearches by that <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But in brief his <hi>Life</hi> being in Danger, (<hi>Oh Noble Mercury!</hi>) he applies himſelf to ſome Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and innocent Remedies, which they had in their <hi>Repoſitory,</hi> that quickly diſpatcht it out of his <hi>Stomach,</hi> and other the more Vital Bowels: and ſending it to his <hi>Throat,</hi> it rais'd a ſmall ſore ſo painful, that for nigh half a years time, it diſquieted him day and night; but in the end by ſtrengthening Remedies he was cured. Whereas, for ought I know, had they wanted good Medicines, he might have been <hi>Kill'd</hi> by <hi>Noble Mercury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſince, for this and diverſe other good Reaſons, he is ſo much an Enemy to <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Medicines;</hi> and ſo irreconcileably angry with them: that I perſwade my ſelf he will not deal with them on any account; nor give ſuch to the Sick were he <hi>hired.</hi>

               <p>When I view <hi>Glaubers</hi> works and examine the forepart of them, I muſt needs conclude he wrote not a few things that were very good and uſeful; though methods tedious enough in <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> are delivered: But when I view the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, to wit, the <hi>Appendix to the fifth part of Phyloſophick furnaces,</hi> his <hi>Annotations</hi> to his <hi>Appendix,</hi> his way of making <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> and his <hi>ſeparation of Gold out of Flints, Sand, Clay, &amp;c.</hi> By the aſſiſtance of the <hi>ſpirit of Salt,,</hi> it makes me even admire at the Man: and judge if he was not mad nor out of his Wits, when he wrote thoſe impertinent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, yet conclude he was reſolv'd to abuſe the World with a parcell of <hi>Figments</hi> and <hi>fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and out of a deſire to impoſe on the too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous, pretend to teach <hi>lucriferous ſecrets.</hi> I could wiſh with all my heart, I might be acquainted with; or at leaſt wiſe hear (which I never yet could) of ſome perſons that had been profited by his gain-bringing Arts; or that ever made his <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> and found

               <p>Concerning which had the Author been ſilent and not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him for defrauding ſeveral Perſons of their monies, under pretence of ſelling wonderful ſecrets; his own writings would have ſo amply manifeſted it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, if thorowly con'd, that no other proof had been wanting.

               <p>But to return to <hi>Glauber</hi> again: I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were to deceive his Reader, what made him publiſh <hi>gainful</hi> Arts whilſt he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf a <hi>wanter</hi> of ſuch: for in his Preface after his <hi>Appendix,</hi> he tells us: <hi>He had lived in theſe places,</hi> meaning Holland, <hi>many years with diſprofit, and therefore was reſolv'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the peace of Germany ſucceeded or not, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf to ſuch places, where he might have opportunity to handle Coals and Mines</hi>—Of which what need was there, ſeeing he himſelf could teach ſuch <hi>gainful</hi> Arts as the ſeparation of Gold out of <hi>Flints, Sand,</hi> or <hi>Clay.</hi> If theſe Arts were really ſuch, how came he to live <hi>idle</hi> with <hi>disprofit?</hi> What were neither <hi>Flints, Sand,</hi> nor <hi>Clay</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> nor the Provinces adjoyning, that he might in ſome ſort profit himſelf? <hi>For Charity begins at home:</hi> what were none of them there?

he ſaies <hi>how poor ſoever,</hi> Gold may be extracted out of it, by the <hi>ſpirit of Salt,</hi> with Gain: and tells us 'tis ſuch a ſecret by which no man can be an impediment to another? 'Tis very ſtrange he could never: and may we not ſuppoſe him in his generation to have been <hi>Tantalus redivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus?</hi> another <hi>Tantalus</hi> that in the midſt of <hi>Golden Arts</hi> was poor?

               <p>Doubtleſs theſe very pretty Crotchets, no little pleas'd him, when he conſider'd how they would be admir'd and ſtar'd at. But I wonder with what confidence he could ſend them to the Preſs.

Nor did he this alone, but the ſame <hi>Author</hi> affirms, he <hi>cheated</hi> ſeveral of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of money; pretending to teach won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſecrets, and then put a trick on them at laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:154380:32"/>To one <hi>Plenipotentiarie</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>Glauber</hi> ſold a <hi>Tract</hi> entituled <hi>Explicatio Miraculi mundi,</hi> as it was in its manuſcript for a hundred Duckets, and afterwards publiſht it in Print: that <hi>Glauber</hi> for ſome highly prais'd ſecret, had bargain'd with the ſame <hi>Great Man,</hi> and had receiv'd <hi>ſix hundred Imperials</hi> before hand: and though a time was ſet wherein he was to prove the certainty and truth of the <hi>ſecret; ſecret;</hi> yet that, and a longer, time being paſt the expected certainty of it no where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.

               </p>
               <p>After this, the <hi>Anonymus</hi> ſaith, he came into <hi>England,</hi> and at <hi>London</hi> found that the writings of <hi>Glauber,</hi> which were tranſlated into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Idiom, did excite many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions and filthy ſpeeches againſt him (to wit) becauſe the preſcribed proceſſes of the Author were moſt vain; and that frequently many men, had vainly tried the greateſt part of them, to their very great loſs.</p>
               <p>He ſaith alſo that in <hi>Germany, Holland,</hi> and other places, complaints concerning him were then frequent. One ſaith, <q>Alas for me! who have ſpent ſo much money on Glauber, &amp; have not indeed received on Pins worth of profit, or gainful retribution from his Arts.</q>

                  <q>Saith a ſecond, I was ſeduced after this

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>A third ſaith, behold what incredible naughtineſs is in Glauber; his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells him, he cannot perform the <hi>Concentration</hi> he ſo exceedingly boaſted of. For notwithſtanding, as he deſired, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Cauldrons, with all other requiſits for <hi>Concentration</hi> of Corn, and Wine, were prepared for him, and that at other Mens coſts: yet in lieu of theſe large expences he produced nothing of worth, inſomuch that the moſt poor and indigent, were unwilling to drink the Beer which he made; And yet deſiſts not for all to invite even the whole World, to ſuch his Fallacious Arts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus writes our Nameleſs Author; who I am perſwaded was a Man ſingularly honeſt, and wrote no waies out of deſign, but for the real benefit of his neighbour: however his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are conſentaneous with the <hi>Chymical,</hi> whilſt Glaubers ſeem uncouth and forreign.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:154380:33"/>
one that came not off a <hi>looſer</hi> at laſt, you'l prove by farmore fortunate than I have. On the other hand I knew one, a <hi>quick-witted,</hi> and <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unlearned Junior Chymiſt,</hi> that was a mighty adorer of <hi>Glauber,</hi> and gave no little credit to his writings: who on a time (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had read <hi>Glauber</hi> well) boaſted he could get twenty pounds a week by working on <hi>Minerals,</hi> which made us not ſmile a little: But after his roving conjectures were put into practice, he eaſily found his miſtake; in that inſtead of getting twenty pounds a week, he, I be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve did not convert much leſs than a hundred pounds yearly into <hi>Fume.</hi> And 'tis a wonder my <hi>Honeſt Tutor</hi> had not been caught amongſt the reſt; however I believe he went not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Scot-free: and had doubtleſs confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a great deal more, had not this <hi>Anonymous Latin Treatiſe</hi> which I have before cited, been ſent him as a <hi>Preſent</hi> out of <hi>Holland,</hi> by a learned acquaintance of his, not long after he had met with <hi>Glaubers</hi> works.</p>
               <p>Who can ſufficiently admire at the Folly of <hi>Glauber,</hi> and his ridiculous and foppiſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies? ſurely I think none.

               <p>ANd firſt, I judge it will not be amiſs as Perliminary to Treat a little of the vices of <hi>Ferments,</hi> and the contrary. They being of Genuine, proper and true, the producers of quietude, and health in the Body, and <hi>é con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> if ſpurious, malign, eſtrang'd, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, the Authors of all diſorders and <hi>Fevers.</hi> Thus a <hi>Thorn</hi> or <hi>Splinter</hi> in the hand, makes ſuch diſturbance through its forreigneſs to the part, and its ſpurious fermentive odour, that it excites a preternatural heat; and ſometimes make the whole hand, and arm, ſenſible of its power: thereby ſo altering and corrupting the <hi>Saline</hi> Blood which flows thither, as ſummon'd by the inraged Spirit of the part (which by <hi>Helmont</hi> is called the <hi>Archeus</hi>) to expel the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Enemy, as to make it put off vitality.</p>
               <p>So that thus in the mean time the Blood is buſie to expel, but not able, and for that cauſe angry, and hot; in approaching the <hi>Thorne</hi> (which through the excitemenes of heat ſends forth a ſpurious odour) 'tis changed from its <hi>ſaline</hi> and <hi>Balſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:154380:37"/>
injurious as the <hi>Thorn.</hi> Inſomuch that at laſt inſtead of a <hi>Hoſtile Thorn</hi> only, a Thorn and Thornineſs are preſent to the more violent exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating the <hi>Archeus.</hi> And indeed <hi>Optima Corrupta peſſima,</hi> the Blood the moſt lively juice of the Body being thus once deviated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, is no leſs miſchievous than the Thorn. For it having through adheering to the <hi>thorny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaven</hi> put on corruption, loſt <hi>its ſalineneſs,</hi> and <hi>its vitality,</hi> is thenceforth forbidden <hi>to circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> in with the Blood, and enjoy the benefit of <hi>Life.</hi> However a ferment being begun, it glanceth forth <hi>its vitious raies;</hi> and whilſt the <hi>Archeus</hi> is inraged at what doth afflict him, and neglects the defence of his Territories, the neighbouring good Blood is gradualy perverted (<hi>for a little Leaven leavens a whole Lump</hi>) and the <hi>Life</hi> of the part is endangered.</p>
               <p>Thus you may ſee the cauſe of a <hi>Fever,</hi> and that though it takes <hi>its</hi> denomination from <hi>Heat,</hi> yet <hi>that heat</hi> is but <hi>the effect,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſo much to be minded; ſeeing the <hi>thorn,</hi> or <hi>thing cauſing is cold,</hi> and <hi>Deadly.</hi> But if whilſt the <hi>thorn</hi> in the hand is unremov'd, or if removed whilſt the begun <hi>Thorny Ferment or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> is in being, they ſhould, to abate the <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental</hi> Feveriſh-heat, let the Blood out, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>coolers</hi> outwardly or inwardly; oppoſing the <hi>preternatural heat</hi> with contraries, could you poſſibly, forbear ſmiling, and not think them

likewiſe Men, that unleſs we wil wilfully ſhut our eyes as (<hi>the greater is the Miſery</hi>) too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do, we may plainly enough ſee their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs.</p>
               <p>I remember a Learned Gentleman of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, no Phyſician but a general ſtudent, and by that means intimate with ſome <hi>Court-Phyſicians,</hi> ſeriouſly told me; that on a time he lately Diſcourſing with an eminent <hi>Doctor;</hi> a lover of Chymical Principles, and asking him why he let his Patients be bleeded, ſeeing he knew better things; had what follows for an anſwer.

Much good may his gain by bleeding do him.</p>
               <p>But to reaſſume our diſcourſe about Forreign Ferments, and to prove them the cauſe of <hi>heat</hi> in a <hi>Fever,</hi> leaving our Thorn, let us conſider a Mote in the eye, not unlike a Thorn to the part: of which I will Treat, after I have deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you to take notice, <hi>that all Ferments are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:154380:39"/>
injured by ſtrange ones, and that all parts and Liquors of the Body abhor the intruſion of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner.</hi> Thus a Mote in the Eye ſtirreth up a <hi>Feveriſh heat</hi> in the part, whilſt Nature being hurt ſends moiſture plentifully to wipe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: But labouring in vain, grows inraged, and angry, and gives leaſure to the Mote (<hi>heat being preſent</hi>) to lay the foundation of a <hi>ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Acrimonious Ferment</hi> that corrupts' the <hi>Latex</hi> flowing thither, and endeavours a total extirpation of the life of the part.

Bliſters</hi> rais'd in his Neck, to draw the humour backwards; <hi>after the pretty ill-contriv'd old way ſtrike at the effect but neglect the cauſe</hi>) I ſay the Chymical Doctor hearing him complain and ſeeing him like to looſe his eyes ſight; out of compaſſion offered him his help contrary to his cuſtome, <hi>(for I believe he hateth that shab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed trick of asking people to buy health)</hi> and told him he would give him ſomething to cure him; ſhould not coſt above half a Crown: the Merchant replyed, he cared not what it coſt provided he could be cured: and thereupon coming next day to the Doctors houſe, he gave him a Liquor that kills Spurious acid Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and is very friendly to the eye; which being dropped into his eyes, three or four times a day, they were well in the ſpace of (<hi>as I think</hi>) three daies. By which you may ſtill ſee the force of <hi>Ferments,</hi> and what Medicines are likelieſt to prevail.</p>
               <p>And as a <hi>Fever</hi> in the hand is caus'd by a <hi>Thorn,</hi> a forreigner and an enemy to the part; as alſo the like in the Eye by a Mote, both the <hi>begetters</hi> (heat being preſent) of <hi>Spurious Ferments:</hi> ſo if it happens that any thing is admitted into the Stomach (which I have in following Diſcourſe endeavoured to prove the Prime ſeat of life; &amp; there through its weakneſs, or neglect of the <hi>Vitals</hi> called away from their duty, by ſome ſudden fear, ſurpriſal, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154380:40"/>
(for there may be twenty waies to cauſe it) what ever is received in for nouriſhment, deviates, &amp; puts on a Hoſtile dreſs, and through debility is detained in that Noble Bowel long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than it ſhould: know the thing ſo detain'd is an Enemy, and <hi>Metaphorical Thorn</hi> to the Stomach the prime ſeat of Life, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Parent of Feveriſhneſs in the whole body byeconſent. The which thing happens not to the Eye, or Hand, in regard they are <hi>leſs noble and nouriſhed;</hi> and are not thoſe on whoſe welfare the life of the Whole Body depends: therefore no more to be compared to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach in point of Excellence then Servants are to their Maſters. wherefore ſeeing the blood, which is innocent, is commonly charg'd with the guilt of harbouring the cauſe of a <hi>Fever,</hi> and is therefore let out and Nature impoveriſht, I will proceed to prove, that 'tis mightily wrong'd, and lay the blame on the Stomach as its due.</p>
               <p>To tel you that with <hi>Stomachical Medicines,</hi> and thoſe that reſiſt Spurious Ferments, I have known of many hundreds that were cured of <hi>Fevers,</hi> without the leaſt aſſiſtance of <hi>Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> or endangering the Life of the Patient; and ſuch <hi>Fevers</hi> that the ſingle and aſſociated endeavours of ſeveral <hi>Galeniſts</hi> before the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that at laſt cured them with ſuch, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; will be, I ſuppoſe, much to weak an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:154380:40"/>
to prove it; inaſmuch as ſome may on on the other hand object, that thoſe Medicines I call <hi>ſtomachical,</hi> might be aſwell adapted to the <hi>Blood,</hi> and might deſtroy the Spurious Ferment in it. I therefore ſhall endeavour more amply to prove by arguments aſwell as examples.</p>
               <p>And firſt I wil begin with a <hi>Hectick Fever;</hi> which though numbered by many, and that not ineptly, in the Catalogue of Conſumptions, I ſhall here Summon in to prove the ſtomach the ſeat of a <hi>Fever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To tell you its definition, and to ſpend time and paper, to tell you the opinion of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents about it, would be a thing beſides the matter: it being not my intent to ſpin out a tedious Diſcourſe, whilſt the Diſeaſe is too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly known. That the foundation of that febrile heat, which accompanies a <hi>Hectick,</hi> is in the ſtomach, and that its weakneſs is the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer thereof, is ſo apparent to any one that has but half an Eye, that to deny it would be vain: whilſt in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, &amp; when 'tis in its Bud, a Feveriſhneſs is wonted to poſſeſs the palms of the hand, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the whole Body, in leſs than an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eating any thing liberally: and this when as yet the food is in the ſtomach, and no chyle ſent from thence to the <hi>Venae Lacteae:</hi> much leſs to the blood in the Veins; that it might there
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154380:41"/>
prove the cauſe of that <hi>Heat.</hi> Nor doth the <hi>Aeſtuating and Feveriſhneſs</hi> ceaſe, till the ſtomach hath overcome the oppreſſion of the food, and in ſome ſort fitted it for the <hi>Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> yet at laſt having digeſted and clear'd it ſelf of it, the <hi>Aeſtuating</hi> ſpontaneouſly ceaſeth, till the ſtomach is over-loaded a freſh. Here we ſee that a Fever is caus'd, and cured again, whilſt the Blood in the Veins is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>That this is true my own experience hath told me, beſides what I ſaw from others. For being ſome years ſince a little <hi>too Bookiſh,</hi> I in ſtudying for the health of others, loſt my own. Yet not ſo, but that I could pretty well walk about; for 'twas only my Spirits were flag'd, and the digeſtion of my ſtomach weakened. This I felt for a mouth together, and could by no means be drawn to give over, till by appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſigns I fully perceiv'd my ſelf in a <hi>Hectick Fever.</hi> For uſually at noon, after eating a moderate dinner, or at evening a ſupper, the palms of my hands would burn, my head ach, &amp; I was ſometimes more than ordinarily <hi>Feveriſh:</hi> that this Feveriſhneſs was from my Stomach, and that the Blood was not concerned, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than as 'twas hot for the ſake of the vital Spirit, I will thus prove.</p>
               <p>I uſually about an hour (ſometimes leſs) after Dinner or Supper, whilſt as yet the meat
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154380:41"/>
was in my ſtomach, was wonted to have the palms of my hands hot, and ſometimes other parts too, with no little pain in my head. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore a Tabler with my <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rdial Tutor,</hi> I knew how to come at Medicines; and would uſually, when I found <hi>the Fever</hi> and <hi>Head-ach</hi> violent, drink about four ſpounful of two Medicines which were <hi>ſtomachical</hi> and abſterſive, and as uſually remove them both in half an hours time hy enabling my ſtomach to maſter the food, whilſt it deſtroy'd all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to Spuriouſneſs. Whereas ſhould the food have laid long, have declin'd, and prov'd Thorny, and the ſtomach not able to diſmiſs it; the thing to be expected had been a <hi>continual Fever</hi> from Natures endeavouring to expel it.</p>
               <p>Nor is the heat in a <hi>Hectick,</hi> otherwiſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from that in a <hi>continual Fever,</hi> than that the one is occaſion'd by food receiv'd into a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach that is unable to digeſt it, through an ill-habit and general weakneſs: and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is caus'd from food received into a healthy ſtrong ſtomach; which either through its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too too much or from ſome other acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal error, Nature being unable to diſpoſe of it, lies there and degenerates, and <hi>Thorn</hi>-like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a <hi>Fever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a <hi>Fever</hi> which aſſaults Perſons ſtrong, &amp; luſty, is commonly by far the more vehement
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:154380:42"/>
and raging; therefore wanteth the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedies. For their ſtomachs being vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, a ſmall matter hurts them not; and their ſtrength being confirm'd bear`s them out: ſo that if they are caught, commonly the offence is to ſome purpoſe, and they ſometimes dearly pay the puniſhment of their offence. For what is more common, than to have <hi>robuſt, and jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial</hi> people; if after <hi>ſurfeiting and ſurcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their Stomachs, they fall into a continual Fever: for want of potent abſterſive remedies to deſtroy the forreign ferment and enable the ſtomach to do its duty, to take their laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of this World, when <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> and the Doctors <hi>coolers</hi> have done their beſt. And all becauſe they miſtaking the matter fall ſoul on the innocent Blood, and never level <hi>at the cauſe</hi> in the <hi>Stomach.</hi> Whereas they that are weakly, tender, and feebliſh, not daring to be ſo bold with their ſtomachs; if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their little Doſes, and their healths are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced by it; yet it not being ſo over much to exceſs, they make ſhift to wade from under it, with ſome ſlender diſturbance, and pretty eaſily recover again:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what is the ſeat of a Continual Fever, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the Stomach and no where elſe?</hi> If you mean thoſe <hi>Fevers</hi> which are bred by themſelves alone, and don't borrow their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>ſtrange</hi> paſſions: I ſay yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And in ch. 10. he ſaith, that they are ſo much the worſe Fevers, which ſhall not ſit in the hollowneſs of the Stomach, but in its convex parts; becauſe none but an extraordinary Arcanum can reach unto thoſe places. And therefore all Camp and all Endemical Fevers are more ſtubborn than others and for the moſt part without Thirſt; wherein the heat is ſcarce perceivable, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual perplexity alone brings the ſick unto their Coffin: for ſuch-like Fevers defile only from without, and affect the laſt nouriſhment of the ſtomach.

               <p>To confirm the truth of which Doctrine concerning a Fevers ſeat in the Stomach, a <hi>loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> juſt after the beginning of a Fever, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring of fleſhes, fiſhes, and thoſe things which readily corrupt, do offer themſelve; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thirſt, and want of Appetite do prove it. Pain in the forepart of the head, Do tages, a great Drowſineſs ſometimes and watching other ſome, pain about the mouth of the Stomach, and ſometimes in that part of the back on which the ſtomach reſteth, do alſo ſhew it.

and formidable in their perplexities,</hi> take theſe following examples.</p>
               <p>In the year 1660. being the fifteenth year of my Age, about Mid-Summer occaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring my taking Coach for <hi>London,</hi> I return'd from thence into the Country again about a month after; and the laſt night upon the road, my Jovial companions requiring it, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent after ſupper we went to be <hi>merry</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſpeak more properly be <hi>Mad.</hi> We having drunk pretty high though not to <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,</hi> I that alwayes before was accuſtom'd to moderate drinking, was illiſh next morning; and about noon had a pain in my Stomach. But at night when I came home was aſſaulted with a violent fever, whilſt my <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> grievouſly ach'd &amp; a violent pain poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my Back, doubtleſs caus'd by the ſtomachs leaning on the back-bone. In this plght I was when next morning they ſent to a Phyſician, who ſent me a purging doſe: I took it the next day, and had ſix or ſeven ſtools, but my pains were more and more increaſt, inſomuch that I did little but roar.</p>
               <p>At night after taking ſome <hi>Kitchen-Phyſick,</hi> I went to bed being ill, and next morning when I awakt I found my ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>-well; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aroſe and came down. They wondered to ſee me whilſt with Joy I told them I was <hi>well,</hi> and had not the leaſt pain or Fever: But a few
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154380:44"/>
hours after they viewing my hands, and face, found the <hi>Small Pox</hi> coming out thick and three fold, as being I believe made worſe by the purge.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, my bed being warm'd, I was ſent back again to it, &amp; with Difficulty eſcapt with my life: but for five years after this with, what with the weakennings of this fit, twice bleeding an Iſſue, often vomitting, and oftner purging; I was every year as duly as autumn came, laid up with a continual Fever, or an intermitting one. Though ever ſince through the benefit of ſuch healters whoſe properties I have deſcrib'd, I was not ſick, to ſay ſick, two dayes.</p>
               <p>By this my ſickneſs was manifeſted the ſeat of a <hi>Fever,</hi> and that <hi>Helmonts</hi> aſſertion is true. For if the ſeat of a <hi>Fever</hi> is the Blood at which the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> ſhoot their arrows; how came it to paſs I was not pain'd through all parts, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Blood doth circulate through all? and that only my <hi>ſtomach</hi> as chief and my <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Back</hi> by conſent ſhould be puniſht by the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh cauſe? alſo how came it to paſs that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was out of my <hi>stomach,</hi> and that the pain from thence and from my Head and Back was remov'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Fever ceaſed, and all ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was baniſht, whilſt yet the impurity was in my Blood?

               <p>However I will not leave the matter thus, but will prove by one example more, that the occaſional thorn, and cauſe of a Fever has its ſeat, and reſidence in the <hi>Stomach:</hi> and that therefore to let the Blood out whilſt 'tis only hot by accident, is a needleſs thing, if not hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman my acquaintance falling ſick after the eating of ſomething that diſagreed with him, fell into a Fever, an eminent <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi> was ſent for, and for a fort-night labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain to abate the Fever; notwithſtanding his Bleedings and his Coolers.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Gentleman being given over as incurable, though as many are, he was afraid of a Chymiſt, yet ſent for my honeſt <hi>Tutor,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at laſt he could but die, as the <hi>Alder-man</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:154380:45"/>
his <hi>Father,</hi> and alſo his <hi>Mother,</hi> had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix weeks before of a Fever and were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together in one day; after they had each of them been bleeded once or twice at leaſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chymical</hi> Doctor hereupon viſited him, and finding him very weak, and in a Fever, with a very great pain in his <hi>ſtomach</hi> went home and ſent him two Medicines, on an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Acidity, and Acrimonious ſpurious Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the other Cordialine to revive his drooping ſpirits.</p>
               <p>He took the firſt as ordered ſeveral times, and about ſix hours after when the Doctor vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited him again he found him a ſmall matter better, but the Fever not removed, and the pain in his <hi>Stomach</hi> remaining: becauſe the Medicine taken inwards was not ſtrong enough alone to conquer the Diſeaſie <hi>Leaven</hi> in his <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> which as a <hi>thorn,</hi> or rather <hi>thornineſs,</hi> there Implanted, was the cauſe and parent of the Fever. Hereupon he took another Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that kills acidity and that was ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to the firſt, and applies it outwardly to the Pit of his <hi>Stomach:</hi> and then gave him Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as before plentifully to drink. Theſe by their inſinuating and ſubtil livelineſs ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly on both ſides, beſet the <hi>forreign ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gueſt,</hi> that next morning there remained no foot-ſteps on`t (<hi>ſee here the power of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>) ſo that the Doctor viſiting him found

him pretty well, only weakened with his fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights ſickneſs: for which cauſe <hi>cordials</hi> &amp; ſuch Medicines ſtill were ſucceſſively given him; and <hi>Sack, and good ſtrong Beer</hi> with a <hi>Toſt</hi> in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate quantities were not omitted.</p>
               <p>By following of theſe he in leſs than four daies ſpace left his bed, and walked about the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: a fame of which flying abroad, a certain pretender to huge skill in Medicine and to as great in feeling the <hi>Pulſe,</hi> (concerning whom alſo elſe-where) came boldly to give him a viſit. Whereupon ſeeing him ſo well, to the end the <hi>Chymical</hi> Doctor might not have the whole honour, feeling his <hi>Pulſe,</hi> tells him he was in a continual <hi>Fever,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> 'twould ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his Life if he were not bleeded.</p>
               <p>This exceedingly diſturb'd the young Gentle-Man, (<hi>for Death is the King of Terrors</hi>) and caus'd him forthwith to ſend for the honeſt Doctor in haſte to hear what he would ſay to it. The Gentleman having told what the <hi>Apothecary</hi> had ſaid concerning bleeding him; The <hi>Chymical</hi> Doctor askt him how he found himſelf: he replyed very well, and that the pain was remov'd from his <hi>Stomach.</hi> Upon this the Doctor heartned him up, and admoniſht him not to let in fears, for he doubted not of his doing well; adding, that if a <hi>Fever</hi> had been preſent his Body would have been out of order, and chearfully bad him farewell. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:154380:46"/>
got ſtrength apace, and yet kept his blood, and ſaw the <hi>Cunning Pulſe-feeler</hi> miſtaken: for within ſeven or eight daies after he walked abroad, and remains well now 'tis ſeveral years ſince. But by this means he is become ſuch a <hi>Chymical Convert,</hi> that he cares for none but Chymical Remedies: nor cares he for them unleſs they are <hi>ſtomachical,</hi> and agree with the Life of that part.</p>
               <p>Abundance of inſtances as remarkable as theſe I could bring, did I think it needful here: but omitting them, I ſhall deſire you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how little benefit <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> affords, whilſt the Blood is not concern'd in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For though the <hi>Blood</hi> ſeems to look of various colours when 'tis let out, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed for the ſake of the <hi>Vitals</hi> at the Diſeaſe that intrudes: yet does that not argue in the leaſt a neceſſity of letting it out, ſeeing a Fever is and may be ſafely cured without it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſay that there is putrefaction in the Blood, and that for that cauſe it ſhould be emitted won`t do neither; ſeeing if it be deviated or putrefied, good and bad together will be retain'd, aſwell as let out. Beſides, that the Blood is not putrefied plainly appears, from its return to <hi>vitality</hi> when the Fever is overcome, though not an ounce of it was tranſmitted: alſo from its loſing that diſcolouredneſs which appear'd in the Fever when the cauſe in the <hi>ſtomach</hi> is remov'd and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:154380:47"/>
the preternatural <hi>aeſtuating</hi> ceaſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as were the Blood really putrefied it could not be, ſeeing a returning from <hi>Real cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> to Life and Health is denied. Beſides if the Blood ſhould putrefie in the <hi>Veins,</hi> the <hi>Veins</hi> themſelves would putrifie as in <hi>Gangrenes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what are the Signs of the Blood being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefied?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it not from Diverſe colours appearing in the porringer, after 'tis let out? As Black, Yellow, Duskiſh, White, and ſomewhat Greeniſh colour? is it not from a ſlimy, groſs, watry thin matter? and laſtly is it not from a conſiſtence not thready or fibrous, ſcarce cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together? And if theſe be the tokens of Blood being putrified, let us hear what the Learned Chymical Phyſician <hi>Van Helmont</hi> faith concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, from whom I made bold to borrow theſe <hi>queries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to them, ſaith he, <q>I declare under the penalty of a convicted Ly, if any one<note place="margin">De feb. Cap. 2.</note> will make tryal, that I have examined the Bloods of two hundred wanton Country healthy people in one only day, and many of them were exceedingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:154380:47"/>
like in their aſpect, colour, matter, and conſiſtence.</q> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Aspectu valde diſſimilares co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore, materia, &amp; conſiſtentia.</note> of which I deſtil'd and <q>found them a like profitable in healing. For our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-People are wonted at every <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> to let out their Blood, to to the end they may drink the more largely: and though many of them ſeem'd to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefied, others Cankery or Black-Chollery; yet nevertheleſs the Country-men from whence thoſe bloods iſſued were very health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Therefore they confirm'd me, the tokens of corruption not gain ſaying it, that they had their bloods not alien'd in the leaſt, or eſtrang'd from the Nature of a Balſame. Wherefore I have laughed at the Table of judgments from the beholding of Blood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and have really concluded, that by Phyſicians the venal Blood is commanded to bekept, on this account that at leaſt-wiſe they might number one viſit to the ſick. For if corruption of the Blood hath any where a place, and if under that name it betokeneth the letting forth of it ſelf, ſurely that muſt be in the Plague. But in the Plague the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Vein is deſtructive. Therefore Putrefaction is no where in the Blood of the Veins, nor a fear leſt the putrefaction of that Blood ſhould prevail; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:154380:48"/>
the ſcope of letting out the Blood is in this reſpect erroneous.</q> Thus ſaid <hi>Helmont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is his Doctrine coatradictory to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for let others talk of the <hi>Blood</hi> being faulty in a Fever and of its being the cauſe of the <hi>aeſtuating,</hi> and corrupted, if they will call it ſo. Yet I teſtify, I have known of many hundreds cured ſafely and happily of a <hi>Fever,</hi> by remedies that were innocent <hi>Stomachical</hi> and lively, and the deſtroyers of forreign fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without the leaſt aſſiſtance of <hi>Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting.</hi> Nor were months required to cure a Fever with ſuch, whilſt commonly five dayes ſpace did it: ſometimes four, ſometimes three ſometimes two. And ſometimes if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was pretty ſtrong, and not much weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his <hi>Vitals,</hi> one dayes time would do it, without attending the leaſure of a <hi>Criſis.</hi> But if the party had been one that had long lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht under other Phyſicians, and was thereby much impair'd and debilitated: though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired many times three weeks, if not longer, to regain his loſt ſtrength, yet four or five daies time at moſt carried off the <hi>Fever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing there is which I have obſerv'd very <hi>injurious</hi> in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> that is mask'd under the vizard of Art. To wit, that a Phyſician being called whether in a Fever or otherwiſe, doth, notwithſtanding his pretences to <hi>Method,</hi> and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:154380:48"/>
withſtanding the Diſeaſe, ſee it violently get footing, whilſt he gapes for a <hi>judicial Criſis.</hi> And for all he tells them,</p>

But if in the inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

(oppoſing the Diſeaſe &amp; Medicine too), did the Cure by her proper ſtrength. This I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beheld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; wondered to ſee that the people could ſuffer themſelves to be ſo ſignally delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>For if a Perſon is ſlightly affected &amp; illiſh &amp; the Doctor, being ſent for, gives him medicines ſo ineffectual as to exaſperate the diſeaſe, or let it grow ſtronger; thereby confining his Patient to the Dungeon of a ſick bedd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet after all this if Nature by her own ſtrength does the work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reſtores the ſick again; or if by other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies aiding ſhee does it; Know this for certain the firſt Method &amp; Medicines were deſtructive, and no waies aſſiſtant to Nature. For ſhall Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies not be able to deliver one out of the hands of a ſlight Diſeaſe, and yet be able to effect it when 'tis twice worſe? I ſay no: For you may as well imagine that perſon able to carry five hundred weight on his back, who upon trial could not carry three.</hi> But indeed that their Remedies do not do it is plain, and 'tis as manifeſt that <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> is uſeleſs: for commonly when they have brought the Sick to that paſs that 'tis dubious whether they will live or dye, and only attend upon a Criſis, then they apply themſelves to <hi>Cordials,</hi> and to <hi>Kitchen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Phyſick,</hi> and their Patients are ſometimes recovered by them.</p>
               <p>Whereas if Medicines are truly <hi>Stomachical,</hi> the deſtroyers of forreign Ferments, Friendly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:154380:49"/>
to the life, Reſiſters of poyſon, and innocent, they do not uſe to permit the growth of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: But laying the Axe to the Root, cut them down (if they are acute) in the ſpace of four or five dayes: And the firſt day give the Patient ſuch a Teſtimony of their Vigour, and of their Power and abilities in healing; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of growing ſicker, they arefar more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and have thereby encouragement to take them. But if ſuch Medicines have been exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I have ſeveral times known, and the Patient hath vomited them up; and hath after taking them often ſtill done the ſame, ſo that no ſuch Medicine could be admitted to work upon the <hi>Diſeaſe:</hi> It was an apparent ſign of the <hi>Patients</hi> not recovery, and that the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous <hi>Faex</hi> reigned in his <hi>Stomach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if ſuch innocent Medicines as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of (with others as occaſion) have been taken in ſome Diſeaſes of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that therefore required the longer time for extirpating them, and their <hi>Semina,</hi> And have not in ſix dayes time, or leſs, given ſome teſtimony of their Vigour and Virtues; but have nevertheleſs ſuffered either the Diſeaſe to ſtand at a ſtay, or get ſtrength: I ſay the Remedies being thus non-pluſt, if the Diſeaſe did more narrowly beſet the life in the Stomach &amp;c. It was a real ſign of the Patients not recovery, and that the beſt <hi>ſhop</hi> Remedies would be baffled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:154380:50"/>Therefore I ſay, and ſay it again, that that Phyſician who lets a Patient for ſeveral dayes decline, whilſt he makes uſe of Remedies in a Fever, or other ſuch like Acute diſtempers; and yet at laſt the Party recover: deſerves not in the leaſt to have the honour of the Cure, whilſt <hi>Nature</hi> by her goodneſs effected it.

               <p>And let it not ſuffice to ſay this learned man, or that learned man uſeth <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> in a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and therefore we may do ſo: for if they do ſo, know 'tis through a penury of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, for where noble Remedies are, there's no need of it.

For when ſhee has rallied,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:154380:51"/>
and gained a reinforcement, and is enabled to give another onſet, the Fever renews, and is as ill as before, and if you think meet requires a cooling. <hi>But I don't mean by a loſs of more blood;</hi> for if you go that way to work, your cooling will but add weakneſs to weakneſs, and take away ſtrength from the ſhoulders of Nature. And yet after a ſecond or third opening of a Vein, and a loſs of that <hi>Crimſon Treaſure,</hi> if the <hi>Cauſe, the Cauſe, the Cauſe I ſay,</hi> in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach remain and <hi>Nature</hi> is not wholly proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Fever will again renew in ſpight of the Lancet's aſſiſtance.

                  </q>
A Thorn in the hand remaining, a heat and Fever in that part doth not ceaſe. And the occaſional matter (like a Thorn) remaining in the Stomach, heat in the whole body will not ceaſe, ſo long as the <hi>Life</hi> can make reſiſtance. But when you have let out too much of the <hi>Bload,</hi> ſo that not enough remains to make good the Combate, the Patient is fairly cool'd, and to the ſmall honour of <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> dies: whilſt the numbers of the <hi>Fatherleſs</hi> are increaſt.</p>

So that a perſon cured after this method and way might be as luſty in few dayes as before.</p>
               <p>When as thoſe that are cured after <hi>repeated Phlebotomy</hi> and ſuch like exhauſters of the ſtrength, if they at length recover through the benefit of Nature or otherwiſe: How <hi>ſlowly</hi> do they get ſtrength? how <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> (like <hi>ſmall beer</hi> its own ſelf) are they for a long time? and how ſubject on the leaſt error or cold to ſuffer a relapſe. The laſt of which<note place="margin">De Feb. Cap. 1. &amp; alibi</note> the learned <hi>Dr. Willis</hi> confeſſeth, ſaying, <hi>They who let their blood often out are the more prone to Fevers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither, as ſome ſuppoſe, is Putrefaction in the <hi>Heart</hi> or <hi>Stomach</hi> the producer of heat of it ſelf; and ſo conſequently the cauſe of heat in the whole body: For if ſo that <hi>Putrefaction</hi> which of it ſelf is ſo <hi>Hot,</hi> as to extend its heat to the <hi>Extreams</hi> and <hi>Surface</hi> of the Body (<hi>i. e.</hi>) to the hands and feet; muſt of neceſſity

ſcorch or burn thot bowel wherein it reſides. But that the real producer of that <hi>aeſtuating</hi> and <hi>Feveriſhneſs,</hi> is not an inflamed maſs of putry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyings, I ſhall prove by a <hi>Thorn</hi> thruſt into the hand; which is ſo for from being hot, that 'tis actually and potentially could: and yet through its being an Enemy to the life of the part, inrageth it, and exiteth a Fever: Which cannot better be extinguiſht than by a ſtrengthening of the injured life, and enabling it by good remedies to expel the Thorn and Thornyneſs. By doing which, the <hi>Praeternatural heat</hi> will of its own accord ceaſe, without the aid of <hi>Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> or taking away the <hi>Blood.</hi> Therefore is the Heat in a Fever a thing by accident, a latter product, not the being or occaſional cauſe; and conſequently not ſo much to be regarded, as for that cauſe, and for fear of inflaming the ſick, by adding a kind of <hi>Fire</hi> to <hi>Fire,</hi> as they phraſe it: to deny, when the Patient deſires it, <hi>a Glaſs or two</hi> of comfortable Liquor (to wit) <hi>Good Beer, Ale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Sack</hi> in moderate quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

Ferments: The Diſeaſe muſt needs with more eaſe be expelled, and caſt forth by a two-fold aſſiſtance. But to let you ſee the excellency of <hi>Lively Liquors</hi> in a Fever, I have inſerted theſe following relations.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman my acquaintance, being in a <hi>Fever,</hi> was forbidden, though he deſired it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the uſe of ſtrong-beer by the <hi>Doctor,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'twas aſmuch as his life was worth.

               <p>Alſo a man and his wife, both my <hi>Quondam</hi> acquaintance, and neighbours, being in a Fever, and prohibited by their <hi>Doctor</hi> to drink <hi>Strong-beer, Ale, or Sack;</hi> where there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon through about two months ſickneſs ſo very weak, that their recovery was deſpaired of by many. But whilſt they were thus languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Doctor not coming as he uſed to do, neceſſity required them to ſend their ſon to him: who found the <hi>Doctor</hi> indiſpoſed and feveriſh.

               <p>His Siſter falling ſick, a Phyſician was ſent for, who when he came found her <hi>Pleuritical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> affected; therefore orders fourteen oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Blood to be taken away preſently, and the next day at his coming again ſix or ſeven
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154380:58"/>
ounces more: by which means ſhe (whoſe age was but ten years) was ſo extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated and conſequently her life endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that for the ſpace of a <hi>month</hi> ſhe was not able to go, and recovered not her <hi>ſtrength</hi> as formerly in many <hi>months</hi> after. But now at length ſhe hath outgrown it.</p>
               <p>Whereas had the Phyſician given her an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Medicine or two inwardly to ſtrengthen the Stomach, kill ſpurious ferments and ſlay the ſtimulating <hi>thorn</hi> in the <hi>Pleura</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> alſo had applied another to her ſide for the ſame purpose; he might without a loſs of Blood, and exhauſting her ſtrength, have taken away the <hi>occaſional cauſe</hi> and with eaſe have ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthened <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo as to have diſpos'd of the out-hunted Blood to her greateſt advantage and profit: either by admitting it again into the <hi>Veins,</hi> which thing is very common if a good Medicine is preſent; or by diſmiſſing it by the mouth or fundament. So that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus cured without <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> may be well and vigorous in a <hi>week</hi> or little more.</p>
               <p>Or if through the far abſence of good and able <hi>Medicines</hi> he had for the preſent drawn out <hi>ſix or eight</hi> ounces of Blood, &amp; had afterwards exhibited remedies to ſlay <hi>Acidity</hi> in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Forreign gueſt in the <hi>Pleura:</hi> he might with <hi>more eaſe and leſs hurt</hi> to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, have head her without running a hazard.

Only obſerve that though this way brings <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eaſe</hi> yet ſcarce ſo much <hi>benefit</hi> to the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or: foraſmuch as a months time keeping people in hand produceth more <hi>Angels</hi> than a Week.</p>
               <p>However 'twas well the young Woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered at laſt, when her Fathers pocket had paid well for it. But had one forty or fifty years old been dealt with after this <hi>Bloody</hi> rate the loſs would not have been ſo eaſily made up; But in all likely-hood 'twould have made the party weakly, if it had not coſt her her life. Or which is oft-times the event of a great loſs of Blood, have laid the foundation of ſome bad Diſeaſe.

               <p>Nor do I write feigned Notions or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conjectures; having, whilſt I was for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years converſant, and a tabler in the Houſe with an ingenious aged <hi>Chymical Phyſician,</hi> known of a great many cured after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to wit, without <hi>Blood-letting;</hi> nor to the beſt of my remembrance did ever any one miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry under his hand.

it, that ſeveral have recovered by following his mehod without the leaſt aſſiſtance of <hi>Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy,</hi> that have been given up for <hi>Death</hi> by eminent <hi>Galeniſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that obſerving ſuch cures frequently done by him; and on the contrary often Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by others: I ſet upon the ſtudy of <hi>Phyſick</hi> out of a deſire to inform my ſelf, that I might prevent being purg'd out of my life, as my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was. And after a twelve months purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſtudies, and obſerving curative paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, I began out of an affection to the <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Science</hi> to prove a general ſtudent in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> being daily improv'd in my intellectuals by hearing my experienced Intimate Diſcourſe, &amp; his patients declare the effects of his Medicines.</p>

               <p>Another declares how her Husband was Bleeded by an <hi>Apothecaries</hi> order, and had twentyounces taken away, whereby he through weakneſs fainted and died.</p>
               <p>Another relates how a <hi>Doctor</hi> (I might call him a <hi>Horſe-Doctor</hi>) had given a Doſe of Pills

to her Neighbour, that kill'd him before the had done working.</p>
               <p>Theſe with many more ſuch-like narratives minded me of my Fathers Death, and the harm I my ſelf had ſuſtain'd by twice bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, often Purging, and Vomiting, and an Iſſue: So that for many years, I, at every <hi>Autumn,</hi> had a tedious fit of ſickneſs; and was often indiſpos'd at other times.

Only through too cloſely purſuing my ſtudies, I once made my ſelf ſomewhat <hi>Hectical,</hi> but with good wholſome Medicines, and laying my Books aſide a little, I in about a month was cured again.</p>
               <p>Yet believe that what with the hurts of the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> when I was a Youth, ſeconded with the dammage received from <hi>Purges, Bleedings, Vomits,</hi> &amp;c. I have been ſo weakened; that I ſhall ſcarce ever regain my former Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and chearful countenance, whilſt I not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (through Gods mercy) am pretty healthy.</p>
               <p>But to return. Thus having ſpent about four years in my ſtudies I began to fancy the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154380:60"/>
practice of Phyſick. But when I conſidered on the other hand, the dangerouſneſs of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with unexperienced tools, and ſuch reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as Books alone will afford me; without a faithful Tutor to open my underſtanding in the Analyſing of Bodies, the reaſons of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Agents to Patients,</hi> and the compounding and applying of Remedies. I ſay when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered this I was ſomewhat diſheartened, through an unwillingneſs <hi>to turn Experimenter,</hi> and as Phyſicians too often do <hi>Ludere cum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio Humano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe I ſaw much of the miſchief frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done by Phyſick was effected through too great confidence in Vulgar Preſcripts and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> whilſt Diſeaſes were not the ſame. But <hi>Providence</hi> favouring, and my moſt Cordial friend intirely loving me, I obtain'd (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aged) the knowledge of all <hi>his Method and Medicines,</hi> with what was the reſult of twenty I might ſay, (<hi>for he himſelf had an Aged and Learned Tutor in Chymiſtry</hi>) almoſt forty years experience in <hi>Chymiſtry:</hi> nor was I wholly ungrateful.</p>
               <p>Being therefore for ſeveral years ſince no Botcher in Medicine, I thence-forward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied my ſelf to a more narrow ſearch: and from frequent Readings, Operatings, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſe, having made ſome diſcovery of <hi>Abuſes,</hi> and <hi>Injuries</hi> in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> I thought
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:154380:60"/>
meet at length for a General good to publiſh them. That the Phyſician may be admoniſht to defend himſelf and his Patient; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient likewiſe fore-warn'd to take heed of ſuch, who being confident and careleſs mind nothing but their Eaſe and Profit; and by adminiſtring <hi>hurtful</hi> Remedies under the notion of Phyſick, through meer ignorance and careleſneſs <hi>Kill</hi> not a few: as likewiſe of ſuch who under pretence of <hi>Healing,</hi> are continually buſied about <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting the ſtrength and Vitals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To give you a rehearſal of thoſe cures in <hi>Pleuritical affects</hi> which this <hi>Chymical Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> did without <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> will be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſuch narratives requiring more time and Paper than can I now ſpare. However as a <hi>Taſte</hi> and for example ſake, I will mention one which I cured after his manner, in that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim whilſt this <hi>Tract</hi> was penning.</p>
               <p>A perſon who heard well concerning me and the <hi>ſafety</hi> of my <hi>Method,</hi> ſends for me to cure his Wife that was ill, and had through the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of her diſtemper lately ſounded, and ſainted away. I went, and by that time I came to her ſhe was pretty well reviv'd, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſhe could anſwer to my <hi>Quaeries:</hi> Only ſhe had an almoſt intollerable pain in her left ſide, and her Stomach was diſordered. I therefore judg'd 'twas a <hi>Pleuriſy;</hi> and askt her
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:154380:61"/>
what ſhe lately had been eating of, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed with her Stomach.</p>
               <p>She replied that laſt night ſhe had too freely eaten of a thing ſhe lov'd, but it did not agree with her: This confirm'd 'twas a Pleuriſy and that her <hi>Stomach</hi> not well digeſting the laſt nights Supper had ſent a <hi>Pleuritical ſharpneſs</hi> into the Blood. Wherefore as I had learnt from expert <hi>Helmont,</hi> and my no little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced <hi>Tutor, I gave her a Medicine to fortifie her Stomach, and make ſure work there by ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forreign Ferments, and hinder a further procedure that way:</hi> not doubting in the leaſt (<hi>as I had often known</hi>) to expel the <hi>Acidity</hi> in the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and put the <hi>Blood</hi> in good order again without borrowing the leaſt aid of the Lancet. To do which I appointed a Medicine that is an Enemy to <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> to be applied to the place where the pain was; having long ſince learnt, <hi>ubi Dolor, ibi Morbus,</hi> that where the pain is there is the Diſeaſe; and ſo I took my leave of them.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſo operated and beſet the <hi>Spurious fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> on both ſides that they proved a little too hot for it, and baniſht it: ſo that when about ſix hours after I viſited her again, my Patient (being perſwaded to it by a Female acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of hers) was gone into the City. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly admired at her raſhneſs, nor leſs at the ſuddenneſs of the Cure: ſo that deſiring
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154380:61"/>
they would take care at her coming home, if ſhe <hi>relapſt,</hi> to give her liberally of the <hi>firſt Medicine</hi> without fear, I took my leave for that night: and coming the next morning I found her very well; but ſhe told me ſhe was at coming home illiſh, that the pain return'd after her walk, and that the firſt Medicine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd it again:</p>
               <p>Thus to Cure a <hi>Pleuriſy</hi> in a Day is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unwonted, but I had an advantage in taking it in its <hi>Bud:</hi> Nor will I undertake to do the like again in ſo <hi>ſhort</hi> a time. However in <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> daies, I have known a <hi>Pleuriſy</hi> commonly cured, by the ſole aid of ſuch-like Remedies, without bleeding: and will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture one more than an equal lay, by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to do it at any time, if I have the Patient in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Next it will not be amiſs to diſcourſe of the Stomachs <hi>Priority,</hi> and the excellency of Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machical Remedies. Only take notice that I by ſuch don't mean <hi>Syrups</hi> or ſuch like <hi>Sugary</hi> Medicines; which how pleaſing ſoever they are to the healthy, are clogging and hurtful to a weak Stomach. But I by Stomachical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies mean ſuch, that though not very ſweet, are pleaſing and friendly to Nature, and no waies diſguſtful to the Stomach.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:154380:64"/>
to wit, the <hi>Brain, Spleen, Oeſophagus, mouth, Liver Lungs, Heart, Mid-riff;</hi> and in a word there is ſcarce any eminent part of the Body which converſeth not with it through the mediation of <hi>Veins, Arteries, Nerves, and Membranes.</hi> Whereby it (like a careful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron) is made ſenſible of any injury thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding parts ſuſtein, and not ſeldome ſhews it by Vomiting.</p>
               <p>Nor is it only ſenſible of what injury other parts undergo, but it likewiſe makes them feel, and grow ſenſible of its own.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:154380:64"/>
to prove the ſeat of the <hi>Soul</hi> not in the Stomach but in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But doth not the Pſalmiſt</hi> David <hi>ſay, Create within me, O Lord, a New-heart &amp;c. And thou haſt made my heart to rejoyce &amp;c? by the word Heart the Pſalmiſt meaning? his Soul, puting the containing for the contained?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, that though <hi>Holy David</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a <hi>true Divine;</hi> and did ſufficiently experience the <hi>Almighty's</hi> merciful benignity, and frequently enjoy <hi>the overflowings of the Spirit</hi> in his <hi>Soul;</hi> yet might he nevertheleſs be ſo wholly unskilful in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> as not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh whether that <hi>Refreſhment</hi> he felt was in his Stomach or Heart: ſeeing that <hi>Galen</hi> who was after him above a thouſand years is upbraided by ſeveral with a diſſercion of <hi>Apes</hi> through a penury of humane Bodies. But granting on the other hand that <hi>Holy David and all the Prophets</hi> were well skill'd in <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> as they might, the contrary not being proveable: yet doubtleſs was it a great error in the <hi>Firſt Ages</hi> of the World, to impoſe the Word HEART which is a Word of a very large ſignification on that one ſmall part of the Body commonly called ſo; when it ſometimes ſignifies the <hi>affections</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Mind,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>whole Soul</hi> it ſelf; which doubtleſs is not confin'd to any one part of the Body but inhabits in the <hi>Heart, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:154380:65"/>
Head, Liver, Blood</hi> &amp;c. Though I am perſwaded chiefly about the <hi>upper</hi> Orifice of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>And therefore if by reaſon of its being an accuſtom'd Phraſe amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet David</hi> utters thoſe ſayings; and our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Saviour</hi> in ſpeaking to the People uſeth the Word <hi>Heart</hi> frequently for the <hi>Soul,</hi> yet 'tis to be underſtood that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſpeak to the People in their own phraſes, to the end they might underſtaud him; which otherwiſe they could not: and that the end of ſpeech is to impreſs our meaning to the hearers. Likewiſe we ought to conſider that had either the <hi>Liver, Spleen,</hi> or <hi>Lungs</hi> through an accuſtom'd Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, been uſed Rhetorically to ſignifie the <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Soul; Chriſt</hi> in ſpeaking, and the <hi>Prophet</hi> in writing, muſt have uſed their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of phraſing, and delivered themſelves in words ſuiting the capacities of the People, if they would have been underſtood by them: and therefore cannot this deny the <hi>Souls</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence primely in the <hi>Stomach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if we grant the <hi>Life</hi> of the Body to be the <hi>Soul,</hi> as 'tis; and that where the <hi>Soul</hi> chiefly reſides muſt needs be the <hi>moſt ſenſible and neceſſary</hi> Bowel, We ſhall eaſily prove it to be in the <hi>Stomach:</hi> from its ſo great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarineſs that no <hi>Animal</hi> lives without it, and from its ſo great ſenſibility that it will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

the preſſure of a hand on its upper <hi>Orifice</hi> without grief; nor a wound without ſudden death.

               <p>But to reaſſume our Diſcourſe concerning the Stomach:</p>
               <p>We find that 'tis ſo uſeful and neceſſary a Bowel that no Animal lives without it, or can live in its abſence: and that Nature has been ſo ſolicitous and careful in the formation of it, and has taken ſuch care to preſerve it; that thoſe Animals that want teeth to grinde their food with, have two Stomachs. As for inſtance <hi>Birds &amp;c.</hi> who have beſides their real Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach which lieth more inward another kind of <hi>Stomach</hi> called <hi>Ingluvies the Crop,</hi> which receives the meat, that it being lightly digeſted may be fitter for the Stomach ſucceeding; or as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be caſt forth for the young ones. This firſt Stomach, (or the Crop) one of our moderns tels us may be wounded and ſown up again, which our loſs of the Life: but not the ſecond or true Stomach, which is moſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Alſo <hi>Beaſts</hi> that chew the <hi>Cud</hi> have that prerogative to enjoy more Stomachs than one. And chewing the <hi>Cud</hi> being a melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, and making the food more fit for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:154380:67"/>
does tacitly hint to us that <hi>Chewing of Food well</hi> (as really 'tis) is very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to Health: ſeeing we read alſo that thoſe <hi>Beaſts</hi> that chewed the <hi>Cud</hi> were in the <hi>Old Law</hi> counted <hi>Clean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though I believe it was never found on record that any man after his Stomach was pierced or pluckt out ſpake one only word: yet the <hi>Lord Verulam</hi> ſpeaks of a man that utter'd three or four words of a prayer when his heart was out and in the Executioners hand, which argues <hi>that after his Heart was out his Soul was in his Body,</hi> elſe he could not have ſpoken. To omit what <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies of <hi>Beaſts</hi> that lowed at the <hi>Alter</hi> after their hearts were taken out, and what <hi>Pliny</hi> (which another to wit <hi>Iulius Obſequens</hi> confirms) ſaies of thoſe Beaſts which when <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſacrificed were found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hearts: but doubtleſs not without Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs.

And laſtly <hi>Paraeus</hi> his relation of one wounded in his heart that ran two hundred paces: with ſeveral others too tedious to quote, though I never yet could Read or Hear of any that wanted a Stomach, or that having been wounded therein have not preſently died.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Helmont</hi> tells of a certain <hi>ſtrong and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Table with his fiſt, about the Orifice of his Stomach; who preſently ſunk down with a foaming mouth, &amp; being lifted up by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, was forth-with depriv'd of Pulſe, and before Grace was ſaid his body was as Cold as <hi>Ice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another relation he has of a <hi>Carter,</hi> who being with a Dagger thruſt thorow about the <hi>Mouth</hi> of his Stomach preſently died with a foaming Mouth, and was alſo depriv'd of all <hi>Pulſe,</hi> and <hi>Heat:</hi> which proves that the prime ſeat of the Soul was there by ſo quick a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Pulſe</hi> with the <hi>Life.</hi> When as thoſe that die from ſome other defect, or a wound elſe-where, are ſcarce cold in many hours; which the ſame <hi>Author</hi> proves by not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtances. One of which is concerning a Woman, on whoſe Head an Image fell down from a high place, ſo as that the top of the Skull depreſſed her brain, for almoſt two fingers breadth: and though ſhe was rcekon'd to be <hi>Dead, yet had a ſlender pulſe in both Arms</hi> ſix hours after.</p>
               <p>Some there are who would have the Soul e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſperſed through-out the whole Body, and that all parts enjoy it alike: not granting it to be in one Part more than in another. But ſuch in the mean time forget a thing daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, to wit, that a Man loſeth his legs or Arms, and yet the Soul remains intire and has
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:154380:68"/>
all its faculties. Nevertheleſs I will not deny, but that it may reſide in more parts than one, being unwilling to teſtifie what the <hi>Scripture,</hi> in this thing, and my own experience will not warrant: however I am ſufficiently confirm'd that the <hi>chief ſeat</hi> thereof is in the Stomach, for reaſons before mentioned; though likewiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it in ſome ſort inhabits in the <hi>Head, Spleen, Heart, Blood, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others would endeavour to prove the Prime or chief ſeat of the <hi>Soul</hi> to be the Brain: but in the firſt place experience denies it, from trouble and grief ſuddenly poſſeſſing the Stomach, and bringing a loſs of <hi>Appetite</hi> with it; which doth not in the leaſt affect the <hi>Brain,</hi> unleſs the Life grows outragious, and then it affects it, by mediation of <hi>Arteries</hi> and <hi>Nerves.</hi> Secondly, the appearance of <hi>Chriſts Spirit</hi> withſtands it, in regard ſolace is felt in the Stomach not in the <hi>Brain.</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it, which declares, out of the <hi>Belly</hi> not out of the <hi>Brain</hi> or <hi>Head</hi> of Believers in Chriſt, ſhall flow <hi>Rivers of Living Water.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>A young Gentle-Woman my acquaintance falling into a violent <hi>Vomiting of Blood,</hi> at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times brought up about <hi>two quarts.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one, and afterwards a ſecond <hi>Phyſician</hi> was ſent for, who forthwith ordered a Vein to be <hi>Breath'd:</hi> but in the interim prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, and order'd various cooling things; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the <hi>Sharpiſh-cauſe</hi> which entred the Blood, through a more than accuſtom'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with <hi>White-Wines,</hi> and had there being corroſive, and Turgent, fretted a Vein and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vent to it ſelf.

And although <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated and Spiritleſs Medicines oftner given, all was in vain: For whilſt the Acidity in the Blood was in being, ſhe frequently, even almoſt every day, vomited up Blood; yea ſometimes twice or thrice a day, and that not by ounces but by greater Quantities. Inſomuch that in leſs than fourteen daies, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the united endeavours of the two <hi>Galenical Doctors,</hi> ſhe was almoſt Dead through daily languiſhing, and the loſs of about two Gallons of Blood; was grown ſo weak as unable to lift up a ſpoon to her mouth; or which is worſe

               <p>She being in this condition, A <hi>Chymical Phyſician</hi> my acquaintance was ſent for, who when he came and ſaw in what a weak ſtate ſhe was, told the <hi>By-ſtanders</hi> he doubted of her recovery: and that her other Phyſicians had done ill, to let out ſo much of her <hi>Blood,</hi> and neglect the <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

that muſt be the way to quiet it, and judging the loſs of two or three ounces of Blood in a week not material, ſeeing ſhe got ſtrength. Thus with his Remedies he gradually ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>ſharpiſh ferment,</hi> and in about ten daies time made her chearful and much ſtronger; though then through ſo great a loſs of her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Whilſt ſhe thus gain'd ſtrength daily, and through <hi>Cold-weather</hi> was confin'd to her Chamber, one of her former Phyſicians came to viſit her again.

weak condition ſent for the <hi>Chymical Doctor,</hi> and was very well pleas'd with his <hi>rational Theory,</hi> the deſcription of her Diſeaſe, its cauſe and manner of cure. But words would not heal her; therefore he ſent two Medicines, <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machical</hi> and <hi>Abſterſive,</hi> which ſhe took: and for the firſt two or three daies very much men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But the Digeſtions whilſt weak having heapt up abundance of Flegm, <hi>Nature</hi> after ſhe was reinforc't attempted the expulſion of it, to eaſe her ſelf of that load: and not being ſtrong enough fell under the burthen to the well-nigh choaking the Patient. Hereupon the Doctor was ſent for in haſt, who gave her lively Medicines plentifully, which brought abundance of <hi>tough viſcous Flegm,</hi> and in a ſhort time he left her much better. After this ſhe took the ſame Remedies, and was by that means ſo vigorous and ſtout, that <hi>Nature</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to have the other <hi>bruſh</hi> with her Enemy, and clear her ſelf of the <hi>clogging Flegm:</hi> In which combate the Sick party being in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuffocation, the Doctor was ſent for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and plying her as before he brought it all up, to the no little haſtning the cure. Which being done, he did his endeavour to cleanſe and ſtrengthen the Ferments and Functions of the Body, with Medicines which were lively and innocent; and in nine or ten dayes ſpace

fully recovered her, to the credit of <hi>Chymical Phyſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo an ingenious Gentleman my good friend having for many months laboured under a <hi>Galloping Conſumption</hi> and made uſe of diverse Phyſicians in vain; at length recollecting his memory remembred how I had formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this <hi>Chymical Doctor.</hi> And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (<hi>though afraid of thoſe dreadful things cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chymical Remedies,</hi> becauſe he had heard how ſome had done miſchief with Remedies ſo call'd) was induc'd, health being a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, to ſee what the <hi>Doctor</hi> could do. A deſire of <hi>health</hi> doubtleſs it was inclin'd him to it, for he was in no wiſe a friend to <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry;</hi> and would never have craved the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of its Medicines, could thoſe of the <hi>Shops</hi> have cured him. But neceſſity had no Law: he had alſo heard from others a good Character of the Doctors Medicines, and his Method commended for its innocency.</p>
               <p>At leaſtwiſe the worſt that could come was but <hi>Death</hi> he thought, towards which he was haſtning apace: whilſt the moſt Authentick Bills, and coſtly Preſcripts, were expos'd to a mock by the Diſeaſe. For his fleſh was ſo waſted that he was little elſe but Skin &amp; Bones: his Stomach was ſo weak, and made worſe by <hi>Spiritleſs droſſy Doſes,</hi> that he almoſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:154380:73"/>
ſpitted, and daily grew worſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd. Whilſt he was in this languiſhing ſtate, he conſulted this <hi>Chymical Doctor:</hi> who to cure him gave him innocent Remedies, yet <hi>lively, Stomachical, cleanſing,</hi> and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About a year after the ſame Gentleman through drinking <hi>wines</hi> and eating a thing he could not digeſt, ſurfeited and contracted a <hi>Quinzy.</hi> After ſome daies the Doctor viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and finding him ſcarce able to ſpeak and in a Fever withal, gave him Medicines to fortifie his Stomach, and break the neck of the Fever: and applied likewiſe two other Medicines to his throat outwardly that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to <hi>Acid Thornineſſes.</hi> Theſe ſo abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fury of the <hi>Quinzy</hi> and vanquiſht the Fever and its cauſe; that in the morning when a friend of his came to make his Will, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him not for this World, he was well, and ſaid he could ſwallow a leaden-bullet, to the great aſtoniſhment of the Perſon.</p>
               <p>For a certain pretender to <hi>vaſt skill</hi> in <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> and to no leſs in <hi>feeling the Pulſe,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been at the Sick Gentlemans houſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, had caus'd that party to come down to make his will: for he was pleas'd to tell the <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of the Family, that if her Husband
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154380:74"/>
was not Bleeded in both Arms (<hi>for take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice he had felt his Pulſe</hi>) he would be a <hi>Dead-Man</hi> before ten of the clock next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The tender Gentlewoman having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt him, comes up big with trouble for fear of loſing her Loving <hi>Huſband;</hi> and being aſkt what ſhe aild? relates the <hi>Cunning Pulſe-feelers</hi> opinion, and that in the preſence of the <hi>Doctor.</hi> Who knowing what his Medicines had often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done, and could do, ſmil'd and animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Patient; and to prove that <hi>Whining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> a notorious lier, and no leſs an <hi>ignoramus</hi> did ſit up all night with his Patient; and by applying Medicines oft both outwardly, and inwardly, made him ſound (<hi>God bleſſing his endeavoars</hi>) by eight a clock next morning, without opening a Vein in the leaſt, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt inclination to relapſe.</p>
               <p>Another Man aged fifty years and upwards being ſick, was almoſt ſuffocated with Flegm: and whilſt he had for ſeveral daies taken vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſcrib'd Remedies grew worſe and worſe notwithſtanding, and was yielded up as incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: So that his <hi>Galenical Phyſician</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and my Friend a young <hi>Chymical Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> ſent for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He came, and finding the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſtubborn, gave him a Medicine in a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold quantity almoſt; but 'twas ſuch a one as could no wiſe hurt nor inflame him, if he had given him four times more; by which ye may
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:154380:74"/>
judge 'twas neither Purge, nor Vomit. This ſomewhat reliev'd the Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and began to work upon the Diſeaſe to ſome purpoſe; which done the Doctor departed elſe-where. And in his abſence in came an <hi>Illiterate Man</hi> a pretender to Phyſick, and counted a knowing <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> yea with the Vulgar he goes under the name of a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> in that he undertakes to predict <hi>Life and Death</hi> to the people from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology, and takes Toll for the Diſcovery of <hi>Loſt Petty-coats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This unlearned mans opinion was askt: and thereupon after he had obſerv'd the <hi>Planets</hi> well, profoundly like a <hi>Fool,</hi> (and no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician) in the ſick mans preſence condemns him <hi>to die without Mercy.</hi> Thus ♃ ♀ ☉ <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> ☿ Ω. with all their <hi>ſmiling Trines, pleaſant Sextiles, and kind Conjunctions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>But when the <hi>Chymical Doctor</hi> came, who was not ignorant of Aſtrologie, they telling him what the <hi>Conjurer</hi> had ſaid, and he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Conceit</hi> of Death might do as much harm as the Diſeaſe, bad his Patient not fear, for the <hi>Conjurer</hi> was an <hi>Aſs.</hi> And proved him little better before he had done: for with wholſome and lively Remedies in the ſpace of a

week he fully reſtor'd him, and he was well not long ſince when I ſaw him.</p>
               <p>Theſe inſtances with the Arguments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding them, will I hope be ſufficient to let Phyſicians ſee that the <hi>Stomach</hi> is no contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible bowel, and that Medicines innocent, and adapted to it, muſt needs be good healers.

               <p>
                  <hi>There was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a witty Doctor, who being asked by an acquaintance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of mine of the ſame profeſſion, why he would not give ſuch a Patient more generous remedies, ſeeing he grew ſo much worſe under the uſe of common languid ones, to which he had been confin'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that at laſt he muſt needs die with them in his Mouth;</hi> he briskly anſwered, <hi>Let him die if he will ſo he die</hi> ſecundum Artem.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:154380:75"/>But may <hi>Secundum Artem</hi> ſerve in the preſence of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> when their own Conſciences ſhall fly in their faces, and tell them, that they knew better Remedies were to be had, only their <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Careleſneſs</hi> hindred them from them? May that excuſe when thoſe who through their deceit, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Cure have been miſerably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Butchered, ſhall appear as accuſers? 'Tis to be doubted hardly. Therefore ye Phyſicians act wiſely, for the good of your own Souls, and the health of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and conſider if the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> who took not compaſſion freely on the ſtranger that fell amongſt <hi>Thieves,</hi> were fore it count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unneighbourly and by conſequence worthy of Blame: How much more worthy of it will ſuch of you appear, who having the life of the diſtreſſed Sick committed to your charge, and a promiſed reward at your Elbows, are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſo much unneighbourly, and inhumane, as to take the reward without regard had to his welfare.</p>

which Method is moſt <hi>Eaſy,</hi> which <hi>leaſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> and which <hi>moſt in Vogue.</hi> This was not the way that thoſe, who deſired <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>Peace of Conſcience</hi> before all fading enjoyments and <hi>Mundane Treaſures,</hi> walked in. Nor was it the Path of <hi>Helmont,</hi> who confeſſeth that out of Charity he forſook the <hi>Common Roads of Medicine,</hi> as ſuppoſing it to be a cruel thing to heap up Moneys by the miſeries of others.</p>
               <p>It may be objected (as I heard it was by a Dunce of a Phyſician) againſt him that he was a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> 'Tis true: he confeſſeth it in his works. which (if you will make it a fault) is to be born with, conſidering 'twas the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of his Country.

               <p>For the Scripture tells us <hi>They ſhall come from the Eaſt, from the Weſt, from the North, and from the South, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven. Alſo I perceive (ſaith the Apoſtle) that God is no respecter of Perſons, but in every Nation he that Feareth God and worketh Righteouſneſs is accepted with him.</hi> And 'tis to be doubted that the greateſt part of the World, whilſt they contend one for this, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for that, and a third part for a third Form &amp; opinion; in the end through their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> placed in their <hi>hearts,</hi> &amp; through their neglect of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> whilſt they pay <hi>Tithe-Mint and Rue,</hi> and perform the leſs weighty matters of the Law, (<hi>Strain at Gnats and ſwallow Camels</hi>) will be caſt headlong to infernal puniſhment.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And truly methinks he wrote like a Chriſtian, and one that was a Phyſician indeed. Nor did he only write, but did ſo, in Curing the Poor freely, and in conſcientiouſly exerciſing the office of a Phyſician towards the Rich, as alſo in detecting the Errors of <hi>Galen,</hi> and ſuch his Drowſy followers who aim more at curing their Patients pockets of a <hi>Plethora</hi> than their bodies of a <hi>Conſumption.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:154380:82"/>Indeed I the more willingly collected theſe things concerning his Education, and progreſs in Phyſick, that <hi>Galenick Phyſicians</hi> may ſee, or, if they will be wilfully blind, that other intelligent perſons may ſee, againſt whom they have been Bawling ſo and Rayling; becauſe he ſtruck at their Maſter <hi>Galen's</hi> frigid No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſour Humors, that have no exiſtence unleſs in the Brains of the vulgar.

               <p>As to diminiſhing it I have nothing to ſay, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to making Gain the chief aim that <hi>Helmont</hi> wrote againſt; as alſo againſt their neglect of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and did well in ſo doing: For Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick doubtleſs had its riſe in Charity, though ſince (as all things are) 'tis corrupted. He tells you in the words of the <hi>Wiſe-man,</hi> That a Phyſician ſhall receive a Gift of a <hi>King,</hi> not of a <hi>Poor-man:</hi> thereby implying that we are not to neglect the Poor though they are not able to bring <hi>Angels</hi> nor <hi>Crowns</hi> in their hands for ſcribling a few words to an Apothecary; nay though they are not able ſometimes to bring half ſo much in their hands to pay for a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine:

For the Almighty who is the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Poor,</hi> has ſometimes a <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his <hi>Sores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it unfit in the mean that thoſe whol can ſhould pay, and reward a Phyſician wel for his Labour and Studies, as a Phyſician ought to be: which <hi>Helmont</hi> in the words of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſignifies.

But then be ſure let Equity and a good Conſcience be made uſe of, and when they are under your hands do not, as 'tis to be doubted too many do, play ſuch unhandſome Parts with them, as to protract cures out of love to <hi>Angels;</hi> Golden ones I mean: Nor out of Deceit, whilſt your own Conſciences tell you the only preventive Phyſick is ſober, modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and orderly living, without R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither deal unreaſonably, as too many frequently have done in cure of Sick perſons of mean Eſtate, running them to ſuch needleſs and great expences as to make them <hi>Beggars</hi> for ever after; or at leaſt thereby ſo to impoveriſh them that ſeveral years ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Truth of it is too too apparent, and yet many times, at leaſt when the Diſeaſe is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, they go uncured through deficiency in Medicine. Nor do ſome Phyſicians mind that; for ſo long as there is Money, the <hi>Sick</hi> ſhall have their Company, with <hi>Your Humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Madam</hi> to boot, And although their own Conſciences tell them, that their <hi>Lifeleſs</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines will not Profit; yet they will tell you, <hi>Their life for yours you will recover,</hi> wiſh they had a leaſe of your life or ſomething to that effect: and ſpeak twice more confidently than one that has better remedies, and makes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of what he does and ſays. Thus a rich Phyſician, but as ignorant as his Neighbours, was wonted to ſerve his Patients, (as ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concern'd and that too well knew it, told me;) and as long as they gave him his <hi>Fee,</hi> to tell them that the Sick Party was like to Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And for all he apparently ſaw they were worſe daily, and that his Remedies were at beſt but <hi>Inſignificancies,</hi> alſo that there was no hopes of recovery by his <hi>Cooling Method:</hi> Yet would he not tell them ſo, leſt I believe another Phyſician ſhould be ſent for, to effect the Cure to his diſhonour. And which was remarkable, many times when the Phyſician
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:154380:83"/>
has thus promiſ'd life the Party has died in an hour or two after, and was ſometimes ſtrugling with Death when the <hi>Doctor</hi> praedicted <hi>Life.</hi> One Gentleman told me himſelf, that this <hi>Doctor</hi> viſiting his Wife every day would give him comforting words, though he and the Nurſe apparently plainly ſaw that ſhe declin'd, and the Doctor might too doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have ſeen it had he not been made blind by <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On the other hand, when the ſame Phyſician has been called to others that have not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On a time a Poor <hi>Waſher-woman</hi> (as 'twas told to my Intimate by her ſelf) being very ill, and having as I remember but three Half-Crowns in the World, was over-perſwaded to imploy this <hi>Doctor,</hi> ſhe did; but did ill in it: for ſhe ſhould have ſent to ſome Phyſician who prepared his own Medicines, and then her advice would have coſt her nothing. Or ſhe might have gone or ſent to ſome <hi>Apothecary</hi> that was judicious and ſober, and he would have done her doubtleſs leſs harm than that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> did. For if ſhe was not right-down ſick the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:154380:84"/>
loſs of her Money (<hi>poor-creature</hi>) for <hi>Fees</hi> was enough to have made her ſo.</p>
               <p>But to the matter. The Doctor viſited her once, and had one half-crown, which was more than ſhe could clear by a weeks waſhing; The ſecond day he came again without ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for, <hi>for the Doctors cuſtom was, being once ſent for, to follow his Game cloſe,</hi> and then he had the ſecond half Crown; And the third day when he call'd in without ſending for, the poor-womans laſt half Crown being hard to be parted with ſhe did not give him it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being angry he askt her at his departure, whether ſhe thought he could run up &amp; down for nothing? ſhe might have told him ſhe did not ſend for him; And truly in my Opinion, if Phyſicians are ſo unwiſe as to run up and down to Mean-peoples houſes without ſending for, the People ſhould be ſo wiſe as to thank them for it, but give them no Money for coming. Now whether or no the woman was <hi>ſentenced to dye</hi> by the <hi>Doctor</hi> I cannot tell, but I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I heard ſhe recover'd by better Medicines. But what an unchriſtian trick was this to rob the <hi>Spittle-houſe!</hi> and how contrary to what the good Samaritane did! Surely if ſuch Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians ſhould have no more mercy ſhewn them from <hi>the Father of Lights</hi> than they ſhew to their <hi>fellow-creatures,</hi> they would ſoon deſcend the Infernal Lake.</p>

laſt itterminated in a <hi>Paralytick Gout,</hi> or the <hi>Gout &amp; Palſy</hi> together becauſe the diſeaſe lying much in the <hi>Genus Nervoſum</hi> contemned their fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuccours, or was rather ſtrengthened by them. But before it came to this paſs, and (though he was weak) had as yet the uſe of his Legs and Arms, he was viſited by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Eſquire that intreated him to make uſe of his Chymical Doctor: adding that he cured him ſafely, and ſoundly, when the ableſt <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts</hi> thereabouts could do no good, and had ſince cured his Wife of a <hi>Paralytick Lethargy,</hi> when two or three Phyſicians had after three daies endeavour left her inſenſible, and ſleeping as they found her.

               <p>'Tis pitty that <hi>Phyſick,</hi> an Art ſo uſeful,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:154380:87"/>
ſhould be thus corrupted; and that Self ſhould thruſt Charity out of doors. I believe if any <hi>Shop-keeper</hi> with whom a Phyſician deals ſhould defraud him of a <hi>Pound</hi> or two, and act diſhoneſtly, he would take it ill, and call him <hi>Knave</hi> not cauſleſly: But how much greater are ſuch, who with lying deceits, not only many times get peoples money for nothing, or at beſt for a parcel of they know not what themſelves: but alſo under pretence of curing, <hi>Kill</hi> them with <hi>Poyſons</hi> Secundum Artem, when their lives can never be regain'd: And rather than another ſhall come to cure when they can't, anoint them with the <hi>Oyle of Fool,</hi> and feed them with <hi>fancies</hi> till they are dead, knowing then they are paſt telling tales.</p>
               <p>☞ Therefore I ſay <hi>(Pray Reader take notice on't,)</hi> that that Phyſician who takes a Patient in hand, though it be in a Chronick diſeaſe, and does not in leſs than fourteen dayes time ſhew an apparent ſign of Recovery: and by the fifth or ſixth day does not give ſome refreſhment to the Patient, and put a ſtop to the procedure of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, I ſay, if he does not do this, Let him pretend what he will, his Method and Remediesare feeble, and will in no wiſe profit.</p>
               <p>For if the life do not meerly fail, which failing no Medicine can cure, Nature will in a few daies in ſome ſort revive, in the preſence, and through the aid of lively innocent remedies,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:154380:87"/>
and ſuch as ſuit with the life. But if Medicines ſhall let a Patient languiſh and grow worſe for a week or two, and yet the Patient after that recover by other Medicines: Know aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly thoſe firſt Medicines were unfit, or ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and dead, if not fitter to kill a Well-man, than cure a Sick one.</p>
               <p>And if a Phyſician being called in an Acute diſtemper, to wit a <hi>Fever</hi> or a <hi>Pleuriſy:</hi> and can't give eaſe, and great comfort, in leſs than four and twenty hours, and put a ſtop to the advance of the Diſeaſe: Alſo can't in the ſpace of ſeven dayes, cure either of them without ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Vein; provided Medicines be well followed, and the candle of life does not fail: Tell him that I who have known hundreds upon hundreds cured ſo, affirm his Medicines are not the beſt in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to perform my promiſe madeafew Pages back, having brought you <hi>Helmont</hi> that noble Phyſician for an example of Charity, and Chriſtianity; I will give you one preſident more, that you may have two to imitate, and may be excited to well-doing by Example.</p>
               <p>This perſon was my <note n="*" place="margin">I have for the preſent conceal'd his name, leſt it ſhould be thought I wrote this to promote his Sons Intereſt who not unfortunateſy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</note> Tutor, who now being
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:154380:88"/>
deceaſed, I may lawfully commend, and tell you he was a practical Divine: And one that though he did not uſe to whine as ſome do, and take the Lord's name vainly in his mouthto make an outſide religious ſhow, (for he aswell as my ſelf abominated Hypocrites) yet carried the fear and love of God alwayes in his heart. And of all the Phyſicians I ever yet met with, I never found one whoſe humour was more like to <hi>Van Helmonts</hi> than his. For in the firſt place above twenty years ſince when he had a good Galenick Practice, finding as he told me <hi>that 'twas a long way to Cure diſeaſes, but a ſhort and eaſy way to get Money,</hi> he gave to a learned chymical phyſician, to wit, one <hi>Sommerskil, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinae Doctor,</hi> that had formerly been Secretary to <hi>Prince Henry</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>King James,</hi> and was a man very Aged and judicious in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and a Practiſer many years. I ſay, to him he gave above a hundred pounds to teach him his Skill in <hi>Chymiſtry.</hi> Which he did, becauſe he lov'd him well, and ſhortly after died; through grief ſome ſay becauſe he could not obtain the <hi>Lapis</hi> to get which he vainly attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But that not concerning our Phyſical affairs, I ſhall pretermit.</p>
               <p>And tell you that he by this means having many years experience, ſtudiouſly went to work himſelf, till at laſt he obtain'd remedies after ſome years endeavour of a Large extent in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:154380:88"/>
Point of Curation. Then he left off <hi>preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing;</hi> and being at that time the only Phyſician there that cleav'd to the <hi>Chymical Method,</hi> had all the <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Apothecaries</hi> againſt him; ſo that he was forced to make good his Ground by <hi>Real Art,</hi> and oppoſe their Reproaches with Cures. Which he manfully did till he died, and left in his place his eldeſt Son of the ſame Name, a Perſon Ingenious and Learned.</p>
               <p>Nor did this honeſt Phyſician appear like to <hi>Helmont,</hi> only in leaving the <hi>Galenick</hi> for the <hi>Chymick-Method;</hi> but alſo in Charity. And had he had but <hi>Helmont</hi>'s <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> and his <hi>hundreds</hi> a <hi>year,</hi> he would, I am perſwaded, have given his Medicines away <hi>Helmont<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> like. For though he liv'd by his Practice, as other Phyſicians did and do, yet was he ſo charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Poor, and tender of the Health of the Diſtreſſed, that I verily believe he cured more People yearly for nothing, than ſome Phyſicians in that City did for a hundred pounds. For 'twas but going and telling him they were <hi>Sick</hi> and <hi>Poor,</hi> and it was the way not only to have Advice, but Medicines too for nothing. Nay, which is more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, he would not only Relieve ſome that were Poor with Medicines and his Advice free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with Money in private likewiſe, as I by diligent obſervance and watching him found; <hi>for he did not uſe to blow a Trumpet when he did
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:154380:89"/>
it;</hi> nor would he ſpeak on't, unleſs I took an occaſion to diſcourſe with him about it: And then he would like a good Man (as he was, if a Man may be called good) reply, The <hi>Rich</hi> have many Friends, but the <hi>Poor</hi> have few: And would add, That perhaps whilſt the <hi>poor Perſon</hi> languiſh'd, and could not work for his Family, his Wife and Children almoſt ſtarv'd at home: And therefore to let the ſick Man languiſh becauſe he had no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, would be a thing very hard-hearted. He would alſo uſe to make their Caſe his, and ſay, He would be glad of <hi>relief</hi> if he were <hi>ſick,</hi> though he had no Money to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Sometimes others who were pretty well to Paſs, having ſpent four or five Pounds on other Doctors in vain; when their Money was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all gone, would come to him; and if when they came they could but plead, 'twas low with them, and they wanted Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he would commonly Cure them for a Crown or an Angel charge; to wit, by giving ſome of his Medicines away, whilſt he ſold other-ſome. And when Perſons who lived well by their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Labour, but not very Rich have come to him at any time about a <hi>Feaver,</hi> or any other ſuch like <hi>Acute</hi> Diſtemper, his Advice they had for no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hing, and commonly a Cure for a Crown or leſs, and that <hi>quickly</hi> and <hi>ſafely</hi> too.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Rich</hi> rewarded him as they ought, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:154380:89"/>
all the Reaſon in the World for it: For if they do not, who ſhall reward him that is a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, for all his Pains, Studies, and Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? But he would not, I am confident, have given to either <hi>them</hi> or the <hi>Poor,</hi> a Malignant Remedy, or ſuch a one he durſt not take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he might have been hired to do it. Which was, in my Opinion, an excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a thing that gave great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to many of his Patients, to cleave to him whenever there was a neceſſity for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. And ſome of his Patients when they have come, and have deſired of him ſome Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Doſe, perhaps a <hi>Vomit,</hi> &amp;c. have had a poſitive denyal, and that was all; for he would rather at any time venture the loſs of his <hi>Patients</hi> love, than hazard their <hi>Lives</hi> and his <hi>Credit.</hi> But if they (being ſelf-will'd) have got what they deſired elſewhere, and have ſoundly paid the puniſhment of their Folly; then would they come to him many times to make up the Breach, and take leaſure to repent of their Indiſcretion.</p>
               <p>It was alſo his cuſtom (though he oftentimes hurt himſelf by it) after inventing or making a New Remedy, if none of his Family would venture on't, to take it firſt himſelf before any of his Patients ſhould touch it. For, ſaith the honeſt Man, I that have Medicines by me, better know how to cure my ſelf, if Malignity
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:154380:90"/>
be in it, than another that hath no Medicine to help himſelf. Beſides, he conſidered if he ſhould try a New-made Remedy on a <hi>Rich-Man,</hi> and he be hurt by it, it would diſcredit himſelf and <hi>Chymiſtry.</hi> And to try it on a <hi>Poor-Man,</hi> as too many do, he conſidered if it ſhould hurt him, though not kill him, yet it ſpoiling his Health, might ruine him, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe his Wife and Children (if he had any) that depended on his daily Labour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to do that would be cruel.</p>
               <p>Thus did this true-hearted Phyſician too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hazard his own, to recover the Health of his <hi>Neighbour;</hi> endangering it, not only by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating in the Fire, to produce <hi>good Remedies,</hi> various times undergoing the fumes of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Antimony,</hi> till he was as weary of them as I am: But after he had, by Directions from other <hi>Authors,</hi> ſome true ones, ſome falſe ones, made many <hi>preparations</hi> too tedious to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and had wrought upon moſt Subjects that werein the leaſt counted <hi>Medicinal;</hi> He, by taking many of them into his Body, mightily <hi>impaired</hi> his <hi>Stomach.</hi> And afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not hurt others, (to wit, his Patients) he threw all ſuch as he found <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Hazardous,</hi> away; and only kept to ſuch Remedies, as he was well aſſured were <hi>Wholeſom, Innocent,</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</hi>

They may believe it will not be aſkt in the <hi>great Reckoning day</hi> how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds a year they had when they Died: but rather how many hundreds of the diſtreſſed Sick they have faithfully Reliev'd.

ingenious Phyſician; to wit, he cared not, nay, abhorred to turn <hi>Mountebank;</hi> and as too many do, make a noiſe in Print about their <hi>Pills, Elixirs,</hi> and <hi>Spirits.</hi> For ſuch let them pretend what they will, and tell you of the Name of the <hi>Lord God</hi> to boot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the buſineſs in the bottom is Money.

               <p>I remember on a time, That one who found great benefit by a certain <hi>Medicine</hi> which my <hi>Tutor</hi> made, that would Cure ſeveral <hi>Acute Diſtempers</hi> ſafely; prevailing with his young Son many years ſince, got a few Bills printed of the Vertue and Uſe of it, with intent to ſell the ſame only to his <hi>private Acquaintance and Friends,</hi> and to take away the trouble of writing Directions.

               <p>The Cure of thoſe moſt inveterate Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, the <hi>French Pox</hi> and <hi>Scurvey,</hi> is a ſmall matter with ſome of theſe <hi>Bill-men,</hi> when, poor-hearts, they would cure it if they could. <hi>Infallible Cures</hi> other-ſome thunder forth, though they have little skill in Medicinal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Piſh, this is nothing with us; <hi>London</hi> and moſt Cities in <hi>England</hi> can ſhew you <hi>Pills</hi> good for <hi>All</hi> Diſeaſes; and which is more, ſome good for <hi>more</hi> than <hi>All</hi> being thoſe (<hi>it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a long Faith to believe it</hi>) that out-do all Pills hitherto extant: So that (<hi>Monſtrum horrendum!</hi>) thoſe very Pills their own ſelves that Cure <hi>all</hi> Diſeaſes, are in no wiſe to be compared to them.</p>
               <p>Moſt of theſe notwithſtanding are <hi>Compleat, Neat, Delicate, Fine; ſometimes Curing, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hurting, and now and then Killing-Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> or <hi>Emeto-Catharticks;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Purging-Pills, or Pills that Purge and Vomit notoriouſly, and not ſeldom fatten Burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places prettily.</hi> But I command and charge you not to read any thing of that in their Books and Bills, on the penalty of being coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one that read what they never publiſh in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:154380:92"/>But here's the worſt on't, The more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the People, and to put the better face on the Matter, we muſt have a pretence to <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,</hi> (for that takes) if we have not ſome ill-ſhap'd Picture of a <hi>Chymical-Furnace,</hi> to make it daintily fine; and muſt tell them <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry</hi> had a finger in the Pill's-formation, for that will make it go off. When alas, <hi>Poor-Things,</hi> they underſtand nothing leſs than the real Art of the Fire; which teacheth us, if truly underſtood, to ſhun all violent Purges and Vomits, and to avoid all hazardous Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>I do not write this to have theſe perſecuted or put by, unleſs the <hi>Poor</hi> may have better Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; But to have People take notice, That, <hi>as good Wine needs no Buſh, no more do good Medicines a printed Bill;</hi> as alſo to deſire ſuch Phyſicians who are intelligent, to be <hi>Sincere, True-hearted, and Merciful, and to eat ſome Grains of Self-denyal.</hi> For 'tis the <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs and haughtineſs</hi> of ſome ſuch, that gives encouragement to theſe, whilſt thoſe who want an Angel or a Crown to Fee a Doctor, muſt go to them many times or no where, though they receive not that benefit they might.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:154380:92"/>
out of Credit. Or, if inſtead of an Angel or a Crown, they would take a Shilling, or Nothing, and write them a <hi>Bill</hi> to ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious <hi>Apothecary,</hi> preſcribing a few cheap, yet Vertuous Ingredients, it would be a means to ſuppreſs the <hi>Bill-Trade.</hi> Which otherwiſe they will never do, and in reality 'tis pitty they ſhould; for a ſmall Aid, and ſomewhat uncertain, is better to the Poor than none.</p>

               <head>Concerning Medicines both Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical and Galenical.</head>
               <p>THat the Common Method of Medicine, called <hi>Galenical,</hi> is too languid and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to tug with thoſe violent and ſtubborn Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which are graſſant and aſſail us in our dayes, Experience hath ſo apparently evinced, that there is ſcarce one in four of our late <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical-Writers</hi> but confeſs it: And therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort Phyſicians to apply themſelves to ſearch after <hi>more vigorous Remedies,</hi> which by their Vertues may vanquiſh Diſeaſes. Thus far they do well and nobly, but in my Opinion they are ſluggiſhly obeyed, eſpecially by ſuch who have either grown gray-headed in Ignorance, and will know nothing in a manner beyond a <hi>Purge,</hi> a <hi>Vomit,</hi> a <hi>Syrup,</hi> or the <hi>Lancet;</hi> or by ſuch, who not much regarding the Good

of the Sick, mind moſtly their <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Profit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it wholly without cauſe that they are no better obeyed, ſeeing ſome few of thoſe who Preach forth this Excellent Doctrine, and plead for a Renovation of Medicine, are ſo far ſhort of what they would have others do, that they themſelves defend Blood-letting, and are not ſtartled at hazardous Remedies.</p>
               <p>For ſhame let us caſt <hi>Poyſons</hi> out of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and all ſuch Medicines as are diſturbers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; unleſs with <hi>Helmont</hi> we are able ſo to correct them, that we may not expoſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed to danger, nor to the Mercy of <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs-Doſes.</hi> Nor let us forget <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> unleſs we are able to tame them; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the firſt, who derides all endeavours unleſs you bring him an <hi>Alkaheſt.</hi> For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding as otherwiſe prepared, with an addition of other Ingredients, it ſometimes, as being <hi>Alcaleous,</hi> effects a Cure.</p>
               <p>Yet conſidering it may expoſe, as it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hath done, a Perſon to dammage and danger, if not perniciouſly deſtroy him; I verily perſwade my ſelf, 'twould be for the honour of Phyſick and their ſafety, never to admit it into our <hi>Stomachs.</hi> Next I think it would no wayes diſhonour <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> could we find all our Pretenders to <hi>Helmontianiſm,</hi> ſteer their Courſe ſafely in <hi>Phyſick;</hi> (as ſome I

               </p>
               <p>Which as it is an Art moſt uſeful, ſo is it a Word of no ill ſignification; being derived, as ſome ſay, from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, others from <hi>Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> a King. But 'tis the real knowledg of the Art and its Principles, not the Name, which is the thing that makes a Phyſician Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent: Seeing it ſeparates Crudities, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects Medicines by the Fire, through a proper Application of <hi>Agent to Patient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is there any greater difference between <hi>Well-prepared Chymical Remedies, and vulgar Shop-ones called Galenical,</hi> than that the laſt are <hi>Crude and Raw,</hi> at leaſt-wiſe not cleanſed from their Terrene and Droſſy Shackles, and therefore unfit for a weak <hi>Stomach:</hi> And that the firſt, to wit, the <hi>Chymical Remedies,</hi> through the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Fire and Art,</hi> are rendered Spirituous, Vertuous, and Innocent, being diveſted of all cloging Qualities.</p>
               <p>For if the Fire be ſo needful a thing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Food when we are well, much more when we are ſick; foraſmuch as the <hi>Stomach</hi> is then uſually ſo impair'd, as that the leaſt thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it, if it be not lively and ſuitable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:154380:94"/>
the <hi>Stomach</hi> not being ſtrong, is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated to make a ſeparation of Parts, and ſuck out the Vertues, which are but ſmall, in a <hi>crude,</hi> and therefore unfit maſs of <hi>Terreſtrieties or droſſy Medicines.</hi> Whereas a ſtudious and induſtrious Chymical Phyſician, profeſſing himſelf <hi>Natures Servant,</hi> ſeparates the <hi>droſſy</hi> parts from the <hi>more pure</hi> that ſhould nouriſh; and by only exhibiting the latter, ſaves <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> the trouble of expelling the Droſs, and of caſting forth what otherwiſe would hurt Her. So that She being <hi>delighted and enlivened</hi> by the approach of ſuch pure Remedies, begins to revive and get ſtrength, and finally <hi>routs</hi> Her Houſhold Enemy, to wit, the <hi>diſeaſie faex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which thing doubtleſs many <hi>Galenical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi> obſerving often, whilſt they rail'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Chymiſtry and its Medicines;</hi> after a tryal of ſuch as they could get from their own or others hands, found them not undeſerving <hi>Protection;</hi> and do ſince embrace them with ſuch loving hearts, though they ſubtilly rail againſt <hi>Chymical Phyſicians,</hi> as ſuch that give hot dangerous Medicines; That being put to a <hi>non-plus</hi> by the ſtubborn Diſeaſe, and their <hi>Syrups, Purges,</hi> and <hi>Electuaries</hi> being baffled, they'l apply themſelves to ſuch, and ſometimes ſo fortunately, that the <hi>almoſt-dead Patient</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers.</p>
               <p>For which their care I muſt needs highly
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:154380:94"/>
commend them, and ſhould more commend them if they made ſuch Chymical Medicines themſelves: But I cannot ſay they are too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and candid in railing againſt an Art, which their own Conſciences tell them is moſt uſeful, and to which they are ſo much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. For if <hi>Chymical Medicines</hi> are good in an <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Hand, who ignores their Doſe or Compoſition; or if they are excellent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſcrib'd by a <hi>Phyſician</hi> that never made a <hi>Chymical Medicine,</hi> or at leaſt-wiſe that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine he gives order for; Why may not ſuch Medicines, being more faithfully made, be much better in a <hi>Chymical Phyſitian</hi>'s Hands? I am ſure there is no reaſon to the contrary, but much reaſon for it; and it ſeems moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſenſe, That he ſhould beſt cure with <hi>Chymical Remedies,</hi> that ſpared neither coſt nor labour to make them Excellent and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and knows well what Ingredients they are made of. <hi>But what do Galenical Phyſitians who preſcribe to Apothecaries, make uſe of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Medicines, and yet nevertheleſs rail at Chymiſtry and its Profeſſors?</hi> Yes, they do, notwithſtanding their railing, which is but to blind the World; and which is worſe, thoſe Chymical Remedies they make uſe of, are (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides badly made) oftentimes Sophiſticated and Adulterated. <hi>How! Sophiſticated and Adulterated?</hi> 'Tis ſo, and all from this curſed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:154380:95"/>
thing <hi>Self,</hi> and a deſire of Gain. For in the firſt place the <hi>Doctor</hi> cannot, becauſe he muſt mind his <hi>Fees,</hi> and keep delicate white hands to feel the Pulſe of his Patient. And in the next place the <hi>Apothecary</hi> loves Money, and won't, becauſe he can buy them of <hi>Mercenary Chymiſts</hi> much cheaper than he can make them. But this cheapneſs ſometimes coſts the Patient dear, to wit, his Health, if not his Life, in regard the Remedies are <hi>Adulteraeted and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> that they may be afforded ſo: Though to cloak their own deceit, if the Medicine does harm, they, like Politicians, will ſay, His time was come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But why do the Mercenary Chymiſts thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their Remedies?</hi> That they may get a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Subſiſtence and live. For the <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,</hi> who (like other Tradeſmen) buyes where he can buy cheapeſt, offering low rates, ſo low, that the Medicine cannot be faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made for the Money; doth thereby tempt the <hi>Mercenary Chymiſt</hi> to <hi>Adulterate and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticate,</hi> or elſe make the Medicine by <hi>halfs:</hi> How deſtructive this is to many a poor Soul, I ſhall leave others to determine. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Spirit of Salt, Phlegm of Salt</hi> is ſold; and not only ſo, but 'tis ſometimes Sophiſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and <hi>Oyl of Sulphur</hi> (with other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies too tedious to be named) <hi>adulterated,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:154380:95"/>
I omit with what, becauſe I will not make Fools Knaves.</p>
               <p>Nor are many of our Modern Writers ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent concerning this; for even <hi>Van Helmont</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly profeſſeth, That he was loth to ſpeak plainly of any Medicine of Note, <hi>Becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Chymical Remedies in the Shops being full of deceit, and adulterated, through deſire of Gain, gave him cauſe to think all would be ſerv'd ſo:</hi> And truly I am of his Opinion. But the ingenious and noble <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Phyſiolog. Eſſayes.</note> 
                  <hi>Boyl</hi> Eſquire, having found it too true, ſayes, <hi>That he ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten met with Chymical Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unſincere, that he dare ſcarce truſt any in the Adminiſtration of Phyſick, which either his own Furnaces did not afford him, or was given him by ſome faithful skilful perſon he had a good opinion of. The other day</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occaſion to uſe ſome</hi> Spirit of Salt, <hi>whereof I was not then provided, I ſent for ſome to a Chymiſt, who making it himſelf, was the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to afford that which was well made: But though I gave him his own rate for it, at the firſt rectification in a Retort, a ſingle pound af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us no leſs than</hi> ſix ounces of Phlegm; <hi>and afterwards being further rectified in a high Body and gentle Heat, the remaining Spirit parted with a ſcarce credible quantity of the like nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeons Liquor. And after all theſe ſequiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:154380:96"/>
of Phlegm, 'twas not pure enough to perform what we expected from it. Of which complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an excellent Chymiſt of my acquaintance, he ſent for</hi> Spirit of Salt <hi>to a very eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiller of it, who gets much by his Profeſſion, and paſſeth for a very honeſt Man: But this Spirit (beſides its weakneſs) diſcovered it ſelf to be</hi> Sophiſticated, <hi>with either</hi> Spirit of Nitre <hi>or</hi> Aqua Fortis; <hi>Which betrayed it ſelf by its peculiar and odious ſmell. Whereas</hi> Spirit of Salt <hi>skilfully and ſincerely drawn, is commonly of a</hi> greeniſh Colour, bordering upon yellow, <hi>and hath uſually a peculiar and not unpleaſing ſmell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall bring here no more Inſtances, though I could produce many to the ſame effect, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would be but <hi>actum agere.</hi> Only be pleaſed to take notice how well a Patient is likely to be recovered by ſuch ill-made Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: And what's the cauſe the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prevail little more in a manner with their <hi>mercenary</hi> Chymical Remedies, than they do with their own cloging droſſy <hi>Galenical</hi> ones, as alſo what is one cauſe they cry out againſt <hi>Chymical Medicines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>☞ <hi>But why then do Galeniſts rail at, and give reproachful Titles to Chymical Phyſicians and their Art?</hi> There are many Cauſes, one of which I deſir'd you to take notice of lately, but the moſt uſual one is, becauſe they out-do
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:154380:96"/>
them in Cures, through faithful preparing their own Medicines. And thereupon leſt the People, eſpecially the <hi>Gentry,</hi> ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to make uſe of them, they <hi>Buz</hi> into their Heads, <hi>That Chymical Remedies either Kill or Cure quickly.</hi> Who, not perceiving the <hi>Doctors</hi> Deſign, believe it, till they are brought almoſt to Death's door; and then when they perceive themſelves as 'twere incurable, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they can but die, a Chymical Phyſician per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſhall be imployed; and if they be not too far ſpent, (which ſometimes they are before the Galeniſt will leave them) by <hi>wholſom, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, innocent Remedies</hi> they recover. And by this means, notwithſtanding their Reproaches, is <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> in repute with many.</p>
               <p>I remember about four years ſince, a worthy Gentlewoman falling into a <hi>Paralytick Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy,</hi> ſeveral (I think three) Galenick Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians were ſent for. They tryed various Wayes and Means, and Medicine upon Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, but all was in vain; and after three days endeavour could not awaken her, or cauſe her to move, but were forced to leave her as they found her, whilſt the Diſeaſe ſeemed to laugh their lifeleſs and feeble Remedies to ſcorn. Thus when ſhe was yeelded incurable, my ingenious <hi>Tutor</hi> was ſent for; who ſending his Son, becauſe himſelf could not conveniently go, recovered her by innocent yet valiant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:154380:97"/>
inſomuch that ſhe could move and open her eyes in few hours ſpace, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to the wonderment of many, he made her well and ſound. One or two of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> hearing this, and ſeeing her within few dayes ſo much mended after their ineffectual attempts: To ſave their Credits, and ſalve their Bungling, buz'd into the heads of the Women, that he, to wit, the <hi>Chymical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> correſponded with the <hi>Devil,</hi> or ſome <hi>bad Spirit;</hi> adding, he uſeth <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> (which the Vulgar call the <hi>Black Art,</hi> though it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows its name from <hi>Light Bodies</hi>) but they miſtook. However this was not a little belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by not only the credulous Women, but ſome Men; inſomuch that enquiery was made concerning it, and that with diligence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were better ſatisfied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and plainly ſaw the <hi>Heatheniſh Chriſtianiſm,</hi> and deceit of the <hi>Doctors;</hi> and we by this means came to hear on't.</p>
               <p>But what a piece of Villany was this, to reward ſo good, ſo <hi>charitable,</hi> and ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Phyſician, with ſo baſe and ignominious a reproach, for all his <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Expences</hi> to find out <hi>better</hi> Medicines than they had! Nor was this all, for they uſed and tryed many wayes to depretiate, and bring his Medicines into contempt; onely becauſe he could do more than they could, and oftentimes cured
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:154380:97"/>
where they were <hi>non-pluſt.</hi> But this reproach was ſo blockiſh, That ſurely had I not then been a <hi>Tabler</hi> with him in the Houſe, and heard it there, I ſhould not eaſily have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that any Phyſician had been ſo ſtupid, or ſo unphiloſophically bred, as to aſcribe the cure of Diſeaſes to the Devil. I muſt confeſs 'tis ſomething like the trick of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who abuſed the <hi>Prince</hi> of Phyſicians, our <hi>Lord and Maſter Chriſt,</hi> for caſting out Devils, and curing Diſeaſes, which they could not; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he did it through <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils: Wherefore if the Maſter was defam'd, well may his Servants.</p>
               <p>However let not ſuch Reproaches deter you, ye noble and true-hearted Chymical Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, from purſuing after more refined Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; being aſſured, (as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſayes) <hi>That none ſhall ever be forſaken of God, who with a pious Affection, and firm Faith, performs the Office of a Phyſician.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor be ye ſtartled at their crying out againſt the <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Chymical Medicines,</hi> ſeeing through a defect in the <hi>Natural Heat</hi> of the Body, Diſeaſes are commonly bred, eſpecially <hi>Fevers.</hi> For if <hi>Heat,</hi> which is the Exciter, though not the Efficient of Digeſtion, did not fail, as well as the Ferment it ſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſinable the <hi>Stomach;</hi> ſo many Fevers, and other Diſtempers as are, would ſcarce be: But
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:154380:98"/>
when the <hi>Natural and Vital Heat</hi> fails, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural one either is cauſed in the whole Body ſoon after, through the <hi>Archeus</hi> being angry, or the whole does gradually decline. Beſides we ought to conſider that <hi>Death</hi> is <hi>cold,</hi> and that Diſeaſes are the <hi>Harbinger</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> therefore to be withſtood by <hi>Vital Remedies,</hi> if we intend not to labour in vain: But how a Remedy that is <hi>Vital</hi> can be <hi>Cold, Dead,</hi> and <hi>Spiritleſs,</hi> I ſhall leave them to prove, ſeeing <hi>Life and Heat</hi> in Man are ſo much akin, that where the firſt is, there's the laſt; and that where the laſt is wholly abſent, the firſt is not preſent.</p>
               <p>But here by <hi>Vital Remedies,</hi> I do not mean ſuch as will inflame, to wit, <hi>Vinous</hi> Ones: though ſuch, if mild, when the diſeaſie cauſe is removed, are good for nouriſhment. But I by <hi>Vital Medicines</hi> do mean, ſuch as are friendly to the <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Stomach,</hi> the Prime Seat thereof; ſuch as are benign, and in their heat not exceeding the Vital Heat of the Body. Such Heaters, I ſay, as ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their lively and abſterſive Properties, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and reinforce Nature, to the expelling what hurts, and thereby undoubtedly cool.</p>
               <p>Provided Death, and an extinction of the Candle of L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Eaſe when vulgar Remedies can't; And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly preſerve the <hi>Senſes</hi> intire to the laſt; as much as then can be expected. For,
<q>
                     <p>Contra vim mortis, non eſt Medicamen in hortis.</p>
                  </q>
Yet am I not ſo much wedded to the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Science,</hi> as to exclude all things from Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick which have not been <hi>Spagyrically</hi> handled: or to go to perſwade the World that in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> no Remedies may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for ſome particular Maladies, whilſt experience tells me the contrary. For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Art of Healing amongſt the <hi>Antients</hi> was firſt founded on <hi>a Proper application of Simples,</hi> which they found good againſt many remote, and leſs dangerous Diſeaſes, whilſt daily experience dictated.</p>

                  <hi>And what then can any harm be in that?</hi> Seeing the Dead are generally very courteous, and are uſually ſo little addicted to revenge, that they never come back to complain, or in the leaſt to tell ſtories againſt the Doctor?

make uſe of more innocent Remedies and not hazard the life of the Sick: May be thereby taught ſo much honeſty for the future, as not to exclaim againſt men ſtudious and learned, and becauſe they recede from perverſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Methods, brand them with the name of <hi>Empericks,</hi> whilſt themſelves who know not what Remedies they give, are much more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thereof.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that an Opiative Medicine is given that has not ſo bad and malevolent tricks, but is by far better corrected than the <hi>Laudanum,</hi> for all its ſpecious and ſpicy addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which with <hi>Sp.

I ſay, ſuppoſe one better corrected than the <hi>Laudanum</hi> is given, yet the event is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes as it ſhould be. For <hi>Matthews's Pill,</hi> which in many Apothecarys ſhops in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is call'd <hi>Magiſterium Anodynum,</hi> and in which the <hi>Opium</hi> is ſix times better corrected than in the <hi>Laudanum,</hi> is not only at a chance ſo great an enemy to the life as to deſtroy it: But alſo frequently a great cauſer of Thirſt, Coſtiveneſs, and head-Ach the morning fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and ſometimes watchfulneſs a night or two after.</p>
               <p>You may perhaps ſay this is through the Pills ill compoſure, the <hi>Corrector</hi> not being
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:154380:104"/>
good, or through the <hi>Opiums</hi> ill commixture with it; cauſ'd from Lazyneſs and careleſneſs in him that made it: But not from any Vice in the Pill, as a Pill. In behalf of its innocency I can ſay little: only I can aſſure you that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I can make it as well as another, yet I uſe it not, becauſe it is hazardous. For, whatever others think, 'tis not an ordinary thing to ſport with mens lives, nor is it in my Opinion lawful to give that Medicine to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other which I would not willingly take. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the miſcarriage of a Father, Mother, or Son, upon taking an untoward Remedy, may do ſo much injury in a family as to give them cauſe of blaming, if not of curſing the Phyſician and Apothecary too. And the killing of a Man, though it be <hi>ſecundum Artem,</hi> with a Medicine known to be dangerous, is a crime not eaſily expiated. Others perhaps may think well on't, and being adventurous, not dread it in the leaſt: And ſo they may for all me; though I wiſh them ſucceſs and proſperity in their affairs, even aſmuch as their hearts can deſire.</p>
               <p>And as to <hi>Lazineſs,</hi> and <hi>Incuriouſneſs</hi> in the Preparer of it, on which you would lay the blame, when the Pill does harm and deſtroys the life of the Patient: I confeſs they are detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in Phyſick, and do make the Pill much more hazardous. Notwithſtanding which, ſome of thoſe Phyſicians who pretend to make their own
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:154380:104"/>
Medicines, as well as Apothecaries, eſpecially ſuch as live in the Country, are and have been accuſtom'd to buy ſuch like Remedies of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Chymiſts</hi> and <hi>Operators.</hi> Of the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making and compounding of which they being ignorant, and hoping they are truly and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepar'd, do ſometimes, and that not ſeldome give them to the ſick with events not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their deſires.</p>
               <p>For ſuch incurious Operators, if they make not their Remedies of periſhed <hi>Drugs,</hi> yet they beſtow not the pains required to make them well, or at leaſtwiſe Adulterate and Sophiſticate them at laſt that they may get a tolerable ſubſiſtance: And why is it? Becauſe 'tis the humour of moſt Apothecaries, eſpecially of thoſe who are ignorant of Chymiſtry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard had to due and honeſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to buy where moſt may be had for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and (which is a wonderful cheapneſs) to purchaſe ſome remedies ſo cheap, that the ſame money, without being payd for Labour, will but defray charges of ingredients, Glaſſes, Fire, and houſe-Rent, if the medicine were due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and honeſtly made. Which humour of theirs in ſeeking after cheap, (not good) remedies is doubtleſs detrimental to the Sick, and one cauſe why they ſometimes go uncured: whilſt to pleaſe them their Operators ſcarce regard what
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:154380:105"/>
they do, being loath to be depriv'd of their Cuſtome.</p>
               <p>I perhaps by this diſcourſe may anger ſome of the Apothecaries whoſe Conſciences on ſight hereof will fly in their Faces; As alſo ſome Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians who pretending to make their own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; do buy their Chymical preparations of others. But if I do, truly they muſt pardon me: For where the lives of men are concern'd 'tis bad foothing; My deſire is that they would be candid &amp; not ſeek more after wealth &amp; eaſe than the good of the ſick. I that loſt a <hi>Father</hi> and had my own Vitals clipt in their prime, through ill-contriv'd and pernicious medicines, may well be allowed to ſpeak. At leaſtwiſe whether they will allow me or not, I will take the liberty to do it.</p>
               <p>Yet would I not have you think that all Apothecaries are thus incurious. No: No: for I am perſwaded that there are not a few in London, and ſome few here and there in the Country that are perſons very ingenious, and candid, and ſuch as make their own Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal preparations. Only I could wiſh that thoſe candid ones were the quarter part of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries in the Nation: For then though it would be bad enough, it would be better by far than 'tis now. But to return to <hi>Magiſterium Anc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynum</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Mathews his Pill,</hi> and to let you ſee 'tis not the ſafeſt of Medicines,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:154380:105"/>
but ſometimes deſtructive, take this example. A certain perſon a man of good credit falling violently ill of a Fever had <hi>Mathews his Pill</hi> given him by a Phyſician that made it, or at leaſtwiſe pretends to make his own Medicines: But whether 'twas to make him ſleep or cure him of his Fever I know not; however the ſick taking it, it ſo perniciouſly freez'd and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pify'd his Vitals that although after ſome hours were paſt, being awakt he could open his eyes a little; Yet returning to ſleep, all their Art could not awake him, ſo he ſoundly ſlept till he died.</p>
               <p>Several more inſtances I could give you of ſuch who with Opiates ſlept to Death: But I know not certainly whether they took the <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum,</hi> or <hi>Magiſterium Anodynum:</hi> Only an <hi>Eſquire and his Wife</hi> in the Country not many years ſince taking <hi>Magiſterium Anodynum</hi> as the Phyſician ordered, and they perſwading him to do ſo too, to prove the ſafety of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: the Phyſician died that night after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, and his Patients died in few dayes after him, their diſeaſe having been much exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>An other perſon not being currently well, was thereby depriv'd of ſleep, whereupon ſhe conſulting a Phyſician, and a <hi>Learned one too,</hi> he preſcrib'd her an Opiative medicine to cauſe ſleep, as alſo a Cordial with it. She took it
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:154380:106"/>
and ſleeping ſoundly all night was awak't by her husband in the morning; when asking for a little drink, ſhe ſuddainly fell aſleep, and ſlept ſo long till ſhe died; whilſt they did their utmoſt endeavour to awake her.</p>
               <p>A certain widow being ſomewhat ill fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a courſe of Phyſick, (her <hi>Doctor</hi> being he that ordered a ſleeping doſe for the laſt) And firſt of all ſhe was <hi>Purg'd and Vomited,</hi> which being done her <hi>Stomach</hi> was ſo hurt ſhe could not ſleep at night. Hereupon a <hi>Dormitive</hi> medicine was given her, which ſhe taking over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, next morning (whereas ſhe uſ'd to be up at ſeven a Clock) ſhe not being Stirring at nine, one of her chief ſervants enquired for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs, and askt why ſhe was not come down: ſays the mayd preſently, the Doctor gave my Miſtriſs ſomething to make her ſleep, which ſaid: The man fearing leſt as ſome others had done ſhe ſhould <hi>ſleep to death,</hi> took the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to go up and call her. When he came and found her faſt a ſleep and in a cold ſweat he awak't her; and ſhe deſiring it, reacht her ſomething to drink: But the Cup was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner taken away, than ſhe was a ſleep again, and gave the man a ſecond trouble of awaking her: However that would not do, for to ſleeping ſhe return'd, whereupon he call'd up more company; and they not prevailing they ſent for the <hi>Doctor</hi> to ſee if he could do any good:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:154380:106"/>
But he with all his <hi>Art Force and Violence,</hi> could not make her open her eyes, for the <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Opium</hi> prevail'd. At length when fair means would not do, the <hi>Doctor</hi> ordered red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot coals to be laid to her back; and when he had ſoundly burnt her, ſhe not awaking ſlept to <hi>Death Secundum Artem,</hi> and left ſeveral Fatherleſs and Motherleſs Children.</p>
               <p>I think I need mention no more, for theſe will ſuffice ſeeing ſuch pranks are too often acted every where. But I wonder what ſuch <hi>Doctors</hi> think of themſelves, whilſt they thus through careleſneſs fatten <hi>Burying places,</hi> and increaſe the numbers of the <hi>Fatherleſs</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs?</hi> Do they think God is juſt, and will ever call them to an account? Doubtleſs though the Outward Law can't reach them whilſt they murther by authority, and ſend people <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically</hi> to <hi>Orcus:</hi> God will one day let them know what a good Conſcience means, and that there were and are Medicines not <hi>Poyſonous</hi> to be found, if they had been diligent. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have one great benefit above many other Profeſſions, and 'tis that which keeps the <hi>Poyſoning trade on:</hi> For if ſome others commit errors they remain in ſight to poſterity, but the Earth forthwith covers Our faults; By which means they being forgotten, we may without interruption next year Kill another <hi>Secundum Arte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:154380:107"/>But does not <hi>Opium</hi> many times profit the ſick in provoking reſt, and cauſing them to ſleep which otherwiſe they would not after watchful nights &amp; days? I cannot ſay it really profiteth, as 'tis commonly corrected, but that it brings ſleep and ſometimes <hi>Death</hi> is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: nor does it ſeldome appear that the ſleep which it cauſeth is not nouriſhing, as almoſt every intelligent woman that has been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with ſick people, or has taken it her ſelf can tell you. For it procures not ſleep in that it takes away the cauſe of Watchfulneſs from the <hi>Midriffs</hi> and <hi>Stomach,</hi> but only through <hi>Stupifying</hi> the <hi>Vitals:</hi> For after the taking of an <hi>Opiative</hi> Medicine to wit <hi>Laudanum</hi> if the occaſional cauſe of <hi>Not-ſleeping</hi> remains; the night or two following the Party who took it is commonly more reſtleſs than before.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>Mathews's Pill</hi> does at any time effect a cure I can hardly aſcribe it to the <hi>Opium</hi> or <hi>Hellebore</hi> but to the <hi>Correcting Sapo:</hi> For that being <hi>Alcaleous</hi> and an enemy to <hi>Acidity</hi> by its abſterſive property (whilſt ſo much of the <hi>Opium</hi> in it does more harm than good) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times effects a cure and removes the Occaſional Cauſe; which being taken away ſleep comes naturally, and of its own accord; therefore we ſhould chiefly aim at that. What I ſpeak is not conjectural, but can aſſure you I am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd that if half the <hi>Opium</hi> in the Pill and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:154380:107"/>
half the <hi>Hellebore</hi> were left out, and a larger quantity of the <hi>Liquoriſh</hi> put in, 'twould be a far more innocent, leſs diſturbing, and far more vertuous Medicine: for whereas according to <hi>Mathews his way</hi> the <hi>Opium</hi> was <hi>one</hi> to <hi>four,</hi> yet now being but <hi>one</hi> to <hi>eight</hi> it can't have that ſtupifying force, nor ſo exceedingly diſplay its <hi>Narcotick Venome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But be ſure whatever you do let the <hi>Sapo</hi> be well, truly, and duely made, and then mix the <hi>Opium</hi> thorowly with it, beating them two together for a good while in a <hi>Mortar</hi> till they are fully incorporated: which being done, at laſt put in the other ingredients after you have mingled them likewiſe; and by this means 'twill be made the more ſafe. Though after all if you would be ruled by me you ſhould be <hi>very cautious</hi> in uſing it.</p>

and pretty healthy, in the ſpring-time ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions calling him into that City wherein we liv'd, accidentally (as I think 'twas) meets with a <hi>Galeniſt,</hi> and one <hi>Med: Doct:</hi> This <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> having for ſeveral years been his Phyſician uſed not much <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to perſwade him; but taking his fee, <hi>Preſcribes,</hi> and ſending the <hi>Bill</hi> away to the <hi>Apothecary</hi> gives order for a Preventive Purge to be taken next morning.

               <p>But had the <hi>Purge</hi> been ſafe as it was not; they would do well to give a reaſon why ſuch a Doſe muſt be given, to Oppoſe a Diſeaſe not in being, and is but ſuppoſed to come: Seeing they are wholly ignorant whether o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Yet will I not ſay that <hi>Phyſick</hi> (as the people call it) at <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall</hi> is unworthy of that appellation; it being moſt true that it is effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and hath a Diverſe Operation at Once: yea and ſo effectual a one too that I will not not be ſo audacious as to rob it wholly of its name, ſeeing it in ſome ſort deſerves it. For if it takes away <hi>ſuperfluous humours</hi> from the Patients body as they tell you; I am ſure it adds <hi>neceſſary ones</hi> to ſome of the <hi>Doctors Purſes:</hi> and whilſt it cures that of a <hi>Plethora,</hi> cures this of a <hi>Conſumption;</hi> which muſt inevitably follow were there not a ſupply and a proper Preventive at hand.

wroteſt not ſo ſatyrically in vain, nor yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſufficient cauſe, we may with facility ſee.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps be objected that ſome Perſons if they take not a Purge at <hi>Spring and Fall,</hi> are ſubject ſometimes to Sickneſs in the Summer or Winter ſucceeding. This word <hi>Sometimes</hi> is well put in; for doubtleſs 'tis not alwayes; Neither are they alwayes well in the ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Winter or Summer who take them; Which I with many others can teſtify from woful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. But many times on the other hand they who don't take them, are more healthy &amp; leſs ſubject to lapſe: Whilſt they only crave the aſſiſtance of a Cup of <hi>Wormwood-beer,</hi> or ſome ſuch innocent <hi>hauſtus</hi> in the ſpring-time.</p>
               <p>But granting what they ſay, to wit, that it is needful for ſome, and ſo requiſite at the fore-named Seaſons; that the omiſſion thereof has made them infirm, and not ſeldome leſs healthy by far: Yet they ought to conſider that <hi>Cuſtome</hi> is the cauſe thereof, and that as <hi>Cuſtomary</hi> doth the body require it, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than it doth the uſe of <hi>Tobacco</hi> when many Years converſe therewith had made it familiar. And if too frequent ſmoking hath made <hi>Tobacco</hi> ſo neceſſary that ſome perſons can better be without their <hi>food</hi> than without it, muſt that forthwith prove it convenient for all perſons to take it? Experience tells us the contrary whilſt not a few are hurt by the uſe of it, and wiſh they never had known it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:154380:109"/>And therefore I ſhall ſay no more to ſuch, whoſe converſe with Preventive Purges has made that cuſtom uſeful, and too ſudden a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining it dangerous, than to adviſe them to take heed of whom they Make uſe, and be ſure that the <hi>Solutive</hi> be ſafe.

               <p>Some years after the untimely death of my <hi>Father,</hi> it being thought meet in <hi>Autumn,</hi> for all I was pretty well, to purge my Body; that is to ſay, to take a <hi>Poyſonous dirty Beſom</hi> to ſweep a clean Houſe, and diminiſh my <hi>Venal Blood,</hi> a <hi>Purge</hi> was ordered, and I took it, but was thereby purged into an <hi>Ague,</hi> that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a good while after; whereas had I been let alone, I might undoubtedly have been heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that <hi>Winter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not much diſagreeing with the Hiſtory of my Father's Death, is an account which <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> gives concerning a noted <hi>Brabanter. Of late,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a judicious Man of the Privy-Council of</hi> Brabant, <hi>that he might preſerve his Health, had taken an uſual Pill of waſhed</hi> Aloes, <hi>(to wit, gilded) and whilſt he found not the effect thereof, declares it to a Phyſician paſſing by: Who blames the ſluggiſhneſs of the</hi> Aloes, <hi>and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:154380:110"/>
ſo turns</hi> Picron or bitter, <hi>into</hi> Pigrum ſlow. <hi>I will preſcribe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>corrected Pills of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vertue; the which being taken, after a whole weeks vainly endeavouring to reſtrain the Purges unbridled effect, he miſerably periſhed, thus that he might free himſelf from a future Diſeaſe, he periſhed by the deceit of the Phyſician, and left eleven Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From whence</hi> (ſaith Helmont) <hi>'tis chiefly manifeſt, that it is free for a looſening Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to tyrannize on him that is in good health, as well as on a ſick Perſon: to wit, it is lawful, under the name of a Phyſician, and deceit of a purging Medicine, to prey upon the Life of</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>without puniſhment, becauſe the Earth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the cruel ignorance of Phyſicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo a Merchants Daughter of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance told me ſeriouſly, That having ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in her Speech, to wit, <hi>a Liſping,</hi> and thereby pronouncing ſome words not very plainly, though otherwiſe ſhe was in very good <hi>health;</hi> was partly promis'd a removal of that Defect by a Phyſician. Who according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſcribes a Medicine or two for her whilſt an <hi>Angel</hi> mediated. They being ſent from the <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> the young Gentlewoman ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to order took them, and was at four dayes end ſick in good earneſt, <hi>(this is worſe than what Tinkers do, to make a Hole in a whole Veſſel)</hi> and therefore had the Doctor's aid to repair the breach he had made in her Health.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:154380:111"/>
which he, by ſtrengthning Remedies, did in four or five dayes more. But the defect in <hi>pronunciation,</hi> her <hi>Liſping</hi> remains ſtill, after that the Doctor had got ſome <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> for making her Sick: Whereas had he ſent for a <hi>Chyrurgion</hi> to cut off a piece of her Tongue, he had had ſome ſeeming pretence; yet that had been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as equally blockiſh and dangerous. Seeing the cauſe of <hi>Liſping</hi> is the Tongues being too large for the Mouth, thereby hindring a clear pronunciation, whilſt it cannot move readily, and is ſubject to cloſe with the Teeth when it ſhould not.</p>
               <p>Surely the <hi>Phyſician</hi> (if I may call him one) was either ſufficiently ill-read in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> or elſe little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, either of which agree badly with Phyſick; for if he had not been one of them, he would never have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Medicines to cure what cannot be cured. The over-bigneſs of the <hi>Tongue</hi> being cauſed at <hi>Nature</hi>'s pleaſure, no otherwiſe than a <hi>large Hand, Arm, Leg, Foot, Noſe, Mouth,</hi> or <hi>Head;</hi> and therefore 'tis every way as rational to expect to leſſen any of them by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Medicines inward, as to hope to make the <hi>Tongue</hi> leſs; to attempt which nevertheleſs would be Sottiſh. Alſo why may we not expect, after the ſame rate of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that a Perſon having ſix Fingers on a Hand, ſhould have one of them taken away by a Medicinal Potion, ſeeing that alſo is from an Error in <hi>Formation.</hi> But of this enough, which though not proper in this place, I thought meet to hint; That if ſuch <hi>Phyſicians</hi> will not learn to be wiſe and honeſt, yet that the People may learn to ſhun them. I ſhall onely add one Inſtance more to ſhew the perniciouſneſs of <hi>Preventive Doſes,</hi> and then draw towards a concluſion.</p>
               <p>A certain Tradeſman, ſome years ſince, being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to take ſome Preventive <hi>Phyſick,</hi> conſults a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician;</hi> who thereupon preſcribes him a <hi>Purge</hi> (to wit) in <hi>Pills,</hi> which were accordingly ſent home to his houſe: But he, by reaſon he had urgent Affairs, neglected the taking of them for two dayes. The Doctor coming by,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:154380:111"/>
and ſeeing him in his Shop, demanded whether or no he had taken them, the man replyed No, but ſaid, he would, and by the Doctor's permiſſion did ſo: But the <hi>Poyſon</hi> being ſtrong, too ſtrong for <hi>Nature,</hi> he was dead in two hours ſpace.</p>
               <p>Theſe Examples I bring, for an admoniſhment and caution to ſuch who may at any time be tempted to take <hi>Preventive Phyſick,</hi> when they are already healthy, and Nature in a good plight, through the Stomach and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Digeſtions performing their Office. It not being ſeldom that ſuch a <hi>Prevention</hi> doth weaken the ſtrength and Vitals, as well as the Purſe; at leaſt-wiſe it doth them no good, all things being conſidered. And ſome Phyſicians there are who are worthy of blame, in that notwithſtanding their own Conſciences, as well as the Scripture, tell them, <hi>The whole have no need of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,</hi> and therefore want no Phyſick: Yet will, in hopes of an <hi>Angel,</hi> be perſwading the Healthy to take their Preventive Doſes, when ſome of them themſelves would not take them were they hired to do it, but a cup of good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ale or Sack ſhall ſupply its place.</p>
               <p>Alſo 'tis worthy of note, that if at any time a Perſon is Sick, and by the Phyſicians order a Medicine brought; if the ſick Party requeſt him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea, ſo much harm hath this preventive Purging, and other abuſes former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, as to make it a Proverb, <hi>Qui Medicè vivit,
