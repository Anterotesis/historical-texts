            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY your ſo much urging me to think
of Writing ſomewhat by way of
Anſwer to <hi>Amyntor,</hi> it ſeems to
me that you have not yet read the Book,
but only dipt here and there in it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you ſaw my Name frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
think there muſt needs be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Book that bears hard upon
me, and which I am concerned in Honor
to make ſome Reply to.</p>
            <p>I deſire you therefore firſt, to read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Book very carefully, (if you have
not yet done it) and after that, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
thoſe Reaſons which I ſhall now
give you, why I have no thoughts at
preſent of Writing any Anſwer to it; and
then I make no doubt but you will be of
my Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
for me, to give either my ſelf, or the
World any more trouble about this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49707:3"/>
In <hi>Amyntor,</hi> there is firſt a general A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology
for Writing Lives, whether of
good or bad Men. But in this part of
the Book, from p. 1. to 11. you will ſee
plainly I am not concerned.</p>
            <p>The next part of it, from p. 11. to 81.
was indeed occaſioned by a Paſſage
in my Sermon before the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
and therefore you with others,
may think perhaps it lies on me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to it: But when you have read it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
I believe you will be of another
Mind, becauſe you will eaſily perceive
that the Author and I are at laſt, well
enough agreed in that Point wherein we
ſeemed moſt to differ.</p>
            <p>The Matter of Fact is this. He had
ſaid in the Life of <hi>Milton,</hi> that <hi>many Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious
Pieces under the Name of Chriſt and
his Apoſtles, and other great Perſons had
been Publiſhed and Approved,</hi> (by ſome I
ſuppoſe he means, not by all) <hi>in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Times:</hi> And to this Obſervation,
becauſe (by my little Reading) I knew
there was much of Truth in it, I made
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49707:3"/>
no Exception. But he had ſaid moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that <hi>he doubted the Spuriouſneſs of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
more ſuch Books was yet undiſcovered, thro'
the Remoteneſs of thoſe Times,</hi> &amp;c. And
this Paſſage I found fault with, as what
proceeding from the Mouth of a Perſon
in high Eſteem (as I had heard) with
ſome Men for his great Parts and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
might give occaſion to them, and to
others not ſo well read in Antiquity as
they took him to be, to think that ſome
of thoſe Books which are received by the
whole Chriſtian Church, as Parts of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Scripture, are of very uncertain
Authority; (becauſe, as I then ſaid, <hi>I
knew of no other Pieces under the Name
of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the Spuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
whereof had not been diſcovered)</hi> and
I charged him with Infidelity, if indeed he
did doubt of the Authority of theſe
Books; and with Immodeſty, for ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
Affronting the holy Religion, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
and Eſtabliſhed among us, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
this his Doubt in Print.</p>
            <p>But he ſayes now, that I was miſtaken
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49707:4"/>
in my Cenſure, becauſe the Books which
he meant, <hi>(viz.</hi> In this laſt Paſſage which
I excepted againſt, as well as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
or elſe all that he Writes from p. 18.
to p. 43. is nothing to me, nor to the
Purpoſe) are, either ſome Books, the
Spuriouſneſs of moſt of which has been
diſcovered many hundred Years ago, and
which are few of them now extant; a
large Catalogue whereof he has given us
from p. 20. to p. 42, and it ſeems it was
only my fooliſh Miſtake to think that the
word <hi>(yet)</hi> when he ſayes the Spuriouſneſs
of theſe Books is <hi>yet</hi> undiſcovered, did
refer to this preſent Year, whenas indeed
it was meant by him to refer to ſome time
many Years ſince paſt and gone; or elſe he
meant the Books aſcribed to certain Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick
Men; particularly the Epiſtle of
<hi>Barnahas,</hi> the Paſtor of <hi>Hermas,</hi> the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of <hi>Polycarpus</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the
firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> and the ſeven Epiſtles of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inatus</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49707:4"/>
And I can't imagine now what you
would have me reply to this; for whether
he did mean theſe, and only theſe Books
in that Paſſage which I excepted againſt,
none can certainly tell but himſelf; if
therefore he ſayes he did mean only theſe,
and not the Books of the New Teſtament,
how can I contradict him?</p>
            <p>All that I could ſay to this, (if I had a
mind to reply to this part of his Book)
would be only to give the World the
Reaſon that made me think, he meant
not theſe only, but likewiſe ſome of the
Books of the New Teſtament; which
was this; that he having ſpoken before of
<hi>Suppoſititious Pieces under the Name of Chriſt
and his Apoſtles</hi> as well as of <hi>other great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi>
it was very reaſonable to think, that
when immediately after, in the ſame Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
he ſpeaks of <hi>ſeveral more ſuch Books,</hi> the
Spuriouſneſs of which is not yet diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he had meant, <hi>ſeveral,</hi> ſome at leaſt,
of all the ſorts before mentioned; that is,
ſome <hi>under the Name of Chriſt,</hi> and ſome
<hi>under the Name of his Apoſtles,</hi> as well
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49707:5"/>
as ſome <hi>under the Name of other great
Perſons.</hi> For how ſhould I know what
he meant by <hi>ſuch Books,</hi> but by looking
back, and ſeeing what Books he had
ſpoken of before? And finding that he
had there ſpoken, not only of Books <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Name of other great Perſons,</hi> but
likewiſe <hi>under the Name of Chriſt and his
Apoſtles,</hi> what could I underſtand by
<hi>ſuch Books,</hi> but ſome Books <hi>under the
Name of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,</hi> as well
as ſome <hi>under the Name of other great
Perſons?</hi> And if he did not mean ſo, or
would not have been thought to have
meant ſo; he ought, I think, to have
diſtinguiſh'd and have made that Paſſage
which I excepted againſt, an intire Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
by its ſelf; and have ſaid plainly,
that tho' he thought ſome Books Spurious,
which ſome others believed to be Genuine,
they were only ſome pieces that had been
ſacribed to the other great Men, but not
any of thoſe that were received as Pieces
of Chriſt or his Apoſtles; and if he had
Written his Mind thus clearly, I ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49707:5"/>
no more have excepted againſt this
Paſſage than I did againſt the former.</p>
            <p>But he ſays, <hi>If I had been diſpoſed to deal
ingenuouſly with him, I might have ſeen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of the Fathers,</hi> (which he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
I know nothing of) <hi>that he did not mean
the Books of the New Teſtament, when he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Suppoſititious Pieces under the Name of
Chriſt, ſince there is none Aſcribed to him in
the whole Bible, nor do we read there, that
he ever wrote any thing, except once with
his Finger on the Ground, when he acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Woman taken in Adultery.</hi> But I
wonder this ſhould be urged by a Man
that has ſo very lately written the Life of
<hi>John Milton;</hi> for by the ſame Argument
I might prove, that <hi>Paradice loſt,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
late Pieces Aſcribed by this Author,
as well as others, to <hi>John Milton,</hi> are none
of his, becauſe 'tis certain they were not
written by him; for how could he Write
when he was blind? And if to this he
ſhould anſwer, as I ſuppoſe he would,
that they may however, truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
enough, be ſaid to be Pieces of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49707:6"/>
               <hi>Milton,</hi> becauſe they were Dictated, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not Written by himſelf; I ſee
no Reaſon why our Saviours Sermon on
the Mount, and his ſeveral other Sermons
and Diſcourſes which were utter'd and
ſpoken by himſelf, tho' Recorded by the
Evangeliſts, may not be Aſcribed to him;
and be ſaid (in this Author's Phraſe) to
be <hi>Pieces under the Name of Chriſt.</hi> So
that if this be the only Reaſon I had to
think, that when he mentioned Pieces
<hi>under the Name of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and other great Men,</hi> he did not
mean the Books of the New Teſtament;
I think that ſince there are no Pieces now
extant, that can in any ſenſe be called
<hi>Pieces under the Name of Chriſt and
his Apoſtles,</hi> the Spuriouſneſs whereof
hath not been diſcovered, except only
thoſe which make up the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I had much better Reaſon to believe
that he did mean theſe, or ſome of theſe.
And in this Opinion I was the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
becauſe I never (either before
the 30th of <hi>January,</hi> or ſince) have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49707:6"/>
met with ſo much as one ſingle Perſon
that did not underſtand that Paſſage in
his Book in the ſame Senſe that I did.</p>
            <p>Whether therefore I did miſtake and
miſrepreſent his Meaning, is a Queſtion
that none but he himſelf, who beſt knew
his own Meaning, can decide; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I miſtook it (if indeed I did miſtake
it) without ſufficient Ground from his own
Expreſſion, is another Queſtion, which I
could very willingly leave to be decided, by
any indifferent Perſons; nay, if I were to
chuſe the Judges, and could be well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that they would ſpeak their Minds
freely, they ſhould be thoſe very Men that
are his great Admirers, who I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
would all with one Voice ſay that
they underſtood him as I did; and that
they look upon that Expoſition which he
has now given of that Paſſage, as little
better than a Retractation of that bold
Poſition which they thought he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
advanced, and for the ſake of which,
and of other ſuch like impious Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in that and other Books, ſaid to be-
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49707:7"/>
Written by the ſame Author, (I fear)
it is that they do chiefly admire him.</p>
            <p>But whether I did miſunderſtand him,
or no, and whether I had good reaſon to
underſtand him as <hi>I</hi> did, or not, are
private Queſtions, which only he and <hi>I</hi>
are concerned in; and <hi>I</hi> think it foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
to trouble the reſt of the World
about them.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficient, that now at laſt we
are agreed in the main Queſtion, which
is of more general Concern; for (unleſs
<hi>I</hi> miſunderſtand him now as much as
he ſays <hi>I</hi> did before) he now agrees
with me, that the Books of the New
Teſtament are Genuine, which was all
<hi>I</hi> ever meant to contend for.</p>
            <p>He therefore having declared,<note place="margin">P. 42.</note>
               <hi>that in the firſt Member of that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
in</hi> Milton'<hi>s Life, by the Spurious
Books publiſhed in the Primitive Times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Name of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
and other great Men, he meant ſome of the
Books mentioned in his Catalogue,</hi> p. 20.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49707:7"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (in which Point <hi>I</hi> did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
diſagree with him) and <hi>that in
the ſecond member of that Paſſage</hi> (with
which only it was that <hi>I</hi> found fault) <hi>by the
ſeveral more,</hi> [<note n="*" place="margin">P. 43.</note> 
               <hi>ſuch Books] he meant the
ſuppoſed Writings of certain Apoſtolical Men
(as they call them)</hi> Barnabas, Hermas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
About which the Learned World has
been much divided, and probably will
be, until greater Reaſon ſhall appear
either wholly to reject them, as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Spurious, or wholly to receive
them, as in all parts Genuine, than
has yet been produced, either on the
one ſide or the other: And he having
moreover expreſly granted,<note place="margin">P. 57.</note> 
               <hi>that
even thoſe ſeven Pieces,</hi> (as he calls
them) <hi>viz. The Epiſtle to the</hi> Hebrews,
<hi>the Epiſtle of</hi> James, <hi>the ſecond of</hi> Peter,
<hi>the ſecond and third of</hi> John, Jude, <hi>and
the</hi> Revelation, <hi>which were doubted by
ſome of the Ancients, are (not without
convincing Reaſons) received by the Moderns;</hi>
I have now no further Quarrel with
him upon the account of this Paſſage;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49707:8"/>
we are thus far fully agreed; may he
always continue in the good Mind he
ſeems now to be in. Only if <hi>I</hi> might
be heard by him as a Friend, I would
adviſe him, in the next Edition of
<hi>Milton</hi>'s Life, either ſo to alter the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of that Paſſage which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
againſt, that his meaning may
not be ſo liable to be miſunderſtood;
or elſe to add this Explanation which
he now makes of it, in the Margin.</p>
            <p>And now this great Difference being
thus amicably compoſed; <hi>I</hi> don't ſee
what Reaſon <hi>I</hi> (more than any one
elſe) have to maintain a Diſpute with
him upon any other Account. For
whereas <hi>I</hi> charged him with <hi>Confidence</hi>
for <hi>aſſerting King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt's Book,
call'd</hi> Icon Baſilike, <hi>to be ſpurious, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either producing any new Evidence for
the Proof of his Aſſertion; or offering one
word in Anſwer to thoſe juſt and rational
Exceptions, that had been made before to
thoſe only Teſtimonies, which he inſiſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to prove it a Forgery; or making any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49707:8"/>
Exceptions to thoſe later Evidences that
have been produced to prove it Authentick;</hi>
The matter of Fact he does not deny,
and whether the Charge was juſtly
grounded on the Matter of Fact, the
World will judge.</p>
            <p>In this laſt Book indeed, he ſays,
<hi>he will make amends for all former O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions;</hi>
and, I ſuppoſe, thinks has
done it; but whether he has or not,
I ſhall likewiſe leave the World to
judge; becauſe I do not think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for me, to take this Controverſie
out of another Man's Hands, who is
better prepared, and better able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it than my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Only, becauſe perhaps that worthy
Perſon, (ſaid by him and others to be
Mr. <hi>Wagſtaff,)</hi> may not think a formal
Reply needful to that little, (that very
little indeed) that is ſaid in <hi>Amyntor,</hi>
more than had been ſaid before, to
prove the Book Suppoſititious; <hi>I</hi> will
juſt hint this one thing to you; (and
upon Peruſal of all that has been ſaid
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49707:9"/>
on both ſides, <hi>I</hi> believe you will find
it true;) <hi>viz.</hi> that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> himſelf
is the only Evidence that has yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
(and he, not in Perſon, but by
his Friends, though in this <hi>I</hi> think no
Friends to his Reputation or Memory)
to prove himſelf the Author of that
Book. For all that Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays,
is from Dr. <hi>Gauden;</hi> except only that
he ſaw the Book under Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s
Hand-writing; (which might be, and
yet Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> the Tranſcriber only,
not the Author; according to what is
ſaid in Mr. <hi>Le Pla</hi>'s Letter.) And all
that Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſays, whether in
the Fragments before publiſhed, or
in the larger Narrative printed in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myntor,</hi>
is, as from her Husband, that
is, from Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſtill. Nay, and
even all that my Lord <hi>Angleſie</hi> teſtifies
under his Hand, as told him by the
<hi>Royal Brothers,</hi> (ſuppoſing the <hi>Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi>
to be my Lords Hand-writing,
and that it contains a true Relation of
what was told him by them;) and all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49707:9"/>
that any other Perſons, (though there
be Five Hundred of them,) do or
ſhall teſtifie as by Hear-ſay from the
<hi>Royal Brothers,</hi> is from Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſtill;
it plainly appearing by the whole Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and particularly by Mr. <hi>North</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that both King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second,
and his Brother did believe, or were
thought to believe the Book to be their
Fathers, till Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> in order to get
a good Biſhoprick for his good Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
told them otherwiſe. Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s
Teſtimony being therefore the ſingle E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
on that ſide: <hi>I</hi> leave it to you
to conſider, whether his manifeſt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in affirming this, and his Zeal in
purſuing his Intereſt by this Report of
his, being ſo very evident, they do not
render his ſingle Teſtimony liable to great
Suſpicion. And <hi>I</hi> leave it to all the
World to conſider, of what weight or
Validity any Man's Teſtimony can be, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
when he teſtifies for his own
Advantage, in caſe the Matter of his
Teſtimony be ſuch, that it can't be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49707:10"/>
credited without allowing, that he (the
Witneſs himſelf) has formerly been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a moſt notorious Forgery, and
conſequently that he is not a credible
Witneſs.</p>
            <p>In the Concluſion of <hi>Amyntor</hi> the
Author takes Occaſion, from the Offence
my Sermon has given him, to repreſent
the great inconveniencies that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
by the Obſervation of the <hi>30th.</hi>
of <hi>January,</hi> and by the Sermons that
have been preached upon that Day;
and you may expect perhaps that <hi>I</hi> ſhould
ſay ſomething to this; but <hi>I</hi> don't think
it either needful or convenient; becauſe
<hi>I</hi> judge this to be a Matter more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be debated in <hi>Parliament</hi> then by
private Perſons.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing noted in this
<hi>Concluſion,</hi> which perhaps you may think
lies upon me, more then any one elſe,
to defend, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſpeaking of K.
<hi>CHARLES</hi> I. in my Sermon, I ſhould
ſay, <hi>the beſt of Kings, and the beſt of
Men;</hi> which Expreſſion he ſaies ſeveral
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49707:10"/>
were angry at; eſpecially becauſe I did
not except the preſent King; (and he
might have added, that 'twas a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fault in me than it would been in
another, becauſe I Write my ſelf <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
to His Majeſty)</hi> But the Author, I
think, does not ſay he himſelf was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at this Expreſſion; and <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe
thoſe ſeveral, (if indeed there were any
that, upon this Account only were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
at it,) were only ſuch, as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have not been converſant in ancient
Authors, but are not yet ſo far read,
even in their Teſtament, as to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel, where v. 3.
he ſtiles <hi>Theophilus, moſt excellent;</hi> by which,
<hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe few, even of theſe beginners
to read, do think that St. <hi>Luke</hi> meant
to make a Compariſon between him and
other excellent Perſons, and much leſs to
prefer <hi>Theophilus</hi> before all other Men,
the Holy Apoſtles of our Lord not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
And therefore this being ſo
manifeſtly an invidious Cavil, <hi>I</hi> think needs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49707:11"/>
no Anſwer; eſpecially when in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
it ſelf, tho' <hi>I</hi> commended K.
<hi>Charles I.</hi> for his Virtues, <hi>I</hi> did allow
that he had Faults; But the Faults that
were then, and have ſince been charged
upon him, being only ſuch as he might
be, and I believe was led into by Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information,
and a miſtake of the extent
of his Power and Prerogative, I ſaid
they were only <hi>ſuch as were conſiſtent
with Integrity of Mind;</hi> and ſuch Faults
as theſe I think can hardly be called
<hi>Vices and Immoralities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Now, Sir, <hi>I</hi> hope you are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that <hi>I</hi> have no Reaſon, more
than any other Man, to engage my ſelf
in a further Controverſie with <hi>J. T.</hi>
the Author of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Life; for as to
the Reflections which he has in ſeveral
places of <hi>Amyntor,</hi> (almoſt in every Page)
made upon me; particularly, as to the
meanneſs of my Parts, and my great
want of Learning; <hi>I</hi> value them not;
let the World believe of me as it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49707:11"/>
pleaſes. Or if <hi>I</hi> was minded to make
any Anſwer to theſe parts of his Book,
it ſhould be only this; That my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Parts are ſuch as God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to give me, to which <hi>I</hi> can no
more add than to my Stature; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
ſuch as they are, I am contented
with them, and thankful for them:
And that my Learning is as much,
as by moderate Study, with ſuch Parts,
<hi>I</hi> have been able to attain. And to this
perhaps, <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſubjoyn a Prayer,
in which <hi>I</hi> make no doubt <hi>J. T.</hi>
would think himſelf included (as well
as he is thought by ſome to be, in the
Prayer for <hi>Jews, Turks, Infidels,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks)</hi>
viz. That they who have better
Parts, and more Learning, may uſe and
improve them to the Glory of him
that gave them; and do more good in
the World than <hi>I</hi> am able to do.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons for my not Writing
an Anſwer to <hi>Amyntor,</hi> if they ſatisfie
you, you may pleaſe to communicate,
