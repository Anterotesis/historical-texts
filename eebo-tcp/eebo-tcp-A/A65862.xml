         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Divine Light of Christ in Man
and his Mediation, truly confessed
by the People called Quakers.</head>
            <p>I Having had the opportunity lately to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
two Treatises concerning the Divine
Light, wherein the same Light as it is
in Man is very much acknowledged and
confest unto by the Author, beyond many if not
most under his circumstances in our day, but
withal finding that the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>
are unduly charged by him as I apprehend, That
they do confine the Light, as to the Act of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination,
to certain Men, or to Men of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Order, namely their own Party. And that
they make the Light within to be a Creature,
yea a Material Creature, <hi>p.</hi> 23, 78, 1st Treat.
and <hi>p.</hi> 18, 2d Treat. We the said People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus charged so manifestly contrary to our
sincere Belief, free and open, and frequent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and Testimony of and for the Divine
Light of Christ, both as it is in all Men or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and as it is increated Supernatural and
Divine. This gave me occasion the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and narrowly to inspect the said two Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
of the Divine Light, and to consider from
what General Doctrins or Positions as held by
the People called <hi>Quakers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Author could with
any colour of reason deduce such Consequences
upon us the said People, as so confining the Act
of Illumination only to those of our own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that we make the Light within to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36824:3"/>
but a Creature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I am sure I cannot find
any such Inferences justly deduceable upon Us
as a People, nor do I apprehend any particular
approved Writers among Us justly chargeable
therewith, their Writings on that Subject of
the Light within and Universal Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
duly inspected and impartially compared.
And therefore in love to the Truth and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Respect and Tenderness to the Author of
the said two Treatises, (<hi>i. e.</hi> J. N.) I had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
upon my Spirit to give him and the World
my Sentiments about the Matter objected and
charged by him, according to that measure of
Light and Understanding that God has been
pleased to give me, not to raise controversie
nor to give him or any others any real offence,
nor to cause or widen any Differences or
Breaches, but rather to lessen and compose
them, wherein they may in Truth and a right
Understanding be composed and quieted: for I
have a love for the said Author, and the more,
because he has so much confest to the Truth of
the Divine <hi>Logos,</hi> or <hi>Light in Man.</hi> Altho' by
the way, I do take notice how passionately and
angrily he is pleased to treat our Friend <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Vickris</hi> with severe Reflections, hard Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
and Detractions, which I think do not
well agree with his own Pretensions, nor sute
his Circumstances. And altho' he seems hardly
to resent some Reprehensions given him by <hi>R. V.</hi>
in his Answer to him, which shews the reason
thereof, yet I do not find that he has got any
real advantage against <hi>R. V.</hi> in point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
or Testimony relating to the Divine
Light, Spirit or Grace of God, but that <hi>R. V.</hi>
has plainly and honestly asserted Truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
and I confess it is ingenuous in <hi>J. N.</hi> to
Cite <hi>R. V.</hi> so fully as he has done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:36824:3"/>
As the People commonly called <hi>Quakers</hi> do
sincerely believe and confess the Divine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-Grace
of God in Christ to be universally
free to and for all Mankind, <hi>so they do not confine
the Divine Light of Christ as to the Act of Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to certain Men only, or only to Men of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Order, or to their own Party only,</hi> (as undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charged, <hi>p.</hi> 23, 78, 79.) is evident from
their own general Confession, that Christ as
the Divine word, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>enlightens every
Man coming into the World,</hi> Joh. 1. 9. which
must needs be an actual Enlightening; For
how can it be said Christ enlightens every Man,
but not actually? What Nonsense and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
would this be?</p>
            <p>And that <hi>R. Barclay,</hi> the Person charged, was
not of the opinion so to confine the <hi>actual Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
of this Divine Light in Man, see his own
Testimonies, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>For this end (that is for the
Restoration of Man) God hath communicated
and given unto every Man a Measure of the
Light of his Son, a Measure of Grace, or a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Spirit, which the Scripture expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
by several Names, sometimes the Seed of
the Kingdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 18, 19. The Light that
makes all things manifest, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 13. The
<hi>Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 18. or manifestation
of the Spirit given to profit withal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

Leaven. The Gospel preached <hi>in</hi> every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 23. And also that God in and
by this Light, invites, calls, exhorts and
strives with <hi>every Man,</hi> in order to save them,
(and is not this a plain confession to its <hi>actual
illumination</hi> in every Man?) which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is
received, and not resisted, works the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                  <bibl>[Thus far <hi>R. B.</hi> Apology,
330, 331.]</bibl>
               </q> And <hi>J. N.</hi> confesseth, <hi>that the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36824:4"/>
Spirit of Truth (which</hi> R. B. <hi>esteems the Light to
be the very same with) is really and truly God,</hi>
p. 66, 67. (wherein it seems <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>J. N.</hi>
are agreed). <q>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> also declares of this Divine
Light or Manifestation of the Holy Spirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to every Man to profit withal; That now
it were not profitable unto them, if it did
not strive with them in order to convert them.</q>
               <bibl>Thus <hi>R. B.</hi> fol. 66.</bibl> 
               <q>And that the Light of
Christ in a <hi>Turk,</hi> if minded, would reprove
him both for committing Fornication and for
Idolatry.—And that there is a possibility of
Salvation to every Man during the day of his
Visitation—which comes upon all at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
times and seasons, wherein <hi>it (i. e.</hi> the
Light or Grace of God) works powerfully
upon the Soul, mightily tenders and breaks
it, at which times, if Man resist it not, but
close with it, he comes to know salvation by
it. And moreover, concerning the Light's
operation in the Hearts of all Men, <hi>R. B.</hi>
saith, That as the Grace and Light in all is
sufficient to save all, and of its own nature
would save all, so it strives and wrestles with
<hi>all</hi> for to save them; he that resists its stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
is the cause of his own condemnation;
he that resists it not, it becomes his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
               <bibl>[Thus <hi>R. B.</hi> in his Apology, <hi>fol.</hi> 338,
339, 340.]</bibl> and the like in <hi>fol.</hi> 354. <q>And of
them who live at ease in their sins, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Deeds are evil, that with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
they reject this Light, for (saith he) it
checks the Wisest of them all and the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst
of them all in secret, it reproves them;
neither can all their Logick silence it, nor
can the securest among them stop its voice
from crying and reproving them within, for
all their consilence in the outward knowledge
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36824:4"/>
of Christ, or of what he hath suffered out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
for them; for, as hath been often said
in <hi>a day,</hi> it strives with <hi>all,</hi> wrestles with <hi>all;</hi>
and it's the unmortified Nature in the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,
in the Learnedest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that denies this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that despises it, that shuts it out to their own
condemnation; they come all under this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
<hi>Every one that doth Evil, hateth the
Light, neither cometh to the Light, lest his deeds
should be reproved,</hi> Joh. 3. 20. </q>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Apology, f.</hi> 355.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far <hi>R. Barclay,</hi> with much more of this
kind in his Works, which I forbear farther to
recite here, being I think sufficient to evince
to any rational and intelligent person, that he
did not (nor do any of us) confine the Light
of Christ within (in reference to the <hi>Act of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination</hi>
or Enlightening) to certain Men, or
to ourselves only, but the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi>
of its more powerful operation unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and deliverance of Man from Sin and
Satan, is only effectually receiv'd and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
in them who return inward unto and
obey this Divine Light of Christ within when
it unavoidably convicts and reproves them of
Sin and Transgression, Christ being the Author
of Eternal Salvation to them that obey him;
tho' he actually enlightens all, he saves only
them that believe and obey him. And that
<hi>R. Barclay</hi> did not believe this Divine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-Light
to be a <hi>Creature,</hi> as is inferred upon
him, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> for his sake, pray observe
his own Testimony, <hi>Apology,</hi> fol. 798. <hi>viz. That
the</hi> Quakers <hi>exhort People to believe in a meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is a meer Calumny,</hi> (saith <hi>R. B.</hi>)</p>
            <p>But now what ground has <hi>J. N.</hi> to charge
the <hi>Quakers</hi> with confining the Light within, as
to the Act of Illumination, as aforesaid? For
I find no real cause he has thus to charge us
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36824:5"/>
from <hi>R. B.</hi> his speaking of the natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Man, <q>as fallen, degenerate, dead, and
deprived of the sensation or feeling of this
inward Testimony of the Seed of God, and
as subject to the power, nature and seed of
the Serpent—and that Man, as he is in this
state, can know nothing a right, and that his
thoughts and conceptions concerning God
and things spiritual are unprofitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and others, until he be dis-joined from
this Evil Seed, and united to the Divine
Light, <hi>P.</hi> 8. <hi>Apol. fol.</hi> 310. And that this
holy, substantial Seed many times lyes in
Man's Heart, as a naked Grain in stony
Ground,</q> 
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Apol. fol.</hi> 334.</bibl> Observe, Whence
it does not follow, <hi>That wicked Men who have the
Light really and truly in them, yet are not actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd
by it,</hi> nor yet <hi>that it lyes dormant in them,</hi>
(as is inferred, <hi>p.</hi> 83.) For tho' natural, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
Man, dead in sins, and wicked, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
Men, have not the true sense and
knowledge of the Divine Light it self, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
not, that they are not at all or in any sense
actually enlightened by it; for when they are
at any time convicted and reproved of evil,
judged and condemned in themselves for their
wickedness and evil deeds, and excited to the
contrary, they are thereby so far actually enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,
tho' they know not that Light it self, nor
what it is that doth so convict, reprove, and
condemn them; the Spirit of Truth reproves
the World of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they neither accept
nor see it, (as they ought to do) and the Spirit
many times blows or breaths upon them, yet
they know not whence it comes, nor whither
it goes, nor really what it is, tho' it does actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
visit and enlighten them; the Sun shines
and the Rain falls actually upon the stony and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36824:5"/>
barren Ground; so the Lord causeth <hi>his</hi> Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
to arise upon the evil and the good, and
the Rain to fall upon the just and unjust. And
some grow past feeling and become judicially
harden'd through their rebellion and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
sinning against the Light. <hi>How often is the
Candle of the wicked put out, how oft is destruction
upon him?</hi> 'Tis therefore often <hi>lighted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning what <hi>J. N.</hi> is pleased to impute
to the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, <hi>viz. That they do not
hold their Light to be the very Substance and Essence
of the Deity,</hi> p. 39. Herein he is mistaken of
the People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> who profess God to be
<hi>our Light and Salvation.</hi> And I think his particular
Instance from <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> impartially consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and compared with other Instances of his,
will fall so far short of proving the Charge upon
the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that the contrary will appear for him
and the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this case. His Instance for
proof is, <hi>viz.</hi> That</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Barclay <hi>saith,</hi> By this Seed, Grace and Word
of God and Light wherewith we say every Man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
and hath a measure of it, which strives with
them in order to save them, and which may by the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness
and wickedness of Man's will be quenched,
bruised, wounded, pressed down, slain and crucified; We
understand not the proper Essence and Nature of God
precisely taken<note n="*" place="bottom">That is, as to his own distinct, <hi>intire Essence,</hi> purely considered, without relation to Man, or to the Suffering Nature or Spirit of the Man Christ Jesus, who suffered <hi>as. Man,</hi> but not <hi>as God.</hi> 1. Pray what is it then in Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is or may be so bruised wounded, pressed down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>R. B.</hi> saith? 2 Can <hi>J. N.</hi> say 'tis the Proper Essence of God precisely taken? 3 What is the <hi>Seed</hi> the Son of Man sows in Mens hearts? <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 4. And is nothing of the heavenly Man Christ in it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Pray consider.</note>, but a spiritual, heavenly and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Principle, in which God, as Father, Son and Holy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36824:6"/>
Ghost dwells, a measure of which divine and glorious
life is in all Men as a Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—and this we call
<hi>Vehiculum Dei,</hi> or the Spiritual Body of Christ, the
Flesh and Blood of Christ which came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>p. 37, 38. On which</hi> J. N. <hi>observes thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
viz. I think 'tis plain, from this account Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>
gives of the Light, that tho' it be a Substance, yet 'tis
not the same with, but really distinct from the substance
of God, for 'tis not <hi>Deus,</hi> but <hi>Vehiculum Dei.
(Thus far</hi> J. N.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. By the way, (being sensible where the
stress of his Objection lyes, and what Words it
most here pinches upon) I do sincerely propose,
That the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Word of God,</hi>
cannot be confined to those or any such Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(here objected) in a strict or literal sense;
neither shall I insist upon the same; If <hi>J. N.</hi>
should write another Book (or more) thereof, I
shall not contest with him about varieties of
Words and Terms (which he may have and know
far more of than I) but for <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Substance,</hi>
knowing that the <hi>Light</hi> is very comprehensive
and large in its extent and signification. 'Tis said
that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>the Light,</hi> and the
<hi>Law</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>Commandment</hi> a <hi>Lamp,</hi> and
the <hi>Word</hi> both a <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Lanthorn.</hi> By which
manner of speaking, it may then be said, the <hi>Word</hi>
is both the <hi>Light</hi> and its own <hi>Vehicle.</hi> And then
why may not <hi>Christ's Spiritual Body</hi> which came
down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> as well be a <hi>Light,</hi> as <hi>Life, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment</hi>
or <hi>Food</hi> to the <hi>Soul?</hi> or as <hi>truly</hi> as the
Saints be <hi>the light of the World</hi> (instrumentally)
or Light <hi>in</hi> the Lord, who enlightens them? Is
not Christ intirely in all respects <hi>a Light,</hi> as well
as all other Spiritual Good to the Soul? For
Christ is not divided.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. 'Tis certain, that God is Light (even
the Fountain and Fulness of all true Divine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36824:6"/>
Light) and in him is no darkness at all; and he
hath shined in our hearts, to give us the light of
the Knowledge of his Glory <hi>in the Face</hi> of Christ
Jesus our Mediator and Way to the Father;
God is our Light and Salvation in Christ. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for any to suppose <hi>R. B.</hi> or the <hi>Quakers</hi> to
hold or intend, that the <hi>Divine Logos, Word,</hi> or
<hi>true Light,</hi> which enlightens all Men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. is
not the Divine Essence, or not of the Being or
Substance of God, is wrongfully to suppose, that
they oppose or deny the plain Testimony of
<hi>John the Evangelist,</hi> which expresly saith, <hi>In the
Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and that Word was God; the same was in the
Beginning with God;</hi> and that <hi>In it was Life, and
the Life was the Light of Men,</hi> Joh. 1. Which
Light therefore was of the very Essence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Deity. 'Tis certain that Jesus Christ
as God enlightens all Men, and as he is God and
the heavenly Man he enlivens and quickens the
true Believers and regenerates them into his own
heavenly Image, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 25,
37, 40, 50, 88, 93, 147, 154 Verses. And I am
sure <hi>R. B.</hi> and the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> are so
far from opposing or denying this Gospel-truth,
that both they and he do sincerely own, believe,
and confess it. See <hi>R. B.</hi>'s own Testimony, in
his Works, quoted <hi>fol.</hi> 11. where he expresly
saith, <q>
                  <hi>Christ is near unto every one,</hi> for in him
we live and move and have our being; and this
nearness of his unto all Men in a day, is more
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) to them than the general presence, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
whereof he abides with all the works of his
hands, forasmuch as he is <hi>in them</hi> to enlighten
them that they may believe, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Whence 'tis plain, that here he owns Christ, and
even as God also, to be that true Light in all
Men. And likewise in <hi>fol.</hi> 63. <hi>R. B.</hi> owns even
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36824:7"/>
what his opposer grants, namely, <q>That the
Light is in all Men, and that <hi>Christ is in all
Men,</hi> in so far as his Light is in all Men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Christ's Light to be in all Men, even in
such as are not in Union with him, adding,
That <hi>where the Light is, there is Christ the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of it,</hi> which is all we say.</q> (Thus far <hi>R. B.</hi>)
And in <hi>fol.</hi> 64. he confesseth, <q>An universal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of the Holy Spirit in every one,
and that he that believeth in the Light belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in Christ, for where the <hi>Light of Christ is,
there is Christ himself,</hi>
               </q> compared with <hi>fol.</hi> 66.
[Thus far <hi>R. B.</hi>] Wherein I hope <hi>J. N.</hi> and he
are agreed, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Divine Light in Man
is of the very Nature, Substance and Essence of
God, and his dear and only begotten Son Jesus
Christ. And therefore I wish <hi>J. N.</hi> would be
so charitable and tender as not to study either to
make or widen Differences or Breaches, in point
of Judgment where they are not in reality, if
Matters be impartially and truly lookt into and
compared.</p>
            <p>3. But <hi>R. B.</hi> supposes <hi>a Spiritual Body</hi> of Christ,
(or Principle) <hi>which,</hi> says he, <hi>we call</hi> Vehiculum
Dei, <hi>wherein God as Father, Son and Spirit dwells,</hi>
(or appear in Man, as he understands) and what
then? is this either to deny God or a Light of
his Divine Essence to be in Man, when it grants,
<q>God, both as Father, Son and Spirit, to be <hi>in</hi>
such a Divine Principle as is in Man? yea, that
Christ the Eternal Word, which was with God
and was God, thus dwells in us,</q> 
               <bibl>
                  <hi>fol.</hi> 334.</bibl> which
<hi>R. B.</hi> adds to the words before cited by <hi>J. N.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, wherein he truly supposes, that
Christ <hi>as in</hi> a Seed, or in such a Love (or Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory)
appearance <hi>in Men,</hi> may be pressed, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and slain, as to them who are said to <hi>crucifie
the Lord of Life afresh unto themselves,</hi> yet not as to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36824:7"/>
his own intire <hi>Existence</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> nor as he is the
Omnipotent God; for tho' Christ be a Lamb,
and aspersed and crucified to many by their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
he is also a Lion, and hath power to stir
up his strength even <hi>in Man</hi> when he pleases.
And for <hi>the Seed of Eternal Life to be sown in us,
and that the Lord would raise up his Power in us,</hi>
these are not new, nor uncouth Expressions, but
prayed for even in the Liturgy of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to his words, <hi>which we call</hi> Vehiculum Dei,
(speaking of the <hi>Spiritual Body of Christ</hi>) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
he speaks in condescention in <hi>the Person of
some</hi> of the learned Writers or Philosophers who
have used those Terms, and not in the Person of
the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are not only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
an illiterate People, but are a plain, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
innocent People, who most affect plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Language,
without any School Glosses, or
Nice Distinctions, to deck, adorn, or illustrate
their Christian Profession of Christ or of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Light within, and many Thousands may
not understand the terms, <hi>Vehiculum Dei, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Being,</hi> (nor the word <hi>Idea's,</hi> so much used
by <hi>J. N.</hi>) Nor is Jesus Christ Preacht among us
under those terms, but in Scripture-terms, both
as he is truly <hi>God,</hi> and as he is the one Mediator
between God and Men, even the Man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
as having an inward sight, sense and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him by his Divine Light, Spirit, Life
and Power; so as we shall not need to fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Names thereof, but prize the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the World's Wisdom, natural and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Knowledge and Learning, for in him are
all the hidden Treasures of true Wisdom and
Knowledge. We who are a plain, simple-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
People, who are content with what God has
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36824:8"/>
bestowed upon us, are not willing to trouble our
heads with curious Notions, nor with intricate,
school Definitions and Distinctions about Words
and Names, having an inward feeling of the
principal thing, the root of the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>5. Concerning <hi>R. B.</hi>'s speaking of the <hi>Spiritual
Body of Christ, as a heavenly, invisible and Divine
Principle,</hi> and believing <hi>God as Father, Son and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
dwells therein,</hi> and are to be known and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
therein; I think <hi>J. N.</hi> has no great reason
to differ with him therein, much less to suppose
thence, that he or we conclude, the Divine
<hi>Light,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, mention'd <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. but a meer
Creature. And considering that Doctrin of the
<hi>Spiritual Body</hi> of Christ is that which <hi>R. B.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
in all his Discourse of that Subject, <hi>J. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
himself cannot oppose, but rather, grants the
probability thereof (and then where's the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie?)
For which take a view of his own
words, <hi>p.</hi> 38. <hi>1st Treat.</hi> viz. <q>Whether there be
any such thing as <hi>Vehiculum Dei,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Body
of Christ,</hi> (which is a Notion several learned
Men both before and since the appearance of
Quakerism have entertain'd upon the reading
the 6th Chapter of St. <hi>John</hi>) I have neither
Cause nor Mind at present to dispute,</q> 
               <bibl>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 38.
<hi>1st Treat.</hi>
               </bibl> And to the same purpose he writes
more fully and ingeniously in his second Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
<hi>p.</hi> 17. Which therefore I may here recite
in his own words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>And here, in the first
place, I shall be so free and ingenuous as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that I shall not stand with them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any of the <hi>Five first Propositions,</hi> which may
be all true, for ought I know to the contrary.
Particularly I shall <hi>not</hi> stand with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>the Spiritual Body of Christ,</hi> as distinct
from that Natural Body wherein he was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36824:8"/>
of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> There may be such a
thing for ought I know, or am able to shew
to the contrary, and I know, that several among
the Ancients have been of this opinion, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for its foundation the sixth Chapter of
St. <hi>John,</hi> which, to confess the truth, seems to
favour it not a little. And this Hypothesis has
been of late to the great surprise and amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the stiffer and severer sort of Divines,
re-advanced by a person of singular Note and
Eminence in our Church, who makes use of it
to salve and maintain the Doctrin of the Real
Presence, supposing that while the Bodies of
the Communicants feed upon the grosser Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Bread and Wine, their Souls (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them as are fitly disposed) do take in and
feed upon this Divine and <hi>Spiritual Body</hi> of
Christ, which strengthens and nourishes their
Inner Man, and becomes to them <hi>a Principle of
Regeneration and Spiritual Life,</hi> as you may see
more fully deduced in his Discourse of the <hi>Real
Presence,</hi> particularly in the first and sixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of that Treatise. I shall not therefore, I
say, contend with them concerning the <hi>Spiritual
Body of Christ,</hi> either as to its Existence, or
as to this its Use, whether there be such thing,
or whether it be the <hi>Principle of Regeneration</hi> and
Spiritual Life to the Saints: They may be both
true, for ought I know, I see nothing absurd,
or so much as improbable in them; and as I do
not surrender up my full assent to what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
demonstrate to be true, so neither do I care
to run down and condemn such Principles which
I cannot prove to be false.</q> (Thus far <hi>J. N.</hi>)
It may not be amiss here, to insert those 5 <hi>first
Propositions</hi> before mentioned, which he has sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
from our friend <hi>R. B.</hi> &amp;c. and which he
declared he <hi>shall not stand with us concerning any of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36824:9"/>
them, for that they may be all true, for ought he knows
to the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. p. 14, 15. They (meaning the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers)</hi>
suppose, that the Spiritual Life, or the
Life of Holiness and Grace, is a Substantial
Life, even as the Life of Vegetation, the Life
of Sensation, and the Life of Reason are all
substantial.</p>
               <p>2. They suppose, that this Substantial Life
is by the Vital Union of the Soul with some
body or other.</p>
               <p>3. They suppose, that this Body in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Union of the Soul, with which Spiritual
Life does consist, is a certain <hi>Divine or Celestial
Body,</hi> even as the Natural Life does consist in
the Vital Union of the Soul with a Natural or
Terrestrial Body of the common Elementary
Consistence.</p>
               <p>4. They suppose, that Christ had two Bodies
of a distinct Original, and of a different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>—<hi>a Body</hi> which he took from the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>a Body</hi> in which his Soul exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long before he took flesh of the <hi>Virgin.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>These are the very words of Mr. <hi>Barclay.</hi> To
the Question of his adversary, <hi>Had Christ two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?</hi>
He answers, <hi>Yes;</hi> and let him deny it if
he dare, without contradicting the Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi>
6. 58. Christ speaks of his flesh which came down
from Heaven; but this was not the Flesh he took
from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> for that came not down
from Heaven, but he had a Spiritual Body, in
which his <hi>Soul</hi> existed long before he took Flesh of
the Virgin.</p>
            <q>
               <p>5. They suppose, that this latter, <hi>the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Body of Christ,</hi> is that <hi>Divine or Celestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
in the Vital Union of the Soul, with which
our Spiritual Life, or our Life of Grace does
consist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That this is that heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:36824:9"/>
that <hi>living Bread</hi> discoursed of in the 6th of
St. <hi>John,</hi> that Divine <hi>Aliment</hi> upon which the
Saints do feed, and whereby they are nourished
unto Everlasting Life.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The premises (of the whole foregoing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
seriously considered and compared, where's
the great difference between <hi>J. N.</hi> and <hi>R. B.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The one confesseth the Divine, Substantial
Essence and Nature of the <hi>Deity</hi> to be that Light
which is in Men.</p>
            <p>The other confesseth God, as Father, Son, and
Spirit, to be the Light in Men, and to be in that
Seed, Principle, or Spiritual Body of Christ, which
is (in some degree) in all Men.</p>
            <p>2. The one confesseth the Divine Light of the
Word that was with God to be in all Men.</p>
            <p>The other confesseth Christ, who is that Word,
to be in all Men, in some measure.</p>
            <p>3. The one confesseth the Spiritual Body of
Christ, (consequently Christ's being in that Body)
The other cannot deny it, but rather assents to it.</p>
            <p>4. Both confess the Light of Christ within to
be a Divine, Substantial Light and Truth.</p>
            <p>5. They differ not about the Divine Essence
of the Light, as being of the Nature and Being
of God and Christ, as he is the Divine Word or
<hi>Logos,</hi> but somewhat about the mode or manner
of its Being, (Discovery and Reception) as <hi>in
Man;</hi> The one supposeth the very Essence and
Substance of the Deity to be intimately united to
our Minds; And the other, that 'tis <hi>in us</hi> as in
a <hi>Medium,</hi> i. e. <hi>in</hi> the Spiritual Body of Christ,
(which is rather assented unto than opposed) or
in and through Christ as Mediator; for therein
he is <hi>God's Servant,</hi> (most eminent) and <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>
See <hi>Isai.</hi> 42. 1, 6, 7. ch. 49. 6. ch. 52. 13.
&amp; 53. 11. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>6. But the main difference is, That <hi>J. N.</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36824:10"/>
and condemns is (in <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>G. K.) their
making the Spiritual Body of Christ</hi> to be <hi>the Light
within,</hi> p. 18. <hi>Treat. 2d.</hi> Concerning which,
and his saying, <hi>That</hi> not <hi>even the Soul of Jesus
Christ—much less his Spiritual Body can ever be a
Light to the Mind of Man,</hi> p. 23. <hi>Treat. 2d.</hi> I
ask him if any spiritual part of Jesus Christ,
wherein he is received and knowable <hi>in Man,</hi> can
be truly said to be no Light to the Mind or Soul
of Man? How then says Christ himself, <hi>I am the
Light of the World; I am the Way, the Truth, and
the Life; No man cometh unto the Father, but by me?</hi>
Joh. 14. I could draw strange consequences on
<hi>J. N.</hi> in this matter, but chuse at present to be
sparing.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Comparison for reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Although <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>J. N.</hi> acknowledge
Christ the Divine Word, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be the
Light within, even that Light which enlightens
all Men, the one supposeth 'tis as <hi>in the spiritual
Body of Christ;</hi> and the other cannot tell; he
knows not but there may be such a thing; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
both confess the Light to be <hi>a substantial
Light,</hi> of the Divine Essence and Nature of the

            <p>I think in the main the difference is not very
great; not so great as to deserve such severe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
and Reproach from <hi>J. Norris;</hi> As, <hi>That
the Notion of the Light within, according as the
Quakers explain and represent it, is really ridiculous
enough to make the Patrons of it so, and well deserves
all the scorn and contempt that is cast upon it,</hi> p. 3, 4.
Treat. 2.</p>
            <p>But I must take leave to tell him, I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this his Reproach and Contempt which he
hath cast on us and our Notion, (as he calls it)
nor that it can any ways become his Profession,
either thus to gratifie Scorners and Contemners,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36824:10"/>
or thus to teach the wicked their way, who scorn
and contemn Religion and Truth; but rather
I take it, that he writ this scornful and contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Passage against us very inconsiderately, and
from a groundless Passion; of which the Lord
make him truly sensible, (and forgive him.) And
also of his undue, censorious and scurrilous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
<hi>viz. That the Quakers only Cant in some
loose and general Expression about the Light, which
they confirm with the Authority of St.</hi> John'<hi>s Gospel,
tho' they understand neither one nor t'other,</hi> p. 24.
Herein he was too censorious; we know in whom
we have believed, (we thank God) and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sense and experience we have of his Light
and Grace in our Hearts for Life and Salvation
from Sin and Death: and what real change and
reformation it has wrought and brought forth
in us in Life and Conversation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And seeing <hi>J. N.</hi> saith, <hi>That to the like purpose,
Mr.</hi> Keith, <hi>another of their most considerable Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
speaking of the Seed of God, saith,</hi> &amp;c. By
his words, <hi>to the like purpose,</hi> he means, like as
<hi>R. B.</hi> hath declared about the <hi>Spiritual Body of
Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which I say then, what has been said for
<hi>R. B.</hi> in the case, may serve for Answer to him
about <hi>G. K.</hi> Howbeit, that Faithful Man, <hi>R. B.</hi>
being gone to his rest, and not here to answer
for himself, I was the more concerned to take
notice of him, and of his own Explications in this
Matter. It may be <hi>R. Vickeris</hi> (or some else) may
find cause to answer <hi>J. N.</hi>'s two Treatises more
particularly and fully for themselves; but that I
leave.</p>
            <p>What <hi>J. N.</hi> saith, <q>That to be a <hi>Light</hi> to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36824:11"/>
Mind of Man, is to be to it the Principle of
Understanding, to furnish it with <hi>Idea's,</hi> and
to be the immediate Object of its Conception,
immediately present to the Mind, and to have
the whole perfection of being the <hi>Idea's</hi> of all
things, and to be an Universal Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
which conditions (especially the last)
no creature either has or can possibly have;
and therefore no creature is able to be a Light
to the Soul of Man,</q> 
               <bibl>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 23. <hi>Treat.</hi> 2.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>These Propositions we shall not need to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
nor oppose the Inference, which affects
not our Principle of the Divine and increated
Light of God and Christ in Man, and therefore
shall not need to examine <hi>J. N.</hi>'s large Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Demonstrations of the same, Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being not denied, but the same in effect as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
by <hi>R. B.</hi> In his concluding it, <q>A meer
Calumny for any one to say, That the <hi>Quakers</hi>
Exhort People to believe in a meer Creature,</q>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Apol.</hi> 798.</bibl> Besides, where such Creatures as the
Saints in Christ were called the <hi>Light</hi> of the
World, and the <hi>Salt</hi> of the Earth, and those that
were sometimes Darkness, were become Light in
the Lord when converted, they were <hi>such</hi> not of
themselves; nor as meer Creatures, but as join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and united unto (and made partakers of)
Christ Jesus, and to God <hi>in him,</hi> who was their
Light, their Life, and Salvation, and that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velily
Salt that seasoned and sanctified them. And
if they were Light <hi>in the Lord,</hi> who was their
Light, much more Christ Jesus, who is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Divine Light and Universal Illumination,
in whose Light (and not as in a Creature) Men
ought to believe, that they may be Children of
the Light: And although we believe in God,
through Jesus Christ, and 'tis through him as
our Mediator, that our Faith is truly in God,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36824:11"/>
and not without respect to Christ, and living
Faith in him, he being the Author of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and Divine Faith, who said, <hi>Ye believe in
God, believe also in me,</hi> Joh. 14. 1.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident, that accordingly <hi>R. B.</hi> testifies
unto Jesus Christ the Son of God, both as <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Man,</hi> Creator and Mediator, saying, (<hi>Apol.
p.</hi> 274, 275.) <q>1. That Word that was in the
Beginning with God, and was God, by whom all
things were made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that this is that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ by whom God created all things; by
whom and for whom all things were created
that are in Heaven and Earth, <hi>&amp;c. Col.</hi> 1. 16.
Who therefore is called the First-born of every
Creature, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. As then that infinite
and incomprehensible Fountain of Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appeareth in the Creatures, by his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Word and Power. 2. So no Creature
has access again unto him, but in and by the
Son, according to his own express words. See
<hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. Hence he is
fitly called the Mediator betwixt God and
Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that there is no knowledge of
the Father, but by the Son, and that he is the
only Mediator, <bibl>

                  <hi>Friend,</hi> John Norris,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ON the serious perusal of the Controversie,
1. I do not find, that thou hast exalted
the Divine Light of God, and his dear Son, more
than the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet am glad thou
hast exalted it so much as thou hast done, beyond
many (if not most) of thy Brethren; and I tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wish thy mind may be turned into it, and kept
in it, out of all fleshly Wisdom and Imaginations,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36824:12"/>
that thou mayest feel true Divine Life, Power
and Wisdom in it, as well as have a Notion of
it.</p>
            <p>2. I do not see but our Friends exalt Jesus
Christ, as Mediator betwixt God and Men, more
than thy self: For which please to consider,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Thy</hi> supposing the very Essence and Substance of
the Deity to be so intimately united to our Minds, as
that there can be no Medium between God and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>p.</hi> 22. <hi>Treat.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 8. <hi>Treat.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>2. Thy <hi>supposing the Light within to be a Man's
natural and ordinary way of Vnderstanding,</hi> and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>This is Reason, this is Conscience,</hi> (speaking
of the Light) <hi>p.</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 55. <hi>Tr.</hi> 1. [This I think
contradicts the foregoing Supposition. Only it
seems to be qualified with thy <hi>meaning no more than
that this</hi> (the Light) <hi>is that whereby I perform acts
of Reason and acts of Conscience.</hi> May not <hi>R. B.</hi> be
as easily reconciled <hi>about the Light,</hi> and the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Body</hi> of Christ, thinkest thou?]</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thy supposing, that neither the</hi> Soul of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, nor his Spiritual Body, can ever be a Light
to the Mind of Man, <hi>p.</hi> 23. <hi>Tr.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>In these three Suppositions, may not I suppose
thou leavest no room for Jesus Christ as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
in any degree in Men? Or hast thou not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said as much herein, as one called a <hi>Deist</hi> may
say, without relation to Jesus Christ, as manifest
in several degrees, appearances and operations
<hi>in</hi> Man, as we truly feel him and confess him?</p>
            <p>Yet I still confess thou hast suppos'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
many general Truths in thy Books in respect
to the <hi>Divine Light within;</hi> As,<q>
                  <p>That to be actually enlighten'd by this Light,
is the Universal Benefit of all Men, yea, of all
the Intelligent Creation, <hi>p.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>That 'tis the Essential Truth of God,—yet
that it does not formally enlighten or instruct
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36824:12"/>
me, but when I attend to it, and consult it, <hi>&amp;c.
p.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>That in thy account, it (the Divine Light)
is the <hi>very Essence</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi>
exhibitive of <hi>All Truth,</hi> p. 36.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>In him was Life, and the Life was
the Light of Men;</hi> that if the Proposition be
understood formally, then it proves, that 'tis
not only a Substance, but also a Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
strictly speaking even the very Essence
of the <hi>Deity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 40.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not</hi> that I would be thought to deny the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Light</hi> to be Grace, as to the certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of it; so far from that, that I think it to
be the <hi>greatest Grace</hi> of God, that is with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the degrees of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 46.</p>
                  <p>I in this very Book—as well as in the whole
course of my other Writings upon this occasion,
do all along earnestly contend, that this <hi>internal
Light</hi> is no other than the very Essence and
Substance of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 53, 54. </p>
               </q>[Thus far
thou <hi>J. N.</hi>] with much more of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>Now, Friend, (<hi>J. N.</hi>) Hadst thou only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on these Truths, and let the People of God
called <hi>Quakers</hi> alone, and not reproacht them
with <hi>Grossness, Confusion,</hi> &amp;c. it had saved both
thy self and us farther trouble: I would not have
thee reproach or vilifie us any further, but seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with the Light of Truth consult and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what will make most for thy own inward
Peace and quiet Life, and if thou art reflected on
by any of thy Brethren or Society for confessing
the true Light, let not that be a Temptation to
thee to evade Truth or reproach us. Many of thy
Brethren of the Clergy might see and confess
more of the <hi>Divine Light</hi> in Man than they do, if
Avarice, Preaching for Hire, Filthy Lucre,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36824:13"/>
Great Livings, and Worldly Preferments did not
blind their Eyes, cloud their Understandings and
choak the Good Seed in them; therefore have a
care thereof.</p>
            <p>Our Testimony for the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> may be
farther seen in many of our ancient Friends
Writings, as <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi>'s large Book, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
<hi>Rustious ad Academicos,</hi> and many of <hi>Geo.
Fox</hi>'s Books, and <hi>William Dewsbery</hi>'s Works, (with
divers others) to which I refer thee; but chiefly
to the <hi>Divine Light</hi> (confess'd) in thy self, for
Information and a right Understanding: Which
I desire the Lord to give thee; Who am</p>
