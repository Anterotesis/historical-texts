            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For if upon the whole matter you shall be reduced but to the temper of the good Archbishop <hi>Whitgife,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who, as your Lordship knows, though they held the Government of the Church by Bishops to be more agreeable to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, then any other; yet have fully declared themselves to be of opinion, that no form of Church Regiment is so set down there, but that it may be lawfull to alter it, even for a worse, upon Civil respects: I am then very confident, that upon a new ballancing of the account of the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54970:7"/>
of the removing, or retaining Episcopacie in this Church (as things now stand) your Lordship will be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to an alteration thereof. For in truth (my Lord) that we cannot put down a Bishop in a Diocesse, without setting up a Pope in every Parish; and that no other Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is compatible, either with Monarchy, or with ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if upon a review, your Lordship should finde sufficient reason to change your minde concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, as well as concerning the unlawfulnesse of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing Episcopacie in this Church; that so ours may be reduced to an Uniformity with that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> since the reduction of theirs to the likenesse of ours (which was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a matter of great importance) is now impossible: the publication thereof may well repatriate your Lordship in the good graces of all, that have had their mouths open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against you upon this occasion, except it be of a few over hot Zelots. For many wise, and religious men, differing from your Lordship in your opinion touching Episcopacie, and concurring with me in mine, are yet of your minde, that it is better to begin with such a Reformation thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto there is a happy unity of Opinions, not onely in the Representative, but almost throughout the Lay part of the true body of the Kingdom; then to attempt the doing of it all at once, till the humours (yet very crude) shall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prepared for such a sweeping purgation; which for my part I hold to be a politique, that is a doubtfull Probleme. And so your Lordship hath my thoughts upon that first point, which hath held me too long.</p>

I had often heard those principall intendents of the puqlike good most solemnly professe, and consequently, that the Court, and Countrey were, in truth, now to be all of a pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As touching your Lordships carriage in the Tryall and Attainder of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> I must not conceal from you, that the report of the latter made a much deeper gash in your Fame, with us in the country, and I believe in the City, and in the Parliament too. And yet the making of that Speech your Lordship did to the Bill of Attainder, was no fault for ought I know; and accordingly your Lordship need not ascribe it to the Favour, but meerly to the Justice of that Honorable House, that after a dozen distinct char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon the severall passages of that Speech urged against
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54970:9"/>
you, with great strictnesse and acrimony, by that number of the most eminent persons there, both in abilities, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, and in your absence, upon a Good-Friday to you; yet they were not able, after four hours debate, to expose you unto the least reprehension, either upon the main matter, or upon the bye. The offence was the publishing it in print, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the passing of the Bill, and the execution of that great Lord, which, your Lordship may please to believe me, gave exceeding great scandall in the country where I live, and where the reasons, given by your Lordship for your absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Vote, were by many maintained to be unanswerable. And by this your Lordship may guesse what harm it did in other countries at home, and abroad; where, you cannot be ignorant, how apt some are to censure the proceedings of their neighbours, and to take every advantage to speak the worst they can of them: nor that they did so upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion ministred by your Lordship. So that if your censure were known to all the Kingdom, and your infamy were in print with forreign Nations, yet your Lordship therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no more wrong, then the King, and Parliament, and your Country did by your occasion.</p>
               <p>I do therefore humbly intreat your Lordship to resist all temptation to thoughts of discontent for the censure which passed upon you, and that Speech of yours in the House of Commons: and to do it equall Justice by distinguishing their misfortunes in this, and other occasions from their faults, as you desire other should do in your case. For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming that the Speech was printed without your privity, as you now relate, I can find no fault in any man touching this matter, but in Sir <hi>Lewis Dives,</hi> and he, besides the asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a brother to a brother, and the reason he had to do what he did, hath the common license of the times for his almost sufficient excuse. But an extreame misfortune it was, as well to the House of Commons as to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; that you should be censured by them for the fault of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man; which invincible error of theirs it is very probable they might come to find after they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and for that reason forbore the prosecution of their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54970:9"/>
charge with the Lords, to the diminution of their misad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, but the encrease of your Lordships in this affair, because (in my poor opinion as well in your Lordships) neither you, nor the House of Peers it selfe could take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what had beene done in the House of Commons, without a breach of their priviledges, since it was never by them brought up to the Lords (which <hi>I</hi> write under corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) so as your Lordships misfortune in this matter may seem irremediable. And yet to shew your Lordship with how much passion I desire to save a noble young Lord of such eminent abilities, as may be of great use to the King and Kingdom, from sincking in his reputation (which will make them altogether uselesse to the publick) I will adventure to take your Lordship by the hand, and to try whether I can raise you out of this puddle also, when I have first opened my selfe to be the same man, that made the larger Answer to your <hi>Lps</hi> Speech to the Bil of Attainder of the sayd unhappy Lord: which was intended to have been sent to you so timely, that if your Lordship had thereby received satisfaction in your Scruples, you might have acknowledged as much in the House of Commons, whereof you were then a Member, and so have escaped their censure in a fayrer way, then you did by climbing up into the House of Peers at that time. For so that is understood: But the throng of lesser Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets was so great, that before this could passe the Presse, (which I am made believe it could not in a month and more) your Lordships Speech ranne the fortune you know, and another briefer Answer thereunto got through, Of which misadventure, I was much more sorry for your Lordships sake, than mine own, though by this meanes I also may possibly have been censured either for insulting upon a noble person cast down (which I should hate my self for if it were true) or for having taken the advantage of such a time to publish my Answer when it was not safe for your Lordship to make any Reply. But since your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath adventured on other actions, and writings more dangerous then your defence need to be, as your Lordship may mannage it, <hi>I</hi> humbly beseech your Lordship to take it

into your consideration, whether you may not do well to make a Replication thereunto, for the reasons I shall now give your Lordship; and which I am perswaded, ought to have the same force with you, which they have with me. They are, if that your Lordship do yet persist in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that you had sufficient grounds to alter your first judgement of the Lord <hi>Straffords</hi> cause, you ought to make a further clear deduction of them to the world, partly for that unfortunate Lords sake, partly for your owne, a little for your servants, and a great deale for your Countryes sake. For to begin with the last (as being of greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in it self, and <hi>I</hi> beleeve in your Lordships esteem also) If your Lordship, who have now had good leisure, and great cause to revolve all your late words, and actions, in your most serious thoughts, and to bring all the stirrings of your conscience upon every one of them to a strict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, be still of the same mind you were, when you so solemnly washed your hands from the blood of the Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> which he at his death charged home upon this Kingdome, <note n="(a)" place="margin">I wish this Kingdom all the prosperity and happinesse in the world: I did it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and now dying it is my wish, I do now professe it from my heart, and do most humbly recommend it unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man here, and wish every man to lay his hand upon his heart, and consider seriously whether the beginning of the happinesse of a Kingdome should be written in letters of blood, I fear you are in a wrong way, and I desire Almighty God that no one drop of my blood may rise in judgement against you. <hi>viz.</hi> Lord of <hi>Straffords</hi> Speech at his death.</note> then it cannot be, but you must needs fear, that it lyes upon this Land, and in your apprehension, may be one cause of the present unhappy condition thereof, which hath beene so well foreseen, and expressed by my Lord your father. <note n="(b)" place="margin">My Lords, what I have yet sayd unto you hath bin chiefly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the apprehensions and feares of our future dangers.

I could give your Lordship many instances of the inconsistencie and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of obeying these Commands. But I shall trouble you onely with one or two. The Ordinance of Parliament concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> (now in so great agitation) commandeth all persons in Authority to put it in execution, and all others to obey it, according to the Fundamentall Laws of the land; The King declareth it to be contrary to the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Laws, against the Liberty of the Subject, and Rights of Parliament; And commandeth all His Subjects of what degree soever upon their Allegiance, not to obey the said Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as they will answer the contrary at their perills. So likewise in point of the Kings commanding the attendance of divers of us upon His person, whereunto we are obliged by severall relations of our services and oaths: In case we comply not with His Commands, we are liable to His displeasure, and the losse of those places of honour and trust we hold under Him: If we obey His Commands without the leave of the Parliament, (which hath not alwayes been granted) we are liable to the censure of Parliament, and of both these we want not fresh Examples; So that certainly this cannot but be acknowledged to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, and uncomfortable condition. I am sure I bring with me a ready and obedient heart, to pay unto the King all those duties of loyalty, allegiance, and obedience which I owe unto Him: And I shall never be wanting towards the Parliament, to pay unto it all those due Rights, and that obedience which we all owe unto it: But in contrary Commands, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of obedience to both, is hardly to be lighted on. The Reconciliation must be in the Commanders, and the Commands, not in the obedience, or the person that is to obey. And therefore, untill it please God to blesse us with a right understanding betwixt the King and Parliament, and a conformity in their Commands, neither the Kingdom in publique, nor particular men in private can be reduced to a safe or comfortable condition. <hi>Earl of Bristolle Speech.

a publique confession of your judgement (as now infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) in reparation of that high wrong you did His Majestie and the Parliament, by publishing your Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in print, when you were of another minde; nor that you have much worke to do at home, which can be done by no other, and which it doth infinitely concern you not to slubber over, I need not tell you my reason: yet because the most watchfull conscience may need jogging sometimes: I most humbly beseech your Lordship to give me leave with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, to entreat you first to take a re-view of your Speech by the light you now have from Master Solicitor, and then to set before your eyes that part of the preface, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you wished peace of conscience to your selfe, and the blessing of Almighty God to you and your posterity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as your judgement of the life of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> should be consonant with your heart <hi>in all integrity</hi>; which <hi>I</hi> do not with any intention on my part, to give occasion to any other to inferre, that your Lordship went one hairs breadth beyond your own beliefe of the integrity of your heart therein. I thank God I have learned my duty bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and as I ought, do confidently believe your Lordship hath too much of the fear of God in your heart, to transgresse so much as a Mathematicall point, willingly and wittingly in so solemne an execration: But withall I know the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of making such imprecations before his face, who is greater then our hearts, and knoweth more by us then they do. And if it be true which <hi>I</hi> have heard from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of honor, that there was a time when Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> solemnly wished, that if ever he gave his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the levying of monyes on the Subject without their own consent in Parliament, <hi>He might be set up as a Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con on a hill for people to gaze at.</hi> We all have occasion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us in this protesting Age, diligently to call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and sadly to reflect upon what ever we may have inconsiderately uttered in that kinde, having all (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) seen or heard, how his rash words have been veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied upon him, by the Bonefires were made on the tops of many hills in some Countries for his execution; and this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54970:12"/>
by a kinde of instinct in the vulgar sort of people, without any direction from wiser men; the like whereunto upon the like occasion, I beleeve was never done in the World before. Your Lordship will therefore (I hope) forgive me, if out of my desire to make sure of keeping your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship from being hereafter scorched with the like flames, I presume to advise you to enter into your own heart (being <hi>I</hi> suppose like mine own, deceitfull above all things) and there to make the strictest enquiry all your wit and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can, whether the lying of one thing or other in the way, did not hinder you from going to the bottome, when you made that execration; and so from discerning somewhat then, which you may now possibly see in this businesse. For to be plaine with your Lordship, I am therefore a little jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous there might be some pretincture in your Lordshipps own eye, because I observe you could so clearly see, and distinctly describe all that might bloud-shot other mens eys in this case; and yet for ought appears in your Speech, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once took notice of any of those many other causes of vitiation of judgement, which it concerned your Lordship more to have looked after. Such were personall respects, as the inclination of one great wit to take part with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of one Peere apparent, to take compassion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in being, complying with the judgement of the King at that time; hope of favour from His Majesty from thence, feare of His Maiesties dislike of a person so able, so willing, and then (as was believed) in so neere expectance of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do service to the King and State: For <hi>I</hi> will not wrong your Lordships Noblenesse, by the lightest ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination that your eye saw the worse by looking a squint at any private advantage in a publike employment: And I will forbeare the mention of something might be of more force with you, then all <hi>I</hi> have yet touched, because if it were so, your Lordship must needs know it, and <hi>I</hi> cannot minde you of it without preiudice to a third Person; your nimble phansie will quickly represent all other to your memory, by the hint of these <hi>I</hi> have set before you. And they, they (my Lord) and such other were the corruptive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54970:12"/>
of iudgement, of which you should have discharged your selfe to the uttermost of your power, and not Lapwing like have made so great a cry with so many <hi>awayes</hi> there, where your conscience was in no danger. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Let every man purge his heart clear of al passions (I know this great and wise body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke can have none, but I speak to individuals fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the weaknesse which I find in my selfe) Away with al per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal animosities, Away with all flatteries to the people, in being the sharper against him, because he is odious to them; Away with all fears, lest by the sparing of his bloud they may be incenst; away with all such considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as that it is not fit for a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, that one accused by it of Treason should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape with life; Let not former vehemence of any against him, nor fear from thence that he cannot be safe while that man lives, be an ingredient in the sentence of any one of us.

Nay <hi>I</hi> should not have thought so well of you as <hi>I</hi> do, if, not having your understanding subdued, you should have cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated your iudgement to theirs: or if after you had wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped your heart on the side <hi>I</hi> have now shewed you (and it may be you onely forgot to mention, not to thinke on by your selfe) upon the hearing of the Diametrall opposition between great Lawyers of the House in their opinions, your Lordships mind stood in <hi>aequilibrio</hi> (though this were an imperfection of iudgement, <hi>I</hi> should do wrong to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in you, yet if in truth it were so) <hi>I</hi> pronounce you ought to have done as you did, at least <hi>I</hi> should have done the same had <hi>I</hi> been in your place: For <hi>I</hi> conceive that a minde in that posture is bound, or at least hath liberty to encline to the safer side for it self, though it may be the more unsafe for the State, because a mans own soule is of more value to him then all the world. And <hi>I</hi> humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that in all cases either of Counsell, or of Judicature (to one of which it may be all that come within the walls of either House may be reduced) it is ever safest to encline to that side which goeth with him that is in possession, which in this case of the Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> was that which was against the Bill of Attainder.</p>

strange story, which <hi>I</hi> cannot wonder enough <hi>I</hi> should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have heard of before; Thus: There were (sayth he) foure beside your Lordship of the close Committee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi>: There was a paper of much importance concerning the sayd Earle, mislayd on a sodaine in a private roome where they were, which was mist before they departed, but could not be found, yet next day they had it at Court. Those foure Members particularly made their protestation in the presence of God, and of the House of Commons, that they were not privy to the conveying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of that paper: His Lordship did the like, and wished a curse upon him if he knew any thing of it.

As I do also, whether that Writer himselfe, if he be a man that hath taken the Protestation, hath not given as much cause of suspicion of his having violated that part of it, wherein he in the presence of God vowed to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and defend the Kings Honor (a word not to be found in the oathes of Supremacie, or Allegiance) by charging the Cavaliers to have thought to have circumvented part of the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> Army, and to have forced their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through their quarters, and to have seised on all the Ordnance and Ammunition in the Earles Army then at <hi>Hammersmith (by breach of faith)</hi> For that parenthesis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecteth full upon the Kings Honor, and being written af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter His Majesty hath given (as to me it seemeth) ample and full satisfaction to that fowle charge of the Writer of the speciall Passages, <note n="(a)" place="margin">The same night after the Messengers were gone, certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was brought to us, that the same day the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> had drawn his Forces wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to say the truth, it came into my charge but by accident; for being in generall charged of high Treason, and the impeachment in particular, bearing onely that I had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in warlike manner to the terror of the Kings Subjects, a question was raised by a Lord or two learned in the Law, whether that accusation would amount to Treason or no, and so leave was desired to amend the charge, which being granted to make sure work, by the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. it was put in, that I had levyed War against the King.

               <p>The next misfortune your Lordship insisteth on is, your having been charged in generalll with High-Treason, the impeachment in particular bearing onely, that you had appeared in a warlike manner, to the terror of the Kings Subjects at <hi>Kingstone</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi>: and the amendment of that charge, by putting in that you had levyed War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, upon a question raysed by a Lord, or two, learned in the Law, whether that former accusation would amount to Treason, or no. To this I need to say little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I may well presume that the two Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in some sort interessed in this your Lordships com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, though not of them, yet of the persons trusted by them, will not faile to give convenient satisfaction unto your Lordship, and the world, at the sollicitation of those persons to me unknowne, concerning whom your Lordship thinketh you may, as you doe, put a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether they be so full of Honour, ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or integritie? or so free from passion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, interest, or affection, as they are thought, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of both or either House of Parliament, or any refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the opinion or resolution of either of them? All <hi>I</hi> will, or indeed can say as to the matter above recited is but this, That, whether your Lordp. appeared there with six Coach-horses, or six score horses, whether your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships businesse to that place, where those many Souldiers and Commanders, who waited on their Majesties to <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54970:17"/>But whereas your Lordship complayneth, that the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of these things, were referred to a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of your sharpest enemies, and that the great mistake of six Coach horses turned into six score horses, was not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be rectified by other witnesses there, who affirmed the truth; to these two parts of your Lordships complaint <hi>I</hi> have one Answer to make, which is, that if in them both your Lordp. had any wrong, it ought not to be imputed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to any prevalence of your particular unhappinesse, or to the credit of your enemies, but to be reputed among the common calamities, which may befall any subject of this Kingdom, by reason of the ancient customes thereof, which seem exceeding strange to all strangers that hear of them, among whom <hi>I</hi> have often had much a do to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their fitnesse, and equity; and yet the wisdom of this State hath not hitherto found sufficient cause to alter so ancient constitutions. The one of them is, the manner of naming Committees in Parliament, in which all men see there is exceeding great inequality, and too much left to the care of the Clearke, who hath more power by much therein then any Member of the House of Commons. But how to remedy this without running the hazard of other as great, or greater inconveniencies, it may be, is not so easie to devise, Which notwithstanding <hi>I</hi> have often hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and upon this occasion, do now wish that honourable House, (to whom nothing that can be better ordered by humane prudence is impossible) would take into mature deliberation. The other is that ancient <hi>Maxime</hi> of our Law, <hi>Non accipitur juramentum contra Regem,</hi> by reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if it be rigorously observed (as for ought <hi>I</hi> know it is ever in all tryalls upon life and death in inferiour Courts) the honour, life, and estate of the greatest subject how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent soever may be in danger, if two of the meanest men in the whole Kingdom shall combine so secretly to take it away that there can be no discovery of their conspiracy, whereat strangers use to hold up their hands and blesse themselves. For it seemeth, the Committee above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned had the equity of that rule of Law in their eye for their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54970:17"/>
direction, and that your Lordship had not all the favour shewed you to the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who was allowed to produce witnesses, and crosse examine such as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced against him, and in troth I believe had as much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as was ever shewed to any subject in his case, which is, and will ever be one great justification of the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings against him, whatsoever may break forth in time to shew his innocence. But (my Lord) lesse favour may be shewed to divers persons accused of the same crime with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ingredient of private malice, or revenge to the one of them. And yet he that feeleth the hurt of the difference is under a strong temptation to apprehend those to be his private enemies, whom he observeth to be keen in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, although their consciences may bear them witnesse that they are thereunto moved, onely, and meerly by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick considerations: and in such cases there never want false tale-bearers, who may have told your Lordship many &amp; strange stories of the ill acts us'd by your enemies to bring this afliction upon you; and of their resolution to destroy you, published not in whispers, or in the dark, but by their known tampering with very many persons both by threats and promises to accuse you; and they may have damned themselves if all this be not true. And yet, though I am very confident, that the deepe sence of your afflictions hath had no power to transport you to heigthen the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these imaginary injuries to the least degree beyond the truth of your Lordships belief, there may notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding peradventure be no reall truth in them. Nay (my Lord) it being an observation made by the person of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test experience this day living in <hi>Europe,</hi> that he never knew a spy, that was not a double spy, (which it may be may hold in Tale-bearers also) why is it not possible, that the news of your Lordships treating with the Danes, and other forreign power, of the great Treason plotted and discovered at Sherburn (which I never heard of till now) and of your being at tht head of the Rebells in <hi>Ireland,</hi> may have been at first treated by the same tale-bearers, who have abused your Lordship? if there be good rewards stirring

                  <hi>I</hi> come at last to the last part of your Lordships com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint about your being charged with treason, which is the amendment of the charge by this addition, That you had leavyed war against the King; of which crime, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I verily believe some other persons, not long before accused thereof, could as little suspect themselves guilty, as your Lordship: And yet after that they were not onely suspected of, but charged very loud with so loud a crime, how it came to passe <hi>I</hi> know not, but if <hi>I</hi> do not mistake, the charge slept as long as that against your Lordship, so that in this you have had but equall dealing with others. And as for the amendment of the charge, <hi>I</hi> believe your Lordship may one day find, that your assembling of Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers at <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> (for in those words it is expressed in the third Remonstrance of the Parliament) was understood by the Lords and Commons at that time to be a sufficient discovery of your mind, to engage His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty into a civill war.

As you may also another passage, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose very worthy to be seriously reflected upon by your Lordship, amounting to that on their own part, which my

               <p>And so (my Lord) I am come to your Lordships Letters, which is all that remaineth in your Apologie, of which I have not already given you my account, except it be of your counsell and purpose, as well in the transporting of your self into <hi>Holland,</hi> as in your returne from thence into <hi>England</hi> (which you call the period of your unfortunate story:) Both which will fitly fall in with your Letters, and <hi>I</hi> wish did as well agree with them. But sure they were quite out of your memory, and you could recover no copy of them, when you wrote this passage in your Apologie. <hi>I procured his Majesties Licence to transport a person of so great inconvenience and danger, out of his Dominions, into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Countrey: and with all possible speed removed my selfe into</hi> Holland, <hi>never suspecting that my guilt would increase with my absence, in the retyred private life I had resolved on, and did according to that resolution lead beyond tqe sea.</hi> My Lord, <hi>I</hi> hope it will not offend you to be shewed by your servant, that you are not well hidden under this covert, where you may else chance to be taken by an enemy; In which hope <hi>I</hi> will presume to observe, that it may be well believed, your Lordship resolved on such a retyred private life on the other side of the sea, if things had gone on here by way of Accommodation, to which easiest and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antest way, it appears, your Lordship doubted His Majesty might betake Himselfe. But whether His Majestie shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Himselfe so extreamly tender of the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that He was more a wake to the sense of the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and misery that in all probability was like to befall His good Subjects upon this occasion, then of His own Honor and Dignity, were so well approved of by your Lordship; you know the judgement of the Parliament in their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54970:21"/>
upon your Letters to the Queens Majesty, and I will leave the world to judge. My purpose is only to shew out of them, that your Lordships resolution to lead so retyred a life on the other side, was not absolute, but conditionate, a blind man if he could read your letters must needs plainly see. For you were no sooner arrived at Middleburg in Zealand, but in your first letter from thence to Sir <hi>Lewis Dives,</hi> you make mention of another written from abord Sir <hi>Iohn Pennington,</hi> wherein you gave an account why you thought sitting to continue your journey into <hi>Holland,</hi> going stil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, that if things went on by way of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation the King would be advantaged by your absence: If the King should <hi>declare Himselfe,</hi> and retire to a safe place, you should be able to wait upon him from thence, as well as out of any part of <hi>England,</hi> over and above the service which you might do his Maiesty there in the meane time. In the same letter to Sir <hi>Lewis</hi> from Middleburg you declare, that your purpose to remain in that retired place, and condition, was only till you received instructions from their Maiesties (which sure were not very necessary for your employment in a retired private life) you desire him to hasten your sayd instructions unto you by some safe hand, you desire him to send you a Cypher, of which there could be no great need for your giving him an account how you spent your vacant hours: Or if there were, yet sure that was not the reason, why you besought the <hi>Queens</hi> Maiesty to vouchafe you a Cypher; or why you would not adventure to write to her Maiesty, but by expresses, till such time as you had a Cypher. But why do I wast time and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in making such inferences? In that letter of your Lordships to her Maiesty dated from Middleburg the 21 of January, you shew your selfe indeed very confident that if His Maiesty <hi>after all he had lately done</hi> should betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the easiest and compliantest way of Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you should serve his Maiesty more by your absence, then by all your industry (to which darke expression I will give no light:) But withall you shew, that if the King should betake himselfe to a safe place you should then live in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54970:22"/>
patience, and misery till you wayted on her Maiesty, so short-breath'd was your resolution to lead a private reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red life on that side the Sea. Yet truely how long you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that manner I have not heard: But it should seeme it was not many weeks: for by the tenth of March your Lordship had been so long at the Hague, that you thought your selfe very sufficiently instructed, and able to informe her Maiesty of the state of that place, both in point <hi>of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and interest</hi> (<hi>Quaere</hi> in relation to what) which, considering the many Provinces, and towns, and persons to be enquired after there, before any good judgement could be made of the state of that place in either of the respects above mentioned, and the reservednesse of that Nation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specialy toward strangers, I dare say would have asked some other very busie man three very busie weeks. But God hath given your Lordship much quicknesse of wit, and your great industry and paines in the study of books hath made the study of men a sport to you, in which it is certain, that some man may do more in a day, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another man can do in a yeer. There is therefore no certain inference to be made of the time you had spent at the Hague by the number of talents you had gained there, in comparison of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement might have been made by some other man. But when in your letter to the <hi>Queens</hi> Majesty dated at the Hague before her Majesties coming thither, you say you had not so much as mentioned any businesse to her Majesty since you left <hi>England,</hi> may we not thence lawfully inferre that there was some businesse committed to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, at least, which you might have mentioned to her Majesty? And sure (my Lord) when your Lordship wrote to the Kings Maiesty with that hardinesse, which you thought his affairs and complexion required, though every body knowes your Lordship never had the honour to be a Counsellor, yet I believe most men will believe, that you either presumed to interpose in his Maiesties affairs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being questioned (which you say you never did) or that His Maiesty had entrusted you with some part of his affairs on that side the sea, from whence you wrote; or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54970:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(which is worst for you) that in some affairs then on the Carpet, your Lordship was a very secret, and a principall Counsellor, if his Maiesty sent to <hi>Zealand</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> to demand your good advice about them, having my Lord your father, and so many other able Counsellors at that time not farre from him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>I</hi> will enquire no further what businesse you had, or did beyond the sea, though perhaps it were possible to make an unhappy guesse at it, by the two notes of armes found among your papers. <hi>I</hi> come to your Letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from thence, the falling whereof into hands they were not directed to, <hi>I</hi> shall be very willing to cast up in the number of your misfortunes, so your Lordship will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to put this into your reckning, that no misfortunes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to any man without the speciall providence of God, whose hand many men thinke they see, in making your own an instrument to discover more against you, then, could easily have beene found out otherwise, though the falsehood of a person you trusted, and other accidents were used as meanes to bring this to passe. <hi>I</hi> dare not be so peremptory in my observation, or censure, but leaving the consideration thereof to your Lordship whom it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, crave your leave to say, that these Letters of yours are so full and clear an evidence of your being an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Courtier, and as excellent a Secretary, that I doubt the world wil nere admit your being ill in either, for a good excuse of the faults have been found in some expressions of your Letters. I shall instance but in one, not in respect of the <hi>unworthy</hi> you therein put upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your Countrey (wch not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <hi>I</hi> conceive will be judged by those to whom you appeal, to have been but a wild piece of civillity to asperse a whole Nation, especially your own, with the fault of some few, and this in an addresse to a Lady of so great eminence, and of another Nation not much given to over-value ours) but if that should be suffered to passe for an ill made complement, I beseech your Lordship what good construction can be made of your saying, <hi>it was the first contentment you had been capable of a long time, that Her
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54970:23"/>
Majesty was safely arrived in</hi> Holland, <hi>withdrawn from a Country unworthy of her.</hi> Which that her Maiesty had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not pleasing occasion to do, <hi>I</hi> beleeve was an exceeding great discontentment to many other good Subiects, and good English men, no lesse for her Maiesties sake then their owne, this having beene taken by all men that had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the times, for a shrewd prognostick of the storme which was then gathering, and now lyes so sore upon us, in the foresight whereof <hi>I</hi> hope your Lordship took no contentment, though your words might with little force be wrested to such an interpretation.</p>
               <p>But to passe by other expressions, and come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your Letters, and examine whether any wrong hath been done you in the Glosses and Comments, with which you observe they have been published to the world, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the people how much of the dangerous and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ious Counsells pretended to be then, and still on foot, had passed through your hands, and how great an enemy you are to Parliaments: for these are your words. And you seem to be very sensible of this latter most grievous, and (as you expresse it) venemous imputation. Whereas I find no sillable to that purpose in the Glosse made upon the copy of your Lordships letter to the Queens Maiesty of the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> which is all that ever I have seen pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished with any Glosse, besides those of the 20. and 21. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and I have enquired diligently of some other, who are in a trade of news, and can hear of no other letter of your Lordships published in print. And yet that ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I have observed in your Lordship in many other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, will not suffer me to imagine, that in this you have framed a charge against your selfe, upon such an article as was never put in against you, that from thence you might take an occasion to make such a defence for your selfe, as you conceived would be to your advantage: Such little plots are womens worke, unworthy of a man of your parts, and when they are discovered (as they seldome fayle to be) ever come home with the giving of a shrewd counterbuffe, and therefore I will passe this over.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:54970:23"/>To that of your Lordships having had so great a hand in ill Counsells, which are expressed to be of his Maiesties removing from <hi>London,</hi> to a place of safety, and the like, I will not re-inforce the inferences you say have been made out of your letters by your enemies, because I would not willingly be taken for one of them: But as your humble servant observe two things to your Lordship, which <hi>I</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfe you did not well observe in the writing of this part of your Apology. The first is, that you have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in entered into such a contestation, as <hi>I</hi> beleeve no subiect of this Kingdome before you ever undertooke against the two Houses of Parliament. For they in that Declaration of theirs, wherein they have set forth the Grounds and Reasons that necessitated them to take up <hi>Defensive</hi> arms, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, make mention of the uniust charging of some Members of both Houses with Treason: of the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the House of Commons with a Troop of Cavaliers to fetch those of that House away by force: of the pious and generous resolution of the City of <hi>London</hi> to guard the Parliament, in regard of this greatest violation of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was ever attempted: of certain wicked persons who had engaged the King in the above mentioned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and practise against the Parliament, &amp; of their having been so grieved, and enraged by this action of the City, that thereupon they made his Maiesty forsake WHITE-HALL, under pretence that His Person was there in great danger, which they say is a suggestion as as false, as the father of lyes can invent; And yet your Lordship hath been bold to averre the truth of the danger of His Majesties person was therein; at that time, by avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there were Tumults then, (which the Parliament hath denyed in one of their Declarations) and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship saith you saw them with your eyes; and then by giving three severall in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tances of most dangerous, indeed desperat words spoken in those Tumults against the King, two of which your Lordship saith you heard with your own ears, and the third you say you can prove to have been spoken by a leader of those people, in the heat, and violence of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54970:24"/>
Tumult. His Majesty on the other side in his Declaration of the 12. of <hi>August,</hi> wherein he hath graciously descended to give his Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And your Lordship saith, you have known such Members of both Houses mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by the multitude for blessings, and such for sacrifice. You say, Advertise His Majestie you did, Advise him you could not, you had neither the ability nor the opportunity. But you ask, if you had been a Counsellour, what you had been, if, having seen what you had seen, and heard what you had heard, you should not have advised his Majesty to withdraw to a place of safety, not from his Parliament, but from that insolent and unruly multitude, who had already brought into so much hazard the persons, and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of this till then most happy Parliament; and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>taying there, did so loudly threaten ruine, even to the sacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King; which is a most full averment of one great part of the Kings charge against those, whom his Majestie stileth the Factious part of the Parliament, though not a charging it on the particular persons accused thereof by his Majestie. And whether this being laid to the early knowledge your Lordship had of his Majesties deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether he should betake himself to a safe place, and to the many inferences have been made upon your severall Letters (which I will not repeat) may not amount to a probable Argument, that you had some hand in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of his Maiesties removing from <hi>London</hi>; to a place of safety, and the like, I leave your Lordship, and the world to iudge.</p>
               <p>By this time I apprehend your Lordship may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me to be in the number of your Enemies, because I have been so sharp, and pressing upon you in this last part of your Apologie. Which I have been, with an intention to do your service, by putting you to think, whether you
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54970:24"/>
should do well to lye at this guard, if you should come to be questioned for your lifey; our Lordship may have heard, (if not, my Lord your father can tell you particularly) how the great Oracle of Parliamentary proceedings in his time, Sir <hi>Henry Nevill</hi> by name, lost himselfe in the last he was of, commonly called the Undertakers Parliament. The sum is this, he had done the greatest service to his Countrey, that perhaps was ever done by a private Gentleman in a time of peace, by procuring the Assembling of a Parliament in the time he did, upon the hopes he gave, that the House of Commons might be induced to grant a supply of Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the late King our Soveraign of blessed memory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out questioning his power of imposing, if his Maiesty on his part might be pleased to grant them such and such things upon such and such conditions, which were so much to the advantage of the Subiect, that I doubt we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have the like bargain offered again; yet this great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his, and of other leading men, with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred about it, having been decryed in that Parliament under the title of undertaking, he suffered that mis-conceit to prevail so far in the House, before he tooke the courage to avow what he had done, and (as <hi>I</hi> have heard from wise men) might have had thanks for doing in the fair way he did it, that through that default onely, and for no other fault, he forfeited the great credit he had in the House be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and occasioned an untimely, and most unhappy disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of that Parliament. It may be the like adventure hath befallen as wise a man in a tryall for his life. But <hi>I</hi> will give no more examples, nor make any other then this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall application, That which hath happened once or twice, may have hapned thrice, and may happen a fourth time. And yet why should <hi>I</hi> hold my self thus in the clouds, I will adventure to descend to a particular confession, that my selfe among many thousand other of the Kings loyall subiects, have been exceedingly offended with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for having had so deep a hand, as hath been seen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your own, in the ill advise of his Maiesties removing so far from the Parliament: for distance of place doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally

induce a proportionable distance in affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the best friends, if the time of absence be not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefully entertained with all possible meanes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their amity at the height; but if there were any jarre between them before, and they come to wrangle about that by letters, it is almost impossible to prevent an utter breach between them, though they be men of the best tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered spirits: Besides this, it hath ever been my simple o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that if His Maiesty after his returne from <hi>Dover</hi> had given over all thoughts of retiring to <hi>Yorke,</hi> and gone di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>London,</hi> he might have been able to have quite broken the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g combinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; conspiracies his Maiesty sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth were made against him, into so many pieces by his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence, and the help of his Nobles, and of those many generous persons in the House of Commons, who would have lent willing hands to so needfull a work, that it could not have been in the power of the Devil himself to repiece the poor wormes so dissevered, for the best among them would have been found no other, if he had once lifted up his head against the King his Soveraign; But my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the unadvisednesse of the advise given his Maiesty to quit his Saddle, having been founded on the confident beleef I ever had that his sacred Person was in no danger by those foolish disorderly friskes of the unmannaged rude people of his Royall City, till <hi>I</hi> saw your Lordships Apology, (His Maiesties Declaration conteyning nothing but generalls to that purpose:) I am now quite out of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience that the particulars I therein find to the contrary, should have been kept up so long, to the infinite preiudice of his Maiesties service, of his good peoples quiet, and of your Lordships honor, who certainly need not have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed your knowledge so long, nor have now made so dainty of owning the advise given his Maiesty to retire to a safe place if there were so iust a cause of fear, that His Maiesties life, which is of more worth then ten thousand of ours, might have been in danger in the tumults at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> But now <hi>I</hi> find <hi>I</hi> can proceed no further in doing your Lordship that service, which (<hi>I</hi> hope you see) <hi>I</hi> have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54970:25"/>
hitherto endeavoured, without taking notice to you of a thing, of which I perceive you have studiously decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the mention; and which <hi>I</hi> should be as unwilling to touch as you, it being the head of that bile, which putteth you to the greatest pain you are in, if the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were not in as much upon the same occasion. In which respect <hi>I</hi> am resolved to put a launcet into it, when <hi>I</hi> have first most humbly prayed God upon my knees that my so doing may, through his blessing, be to the ease of his Majesty, of your Lordship, and of us all, and not to the hurt of any body; which (he is my witnesse) is my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and onely intention, if <hi>I</hi> know my own heart. Which, that your Lordship may not thinke I resolve on imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently before the time, I must first shew you how farre the matter is prepared. It cannot be unknowne to your Lordship, though in your Apology you seem to make your selfe ignorant, that common fame hath from the beginning accused you to have bin the suggestor to his Majesty of the accusation put in by his Atturney against the Lord <hi>Kimbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the five worthy Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: Or if it be possible this should have been kept from your ears, which hath certainly been the voyce of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for about a yeer, your Lordship may finde so much, in expresse termes in the publick intelligence of two weeks of this January with this addition, that you were the Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of his Majesty to come in person to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in a hostile manner with four hundred armed men upon the fourth of January last: To which it may be thought your Lordship had some reference by making the fourth of this January the date of the publication of your Apology. But (my Lord) this darke intimation, which it may be you may expound in that manner in time to come, doth not, cannot serve your turne at the present. For the plain truth is (<hi>I</hi> tell it you for your service, and hope you will take it so) you may as well rayse a dead man out of his grave, as rayse your selfe, or your repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the hate and infamy, under which you, and it lye, by any thing you can say or do, or all your friends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your Lordship, for your owning of the suggestion, upon which the Members of both Houses were impeached of Treason, before your being impeached of the same crime, had preserved your estate, life, and honour from that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and your reputation from that stain, which it got by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54970:26"/>
this mishap, and which will be exceeding hard to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out. The Kingdome, which to my understanding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in so miserable an estate since the last Conquest, as at this present, and into this so lamentable an estate (let me write it without offence till you have read my reason) <hi>I</hi> conceive it is fallen meerly and wholly by this omission of your Lordships, if you were the secret Accuser of those your brethren. For they are all wise enough to know, that no man legally accused, can ever be cleared in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation without being acquitted from the crime layd to his charge in a faire legall Triall. And this certain danger would undoubtedly have been of so much more regard to men of untainted fame, then the hazard the most innocent persons may possibly run through false witnesses, or a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Jury, that in that respect no doubt they would have desired to have been brought to such a Triall, which it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth was intended by his Majestie: Neither could they, if they would, have avoided it, by pretence of priviledge of Parliament, if any part of their accusation legally char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on them had been such as may now seem to be insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in your Lordships Apology, or as some of the Articles preferred against them do import, if I do not misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them. For the Lords and Commons this very Parliament in their Petition to his Maiesty delivered the sixteenth of <hi>Iuly</hi> following, desired no more, but that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done; or spoken in Parliament, or by any Person in pursuance of the Commands, and Directions of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that upon the whole matter, I humbly conceive; that, supposing your Lordship to have been the Accuser of the six Members of

For, since his Majestie, out of his Princely desire of the continuance of the Peace of his People, was gratiously pleased to have wholly deserted any prosecution of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused Members, and since his Honour would (as I humbly conceive) have been as well saved by the producing, as it was by the suppressing of the particular suggestions against them, though they should have been acquitted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is not easie to imagine any sufficient cause, why his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They either could, or would have done no more but accuse you, and if Traitors had so great a sway among them, their accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have had the lesse credit either with the Lords or with the World. Was it in the House of Peers? I know your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship will not say, that was your intendment, for if you should, it might much aggravate your fault, no way excuse your declining their judiciall sentence, it being notoriously knowne, that some time after your Lordship went out of <hi>England,</hi> the resolution of the House of Peers was not wholly guided by that of the House of Commons (witnesse the two offers at the <hi>Militia</hi> before that Ordinance passed in both Houses; and His Mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

great wonders in his Raign. My Lord your father is an example in the very point. And the Kings heart is still in the same hand, that turned it towards him after as great an aversation. And if your Lordship once find this great block that lyeth in the way of the peace of the Kingdom begin to stir, then put all your own, and your friends strength to it. Have no doubt that you shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the like favour from the accused Members, though you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver convey to them the least knowledge of that you have done in their behalfe. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath observed, that when a mans wayes please the Lord, he maketh his enemies to be at peace with him.

               <p>In Master <hi>Eliots</hi> Letter it may be first observed, That whilest His Majesty contests with His Parliament for some questionable Prerogatives concerning the Common-wealth, His own servants do really deprive him of an undoubted Prerogative, of being the Soveraigne disposer of favours and preferments in His own Family, which this Gentleman doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse in that resolution, never to have any place about His Majesty, but by the Queen, and may be further observed what these desperate Counsels about the King are most afraid of, and what they think most hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By these two Notes may be observed, that at the time whilest so many Declarations were published in His Majesties Name, with solemne Protestations of His Majesties intentions of raising onely a Guard for His own Person, all sorts of Provision for an Army were made beyond the seas, and this poore Kingdom designed to the misery and confusion of war, and under the disguise of defending the Protestant profession, an Army to be raised in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these wicked Counsellors, for the suppressing and destruction of the Protestant Religion.</p>

               <p>TO give my self the honor of becoming your Lordships Gentleman-Vsher in the way of retractation, I shall not blush freely here to confesse that when I made that mine Answer to your Lordships Speech to the Bill of Attainder, I had not observed that the breach of the Sabbath among the <hi>Iews</hi> was punishable by death by any Command of God, before that which was given upon the occasion of the gatherer of sticks, which was a manifest ignorance in me. For Exod. 31. 14. we find these words, <hi>Ye shall keepe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath for it is holy unto you, every one that defiles it shall surely be put to death,</hi> for whosoever doth any worke therein that soul <hi>shal be cut off from among his People.</hi> Whereby it seemeth that the question about the stick-gatherer was in the regard of the lightnesse of the work he had done; or of some other occasion now unknown to us, but that makes no difference in the case, in respect of the use I made of the example. And upon this occasion I cannot forbear to observe, that the gross<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
