            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Whereof no better exemplarie rule can be made, then the late apparant teſtimonie of Londons Loue to Royall Prince Henrie, appointed by our dread Soueraigne his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be created Prince of Wales, and Earle of Cheſter, euen now in the aſſembly of the high Court of Parliament: that he might be the twelfte Prince in that Royall creation, ſucceeding thoſe eleuen ſo long ſince paſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:4170:5"/>For our Chronicles and Recordes doe name but eleuen, that (ſince the Conqueſt) were Princes of Wales. Whereof the firſt was Edward, Sonne to King Henrie the third, who afterward was King Edward the firſt, he was created Prince at London.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was Edward his Sonne, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo afterward King Edward the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and he had his creation at London likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Edward his Sonne being after that King Edward the third: but he had his creation at <hi>Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Edward, ſurnamed the Blacke Prince, who was Sonne to King Edward the third, that conquered <hi>France,</hi> and quartered their Armes with ours: he alſo was created at London.</p>
            <p>The fift was King Richard the ſecond

Sonne to that worthie warriour the Black Prince, who liued not to enioy the Crowne: he had his creation at <hi>Hauering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſixt was Henrie the fift, eldeſt Sonne to King Henrie the fourth, and he had his creation at London.</p>
            <p>The ſeauenth, was Edward the Sonne of King Henrie the ſixt, whoſe creation I read to be at <hi>Reading.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eight was Edward, the Sonne of King Edward the fourth, afterward called Edward the fift, neuer crowned, but made away by his cruell vnckle Richard the third: he was alſo created at London.</p>
            <p>The ninth, was Edward, Sonne to King Richard the third, created at London alſo,.</p>
            <p>The tenth was Prince Arthur, Sonne to

King Henrie the ſeauenth, who deceaſsing, his brother Henrie (afterward King Henrie the eight) who was made the eleuenth, was alſo created Prince of Wales, and bothe of them at London.</p>
            <p>All theſe fore-named Princes of Wales, were created ſollemnely, by and in the Court of Parliament; except three, which were Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard the ſecond, Edward the fift, &amp; Edward the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of Richard the third. And thoſe that were created out of Parliament, were Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of hard and diſaſter fortune: For Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard the ſecond was depoſed: Edward the fifte murdered, and Richard the third, his Sonne dyed with in three moneths after, as a iuſt iudgement of God for his Fathers wickednes.</p>
            <p>But now our Royall Henrie comming to be the twelfth Prince in this great dignitie, and Londons cheefe Magiſtrate the Lord

            <p>Wherfore, vpon Thurſday, being the laſt day of May, about eight of the clocke in the morning, all the worſhipfull Companies of the Cittie, were readie in their Bardges vpon the water, with their Streamers and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes gloriouſly diſplayed, Drommes, Trumpets, Fifes and other Muſickes atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on them, to awaite the Lord Maior and Aldermens comming.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had his Honor and the reſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Bardge, but on they rowed, with ſuch a chearefull noyſe of Hermonie, and ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4170:7"/>
goodlie a ſhewe in order and equipage; as made the beholders and hearers not meanely delighted; beſide a peale of Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that welcomde them as they entred on the water.</p>
            <p>To beautifie ſo ſumptuous a ſhewe, and to grace the day with more matter of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe, it ſeemd that <hi>Neptune</hi> ſmyled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on auſpitiouſlie, and would not ſuffer ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Citties affection, to goe vnfurniſhed of ſome fauour from him: eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Metropolis and cheife honor of the Iſland, whereunto him ſelfe euer bare ſuch endeared affection.</p>
            <p>For, according to the affirmation of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius de Viterbo, Diodorus Siculus, Higginus,</hi> and <hi>Pictonius, Neptune</hi> being called King, or God of the Seas, had by his Queene <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitrita</hi> diuers Children,<note place="margin">Script.

            </p>
            <p>Now it is not without good reaſon to be imagined, that in meere loue to his ſonnes memorie, and for his auncient affection to this Iſland; no bleſſednes at any time can befall it, but it ſhall receiue ſome eſpeciall and regardful noate of his fauour. But more eſpecially at this time, when Heauen, Earth, Sea, and all had enterlaced loue together, to honor the generall reioycing, for ſo fayre a fortune, ſo royall a hope, and a Prince of ſo vnuſuall ſtraine or expectation.</p>

               <p>Vpon the Sunday following, fiue and twentie Knights of the Bathe were made by his Maieſtie, in honor of the Prince his Sonne, and they all rode in their apte habits, with their Squires and Pages, from <hi>Durham</hi> houſe to White Hall, to their no little praiſe and commendation.</p>
               <p>On the Monday, the King and all the Nobilitie, going by water from the Courte to Weſtminſter; in the Courte of Requeſts (which then was reputed as the Parliament houſe) the Prince had his creation of Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Rotchſaye,</hi> Earle of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and Knight of the moſte noble Order of the

               <p>In the euening of the ſame day, it was expected that the water Fight &amp; Fire workes ſhould haue bin perfourmed, no meane multitude of people attending to ſee it· But whether by the violent ſtorme of rayne, or other appointment of his maieſtie, I knowe not (albeit <hi>Protheus</hi> mounted on a Sea Monſter, had deliuered the intent of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to his Highneſſe) yet was it deferred till the Wedneſday following.</p>
               <p>Vpon which day, after a moſte Royall and ſumptuous Tilting, the water fight was worthilie perfourmed, and by ſuch reporte as was thereof made to me, thus it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:4170:15"/>A Turkiſhe Pirate prowling on the Seas, to maintaine a Turkiſhe Caſtle (for ſo their Armes and Streamers deſcribed them both to be) by his ſpoyle &amp; rapine, of Merchants, and other Paſſengers; ſculking abroade to finde a bootie: he deſcried two Merchants Shippes, the one whereof bearing to winde ſomewhat before her fellowe, made the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wafte her to ſtrike ſayle and come in, which the Merchant either not regarding, or no way fearing, rode ſtill boldely on. The Pirate with drawen weapons and other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, wafts her againe to vayle her bonnet, but the Merchant ſtill refuſing: the Pirate ſends a commanding ſhott, which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant anſwered againe, encouraged therto by her fellowe Merchant, who by this time was come neere her, and ſpake in like lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage with her to the Pirate. When he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his hope defeated, and this bolde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance returned; he ſent ſhot vpon ſhot very fiercely, wherto they replyed as reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4170:15"/>
ſo that betweene them grewe a verie fierce &amp; dangerous fight. Wherein the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts wexing to be ſomewhat diſtreſſed (by reaſon that the Caſtle likewiſe often played vpon them) two men of warre happening then to be neere, made in to helpe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue their hard detriment.</p>
               <p>And now the fighte grewe on all ſides to be fierce indeed, the Caſtle aſsiſting the Pirate very hotly, and the other withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brauely and couragiouſly: diuers men appearing on either ſide to be ſlayne, and hurlled ouer into the Sea, as in ſuch aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it often comes to paſſe, where ſuch ſharpe aſſaultes are vſed indeed.</p>
               <p>In concluſion, the Merchants and men of warre, after a long and well fought skirmiſh, prooued too ſtrong for the Pirate, they ſpoylde bothe him, and blewe vp the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ending the whole batterie with verie rare and admirable Fire-workes, as alſo a worthie peale of Chambers.</p>
