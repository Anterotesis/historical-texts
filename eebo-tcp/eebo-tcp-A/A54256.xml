            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>FOR THE PREACHERS and LEADERS of the People called QUAKERS.</head>
            <p>YOUR Day into <hi>Darkneſs</hi> is turned; the Sun is gone down over you: You have had a large Day and Power given you, to have done the Will of GOD; but you have abuſed the Power, and ſlighted your Day, and have refuſed to do the LORD's Work, and have ſought your Selves, and not the LORD; Therefore in Juſtice and Righteouſneſs is the Day, wherein you might have wrought for GOD, taken from you, and the thick <hi>Dark Night</hi> of Confuſion is come upon you, wherein you are groping, and ſtumbling, and cannot work: The <hi>DECREE</hi> is gone out, and ſealed againſt you; and it cannot be recalled. You are not the Men (as ye ſtand) in whom GOD will appear to work Deliverance for His People, (and yet Deliverance ſhall come [but not according to Mans expectation]); but as for You, ye have rejected the Counſel of the LORD, and grieved His Spirit, and He hath long born you; yea, You are departed from the LORD, and His Preſence is departed from You: Indeed He hath <hi>hewed</hi> with You, (and if you had been faithful to the End, He would have <hi>honoured</hi> and <hi>proſpered</hi> You, and have been your ſufficient Reward): Ye were His <hi>AX,</hi> but you have boaſted your ſelves againſt Him: Therefore as you have <hi>hewed</hi> and <hi>broken</hi> others, even ſo muſt You be <hi>bewed</hi> and <hi>broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O ye <hi>Treacherous, Wilful, Proud, Self-ſeeking</hi> People! who have deſpiſed the Counſel of the LORD, and would not take warning, though He hath ſent His Servants among you, <hi>ſome of</hi> whom you have diſpitefully uſed; What will ye do now? Whom will you now flee unto for help? Seeing you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the LORD, [and are now rending and tearing, biting and devouring one another, for proud Ambitious, Self-ends. (Mark!) If you would now build again the thing that you once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that ſhall not be able to hide, or ſhelter you from the Wrath of the Lamb; that way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you think to ſtrengthen your ſelves, thereby ſhall you make your ſelves much weaker, and help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your own deſtruction]. Remember your End, which haſtens greatly; <hi>Breach</hi> upon <hi>Breach, Diviſion</hi> upon <hi>Diviſion</hi> ſhall there be, until HE come to Reign whoſe Right it is.</p>
            <p>They that truſt in, or lean upon You for help, it is as if they leaned upon a <hi>broken Keed</hi> which is not able to help it ſelf nor others. You have been made to do many good things, but you would not go through with the Work which GOD will have accompliſhed, and therefore are theſe things come upon you. Therefore <hi>tremble</hi> and <hi>dread</hi> before the LORD, Ye who have been as ſtrong Oaks, and tall Cedars; for now ſhall your Strength fail you, and you ſhall be weak, even as the weakeſt of Men: But if you would yet ſubmit to GOD's righteous Judgments, you might come to witneſs your Souls ſaved in the DAY of the LORD; though many are to be thrown by (becauſe of grievous Backſlidings) as not counted worthy to be the LORD's Workmen.</p>
            <p>There is a ſmall Remnant yet among you (for whom my Soul breaths) who may be winnowed out; and if they will own the Judgments of the LORD, and truly and throughly deny themſelves, and follow His Leadings, He will heal their Backſlidings; but they that will continue with you in your <hi>Sins,</hi> ſhall partake with you of your <hi>Iudgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The foregoing Words (excepting the Title) were writ [by another] to the former</hi> Rulers [1659] <hi>upon whom they were fulfilled; and ſo as certainly ſhall they be fulfilled upon you.</hi>
