            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The conſideration heereof hath now moued me to expone a Caſe vnto you, which doeth not ſo neerely touch mee in my particular, as it doeth open a breach againſt our authoritie, (I ſpeake in the plurall of all Kings) and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge in generall. And ſince not onely all rankes and ſorts of people in all Nations doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolably obſerue this <hi>Maxime,</hi> but euen the Ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uill Law, by which the greateſt part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is gouerned, doeth giue them an intereſt,

As for this <hi>Apologie</hi> of mine, it is true, that I thought good to ſet it firſt out without putting my name vnto it; but neuer ſo, as I thought to deny it, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring well mine owne words, but taken out of the Scripture, in the beginning of the Preface to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:24995:5"/>
Reader, in my <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo hid, which ſhall not bee opened, &amp;c:</hi> promiſing there, which with <hi>GOD</hi> his grace I ſhall euer performe, neuer to doe that in ſecret, which I ſhall need to be aſhamed of, when it ſhall come to be proclaimed in publique.</p>
                  <p>In deed I thought it fit, for two respects, that this my <hi>Apologie</hi> ſhould firſt viſite the world without hauing my name written in the forehead thereof. Firſt becauſe of the <hi>matter,</hi> and next of the <hi>perſons</hi> that I medled with. The <hi>matter,</hi> it being a <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> which I was to write, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning reaſons &amp; diſcourſes in <hi>Diuinity</hi> for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> and refutation of the condemners therof; I thought it not comely for one of my place, to put my name to books con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſcholaſtick <hi>Diſputations;</hi> whoſe calling is to ſet forth <hi>Decrees</hi> in the Imparatiue moode: for I thinke my ſelfe as good a man as the Pope, by his reuerence, for whom theſe my Anſwerers make the like excuſe; for that his <hi>Breues</hi> are ſo ſummary without yeelding any reaſon vnto them. My next reaſon was the respect of the <hi>perſons</hi> whom with I meddled: Wherein, although I ſhortly anſwered the Popes <hi>Breues;</hi> yet the point.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:24995:5"/>
I most laboured, being the refutation of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> Letter, I was neuer the man, I confeſse, that could thinke a <hi>Cardinall</hi> a meet match for a <hi>King:</hi> eſpecially, hauing many hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of my ſubiects of as good birth as he. As for his Church dignitie, his <hi>Cardinalſhip</hi> I meane, I know not how to ranke or value it, either by the warrant of God his word, or by the ordinance of <hi>Emperours</hi> or <hi>Kings</hi>; it being indeed onely a new <hi>Papall</hi> erection, tolerated by the ſleeping conniuence of our <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> (I meane ſtill by the plurall of Kings.) But notwithſtanding of this my forbearing to put my name vnto it, ſome <hi>Embaſſadours</hi> of ſome of you (my louing <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Coſins</hi>) whome this cauſe did neereliest concerne, can witneſſe, that I made Preſents of ſome of thoſe bookes, at their firſt printing, vnto them, and that auowedly in my owne name. As alſo the Engliſh <hi>Paragraphiſt,</hi> or rather peruerſe Pamphleter <hi>Parſons,</hi> ſince all his deſciption muſt runne vpon a <hi>P.</hi> hath truely obſerued, that my Armes are affixed in the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpice thereof, which vſeth not to bee in bookes of other mens doing; whereby his malice in pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tending his ignorance, that he might pay me the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:24995:6"/>
ſoundlier, is the more inexcuſable. But now that I find my ſparing to put my name vnto it hath not procured my ſparing by theſe anſwerers, who haue neither ſpared my Perſon directly in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming me, nor indirectly by railing vpon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Booke: it is now high time for me no longer to conceale nor diſauow my ſelfe, as if I were aſhamed of my owne deed. And therefore that yee may the better vnderſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the cauſe, I will begin at the firſt ground thereof.</p>
                  <p>The neuer ynough wondered at and abhorred <hi>POVVDER-TREASON</hi> (though the repetition thereof grieueth, I know, the gentle hearted Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite <hi>Parſons</hi>) this Treaſon, I ſay, being not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended againſt me and my Poſteritie, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt the whole houſe of Parliament, plot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted only by Papiſts, and they onely led thereto by a preposterous zeal for the aduancement of their Religion; ſome of them continuing ſo obſtinate, that euen at their death they would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their fault; but in their laſt words, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly before the expiring of their breath, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to condemne themſelues &amp; craue pardon for their deed, except the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:24995:6"/>
firſt condemne it; And ſoone after, it being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, that a great number of my Popiſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of all rankes and ſexes, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as well within as without the Countrey; had a confuſed notion and an obſcure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſome great thing was to be done in that Parliament for the weale of the Church; although, for ſecrecies cauſe, they were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the particulars; certaine formes of prayer hauing likewiſe bin ſet down and vſed for the good ſucceſſe of that great errand; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereunto, that diuers times, and from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Prieſts, the Arch-traitors themſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Sacrament for confirmation of their heart, and obſeruation of ſecrecie; Some of the principall <hi>Ieſuits</hi> likewiſe being found guiltie of the foreknowledge of the Treaſon it ſelfe; of which number ſome fled from their triall, others were apprehended (as holy <hi>Gamet</hi> himſelfe and <hi>Ouldcorne</hi> were) and iuſtly executed vpon their owne plaine confeſsion of their guilt: If this Treaſon now, clad with theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, did not miniſter a iuſt occaſion to that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament houſe, whom they thought to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, couragiouſly and zealouſly at their next
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:24995:7"/>
ſitting downe, to vſe all meanes of trial, whether any more of that mind were yet left in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; I leaue it to you to iudge, whom God hath appoynted his highest Depute-Iudges vpon earth: And amongst other things for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, This <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> ſo vniuſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, was then deuiſed and enacted. And in caſe any ſharper Lawes were then made againſt the Papiſts that were not obedient to the former Lawes of the Countrey; if ye will conſider the <hi>time, place,</hi> and <hi>perſons,</hi> it will bee thought no wonder, ſeeing that occaſion did ſo iuſtly exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them to make ſeuerer Lawes then otherwiſe they would haue done. The <hi>time,</hi> I ſay, being the very next ſitting downe of the Parliament, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diſcouerie of that abominable Treaſon: the <hi>place</hi> beeing the ſame, where they ſhould all haue bene blowen vp, and ſo bringing it freſhly to their memorie againe: the <hi>perſons</hi> being thoſe very Parliament men whom they thought to haue deſtroyed. And yet ſo far hath both my heart and gouernment beene from any bitternes, as almoſt neuer one of thoſe ſharpe additions to the former Lawes haue euer yet beene put in execution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:24995:7"/>And that ye may yet know further for the more conuincing theſe Libellers of wilfull malice, who impudently affirme, That this <hi>Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ance</hi> was deuiſed for deceiuing and intrapping of Papiſts in points of conſcience; The truth is, that the Lower houſe of Parliament at the firſt framing of this Oath, made it to containe, That the Pope had no power to excommunicate me; which I cauſed them to reforme; onely making it to conclude, That no excommunication of the Popes can warrant my Subiects to practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Perſon or State; denying the depoſition of Kings to be in the Popes lawfull power, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I take any ſuch temporall violence to bee farre without the limits of ſuch a Spirituall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as excommunication is. So carefull was I that nothing ſhould be contained in this Oath, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the profeſsion of natural Allegiance, &amp; ciuill and temporall obedience, with a prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Oath now grounded vpon ſo great and iuſt an occaſion, ſet forth in ſo reaſonable termes, and ordeined onely for making of a true diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betweene Papiſts of quiet dispoſition, and in all other things good Subiects, and ſuch other
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:24995:8"/>
Papiſts as in their hearts maintained the like violent bloody <hi>Maximes,</hi> that the Powder-trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did: This Oath, I ſay, being publiſhed and put in practiſe, bred ſuch euill blood in the Popes head and his Cleargie, as <hi>Breue</hi> after <hi>Breue</hi> commeth forth, <hi>vt vndam vnda ſequitur;</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting all Catholiques from taking the ſame, as a thing cleane contrary to the Catholicke faith; and that the taking thereof cannot ſtand with the ſaluation of their ſoules.</p>
                  <p>There commeth likewiſe a letter of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> to <hi>Blackwell</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; but diſcourſing more at length vpon the ſayd Oath. Whereupon, after I had entred in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their vniuſt impugning that ſo iuſt and lawfull an Oath; and fearing that by their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true calumnies and Sophiſtrie the hearts of a number of the moſt ſimple and ignorant of my people ſhould be miſ-led, vnder that faire and deceitfull cloake of conſcience; I thought good to ſet foorth an <hi>Apologie</hi> for the ſaid Oath: wherin I proued, that as this Oath contained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but matter of ciuill and temporall Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, due by Subiects to their Soueraigne Prince: ſo this quarrelling therewith was nothing but a

late vſurpation of Popes (againſt the warrant of all Scriptures, ancient Counſels and Fathers) vpon the temporall power of Kings, where with onely my <hi>Apologie</hi> doth meddle. But the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of this Booke of mine hath brought ſuch two Anſwerers, or rather Raylers vpon me, as all the world may wonder at. For my Booke beeing firſt written in Engliſh, an Engliſh Oath beeing the ſubiect thereof, and the vſe of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to my ſubiects of <hi>England</hi>; and immediatly thereafter being tranſlated into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, vpon a deſire that ſome had of further pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it abroad it commeth home vnto me now anſwered in both the Languages. And, I thinke, if it had beene ſet forth in all the tongues that were at the confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> it would haue beene returned anſwered in them all againe. Thus may a man ſee how buſie a Biſhop the Deuill is, and how he omitteth no diligence for venting of his poiſoned wares. But herein their malice doth cleerely appeare, that they pay me ſo quickly with a double anſwere; and yet haue neuer anſwered their owne Arch-prieſt, who hath written a booke for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſame Oath, and of the temporall authoritie of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:24995:9"/>
Kings, alledging a cloud of their owne Scoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men againſt them.</p>
                  <p>As for the Engliſh <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> my vnnaturall and fugitiue Subiect; I will neither defile my pen, nor your ſacred eies or eares with the deſcribing of him, who aſhames, nay, abhorres not to rayle, nay, to rage and ſpewe forth blaſphemies againſt the late <hi>Queene</hi> of famous memorie. A Subiect to raile againſt his naturall <hi>Soueraigne</hi> by birth; A man to rayle againſt a Lady by ſexe; A holy man (in outward profeſsion) to inſult vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dead; nay, to take <hi>Radamanthus</hi> office ouer his head, and to ſit downe and play the Iudge in hell; And all his quarrell is, that either her <hi>Succeſſour,</hi> or any of her Seruants ſhould ſpeake honourably of her. Curſed be he that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Anointed of God: and deſtroyed mought he be with the deſtruction of <hi>Korah,</hi> that hath ſinned in the contradiction of <hi>Korah.</hi> Without mought ſuch dogs and ſwine be, caſt forth, I ſay, out of the ſpirituall <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for my Latine <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> I haue nothing to ſay to his perſon; he is not my Subiect; he stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or falleth vnto his owne Lord: But ſure I am, they two haue caſten lots vpon my Booke,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:24995:9"/>
ſince they could not diuide it: the one of them, my fugitiue, to rayle vpon my late Predeceſſor, (but a rope is the fitteſt anſwere for ſuch an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian;) the other, a ſtranger, thinketh he may be boldeſt both to pay my perſon and my booke, as indeed hee doth; which how iustly either in matter or maner, we are now to examine.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, who ſhould be the true Authour of this booke, I can but gueſſe.

                  <p>And now to come to his <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of Anſwere: Surely if there were no more but his vnmannerly <hi>manner,</hi> it is enough to diſgrace the whole matter thereof.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:24995:10"/>
an Engliſh booke, that lacketh the name of an Authour: as if a perſonated obſcure name for Auhour of a <hi>Cardinals</hi> booke, were a meet match for anſwering a <hi>Kings</hi> booke, that lacketh the name of an Authour; and a <hi>Cardinals</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine to meete with the <hi>Deane</hi> of the <hi>Kings Chappell,</hi> whome <hi>Parſons</hi> with the <hi>Cardinall</hi> haue (as it ſeemeth) agreed vpon to intitle to bee the Authour of my <hi>Apologie.</hi> And not onely in the Preface, but alſo through the whole Booke doeth he keepe this comparatiue greatneſſe. He muſt bee as ſhort in his anſwere, as I am in my booke, he must refute all that I haue ſaid againſt the Popes ſecond <hi>Breue,</hi> with equall breuity, and vpon one page almost, as I haue done mine: and becauſe I haue ſet downe the ſubſtance of the Oath in <hi>14.</hi> Articles in iuſt as many Articles muſt he ſet downe that Acte of <hi>Parliament</hi> of mine, wherein the Oath is contained: And yet, had hee contented himſelfe with his owne pride, by the demonstration of his owne greatneſſe, without further wronging of me, it had bene the more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And as for the <hi>matter</hi> of his booke, it well fits indeed the <hi>manner</hi> thereof: for he neuer anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth directly to the maine queſtion in my booke. For whereas my <hi>Apologie</hi> handleth onely two points, as I told you before; One, to proue that the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> doeth onely meddle with the ciuil and temporal obedience, due by Subiects to their naturall Soueraignes; The other, that this late vſurpation of Popes ouer the temporall power of Princes, is againſt the rule of all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ancient Councels and Fathers: hee neuer improoues the firſt, but by a falſe inference; that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:24995:12"/>
the Oath denieth the Popes power of excommu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nication directly, ſince it denyeth his authoritie in depoſing of Kings.

For ſaith hee, although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med generally, that Church-men were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to earthly Kings; yet did he not inſert that particular clauſe <hi>[though they were borne and dwelling in their dominions]</hi> as if the words of Church-men and earthly Kings in generall imported not as much: for Layicks as well as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:24995:13"/>
Church-men are ſubiect to none but to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <hi>Soueraigne.</hi> And yet doeth he not ſticke to confeſse that he meant it, though it was not fit (he ſaith) to be expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>And thus quarrels hee me for reuealing his Printed ſecret. But whoſe hatred did he feare in this? was it not yours? Who haue interest, but <hi>KINGS,</hi> in the withdrawing of true Subiection from Kings? And when the greatest Monarchs amongſt you will remember, that almost the third part of your Subiects and of your Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, is Church-men and Church-liuings; I hope, yee will then conſider and weigh, what a feather hee puls out of your wings, when he denu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth you of ſo many Subiects and their poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the Popes fauour: nay, what bryers and thornes are left within the heart of your Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, when ſo populous and potent a partie ſhall haue their birth, education and liuelyhood in your Countries, and yet owe you no Subiection, nor acknowledge you for their <hi>SOVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAIGNES</hi>? So as where the Church-men of old were content with their tythe of euery mans goods; the Pope now will haue little leſſe then the third part of euery Kings <hi>Subiects</hi> and <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:24995:14"/>
And as in this place ſo throughout all the reſt of his booke, hee doeth nothing but ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Popes power ouer Kings, and exaggerate my vnreaſonable rigour for preſsing this Oath; which he will needes haue to bee nothing but a renewed Oath of <hi>Supremacie</hi> in more ſubtill and craftie termes onely to robbe the Pope of his <hi>Primacie</hi> and ſpirituall power: making his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power and authoritie ouer Princes, to bee one of the chiefe <hi>ARTICLES</hi> of the Catholike faith.</p>
                  <p>But that it may the better appeare vnto you, that all my labour and intention in this errand, was onely to meddle with that due temporall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which my Subiects owe vnto mee; and not to entrap nor inthrall their Conſciences, as he moſt falſly affirmes: Ye ſhall firſt ſee how farre other Godly and Christian <hi>Emperours</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> were from acknowledging the Popes tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall <hi>Supremacie</hi> ouer them; nay, haue created, controlled and depoſed Popes: and next, what a number of my <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> in this Kingdome haue at al occaſions, euen in the times of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Greatneſse of <hi>Popes,</hi> reſiſted and plainely withſtood them in this part.</p>

                  <p>So as my Predeceſſours (ye ſee) of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> euen when the <hi>Popes</hi> triumphed in their greatnes, ſpared not to puniſh any of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, that would preferre the <hi>Popes</hi> obedience to theirs euen in Church matters: So farre were they then from either acknowledging the <hi>Pope</hi> for their temporal Superior, or yet from doubting that their owne Church-men were not their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. And now I will cloſe vp all theſe examples with an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> in King <hi>Richard 2.</hi> his time; whereby it was prohibited, That none ſhould procure a <hi>Benefice</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder paine to be put out of the Kings protection.

                  <p>By theſe few examples now (I hope) I haue ſufficiently cleared my ſelfe from the imputation, that any ambition or deſire of Noueltie in mee ſhould haue ſtirred me, either to robbe the <hi>Pope</hi> of any thing due vnto him, or to aſſume vnto

Neither is it enough to ſay (as <hi>Parſons</hi> doeth in his anſwere to the <hi>Lord Cooke</hi>) That farre more Kings of this Countrey haue giuen many more examples of acknowledging, or not reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the <hi>Popes</hi> vſurped Authoritie; ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance lacking the occaſion, and ſome the abilitie of reſiſting them: for euen by the ciuill Law, in the caſe of violent intruſion and long and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full poſſeſsion against mee, it is enough if I proue that I haue made lawfull interruption vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient occaſions.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Cardinall</hi> thinkes the Oath, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnlawfull for the ſubstance thereof, but alſo in regard of the <hi>Perſon</hi> whom vnto it is to bee ſworne: For (ſaith he) <hi>The King is not a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi>; And in two or three other places of his booke, he ſticketh not to call me by my name very broadly, <hi>an Heretike,</hi> as I haue already tolde. But yet before I be publikly declared an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike</hi>; by the <hi>Popes</hi> owne Law my people ought not to refuſe their Obedience vnto me. And

(I trust) if I were but a Subiect, and accuſed by the <hi>Pope</hi> in his <hi>Conclaue</hi> before his <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> he would haue hard prouing me an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike,</hi> if he iudged mee by their owne ancient Orders.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, I am no <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> as the <hi>Cardinall</hi> would make mee; not onely hauing euer been brought vp in that Religion which I preſently profeſſe, but euen my Father and Grandfather on that ſide profeſsing the ſame: and ſo cannot be properly an <hi>Heretike</hi> by their owne doctrine, ſince I neuer was of their Church. And as for the <hi>Queene</hi> my Mother of worthie memorie, although ſhe continued in that Religion wherin ſhe was nouriſhed, yet was ſhee ſo farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperſtitious or <hi>Ieſuited</hi> therein, that at my <hi>Baptiſme</hi> (although I was baptized by a Popiſh <hi>Archbiſhop</hi>) ſhee ſent him word to forbeare to vſe the ſpettle in my <hi>Baptiſme</hi>; which was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, being indeed a filthy and an apiſh trick, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſcorne then imitation of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> And her owne very words were, <hi>That ſhee would not haue a pockie Prieſt to ſpet in her childs mouth.</hi> As alſo the Font wherin I was Chriſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was ſent from the late <hi>Queene</hi> heere of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:24995:20"/>
memorie, who was my Godmother; and what her Religion was, <hi>Pius V.</hi> was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And for further proofe, that that renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Queene</hi> my <hi>Mother</hi> was not ſuperſtitious, as in all her Letters (whereof I receiued many) ſhe neuer made mention of Religion, nor labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to perſwade me in it; ſo at her last words, ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded her <hi>Maſter-houſhold,</hi> a Scottiſh Gentleman my ſeruant, and yet aliue, ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him (I ſay) to tell me; That although ſhe was of another Religion then that wherein I was brought vp; yet ſhe woud not preſſe me to change, except my owne conſcience forced mee to it. For ſo that I led a good life, and were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to doe iustice and gouerne well, ſhe doubted not but I would be in a good caſe with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of my owne Religion. Thus am I no <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate,</hi> nor yet a deborder from that Religion which one part of my Parents profeſſed, and an other part gaue me good allowance of. Neither can my Baptiſme in the rites of their Religion make me an <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> or Heretike in respect of my preſent profeſsion, ſince wee all agree in the ſubſtance thereof, being all baptized <hi>In the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:24995:20"/>
holy Ghoſt:</hi> vpon which head there is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance amongst vs.</p>
                  <p>And now for the point of <hi>Heretike,</hi> I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee aſhamed to render an account of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, and of that hope that is in me, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle preſcribeth. I am ſuch a <hi>CATHOLIKE CHRISTIAN,</hi> as beleeueth the three <hi>Creeds;</hi> That of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> the two latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Paraphraſes</hi> to the former: And I beleeue them in that ſenſe, as the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi> that made them did vnderſtand them. To which three <hi>Creedes</hi> all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>England</hi> doe ſubſcribe at their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I alſo acknowledge for Orthodoxe all thoſe other formes of <hi>Creeds,</hi> that either were deuiſed by <hi>Councels</hi> or paticular <hi>Fathers,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst ſuch particular <hi>Hereſies,</hi> as moſt reigned in their times.</p>
                  <p>I reuerence and admit the foure first generall <hi>Councels</hi> as Catholike and Orthodoxe. And the ſaid foure generall <hi>Councels</hi> are acknowledged by our Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and receiued for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe by our Church.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Fathers,</hi> I reuerence them as much
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:24995:21"/>
and more then the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> doe, and as much as themſelues euer craued. For what euer the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> for the firſt fiue hundreth yeeres did with an vnanime conſent agree vpon, to be beleeued as a neceſſary point of ſaluation, I either will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it alſo, or at leaſt will be humbly ſilent; not taking vpon me to condemne the ſame: But for euery priuate <hi>Fathers</hi> opinion, it bindes not my conſcience more then <hi>Bellarmines;</hi> euery one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> vſually contradicting others. I wil therefore in that caſe follow <hi>S.</hi>

                     <hi>Auguſtines</hi> rule in iudging of their opinions, as I finde them agree with the Scriptures: what I find agreeable thereunto I will gladly imbrace; what is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I will (with their reuerence) reiect.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> no man doubteth I will beleeue them. But euen for the <hi>Apocrypha</hi>; I hold them in the ſame account that the Ancients did.

alone to ground any article of Faith, except it be confirmed by ſome other place of Canonicall Scripture; Concluding this point with <hi>Ruffinus</hi> (who is no Noueliſt, I hope) That the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall Bookes were by the <hi>Fathers</hi> permitted to be read; not for Confirmation of Doctrine, but onely for inſtruction of the people.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Saints departed</hi>; I honour their memory, and in the honour of them doe we in our <hi>Church</hi> obſerue the dayes of ſo many of them, as the Scripture doth canonize for <hi>Saints;</hi> but I am loath to beleeue all the tales of the Legended Saints.</p>
                  <p>And firſt for the <hi>bleſſed Virgin MARIE,</hi> I yeeld her that which the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced of her, and which in her <hi>Canticle</hi> ſhee prophecied of her ſelfe: that is, That <note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 1.28.</note> ſhe is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongst women, and <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 48.</note> That all generations ſhall call her bleſſed. I reuerence her as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> whom of our Sauiour tooke his fleſh, and ſo the Mother of <hi>GOD,</hi> ſince the Diuinitie and Humanitie of <hi>CHRIST</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable. And I freely confeſſe, that ſhee is in glory both aboue Angels and men, her owne Sonne (that is both <hi>GOD</hi> and man) only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:24995:23"/>
But I dare not mocke her and blaſpheme againſt <hi>GOD,</hi> calling her not onely <hi>Diua</hi> but <hi>Dea,</hi> and praying her to command and controule her Sonne, who is her <hi>GOD,</hi> and her <hi>SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OVR.</hi> Nor yet can I thinke, that ſhe hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to doe in heauen, then to heare euery idle mans ſuite and buſie her ſelfe in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands; whiles requeſting, whiles commaunding her ſonne, whiles comming downe to kiſſe and make loue with <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and whiles diſputing and brawling with <hi>Deuils.</hi> In heauen ſhe is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall glory and ioy, neuer to bee interrupted with any worldly buſines; and there I leaue her with her bleſſed <hi>SONNE</hi> our Sauiour and hers in eternall felicitie.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Prayer to Saints;</hi> Chriſt (I am ſure) hath commaunded vs to Come all to him that are loaden with ſinne,<note place="margin">Matth 11.28.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">Coloſ. 28.23.</note> and hee will relieue vs: and <hi>S.

But what warrant wee haue to haue recourſe vnto theſe <hi>Dij Penates</hi> or <hi>Tutelares,</hi> theſe Courtiers of God, I know not; I remit that to theſe philoſophicall neoterike Diuines. It ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:24995:23"/>
me to pray to <hi>God</hi> through <hi>Chriſt</hi> as I am commanded, which I am ſure muſt bee the ſafeſt way; and I am ſure the <hi>Safeſt</hi> way is the beſt way in points of ſaluation. But if the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> hath coined new articles of faith, neuer heard of in the firſt <hi>500.</hi> yeeres after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I hope I ſhal neuer be condemned for an Heretike, for not being a Noueliſt. Such are the <hi>priuate Maſſes,</hi> where the <hi>Prieſt</hi> playeth the part both of the Priest and of the people; And ſuch are the <hi>Amputation of the one halfe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from the people; <hi>The Transſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Eleuation for Adoration,</hi> and <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation</hi> in proceſsion of the Sacrament; the <hi>works of Supererogation,</hi> rightly named <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaurus Eccleſiae, the baptiſing of Bels,</hi> and a thouſand other trickes: But aboue all the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images.</hi> If my faith bee weake in theſe, I confeſſe I had rather beleeue too litle then too much. And yet ſince I beleeue as much as the Scriptures do warrant, the <hi>Creeds</hi> do perſwade, and the ancient <hi>Councels</hi> decreed, I may well be a <hi>Schiſmatike</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> but I am ſure I am no <hi>Heretike.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Reliques of Saints,</hi> If I had any ſuch
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:24995:24"/>
that I were aſſured were members of their bodies I would honorably bury them, and not giue them the reward of condemned mens members, which are onely ordained to be depriued of buriall: But for <hi>worſhipping</hi> either them or <hi>Images,</hi> I must account it damnable idolatry.</p>
                  <p>I am no <hi>Iconomachus,</hi> I quarrell not the making of Images, either for publike decoration, or for mens priuate vſes: But that they ſhould be worſhipped, bee prayed to, or any holineſſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto them, was neuer knowen of the Ancients: and the Scriptures are ſo directly, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently and punctually againſt it, as I wonder what braine of man, or ſuggestion of Sathan durst offer it to Christians; and all must be ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with nice Philoſophicall distinctions: As, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolum nihil eſt:</hi> and, They worſhip (forſooth) the Images of things <hi>in being,</hi> and the Image of the true <hi>GOD.</hi> But the Scripture forbiddeth to worſhip the Image of any thing that <hi>GOD</hi> created. It was not a <hi>nihil</hi> then that <hi>GOD</hi> forbade onely to be worſhipped, neither was the braſen <hi>Serpent,</hi> nor the body of <hi>Moſes</hi> a <hi>nihil</hi>; and yet the one was deſtroyed, and the other hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for eſchewing of Idolatrie. Yea, the Image
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:24995:24"/>
of <hi>GOD</hi> himſelfe is not onely expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be worſhipped, but euen to be made. The reaſon is giuen, That no eye euer ſaw <hi>GOD;</hi> and how can wee paint his face, when <hi>Moſes</hi> (the man that euer was moſt familiar with <hi>GOD</hi>) neuer ſaw but his backe parts? Surely, ſince he cannot bee draawen to the <hi>viue,</hi> it is a thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe labour to marre it with a falſe repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which no Prince, nor ſcarce any other man will be contented with in their owne pictures. Let them therefore that maintaine this Doctrine, anſwere it to <hi>CHRIST</hi> at the latter day, when he ſhall accuſe them of Idolatry; And then I doubt if he will be payed with ſuch nice ſophiſticall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Chriſts Croſſe</hi> muſt haue a particular priuiledge (ſay they) and bee worſhipped <hi>ratione contactus.</hi> But firſt we muſt know what kinde of touching of <hi>Chriſts</hi> body drew a vertue from it; whether euery touching, or only touching by faith? That euery touching of his body drew not vertue from it, is more then manifeſt. When <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 8.</note> the woman in the bloody flux touched him, ſhee was healed by her faith: But <hi>Peter</hi> then tolde him that a crowd and throng of many people
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:24995:25"/>
then touched him; and yet none of them receiued any benefit or vertue from him. <hi>Iudas</hi> touched him many and many a time, beſides his laſt kiſſe; ſo did the villaines that buffeted and crucified him, and yet I may ſafely pronounce them accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that would bestow any worſhippe vpon their reliques: yea, wee cannot denie but the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> it ſelfe (whereupon our Lord did daily tread) is ſo viſibly accurſed, being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by faithleſse <hi>Turkes,</hi> full of innumerable ſects of hereticall <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie thereof ſo far degenerated into a pitiful ſterilitie,<note place="margin">Luc. 11.28.</note> as he must be accurſed that accounteth it bleſsed. Nay, when a certaine woman bleſſed the belly that bare <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the breaſts that gaue him ſucke; Nay rather (ſaith he) <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that heare the Word of God and keepe it.</hi> Except then they could firſt prooue that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had reſolued to bleſſe that tree of the Croſſe whereupon he was nailed; they can neuer proue that his touching it could giue it any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And put the caſe it had a vertue of doing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as <hi>Peters</hi> ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:24995:25"/>
in ſo many places curſe thoſe that worſhip Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that haue eyes and ſee not, that haue eares and heare not, would much more haue curſed them that worſhip a piece of a ſticke, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As for <hi>Pugatorie</hi> and all the <note n="*" place="margin">Iubilees, In dulgences, ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfactions for the dead, &amp;c.</note> traſh depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereupon, it is not worth the talking of, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cannot finde any ground for it in all the Scriptures.

Heauen and Hell are there reuealed to be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall home of all mankinde: let vs indeauour to winne the one and eſchew the other; and there is an end.</p>
                  <p>Now in all this diſcourſe haue I yet left out the maine Article of the Romiſh faith; and that is the <hi>Head of the Church</hi> or <hi>Peters Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>; for who denieth this, denieth <hi>fidem Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> That Biſhops ought to be in the Church, I euer maintained it, as an Apoſtolike inſtitution, and ſo the ordinance of <hi>GOD;</hi> contrary to the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> and likewiſe to <note n="a" place="margin">Bellar lib. <hi>4.</hi> de Rom.

that I haue found greater honeſty with the high-land and border theeues, then with that ſort of people. But leauing him to his own impudence, I returne to my purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and Church Hierarchie I very well allowe (as I ſaide before) and likewiſe of Rancks and Degrees amongſt <hi>Biſhops.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus haue I prooued out of S. <hi>Paul</hi> now, that the time of the <hi>Antichriſts</hi> comming, and the generall Defection was not to bee till long after the time that he wrote in; That his Seat was to be in the Temple and Church of God; and, That his <hi>Action</hi> (which can beſt poynt at his <hi>Perſon</hi>) ſhould be to <hi>exalt himſelfe aboue all that were called Gods.</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> indeed doth more amply, though myſtically deſcribe this <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which vnder the figure of a monſtrous Beaſt, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

And who hath ſo meanely read the Scriptures (if he haue euer read them at all) that knoweth it not to bee a common phraſe in them, to call <hi>CHRIST</hi> perſecuted and ſlaine, when his Saints are ſo vſed?

                     <hi>That in that Citie was found the blood of the Prophets, &amp; of the Saints, and of all that were ſlaine vpon the earth;</hi> and I hope <hi>CHRIST</hi> was one of them that were ſlaine vpon the earth.

Nor yet that turning <hi>Chriſtian Rome</hi> while ſhe was in the conuerting, which immediatly followed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time, glorious by the Martyrdome of ſo many godly <hi>Biſhops:</hi> But that <hi>Antichriſtian Rome,</hi> when as the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall ſet downe his ſeat there; after that by the working of that Mysterie of iniquitie, <hi>Chriſtian Rome</hi> ſhall become to bee corrupted; and ſo that deadly

                  <p>But here it may be obiected, that the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> cannot reigne a long ſpace; ſince <hi>S.

And therefore who will but remember that in all his Viſions in the ſaid Booke, hee directly imitates the faſhions of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiels, Daniels,</hi> and <hi>Zacharies</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions (borowing their phraſes that prophecied before <hi>CHRIST,</hi> to vtter his <hi>Prophecies</hi> in, that was to ſpeake of the laſt dayes) ſhall finde it very probable that in theſe three dayes and a halfe hee imitated <hi>Daniels</hi> Weekes, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

for his Week the time between <hi>CHRISTS</hi> firſt and ſecond comming, and making <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> to triumph the halfe of that time or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Weeke. For as to that literall interpretation (as all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make it) of three yeeres and a halfe, and that time to fall out directly the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laſt dayes, ſaue fiue and fortie, before <hi>CHRIST</hi> his ſecond comming, it is directly repugnant to the whole New <hi>Teſtament.</hi> For <hi>CHRIST</hi> ſaith, That in the latter dayes men ſhall be feaſting, marrying, &amp; at all ſuch worldly fineſse, when the last houre ſhall come in a clappe vpon them; One ſhall bee at the Mill.<note place="margin">Matth. 24.41.</note> One vpon the toppe of the houſe, and ſo foorth.<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>CHRIST</hi> telleth a <hi>Parable</hi> of the fiue fooliſh Virgins to ſhew the vnlooked-for comming of this houre; Nay, he ſaith the Sonne of man, nor the Angels in heauen know not this time. <hi>S.

                     <hi>Euangel.</hi> Whereas if the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall reigne three yeeres and a halfe before the latter day, and that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:24995:36"/>
there ſhall be but iuſt <hi>45.</hi> daies of time after his destruction; then ſhall not the iuſt day and houre of the latter day, be vnknowen to them that ſhall be aliue in the world at the time of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> deſtruction. For firſt according to the Papiſts doctrine, all the world ſhall know him to be the <hi>Antichiſt,</hi> both by the two Witneſſes doctrine, and his ſudden deſtruction; And conſequently they cannot be ignorant, that the latter day ſhal come iuſt <hi>45.</hi> dayes after: and ſo <hi>CHRIST</hi> ſhal not come as a theefe, nor the world be taken at vnawares; contrary to all the Scriptures before alleadged, and many more. And thus haue wee proued <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Seat of the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the ſecond halfe of that ſpiritual Weeke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt and ſecond comming of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> to be the time of his Reigne. For in the firſt halfe thereof the myſtery of iniquitie beganne to worke; but the man of ſinne was not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed.</p>
                  <p>But who theſe witneſſes ſhould be is a great question. The generall conceit of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is, that it must be <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> And herein is <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſo ſtrong, as hee thinketh him in a great error (if not an Heretike) that doubteth

And therefore as I will not preſume to binde any other man to my opinion herein, if his owne reaſon leads him not thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſo ſhall I propone ſuch probable coniectures, as (I hope) ſhall be free from <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full curioſity.</p>
                  <p>In two diuers faſhions may the mysterie of theſe Witneſſes be lawfully and probably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, in my opinion. Whereof the one is, that by theſe two Witneſses ſhould be meant the Olde
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:24995:42"/>
and New <hi>Teſtaments.</hi> For as the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> cannot chuſe but bee an aduerſary to the word of <hi>GOD,</hi> aboue all things; ſo will he omit no ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to diſgrace, corrupt, ſuppreſſe and deſtroy the ſame. And now whether this Booke of the two <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> or two <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> haue ſuffered any violence by the <hi>Babylonian Monarchy</hi> or not, I need ſay nothing; <hi>Res ipſa loquitur.</hi> I will not weary you with recounting thoſe Common Places vſed for diſgracing it: as calling it a <hi>Noſe of waxe,</hi> a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> a <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule,</hi> and a hundred ſuch like Phraſes of reproch. But how far the Traditions of men, and Authority of the Church are preferred to theſe witneſses, doeth ſufficiently appeare in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> doctrine.

Nay, ſo farre muſt we be from correcting it, as that the vulgar <hi>Tranſlation</hi> muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by <hi>Catholikes,</hi> to the <hi>Bible</hi> in the owne Originall tongue.

                  <p>The other is more common, and ſeemeth more literally to agree with the Text. And this is to interpret, not the <hi>word of GOD,</hi> but the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers thereof</hi> to bee meant by theſe <hi>Witneſſes.</hi>

But he not thinking it enough to make the <hi>Pope</hi> our Superior, hath in a late Treatiſe of his (called the <hi>Recognition of his bookes of Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi>)
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:24995:63"/>
made the people and Subiects of euery one of vs, our Superiors.

                  <p>As for the exemption of the Clerickes; he is ſo greedy there to proue that point,<note place="margin">Actes 25.10.</note> as he denieth <hi>Caeſar</hi> to haue beene <hi>Pauls</hi> lawfull Iudge: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſſe Text, and <hi>Pauls</hi> plain Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, and acknowledging him his Iudge; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his many times claiming to the Roman pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges,<note place="margin">Actes 22.28.</note> and auowing himſelfe a <hi>Roman</hi> by freedome; and therefore of neceſsitie a Subiect to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour.

                  <p>And as for the ſetting vp of the People aboue their owne naturall King, hee bringeth in that principle of Sedition, that he may thereby proue, that Kings haue not their power and authoritie immediatly from God, as the Pope hath his: For euery King (ſaith he) is made and choſen by his people; nay, they do but ſo transferre their power in the Kings perſon, as they doe notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding retaine their habituall power in their owne hands, which vpon certaine ocaſions they may actually take to themſelues againe.

                  <p>And amongst his other Testimonies for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, that all Kings are made and created by the People; hee alledgeth the Creation of three Kings in the Scripture, <hi>Saul, Dauid</hi> &amp; <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;</hi> and though he be compelled by the expreſſe words of the Text, to confeſſe, that God by his Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> anointed both <note n="a" place="margin">1.

And if the Election by <hi>Lott</hi> be not an immediate Election from God;<note place="margin">Actes 1.</note> then was not <hi>Matthias,</hi> who was ſo choſen and made an Apostle, immediatly choſen by God: and conſequently, hee that ſit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth in the Apoſtolike Sea cannot for ſhame claim to be immediatly choſen by God, if <hi>Matthias</hi> (that was one of the twelue Apostles, ſupplying <hi>Iudas</hi> his place) was not ſo choſen. But as it were a blasphemous impietie, to doubt that <hi>Matthias</hi> was immediatly choſen by God, and yet was
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:24995:64"/>
hee choſen by the caſting of Lots, as <hi>Saul</hi> was: ſo is it well enough knowen to ſome of you (my louing <hi>Brethren</hi>) by what holy Spirit or caſting of Lots the <hi>Popes</hi> vſe to bee elected; the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> his electors, hauing beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in two mighty factions euer ſince long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my time; and in place of caſting of Lotts, great fat penſions beeing cast into ſome of their greedy mouthes for the election of the <hi>Pope,</hi> according to the partiall humours of Princes. But I doe moſt of all wonder at the weakneſſe of his memorie: for in this place hee maketh the poſt conſent of the people to bee the thing that made both theſe Kings, notwithſtanding of their preceding inauguration and anoyntment by the Prophet at <hi>GODS</hi> commandement; forgetting that in the beginning of this ſame little booke of his, anſwering one that alledgeth a ſentence of <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> to prooue that the Biſhops were iudged by the people in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, hee there confeſseth, that by theſe words, the <hi>conſent of the people</hi> to the Biſhops election muſt be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstood. Nor will he there any wayes be mooued to graunt, that the peoples power, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to or refuſing the Election of a Biſhop;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:24995:65"/>
ſhould be ſo vnderſtood, as that therby they haue <hi>power to elect Biſhops:</hi> And yet do theſe words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſeeme to be farre ſtronger for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the peoples power to elect Church-men, then any words that hee alledgeth out of the Scripture are for the peoples power in electing a King.

                     </note> That <hi>the very people haue principally the power, either to chuſe ſuch Prieſts as are worthy, or to refuſe ſuch as are vnworthy:</hi> And, I hope, he can neuer proue by the Scripture, that it had been lawfull to the people of Iſrael, or that it was left in their choiſe, to haue admitted or refuſed <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Dauid</hi> at their pleaſure, after that the Prophet had anointed them, and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Thus ye ſee how little he careth (euen in ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a volume) to contradict himſelfe, ſo it may make for his purpoſe; making the <hi>conſent</hi> of the people to ſignifie their <hi>power of Election</hi> in the making of Kings, though in the making of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, by the peoples <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent,</hi> their <hi>approbauen</hi> of a deede done by others must onely bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtood.

that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was made King in a popular mutinous tumult and rebellion; onely permitted by God, and that in his wrath, both againſt theſe two Kings and their people.

                  <p>And now, that I may as well prooue him a lyar <hi>in facto,</hi> in his narration of this particular Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; as I haue ſhewed him to be <hi>in iure,</hi> by this his damnable and falſe ground in Diuinity: I wil truly informe you of <hi>Garnets</hi> caſe, which is far otherwiſe then this Anſwerer alleageth.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:24995:68"/>
he repenteth him; but by the contrary, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers it as a good motion, and is therein not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by his Confeſsor, nor any penance enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him for the ſame: and in this forme was this Treaſon reuealed to <hi>Garnet,</hi> as himſelfe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And next, though he ſtood long vpon it, that it was reuealed vnto him vnder the vaile of Confeſsion, in reſpect it was done in that time, while as the partie was making his Confeſsion vnto him; Yet at the laſt he did freely confeſſe, that the party reuealed it vnto him as they were walking, and not in the time of Confeſsion: But (hee ſaid) hee deliuered it vnto him vnder the greateſt Seale that might be, and ſo he tooke that he meant by the Seale of Confeſsion; And it had (as he thought) a relation to Confeſsion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that he was that parties Confeſſor, &amp; had taken his Confeſsion ſometimes before, and was to take it againe within few dayes thereafter. He alſo ſaid, that he pretended to the partie, that he would not conceale it from his Superior. And further it is to be noted, that hee confeſſed, that two diuers perſons conferred with him anent this Treaſon; and that when the one of them, which was <hi>Catesby,</hi> conferred with him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:24995:68"/>
it was in the other parties preſence and hearing: and what a Confeſsion can this be in the hearing of a third perſon? And how far his last wordes (whereof our Anſwerer ſo much vaunts him) did disproue it to haue been vnder Confeſsion, the Earle of Northamptons Booke doth beare witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the other parties name, that reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Powder-Treaſon</hi> vnto him, it was <hi>Greenwell</hi> the <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> and ſo a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> this treaſonable plot, the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> reuealer not ſhewing any remorſe, and the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> whome to it was reuealed not ſo much as inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him any penance for the ſame. And that ye may knowe that more <hi>Ieſuites</hi> were alſo vpon the partie, <hi>Owldcorne</hi> the other Powder-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, after the miſgiuing and diſcouerie of that Treaſon, preached conſolatorie doctrine to his Catholike auditory; exhorting them not to faint for the miſgiuing of this enterpriſe, nor to thinke the worſe thereof that it ſucceeded not; alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diuers Preſidents of ſuch godly enterpriſes that miſgaue in like manner: especially, one of Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who in his ſecond iourney to the <hi>Holy land,</hi> died by the way, the

                  <p>Thus ſee ye now with what boldnes and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie he hath belied the publikely knowen veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in this errand, both in auowing generally that no <hi>Ieſuite</hi> was any waies guilty of that <hi>treaſon,</hi> for ſo he affirmeth in his Booke; and alſo that <hi>Garnet</hi> knewe nothing thereof, but vnder the Seale of Confeſsion. But if this were the firſt lie of the affaires of this State, which my fugitiue <hi>Prieſtes</hi> and <hi>Ieſuites</hi> haue coined and ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, I could charme them of it, as the prouerbe is. But as well the walles of diuers Monaſteries and <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Colleges abroad, are filled with the painting of ſuch lying Histories, as alſo the bookes of our ſaid fugitiues are farced with ſuch ſort of ſhameleſſe ſtuffe; ſuch are the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſorts of torments and cruell deathes, that they record their <hi>Martyrs</hi> to haue ſuffered here; ſome torne at foure Horſes; ſome ſowed in Beares skinnes, and then killed with Dogges:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:24995:69"/>
nay, women haue not beene spared (they ſay) and a thouſand other ſtrange fictions, the vanities of all which I will in two words diſcouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
                  <p>Firſt as for the cauſe of their puniſhment, I doe conſtantly maintaine that which I haue ſaid in my <hi>Apology:</hi> That no man, either in my time, or in the late Queenes, euer died here for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. For let him be neuer ſo deuout a Papist, nay, though hee profeſſe the ſame neuer ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, his life is in no danger by the Law, if hee breake not out into ſome outward acte expreſly against the words of the Law, or plot not ſome vnlawfull or dangerous practiſe or attempt; Priests and Popiſh Church-men onely excepted, that receiue orders beyond the ſeas; who for the manifold treaſonable practiſes that they haue kindled &amp; plotted in this countrey, are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to come home againe vnder paine of <hi>treaſon,</hi> after their receiuing of the ſaide Orders abroad; and yet, without ſome other guilt in them then their bare home-comming, haue none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bin euer put to death. And next, for the cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; ſtrange ſorts of death that they ſay ſo many of them haue bin put vnto; if there were
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:24995:70"/>
no more but the Lawe and continually obſerued cuſtome of England, theſe many hundred yeeres, in all criminall matters, it will ſufficiently ſerue to refute all theſe monstrous lies: for no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are euer vſed here, but the Manicles or the Racke, and theſe neuer but in caſes of high Treaſon; and all ſorts of Traitours die but one maner of death here, whether they bee Papiſt or Proteſtant traitours; Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time only excepted. For then indeede no ſorts of cruell deathes were spared vnexecuted vpon men, women and children profeſsing our Religion: yea, euen againſt the lawes of God and Nature, women with childe were put to cruell death for their profeſsion; and a liuing childe falling out of the mothers belly, was throwen in the ſame fire againe that conſumed the mother. But theſe tyrannous perſecutions were done by the Biſhops of that time, vnder the warrant of the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie, and therefore were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to that constant order and formes of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which as they are heere eſtabliſhed by our Lawes and cuſtomes, ſo are they accordingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the puniſhment of all criminals. For all Prieſts and Popiſh Traitours heere receiue their
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:24995:70"/>
Iudgement in the temporall Courts, and ſo doe neuer exceed thoſe formes of execution which are preſcribed by the Law, or approued by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall cuſtome. One thing is alſo to be marked in this caſe; that ſtrangers are neuer called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion here for their Religion, which is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (I hope) in any place where the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> domines.</p>
                  <p>But hauing now too much wearied you with this long diſcourſe, whereby I haue made you plainely ſee, that the wrong done vnto me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; firſt by the <hi>Popes Breues,</hi> and then by theſe Libellers, doth as deepely intereſt you all in generall, that are <hi>Kings,</hi> free <hi>Princes,</hi> or <hi>States,</hi> as it doth mee in particular: I will now conclude, with my humble prayers to God, that he will waken vs vp all out of that Lethargike ſlumber of Securitie, wherein our Predeceſsors and we haue lien ſo long; and that wee may firſt grauely conſider, what wee are bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to doe for the planting and ſpreading of the true worſhip of God, according to his reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will, in all our Dominions; therein hearing the voice of our onely Paſtor (for his Sheepe will know his voyce,<note place="margin">Iohn 10.27.</note> as himſelfe ſaith) and not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:24995:71"/>
following the vaine, corrupt &amp; changeable tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men. And next that wee may proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently looke to the ſecuritie of our owne States, and not ſuffer this incroching <hi>Babylonian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> to winne ſtill ground vpon vs. And if God hath ſo mercifully dealt with vs, that are his Lieutenants vpon earth, as that he hath ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his cauſe with our intereſt, the ſpirituall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the Goſpel with our temporall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: with what zeale and courage may wee then imbrace this worke: for our labours herein being aſſured, to receiue at the laſt the eternall and ineſtimable reward of felicitie in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen; and in the meane time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vnto our ſelues a temporall ſecuritie, in our temporall Kingdomes in this world.</p>
                  <p>As for ſo many of you as are already perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of that Truth which I profeſſe, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering among your ſelues in ſome particular points; I think little perſwaſion ſhould moue you to this holy and wiſe Reſolution: Our Greatnes, nor our number, praiſed bee God, being not ſo contemptible, but that we may ſhew good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to our neighbors; ſince almoſt the halfe of all Chriſtian people and of all ſorts and degrees, are

For if thoſe <note n="a" place="margin">Gen 4.10.</note> crying Sinnes (whereof mention is made in the Scripture) haue that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:24995:80"/>
epithete giuen them for their publique infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and for procuring as it were with a loud crie from heauen a iuſt vengeance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe; and yet thoſe ſinnes are both old and too common, neither the world nor any one Countrey being euer at any time cleane voyd of them: If thoſe ſinnes (I ſay) are ſaid in the Scripture to cry ſo loud; What then muſt this ſinne doe, plotted without cauſe, infinite in crueltie, and ſingular from all examples? What proceeded hereupon is likewiſe notorious to the whole worlde; our Iuſtice onely taking hold vpon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and that in as honourable and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique a forme of Trial, as euer was vſed in this Kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

made, ſetting downe ſome ſuch orders as were thought fit for preuenting the like miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe intime to come.

Which god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wiſe intent God did bleſſe with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:24995:81"/>
accordingly: For very many of my Subiects that were popiſhly affected, aſwel prieſts, as layicks, did freely take the ſame Oath: whereby they both gaue me occaſion to thinke the better of their fidelitie, and likewiſe freed themſelues of that heauy ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that although they were fellow profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of one Religion with the powder Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, yet were they not ioyned with them in treaſonable courſes againſt their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne; whereby all quietly minded Papiſts were put out of deſpaire, and I gaue a good proofe that I intended no perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for conſcience cauſe, but onely deſired to bee ſecured of them for ciuill obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which for conſcience cauſe they were bound to performe.</p>

Wherefore wee doe admoniſh you, that you doe vtterly abſtaine from taking this and the like Oathes: which thing wee doe the more earneſtly require of you, becauſe we haue experience of the Conſtancie of your Faith, which is tried like Gold in the fire of perpetuall Tribulation.

which are dayly reported vnto vs, of the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vertue, valour and fortitude which in theſe laſt times doeth no leſse ſhine in your <hi>Martyrs,</hi> then it did in the firſt beginnings of the Church. Stand therefore, your Loynes being girt about with Veritie, and hauing on the Breſt-plate of righteouſneſse, taking the Shield of Faith, bee yee ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; And let nothing hinder you. Hee which will crowne you, and doeth in Heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde your Conflicts, will finiſh the good worke which he hath begun in you. You know how he hath promiſed his Diſciples, that hee will neuer leaue them Orphanes: for hee is faithfull which hath promiſed.

For by this doe all men know that wee are the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if we haue Loue one to another.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Euerend Sir, and Brother in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> It is almost fourty yeeres ſince we did ſee one the other: but yet I haue neuer bin vnmindful of our ancient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, neither haue I ceaſed, ſeeing I could doe you no other good, to commend your labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring moſt painfully in the Lords vineyard, in my prayers to <hi>GOD.</hi> And I doubt not, but that I haue liued all this while in your memory, and haue had ſome place in your prayers at the Lords Altar. So therefore euen vnto this time wee haue abidden, as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, in the mutuall loue one of the other, not by word or letter, but in deede and trueth. But a late meſſage which was brought vnto vs within theſe few dayes, of your bonds and impriſonment, hath inforced mee
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:24995:97"/>
to breake off this ſilence; which meſſage, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeemed heauy in regard of the loſſe which that Church hath receiued, by their beeing thus depriued of the comfort of your pastorall function among them, yet withall it ſeemed ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe you drewe neere vnto the glory of <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> then the which gift of God there is none more happy; That you, who haue fed your flocke ſo many yeeres with the word and doctrine, ſhould now feed it more gloriouſly by the example of your patience. But another hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy tidings did not a litle diſquiet and almoſt take away this ioy, which immediatly followed, of the aduerſaries aſſault, and peraduenture of the ſlip and fall of your Constancy in refuſing an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Oath. Neither truely (moſt deare Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) could that Oath therfore be lawfull, becauſe it was offered in ſort tempered and modified: for you know that thoſe kinde of modifications are nothing elſe, but ſleights &amp; ſubtilties of Sathan, that the Catholique faith touching the Primacie of the Sea Apoſtolique, might either ſecretly or openly be ſhot at, for the which faith ſo many worthy Martyrs euen in that very <hi>England</hi> it ſelfe, haue reſiſted vnto blood. For moſt certaine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:24995:98"/>
it is, that in whatſoeuer wordes the Oath is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the aduerſaries of the faith in that Kingdome, it tends to this end, that the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the head of the Church in <hi>England,</hi> may be transferred from the ſucceſſour of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to the Succeſsour of <hi>K. Henry</hi> the eight. For that which is pretended of the danger of the Kings life, if the high Prieſt ſhould haue the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in England, which hee hath in all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdomes, it is altogether idle, as all that haue any vnderſtanding, may eaſily perceiue. For it was neuer heard of from the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy vntill this day, that euer any Pope did command that any Prince, though an Heretike, though an Ethnike, though a Perſecutor, ſhould be murdered; or did approue of the fact when it was done by any other. And why, I pray you, doeth onely the King of England feare that, which none of all other the Princes in Chriſtendome ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth feare, or euer did feare?</p>
                     <p>But, as I ſaide, theſe vaine pretexts are but the trappes and ſtratagemes of Satan: Of which kinde I could produce not a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:24995:98"/>
call to your memory <hi>S. Gregorius Nazianze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in his firſt Oration againſt <hi>Iulian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, reporteth, That he, the more eaſily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the ſimple Christians, did inſert the Images of the falſe gods into the pictures of the Emperor, which the Romanes did vſe to bow dawne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with a ciuill kind of reuerence: ſo that no man could doe reuerence to the Emperours picture, but withall he muſt adore the Images of the falſe gods; whereupon it came to paſſe that many were deceiued. And if there were any that found out the Emperours craft, and refuſed to worſhip his picture, thoſe were moſt grieuouſly puniſhed, as men that had contemned the Emperour in his Image. Some ſuch like thing, me thinkes, I ſee in the Oath that is offered to you, which is to ſo craftily compoſed, that no man can deteſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the King and make profeſsion of his Ciuill ſubiection, but he muſt be conſtrained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly to denie the Primacie of the Apostolike Sea. But the ſeruants of Chriſt, and eſpecially the chiefe Prieſts of the Lord ought to be ſo farre from taking an vnlawfull Oath, where they may indamage the Faith, that they ought to beware that they giue not the leaſt ſuspicion of diſsimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:24995:99"/>
that they haue taken it, leaſt they might ſeeme to haue left any example of preuarication to faithfull people. Which thing that worthy <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazar</hi> did moſt notably performe, who would neither eate ſwines fleſh, nor ſo much as faine to haue eaten it, although hee ſaw the great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that did hang ouer his head; leaſt, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſpeaketh in the ſecond booke of the <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> many yong men might be brought through that ſimilation, to preuaricate with the Law. Neither did <hi>Baſil</hi> the great by his example, which is more fit for our purpoſe, carrie himſelfe leſse worthily toward <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour. For as <hi>Theodoret</hi> writeth in his Historie, when the Deputy of that heretical Emperour did perſwade Saint <hi>Baſill,</hi> that he would not reſiſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for a little ſubtiltie of a few points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; that moſt holy and prudent man made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, <hi>That it was not to bee indured, that the leaſt ſyllable of Gods word ſhould bee corrupted, but rather all kind of torment was to be embraced, for the maintenance of the Trueth thereof.</hi> Now I ſuppoſe, that there wants not amongſt you, who ſay that they are but ſubtilties of Opinions that are conteined in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:24995:99"/>
Oath that is offred to the Catholikes, and that you are not to ſtriue againſt the Kings Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for ſuch a little matter. But there are not wanting alſo amongſt you holy men like vnto <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great, which will openly auow, that the very leaſt ſyllable of Gods diuine trueth is not to be corrupted, though many torments were to be endured, and death it ſelfe ſet before you. Amongſt whom it is meete, that you ſhould bee one, or rather the Standerd-bearer, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to the reſt. And whatſoeuer hath beene the cauſe, that your Conſtancie hath quailed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee the ſuddenneſſe of your apprehenſion, or the bitterneſſe of your perſecution, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillitie of your old age: yet we truſt in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of God, &amp; in your owne long continued vertue, that it will come to paſse, that as you ſeeme in ſome part to haue imitated the fall of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> ſo you ſhall happily imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their valour in recouering your ſtrength, and maintaining the truth. For if you will diligently weigh the whole matter with your ſelfe, truely you ſhall ſee, it is no ſmall matter that is called in queſtion by this Oath, but one of the principall heads of our faith and foundations of Catholique
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:24995:100"/>
Religion. For heare what your Apoſtle <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Great hath written, in his <hi>24.</hi> Epiſtle of his <hi>11.</hi> booke. <hi>Let not the reuerence due to the Apoſtolique Sea, bee troubled by any mans preſumption: for then the eſtate of the members doeth remaine entire, when the head of the faith is not bruiſed by any iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Therefore by S. <hi>Gregories</hi> teſtimonie, when they are buſie about diſturbing or diminiſhing, or taking away of the Primacie of the Apoſtolique Sea: then are they buſie about cutting off the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie head of the faith, and diſſoluing of the state of the whole body, and of all the members.

                     <p>And now to come to a particular anſwere of his letter. Firſt as concerning the ſweete memory hee hath of his old acquaintance with the Arch-prieſt; it may indeed be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for him to recount: but ſure I am, his acquaintance with him and the reſt of his ſocietie, our Fugitiues (whereof he alſo van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe in his preface to the Reader in his booke of Controuerſies) hath prooued ſowre to vs and our State. For ſome of ſuch Prieſts and Ieſuits, as were the greateſt Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours

and fomenters of the greateſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies againſt the late Queen, gaue vp father <hi>Robert Bellarmine</hi> for one of their greateſt authorities and oracles.<note place="margin">Campian and Hart. See the conference in the Tower.</note> And therefore I doe not enuie the great honor he can win, by his vaunt of his inward familiaritie with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes traitours and fugitiues: whom vnto if he teach no better maners then hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he hath done, I thinke his fellowſhip are little beholding vnto him.</p>
                     <p>And for deſiring him to remember him in his prayers at the altar of the Lord: if the Arch-prieſts prayers prooue no more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his ſoule, then <hi>Bellarmines</hi> counſel is like to proue profitable, both to the ſoule and body of <hi>Blackwel</hi> (if he would follow it) the author of this letter might very wel be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his prayers.</p>
                     <p>Now the firſt meſſenger that I can finde, which brought ioyfull newes of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> was he that brought the newes of the Arch-prieſts taking, and firſt appearance of Martyrdome. A great ſigne ſurely of the Cardinals mortification, that he was ſo reioyced to heare of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:24995:108"/>
impriſonment and appearance of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to death of ſo old and deare a friend of his. But yet apparantly he ſhould firſt haue bene ſure, that he was onely to be puniſhed for cauſe of Religion, before hee had ſo tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed vpon the expectation of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome. For firſt,<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals charitie.</note> by what rule of charitie was it lawfull for him to iudge me a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, before proofe had bene made of it by the ſaid Arch-prieſtes condemnation and death? What could hee know, that the ſaid Arch-prieſt was not taken vpon ſuſpicion of his guiltineſſe in the Powder-Treaſon? What certaine information had he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vpon the particulars, whereupon hee was to be accuſed? And laſt of all, by what inſpiration could he foretell whereupon hee was to bee accuſed? For at that time there was yet nothing layed to his charge. And if charitie ſhould not be ſuſpicious, what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant had he abſolutely to condemne mee of vſing perſecution and tyrannie, which could not be but emplied vpon me, if <hi>Blackwel</hi> was to be a Martyr? but ſurely it may iuſtly be ſaid of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this caſe, that our Sauiour
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:24995:109"/>
CHRIST ſaith of all worldly and carnall men, who thinke it enough to loue their <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5.43.</note> friends and hate their enemies; the limits of the Cardinals charitie extending no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to them of his owne profeſsion. For what euer he added in ſuperfluous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to <hi>Blackwel,</hi> in reioycing in the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his future Martyrdome; he detracted as much vniuſtly and vncharitably from me, in accounting of me thereby as of a bloody Perſecutour. And whereas this ioy of his was interrupted by the next meſſenger, that brought the newes of the ſaid Arch-prieſt his failing in his conſtancie, by taking of this Oath; he needed neuer to haue bene trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, either with his former ioy or his ſecond ſorrow, both being alike falſly grounded. For as it was neuer my intention to lay any thing vnto the ſaid Arch-prieſts charge, as I haue neuer done to any for cauſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſo was <hi>Blackwels</hi> conſtancie neuer brangled by taking of this Oath; It being a thing which he euer thought lawfull before his apprehenſion, and whereunto hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded all Catholikes to giue obedience;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:24995:109"/>
like as after his apprehenſion, he neuer made doubt or ſtop in it; but at the firſt offering it vnto him, did freely take it, as a thing moſt lawfull; neither meanes of threatning or flatterie being euer vſed vnto him, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe can yet beare witneſſe.</p>
                     <p>And as for the temperature and modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Oath; except that a reaſonable and lawfull matter is there ſet downe in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable &amp; temperate words, agreeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: I know not what he can meane, by quarelling it for that fault. For no temperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes nor modifications in words therein, can iuſtly be called the Deuils craft, when the thing it ſelfe is ſo plaine, and ſo plainely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to all them that take it; as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubleſome thing in it all, bee the words vſed in the end thereof, for eſchewing <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation</hi> and <hi>mentall reſeruation.</hi> Which new Catholique doctrine, may farre iuſtlier bee called the Deuils craft, then any plaine and temperate words, in ſo plaine and cleare a matter. But what ſhal we ſay of theſe ſtrange countrey clownes, whom of with the <hi>Satyre</hi> we may iuſtly complaine, that they blovv
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:24995:110"/>
both hote and cold out of one mouth? For <hi>Luther</hi> and our bolde and free ſpeaking Writers are mightily railed vpon by them, as hot brained fellovves, and ſpeakers by the Deuils inſtinct: and novv if vve ſpeake mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and temperately of them, it muſt bee tearmed the Deuils craft. And therefore we may iuſtly complaine vvith CHRIST, that when we <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 11.17</note> mourne, they wil not lament: and when vve pipe, they vvill not dance. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> his ſeueritie, nor CHRIST his meekeneſſe and lenitie can pleaſe them, vvho build but to their owne Monarchie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground of their ovvn Traditions; and not to CHRIST vpon the ground of his Word and infallible trueth.</p>
                     <p>But vvhat can bee meant by alleadging, that the craft of the Deuill herein, is onely vſed for ſubuerſion of the Catholique faith, and euerſion of <hi>S. Peters</hi> Primacie; had need bee commented anevv by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For in all this Letter of his, neuer one vvord is vſed, to proue that by any part of this Oath the primacy of <hi>S. Peter</hi> is any vvay medled vvith, except Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:24995:110"/>
bare alledging; which without prouing it by more cleare demonſtration, can neuer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the conſcience of any reaſonable man. For (for ought that I know) heauen and earth are no farther aſunder, then the profeſson of a temporall obedience to a temporall King, is different from any thing belonging to the Catholique faith, or Supremacie of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> For as for the Catholique faith;<note place="margin">No deciſion of any point of Religion in the Oath of Allegiance.</note> can there bee one word found in all that Oath, tending or ſounding to matter of Religion? Doeth he that taketh it, promiſe there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, or not to beleeue any article of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Or doeth he ſo much as name a true or a falſe Church there? And as for <hi>S. Peters</hi> Primacie; I know no Apoſtles name that is therein named, except the name of IAMES, it being my Chriſten name: though it pleaſe him not to deigne to name me in all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, albeit, the contents thereof concerne me in the higheſt degree. Neither is there any mention at all made therein, either <hi>diſertis verbis,</hi> or by any other indirect meanes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Hierarchie of the Church, of <hi>S. Peters</hi> ſucceſsion, of the Sea Apoſtolike, or of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:24995:111"/>
any ſuch matter: but that the Author of our Letter doeth brauely make mention of <hi>S. Peters</hi> ſucceſsion, bringing it in compariſon with the ſucceſsion of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. Of which vnapt and vnmannerly ſimilitude, I wonder hee ſhould not bee much aſhamed. For as to King <hi>Henries</hi> ſucceſſour (which he meaneth by mee) as I, I ſay, neuer did, nor will preſume to create any article of fayth, or to bee Iudge thereof; but to ſubmit my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary obedience vnto them, in as great humilitie as the meaneſt of the land: ſo if the Pope could bee as well able to proue his either Perſon all or Doctrinall Succeſsion from <hi>S.

as that hee will attempt the one, and leaue the other vnperformed if he can. And yet ſurely I cannot blame him for paſsing it ouer, ſince he could not otherwiſe haue eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed the direct belying of himſelfe in tearmes, which hee now doeth but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and effect.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:24995:112"/>
that doe moſt authentically cite them, as I haue already ſaid; let vs turne our eyes vpon our owne time, and therein remember what a Panegyrik <note n="a" place="margin">See the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Quintus,</hi> made in the Conſiſtory vpon the death of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 3.</note> oration was made by the <hi>Pope,</hi> in praiſe and approbation of the Frier and his fact, that murthered king <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France</hi> who was ſo farre from either being Heretike, Ethnike or Perſecutor in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the ſaid <hi>Popes</hi> owne wordes in that oration are, <hi>That a true Frier hath killed a counterfeit Frier.</hi> And beſides that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment oration and congratulation for that fact; how neere it ſcaped, that the ſaid Frier was not canonized for that glorious acte, is better knowen to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then to vs here.</p>
                     <p>But ſure I am, if ſome Cardinals had not beene more wiſe and circumſpect in that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, then the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe was, the <hi>Popes</hi> owne Kalender of his Saints would haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proued <hi>Bellarmine</hi> a liar in this caſe. And to draw yet nerer vnto our ſelues; how many practiſes and attempts were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the late Queenes life, which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly enioyned to thoſe Traitours by their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:24995:113"/>
Confeſſors, and plainely authorized by the <hi>Popes</hi> allowance? For verification whereof there needes no more proofe, then that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Pope</hi> either then or ſince, called any Church-man in queſtion for medling in thoſe treaſonable conſpiracies; nay, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals owne <hi>S. Sanderus</hi> mentioned in his letter could well verifie this trueth, if he were aliue; and who will looke his bookes, will find them filled with no other doctrine then this. And what difference there is betweene the killing or allowing the ſlaughter of Kings, and the ſtirring vp and approbation of practiſes to kil them; I remit to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne iudgement. It may then very clearely appeare, how ſtrangely this Authours paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath made him forget himſelfe, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating himſelfe in ſo ſtrong a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt his owne knowledge and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, againſt the witneſſe of his former bookes, and againſt the practiſe of our owne times. But who can wonder at this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of himſelfe in this point, when his owne great Volumes are ſo filled with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions? which when either he, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Nay, could there bee a more gracious part in a King, ſuppoſe I ſay it, toward ſubiects of a contrary Religion, then by making them to take this Oath, to publiſh their honeſt fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in temporall things to mee their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and thereby to wipe off that imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and great ſlander which was laid vpon the whole profeſſors of that Religion, by the furious enterpriſe of theſe Powder-men?</p>
                     <p>And wheras for illuſtration of this ſtrong argument of his, hee hath brought in for a ſimilitude the hyſtorie of <note n="a" place="margin">Nazianze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in Iulian. inuectiuâ primâ.</note> 
                        <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> his dealing with the Chriſtians, when as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:24995:119"/>
he ſtraited them, either to commit idolatrie, or to come within the compaſſe of treaſon: I would wiſh the authour to remember, that although a ſimilitude may bee permitted <hi>claudicare vno pede</hi>;<note place="margin">The diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Cardinals ſimilitude.</note> yet this was a very ill choſen ſimilitude, which is lame both of feet and hands, and euery member of the body. For I ſhall in few words prooue, that it agreeth in no one point, ſaue one, with our purpoſe, which is, that <hi>Iulian</hi> was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and I a King. Firſt, <hi>Iulian</hi> was an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postata,</hi> one that had renounced the whole Chriſtian faith, which hee had once profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and became an Ethnike againe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Atheiſt: whereas I am a Chriſtian, who neuer changed that Religion, that I dranke in with my milke: nor euer, I thanke God, was aſhamed of my profeſsion. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> dealt againſt Chriſtians onely for the profeſsion of Chriſtes cauſe: I deale in this cauſe with my Subiects, onely to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betweene true Subiects, and falſe hearted traitours. <hi>Iulians</hi> end was the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Chriſtians: my onely end is, to maintaine Chriſtianitie in a peaceable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:24995:120"/>
                        <hi>Iulians</hi> drift was to make them commit idolatrie: my purpoſe is to make my Subiects to make open profeſsion of their naturall Alleagiance, and ciuill obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Iulians</hi> meanes whereby hee went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, was by craft, and inſnaring them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were aware: my courſe in this is plaine, cleare, and void of all obſcuritie: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer refuſing leaue to any that are required to take this Oath, to ſtudie it at leiſure, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them all the interpretation of it they can craue. But the greateſt diſsimilitude of all, is in this: that <hi>Iulian</hi> preſſed them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit idolatrie to idoles and images: but as well I, as all the Subiects of my profeſsion are ſo farre from guilt in this point, as wee are counted heretiques by you, becauſe we will not commit idolatrie. So as, in the maine point of all, is the greateſt contrarietie. For, <hi>Iulian</hi> perſecuted the Chriſtians becauſe they would not commit idolatrie; and yee count me a perſecutour, becauſe I will not admit idolatrie. So as to conclude this point, this olde ſentence may well be applied to <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> in vſing ſo vnapt a ſimilitude,

                     <p>And therefore his vncharitable concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doeth not rightly follow: <hi>That it ſeemeth vnto him, that ſome ſuch thing ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly or fraudulently included in this Oath</hi>; as if no man can deteſt treaſon againſt the King, or profeſſe ciuill ſubiection, except hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Primacie of the Apoſtolike Sea.

                     <p>Now let vs examine the words. The epiſtle was written to a Biſhop, eſpecially to grant him the vſe of the Pall; a ceremony and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indifferent. As it appeareth, the Biſhop- of <hi>Rome</hi> tooke it well at his hands, that hee would not preſume to take it vpon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaue from the Apoſtolique Sea, giuing him that admonition which foloweth in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:24995:126"/>
words alledged out of him: which doctrine we are ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impugning, that we altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approue &amp; allow of the ſame, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ceremonie for order is thought meet by the Chriſtian Magiſtrat, and the Church, the ſame ought inuiolably to bee kept: and where the head &amp; gouernour in matters of that nature are not obeyed, the members of that Church muſt needs run to helliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. But that <hi>Gregory</hi> by that terme, <hi>caput fidei,</hi> held himſelfe the head of our faith, and the head of all Religion, cannot ſtand with the courſe of his doctrine and writings.

For it is cleare and apparantly to be prooued by diuers Records, that they were both of them committed to the Tower a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a yeere before either of them was called in queſtion vpon their liues, for the <hi>Popes</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie; And that partly for their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe in the point of the eſtabliſhment of the Kings ſucceſsion, wherunto the whole Realme had ſubſcribed, and partly for that one of them, to wit, <hi>Fiſher,</hi> had had his hand in the matter of the holy <note n="b" place="margin">Called <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Barton.</hi> See the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> mayd of <hi>Kent,</hi> he being for his concealement of that falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets abuſe, found guiltie of miſpriſion of treaſon.

And, that <hi>the obedience that Churchmen giue to Princes, euen in the meaneſt and meere temporall things, is not by way of any neceſſary ſubiection, but onely out of diſcretion, and for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of good order and cuſtome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe contrarieties betweene the booke of God, and <hi>Bellarmines</hi> books, haue I heere ſet in oppoſition ech to other, <hi>Vt ex contrarijs iuxta ſe poſitis, veritas magis eluceſcere poſsit.</hi> And thus farre I dare boldly affirme, that whoſoeuer will indifferently weigh theſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciliable contradictions here ſet downe, wil eaſily confeſſe, that CHRIST is no more contrary to Beliall, light to darkeneſſe, and heauen to hell, then <hi>Bellarmines</hi> eſtimation of Kings, is to Gods.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the concluſion of his letter, which is onely filled with ſtrong and pithy exhortations, to perſwade and confirme <hi>Blackwell</hi> to the patient and conſtant indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Martyrdome, I haue nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, ſaue by way of regrate; that ſo many
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:24995:135"/>
good ſentences drawen out of the Scripture, ſo well and ſo handſomely packed vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould bee ſo ill and vntruely applied. But an euill cauſe is neuer the better for ſo good a cloake; and an ill matter neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by good words: And therefore I may iuſtly turne ouer that craft of the deuill vpon himſelfe, in vſing ſo holy-like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to ſo euill a purpoſe. Only I could haue wiſhed him, that hee had a little better obſerued his <hi>decorum</hi> herein, in not letting ſlip two or three prophane wordes amongſt ſo many godly mortified Scripture ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For in all the Scripture, eſpecially in the new Teſtament, I neuer read of <hi>Pontifex Maximus.</hi> And the Pope muſt be content in that ſtile to ſucceed according to the Lawe and inſtitution of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> and not to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> who neuer heard nor dreamed of ſuch an office.</p>
                     <p>And for his <hi>Caput fidei,</hi> which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred before, the Apoſtles (I am ſure) neuer gaue that ſtile to any, but to CHRIST. So as theſe ſtiles, wherof ſome were neuer found in Scripture, and ſome were neuer applied
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:24995:136"/>
but to CHRIST in that ſenſe, as he applieth it, had bene better to haue beene left out of ſo holy and mortified a letter.</p>
                     <p>To conclude then this preſent diſcourſe, I heartily wiſh all indifferent readers of the <hi>Breues</hi> and Letter, not to iudge by the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of the words, but by the weight of the matter; not looking to that which is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged, but iudiciouſly to conſider what is iuſtly prooued; And for all my own good and naturall Subiects, that their hearts may remaine eſtabliſhed in the trueth; that theſe forraine inticements may not ſeduce them from their natall and naturall duetie; and that all, aſwell ſtrangers, as naturall Subiects, to whoſe eyes this diſcourſe ſhall come, may wiſely and vnpartially iudge of the Veritie, as it is nakedly here ſet downe, for clearing theſe miſts and cloudes of calumnies, which were iniuſtly heaped vpon mee; for which ende onely I heartily pray the courteous Reader to be perſwaded, that I tooke occaſion to publiſh this diſcourſe.</p>
