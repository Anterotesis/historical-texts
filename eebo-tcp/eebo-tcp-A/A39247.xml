            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>By GEORGE ELLIOTT, Author of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Warning-piece to</hi> London.</byline>
            <l>OH whither ſhall I Flee? Where muſt I Go?</l>
            <l>I am undone, my ſins purſue me ſo:</l>
            <l>If I ſhould wander all the World about,</l>
            <l>They will me follow, and will find me out</l>
            <l>My Bones do tremble, and my Heart doth ake,</l>
            <l>God's dreadful Arrows make me fear and quake</l>
            <l>I know not what to do, I dare not ſtay,</l>
            <l>And 'tis in vain I'me ſure to run away.</l>
            <l>I will not ſtir afoot, I will not ſhrink,</l>
            <l>This bitter Cup God gives me, I will drink,</l>
            <l>And take it kindly at his Sacred Hand,</l>
            <l>I'le not refuſe it; I will notwithſtand</l>
            <l>His Will and Pleaſure: ſhall be my direction,</l>
            <l>Under his Wings I hope to find Protection.</l>
            <l>If he do Scourge, and whip me never ſo,</l>
            <l>I will not Flee, I will not from him go:</l>
            <l>But humbly at his Footſtool I will lie,</l>
            <l>And if I Live, I Live; If Dye, I Dye.</l>
            <l>My Sins are Numberleſs, I muſt confeſs;</l>
            <l>But if compar'd they be to God's Goodneſs,</l>
            <l>They are as Nothing: Then appear they will,</l>
            <l>Like a ſmall Molehill to a mighty Hill.</l>
            <l>My Friends forſake me, they are fled away,</l>
            <l>But GOD I hope will be my ſtaffe and ſtay:</l>
            <l>He will not fail me, will not me forſake,</l>
            <l>Nor of a City me a Deſart make.</l>
            <l>I hope the World ſhall ſee that God above,</l>
            <l>Doth not me hate, but dearly doth me love;</l>
            <l>And that the time will come, I truſt e're long,</l>
            <l>When God will put into my mouth a Song</l>
            <l>Of Thanks and Praiſe, then ſhall I ſee and know,</l>
            <l>My Scarlet ſins are waſh'd as white as Snow.</l>
            <l>I do confeſs, O LORD, I do confeſs,</l>
            <l>My ſins are altogether Numberleſs:</l>
            <l>But to thy only Mercy I appeal,</l>
            <l>For I am ſure that hand that ſmites, can heal.</l>
            <l>Thy Grace and Mercy is my only ſtay,</l>
            <l>For Mercies Sake I do thee humbly pray,</l>
            <l>Pardon my Sins, with Hyſſop make me clean,</l>
            <l>For Chriſt his Sake reſtore me once again</l>
            <l>To thy bleſt Favour, and I then will give</l>
            <l>My ſelf unto thee, and will ever live</l>
            <l>Unto thy glory, and will ſpend my Dayes,</l>
            <l>In killing Sin, and to my Makers Praiſe.</l>
            <l>Thy PLAGUES are on me, and thy heavy hand</l>
            <l>So ſore doth Cruſh me, that I cannot ſtand;</l>
            <l>My Enemies me daily do Revile,</l>
            <l>My Forreign Foes that hate me, laugh and ſmile,</l>
            <l>Becauſe thou doſt Chaſtiſe me with thy Rod;</l>
            <l>Are theſe the People that did truſt in God?</l>
            <l>Where is He now, ſay they, Hee'll not them Own?</l>
            <l>Both they and all their Works are fully known.</l>
            <l>My heart would break in pieces, I ſhould be</l>
            <l>Like one that's dead, but that I truſt to ſee</l>
            <l>Thy Love, thy Mercy, and thy Gracious Smile,</l>
            <l>Although I ſuffer Puniſhment awhile;</l>
            <l>I willingly ſubmit my ſelf to God,</l>
            <l>And with Humility will kiſs the Rod</l>
            <l>He whips me with: I will not take it ill,</l>
            <l>But will be ſubject to his Sacred Will;</l>
            <l>Although his hand lie on me very ſore,</l>
            <l>And DEATH himſelf ſtands vaunting at the door,</l>
            <l>And GYANT like doth Domineer and Brave,</l>
            <l>And with his Fiſt doth Fell into the GRAVE,</l>
            <l>Above FIVE HUNDRED in a ſingle day,</l>
            <l>And will have more before HE go away;</l>
            <l>Yet on my God I wholly do depend,</l>
            <l>Who in his time I know will comfort ſend:</l>
            <l>If that the Hills into the Sea was hurl'd?</l>
            <l>Or that a Fire did overſpread the World?</l>
            <l>I would not fear, I would not be diſmaid,</l>
            <l>God is my Rock, why ſhould I be afraid?</l>
            <l>He is my only truſt, my ſtaffe and ſtay,</l>
            <l>So that I may (I hope) with ſafety ſay,</l>
            <l>The LORD is my ſalvation, and my light,</l>
            <l>My GOD, my guide, my ſtrength, and eke my might;</l>
            <l>In this ſame puniſhment, methinks I ſee</l>
            <l>His tender Mercy, and his Love to me.</l>
            <l>His Strokes and Laſhes do me plainly tell,</l>
            <l>He whips me now to keep me out of Hell.</l>
            <l>I do commit my ſelf to Gods good grace,</l>
            <l>And will ſincerely ſeek his gracious face:</l>
            <l>For whom have I in Heaven but him alone?</l>
            <l>And upon Earth there is not any one,</l>
            <l>That in compariſon of him I love,</l>
            <l>My only truſt is in my God above.</l>
            <l>His ſtrength and goodneſſe nothing doth abate;</l>
            <l>For whom he once loves, he doth never hate:</l>
            <l>He doth but frown upon me now awhile,</l>
            <l>That afterwards he may more fully ſmile.</l>
            <l>I'me not forſaken, though I be caſt down,</l>
            <l>My God will but awhile upon me frown;</l>
            <l>I ſhall again be had in Reputation,</l>
            <l>And be the Glory of the ENGLISH NATION!</l>
            <l>Although my Friends are fled, and run away,</l>
            <l>And will not with me in my Troubles ſtay;</l>
            <l>But SWALLOW-like away they faſt do flie,</l>
            <l>In my diſtreſs they will not me come nigh:</l>
            <l>Though Friends do fail, yet God I truſt will never,</l>
            <l>Becauſe his mercies do endure for ever!</l>
            <l>Eaſe me good Lord, take off thy heavy hand,</l>
            <l>Theſe PLAGUES I am not able to withſtand:</l>
            <l>Conſume me not, O do not me deſtroy,</l>
            <l>Inſtead of Grief, I pray thee ſend me Joy.</l>
            <l>Come, come, good God, make haſte, do not delay,</l>
            <l>To do me good, I do thee humbly pray.</l>
