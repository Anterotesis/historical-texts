            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And at the Conference, the Lord Keeper, in the name of the house of Peers, delivered as followeth:</p>
            <p>That this Petition and Protestation of the 12 Bishops, contayning matters of high and dangerous Consequence, and such as my Lords are very sensible of, and such as require a speedy and sudden Resolution; it extending to the deep entrenching upon the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Priviledges and Being of Parliament. Therefore the Lords have thought fit, that this matter, concerning the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be communicated to the house of Commons; It being a thing of so great and so generall Concernment.</p>
            <p>This being thus communicated to the
<pb facs="tcp:96290:3"/>
house of Commons, they came to this Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, To accuse these 12 Bishops of high Treason, for endeavouring to subvert the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Laws and Being of Parliaments.</p>
            <p>And Master <hi>Glynne</hi> was ordered to go to the Lords, and at their Bar, in the name of the house of Commons, and all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England,</hi> To accuse these 12 Prelates of high Treason, for endeavouring to subvert the Fundamentall Laws of the Realm, and the very Being of Parliaments, manifested by preferring that Petition and Protestation; And to desire the Lords that they may be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with sequestred from Parliament, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to safe Custody; and that their Lordships would appoint a speedy day for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to charge them, and they to answer, for that the Commons were ready to make good their Charge.</p>
            <p>He was further ordered to give the Lords thanks for communicating this Petition, with so much affection and speed, and for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing their sense thereof.</p>
            <p>After Master <hi>Glyn</hi> had delivered this at the Barre, the Lords sent the Black Rod instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to finde out these Bishops, and apprehend them; and by 8 of the Clock at night, they
<pb facs="tcp:96290:3"/>
were all taken and brought upon their knees to the Barre, and 10 of them committed to the Tower; and two (in regard of their Age, and indeed of the worthy parts of one of them, the learned Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>) were committed to the Black Rod.</p>

            <p>They humbly remonstrate and protest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, your Majesty, and the Noble Lords and Peers now assembled in Parlament, That as they have an indubitate Right to sit and Vote in the House of the Lords, so are they (if they may be protected from force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) most ready and willing to performe their Duties accordingly.
