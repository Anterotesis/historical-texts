            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Inconveniencies of TOLERATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE is a Thing which hath often made a very Great Noise in the World; and is at the first View, a thing highly plausible; but although it looks hugely pretty in the Notion: yet it was alwayes found strangely Wild and Unmanageable when ever it came to be handled by Experience; and we shall constantly find, That those which cryed it up for the most Reasonable Thing in the world, when Themselves stood in need of it, as soon as ever They came in Power, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure to hear of it any longer. They who plead for it for Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, do not use to allow it to others; it hath always been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky, as soon as ever it hath succeeded, to be laid aside.</p>
            <p>Now Liberty of Conscience is either Absolute, and Universal, or Limited and Restrained: if Universal and Absolute, it layeth us open to all the folly and phrenzy imaginable, to all those Heresies which the Scripture calls Damnable, and is a publick Invitation to all sorts of strong Delusions, and the believing of Lyes, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> cautions us so much against, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 10, 11. And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14. 15. the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> is charged not with holding Errors Her Self, but tolerating Them in Others. Her guilt was, That She had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Her, Those who held the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> and the <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it be Limited and Restrained: Then it is no longer Liberty of Conscience; but there is a clear Confession, That Conscience is not so Sacred a Thing, but it ought to have Limits and Restraints set upon it. If it be asked, Will you force men to go against their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? I answer, That Consciences may be such, that men ought not to be suffered to act according to them. The Scripture tells us of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97171:3"/>
               <hi>Seared Consciences, Reprobate Minds;</hi> and Those <hi>whose very Mind and Conscience is defiled;</hi> So that Conscience alone is no sufficient Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Conscience hath its Rule, may swerve, and ought very well to be looked to. I know that no man ought to act against his Mind or Perswasion; But I know withall, That there ought great care to be taken, what Minds and Perswasions men are of. Thus much I thought fit to premize, Because that the Cause is thought sufficiently pleaded, as soon as ever it can be alledged, This is our Conscience: For it may be your Conscience and your Crime too.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THe First Thing which I shall observe in this Treatise, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to so much Peace, Good Will and Moderation, is the <hi>Time</hi> of its coming out, and that was the Time of an Invasion: Was this a Time to rip up and aggravate Discontents at Home, when we were set upon with a Powerful Enemy from abroad? Who but a <hi>Dutch</hi> man would have gone about to have affrighted the Credulous Vulgar, with this Canting Dismal Strain? p. 86. <hi>There are I perceive many Fears and Hopes upon the Minds of People, and the Presages of their Hearts are many: I know not whether there be any dark notices from some Spirits that preside over us, of some great Events, sometimes when they are near us: But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Minds of some have of late aboaded some very</hi> GREAT EVIL, <hi>or Great Good not to be far from us,</hi> &amp;c. He who at such a time, Proclaims the Fears of the Nation, Intended sure to make them fear much more: This way of divulging such Melancholy <hi>Omens,</hi> could have no end, but to dishearten our People, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them. I could not, me thoughts, pass by this Observation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was one Sad Instance, That the <hi>Puritan</hi> Spirit hath not at all altered his old way of Acting; For so did their Forefathers in 88 try how far they could terrifie the State at that Time, because it was a Time of great Danger.</p>

Eliz. p. 497.</note> 
                  <hi>England</hi> at this Time did labour not onely with a War Abroad, but with Schism at Home: For Schismatical Pravity never fails to add a New Combustion to the heat of War; The Contumacy, Impudence, and Contumelies of these Men did never shew it self with greater Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. <hi>Cambd.

               <p>They persumed upon the necessities of the State; then they thought they might propose and rail at pleasure, because the Queens Hands
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97171:3"/>
were sufficiently full of other business; Then came out <hi>Mar-prelate, Diotrephes,</hi> the <hi>Demonstration, &amp;c.</hi> Thus they use their Native Countrey as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> did the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> as soon as they were <hi>sore,</hi> then not fail to fall upon Them. If ever the State lies under a Disadvantage, These will not fail to help on the Disturbance.</p>
               <p>But from the time of the Publication, proceed we to the Book it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The First Thing we find Observable is <hi>p.</hi> 9, 10, 11.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THere is a company of People about Us in the Countrey, &amp;c. The most of them are certainly Inoffensive Persons, and there is no more against Them, than <hi>Pliny</hi> had against the Christians; that They meet and Preach and Pray together, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>How harmless, or Inoffensive They may seem to You, we know not: But This, nor our Neighbour Nation, hath not found Them to be such Tame and Modest Things: The Time hath been Known, when They <hi>could devour Widows Houses,</hi> as well as for a pretence <hi>make long Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Charity prompts us to hope, that there are amongst This Sect several good and well meaning People, and such which of themselves would be very harmless and inoffensive; yet, Law makers ought to consider not only what People are, or would be of Themselves, but what use others are like to make of them: It is no News for Men to be made the Instruments of a Design, and yet to know nothing of it; to be the great Engines of such businesses, which had they seen thorough Them, They would have dyed, rather than to have any thing to do with: We are therefore not only to consider the People who meet there, but who they are, which have the Managing of such Meetings; as suppose now that the <hi>separated</hi> Congregations should think those men the fittest to be Their Guides, who led them on to the late War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the chief speakers there should be the Abetters and Applauders of the Murther of the <hi>King.</hi> And these amongst Them who are of their own Nature the most harmless and Inoffensive, are the most likely there to be imposed upon: It is therefore the greatest Kindness of Government toward such Innocent Men, not to permit the Subtle and Malicious, to make a Prey of Them, and abuse their Credulity to be the Instrument of Their Teachers Contrivances. And whereas it is here said, that They <hi>Meet only to Preach and Pray together:</hi> It ought to be considered that we could repeat strange Things, which have been said in <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sermons;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we sure that They meet only to do that: we Know, that there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97171:4"/>
may be, and do verily believe, that there is a quite other use of such Assemblies, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>To Form and to Know a Party, to Communicate Intelligence and Discontents, to have a Plausible and Unperceivable way of scattering abroad among the whole Nation, all sorts of little and Malicious stories. There is no such Dangerous way of Libelling, as that which is vulgarly called a good Gift in Prayer.</q>

               <p>THe next Thing observable is <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>I wonder really in whose shops. They have bought their Spectacles, that They can see this great Thing Unity of Folks Spirits, in Uniformity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Surely Uniformity doth of all Things in the World look most like to Unity: And <hi>St. Paul</hi> recommends it to us upon this very score; <hi>That we all speak the same things,</hi> being with Him a very great Evidence, <hi>That there are no Divisions amongst Us.</hi> But because the The credit of these <hi>Glasses</hi> wherein we perswade our selves, That we see clearly U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Uniformity, doth it seems depend very much upon the Shop they came out of: We shal gratifie our Author so far, as to let Him Know whence we had Them; and to go no further, We were Advised, in the making and using of this sort of <hi>Glasses</hi> by one who we are sure, will not be denyed to be a most Skilful Work-man in such like Affairs; even the Non-conformists entirely beloved <hi>Mr. Calvin</hi> in his <hi>Epist. ad Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorem Angliae,</hi> where we have Him expressing his judgment clearly and fully for Uniformity in all its Parts, and utmost Extent of it.

               <p>The Second of these Reasons comes home to what our Author makes such a Wonder of, <hi>viz.</hi> That Uniformity is a great Degree and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Unity: And we are told a little before in the same Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle that there are a sort of seditious People in <hi>England,</hi> which all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is highly concerned to provide against, and He Describes them Thus, <q>There are (saith he) some Brain-sick People in <hi>England,</hi> who<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cerebro si qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam qui sub E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelii nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>

Uliore gladio coerceri,</hi> &amp;c.</note> under the pretence of the Gospel, bring in all sorts of disorder.</q> And his sentence is very Peremptory concerning them; that They ought, <q>To be restrained by the Avenging Sword.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now who these People are, who are complained of, as the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all order, is not surely hard to be conceived: They are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers of all order, who refuse to be under any, who will own the obligation of no Law (as to these Externals wherein order alone can have any place) but take it very ill; that they are not left wholly and altogether to their own Humour and Capriciousness, or what ever else it is possible for them to mistake for, or to pretend to be their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And now if we think that Uniformity looks like Unity, we hope the Glasses which we see this thorough, will be no longer derided, when we consider in whose shops we found them exposed to our open view, and we our selves were particularly called upon by the chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, to make use of Them for this very particular purpose and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
               <p>But that Uniformity is a Thing highly to be desired, and by all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to be endeavoured after and procured, Is a Thing which I suppose will not be denyed by that Party which is here chiefly pleaded for; Because that they have with Hands lifted up to Heaven, sworn Themselves, and not only so, but with all manner of Art and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, did perswade and force every one they had Interest in, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97171:5"/>
Power over, to Swear with them; <hi>That they would endeavour to bring the Churches of God in the Three Kingdomes, to the nearest Conjunction and UNIFORMITY in Religion, Confession of Faith, Form of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Government, Directory for Worship and Catechising.</hi> See the First Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>We have One Argument more for Uniformity, and that is, The Horrible Divisions which we have seen to arise for the want of it; and here we appeal to the Sober Part of our Adversaries, who when time was, made great Complaints of this very Thing, the sight of the hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heresies, Schisms and Scandals, which did immediately arise among Themselves, did make them cry out mightily to their <hi>Rulers</hi> for a Law, to set bounds to the Consciences of their own Brethren. Liberty of Conscience is so wild a Spirit, as no Circle will keep in order: And to speak the Truth, it is a Contradiction to own that pretence, and then to offer to set any Bounds unto it.</p>
               <p>But to draw towards a Conclusion of this Argument, we do verily believe, That Uniformity if it were carefully maintained, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently looked after, would in a few years recall our Ancient Unity; The People would quickly forget all these Fantasies, if it were not for these small <hi>Levites</hi> which are perpetually buzzing them into their ears; We should quickly see, that the People would come to the Churches, if there were not so many Conventicles to keep them thence; and if they were but used for a little while to come thither, they would not find the Liturgy to be such a fearful Idol, as they have been often told of: And I durst confidently say, That if a Tryal were made in any gathered Church about the Town, and many of our Prayers were there repeated <hi>memoriter,</hi> that that man would be accounted one of great Gifts that could pray so sweetly: It is nothing but unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness which makes them lyable to be so scared, with all those terrible and groundless Stories. And I here durst boldly appeal to Thousands, who have since the Kings Return, gone once or twice to hear the Common-Prayer out of Curiosity, and have gone ever after out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; and have much wondered at and despised their own credulity, in that they were ever brought to entertain such hard jealousies of so harmless a Thing.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>BUt we are told in the next place, That to make Laws in Religious Matters especially, (and by the same Rule in every thing else) is a thing, to say no more, perfectly insignificant and absolutely useless, For, <hi>It is a Principle of a serious tender Christian, that he would not do
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97171:5"/>
any thing for fear, which he would not out of Conscience,</hi> i. e. As these words must signifie in this place, he will do no more for the sake of the Law, than he would have done without it: <hi>And it is a deadly Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the present Injunctions, that they have a penalty annexed to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did ever any hear of a Law without a Penalty? was ever an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction drawn up in this form? These things we do enjoyn you to do; and if you do them, it shall be to you the same thing as if you let them alone. If the Church hath power to command us any thing, we need go no farther than common sense to infer; That she hath power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, if that be not done which is commanded; and now that the Church hath power to make Injunctions of this nature, We have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough from the Scripture it self, where we find out Saviour so far owning this Authority, as that he submitted to it: The Feast of the Dedication was of Institution purely humane, and yet our Lord obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it; <hi>John</hi> 10. 22. Nay farther, our Saviour did not onely observe humane Institutions, where there was no particular command in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for them; but he also did observe such as were in outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, quite different from what the Scripture hath appointed them to be in. If this seem strange to us, let us look into <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. where we find the very manner of eating the Passover plainly prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to us, to be done in a standing-Posture, and that with all the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Formality, of their Loyns girt, Shooes on their Feet, and Staves in their Hands. Now our Saviour eats it quite otherwise, in a Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture leaning, without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Loyns girt, Shoos on his Feet, or Staff in his Hand, in perfect compliance with the Uniform practise of that age he lived in.</p>
               <p>And that all good Order and Authority was not buryed with the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, is apparent from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>Let all things be done</hi>

               <p>But now suppose the Church make these Laws, how if Inferiors will not obey them? For that Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> shall be their Judge in his Epistle to <hi>Farel</hi> p. 9. <q>This hath always obtained in the Church, which hath also been decreed by the ancient Synods, that he who will not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<note place="margin">Semper hoc in Ecclesia valuit quod veteribus Synodis fuit decre<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>If this be intended to represent the Gallantry of that Party, which is here pleaded for; as being a company of Heroick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97171:6"/>
as that they may be perswaded or encouraged, but are at no hand to be frighted into any thing: We shall then say, that we never yet saw reason to believe that they were persons of such great bravery and resolution: We have heard indeed by one who knew them well (King <hi>James) That no Deserts would oblige them, nor no Oaths bind them;</hi> but we never yet heard, but they were as liable to be terrified as any other Mortals. We suppose that Mr. <hi>Love</hi> may well pass for one of these serious and tender Christians, and yet Fear prevailed so far upon him, as to make him acknowledg his great Guilt and unfeigned Sorrow for his great Offence; and own those whom he conspired against, as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority, and promise all manner of Duty and Submission, in hopes of a Reprieve; and that this was not altogether Conscience, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that when they would Reprieve him no longer, he called them Rebels and Traitors. Once again, Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> too, did recant then; and we are more sure that he did comply then, out of the principle of Fear, than we are that his not-Conforming now, proceeds purely out of a principle of Conscience. Nay, did not that whole Party lay aside all mention of the Covenant from Mr. <hi>Love</hi>'s death, till just upon the King's Restauration? Now I suppose Fear had some influence upon them in this, as well as Conscience. The truth of it is, they are like Spaniels, if they seem to love any, it is after they have been soundly beaten; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are of the basest of all Dispositions, who really love no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but yet will cringe and fawn upon any one, so long as they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of him. And if this be the character of a tender Christian, to do nothing for fear; sure we are, that the tender Christian is (of all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) the most unlikely to be found amongst those who talk so much of having tender Consciences.</p>

               <p>IN pursuance of the former Argument, we are told, p. 14.

               </p>
               <p>It is to me not a little wonder; that any one who hath but the face of a man, can pretend to complain, as if there had been any severity in enjoyning the Oath made at <hi>Oxford:</hi> And to satisfie any, whether that which is here called Banishment, (<hi>i.e.</hi> removal five miles from a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration) be a Punishment any thing less necessary for the refusing that Oath, there will be little requisite besides consulting the Oath, which follows in these words, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now it is clear, that this Oath is not an Ecclesiastical, but a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Oath, made purely for the safety of the <hi>King</hi>'s Person and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and was, with some addition, in force before; and being refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the pretence was not any thing of Disloyalty, (no, the time was not come to profess that) but because there was in it a clause for the Renouncing of the <hi>Covenant:</hi> The <hi>Parliament</hi> therefore being willing to comply, not only with their infirmity, but with their very peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, contrived the substance of the former Oath without that clause in it, only binding them to profess, That it was not lawful to bear Arms, &amp;c. <hi>ut supra.</hi> Now the refusal of such an Oath as this, wherein they are only required to swear, That they will not serve this <hi>King</hi> as they did his <hi>Father;</hi> One would think were Confiscation of goods, perpetual Imprisonment, or Banishment, in the proper sense of that Word; when lo, it is nothing but the being removed five Miles from a Corporation.

And yet even this is not exacted, as those who walk <hi>London</hi> Streets, know well enough; and now where there is so direct, so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and withal, so Merciful a Law; One would think, that instead of complaining, they should rather express their Gratitude towards the <hi>King</hi> for his so wonderful, I had almost said so Groundless an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, in not putting in execution this Act, which is so great a piece of his own security, as it is a restraint upon those who will not so much as Engage themselves, not to Destroy him and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>BUT now, p. 18. We are plainly told what there is in those Laws which doth so much offend them: First, negatively; <hi>It is not the Dignity of the Bishops, their Lordships and Revenues; It is not their Cathedrals, Organs, and their Divine Service, in what State and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence they please: It is not Common-Prayer, no nor any Ceremony of the Church, for all its significancy, if it be but a Circumstance of Worship, and no more, that could hinder most of the judicious and sober</hi> Nonconformists <hi>to come over to you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These things it seems are Lawful, and they can come over to them: It were to be wished that they would instruct their Proselytes but thus much as they here openly profess, and not for ever infuse dismal jealousies into the heads and hearts of the people, against those things which themselves own so perfectly innocent, and what they can at any time come over to: But hath not the irresistible evidence of Truth, here forced them to give up at once no less then their whole Cause, or at least, to take away all manner of colour from it? For seeing that these things are all innocent, What one thing can there possibly be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to create any longer scruple?</p>
               <p>Here is a clear Confession, That these men are guilty of the most unreasonable <hi>Schism</hi> that ever was, or ever can be in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is such a <hi>Schism</hi> which is in their own judgments utterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reason; For there is not any thing required, but what they here profess that they can come over to: The Church exacts Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to nothing but what the very Dissenters acknowledg that all the sober and judicious men among them can come over to. But are these men to be esteemed, or <hi>Sober,</hi> or <hi>Judicious,</hi> which stand out in so causless a <hi>Schism?</hi> which keep up so needless a <hi>Separation,</hi> and divide (not to say the Church, but) their Native Country, by refusing to do such things which they <hi>know</hi> and <hi>own,</hi> that they may do, and do them very unlawfully.</p>
               <p>But if these things do not keep them out, what doth? For these are all the things which the Dispute lies about; Why? <hi>It is these Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Subscriptions, and Oaths, which you impose upon them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If the former doth not hinder, I see no reason why this latter should; For, if we may do such a thing, why may we not <hi>declare</hi> that we will do it? If we do believe these things, why may we not <hi>Subscribe</hi> to them? And what is the harm of an Oath to a thing which hath no harm in it: And as to the Imposition, that alone cannot alter the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97171:8"/>
Case; For if such a thing (suppose a significant <hi>Ceremony</hi>) be in it self lawful, then the Magistrate by imposing a significant <hi>Ceremony,</hi> hath only imposed that which is a lawful thing.

               <p>We live then certainly in a very mad Age.

               <p>At this rate, there must be no <hi>Oaths</hi> at all, Because too many may be tempted to break them; but I shall not make any longer Annotations upon this, because I will not presume to vie skill with a <hi>Puritan</hi> in what belongs to the shifting out of any Oath, especially if it be a lawful one; I shall readily acknowledg, that they are, of all others, the most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Masters of that Faculty.</p>

But these different Lights and Perswasions did not hinder those godly, as well as wise Magistrates, from imposing such an Oath; but rather it was the grand cause or motive of such Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to discover who they were who were of another Perswasion, that they might be observed, and care taken of them, that they might be questioned, and, if possible, in time reduced.</p>

But of all the things which are here said in the behalf of Liberty of Conscience, I cannot chuse but smile, that it is here said to Restore the <hi>King,</hi> p. 46. Surely the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> may say, without Boasting, That Her Sons were the truest, the most constant Subjects the <hi>King</hi> had: You cannot name any other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Nation, chuse where you will, but something may be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as to their Deviation from the strict Rules of Loyalty, among the <hi>Nobility, Gentry, Citizens, Countrey-men;</hi> if there were any who were beyond their Neighbours eminently Royallists, they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise noted as eminently Prelatical: These were the men who made every other Government uneasie, by Dissenting from, and upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions Opposing of it: All other Denominations set up, courted, owned every Usurping Power, engaged, addressed, did what they could to make an Interest, vvhile the Episcopal Perswasion alwayes held off.

               <p>But if in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, you were one of those who Enjoyed the Liberty of your Conscience, we are sure that we could not Enjoy the Liberty of ours: Was not Prelacy, as well as Popery, excepted in the Instrument of Government, that Liberty should not Extend to that Perswasion? Was not the Reading Common-Prayer a thing then Prohibited? and that under no less a Penalty than Deprivation, and sometimes Deportation for the third Committing such an Offence? An Episcopal Divine was then forbidden to Preach, or so much as to keep a School. Let us remember the Major Generals, and then we shall not forget what kind of Liberty of Conscience that was <hi>which sate down, and reigned with Cromwel.</hi> This is, I must needs say, a bold way of making a Proposition to the <hi>King,</hi> to tell him of <hi>Eternizing of Cromwel.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In a Discourse which pretends wholly to Peace and Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I wonder how this comes in, being perfectly Extrinsecal to any thing which they at present have any occasion to plead for, unless they have a fancy that they cannot serve God now according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, because that the Bishops, seven years ago, were permitted to have the Letting of their own Leases.</p>
               <p>But if a <hi>Tender Conscience</hi> be that which is afraid of the very <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of Sin; How comes it to pass that they are so <hi>angry</hi> that the State did not commit Sacriledg? These men cannot be content, if the Church doth ever recover Her own, and be but once, as it were, <hi>expostliminio,</hi> restored to those Rights which they had once Robbed Her of. Not to mention Merits, or Sufferings, we only speak of the Justice of the thing. His <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Piety is indeed for ever to be Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in being thus the <hi>Church</hi>'s Nursing-Father; it had suffered for Him, and He scorned that Advice which would have had it to Suffer <hi>by</hi> Him. And as for the <hi>good works</hi> which he fancied that money might have been better employed in, Who shall secure us, that, suppose the Church had lost it, it should have been employed wholly in <hi>good works?</hi> Was not this the very Plea of <hi>Judas, Might not This have been sold for five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pence, and given to the Poor?</hi> How Charitable and Publick-Spirited are these men grown upon other mens Purses!</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Former Sacriledges have been committed upon such plausible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences as the <hi>Publick Benefit</hi> and <hi>Security;</hi> but if we consult things aright, we shall not find that the <hi>Publick</hi> ever gained by such courses, nor do we believe that it ever will; nor indeed is it fit that it should do so. While these things continue in the Church, the Publick hath a considerable Interest in them: take them away thence, and you raise some private Families, whose turn being now served, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hath no influence upon them any longer. Men may talk of the Common Good, and pretend that; but no man will be an Instrument of Sacriledg, without an eye to his <hi>Private</hi> Interest. As the Case now stands, How much of the Churches <hi>Revenue</hi> is still payable to the <hi>King?</hi> And how much more hath He the <hi>Disposal</hi> of? Now those Lands are in the hands of those who are the King's constant Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; take them away, and you may give them to those who may

immediately turn his <hi>Enemies;</hi> and if we should make an Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon experience, we might perhaps find, that those who have enjoyed the spoils of the Church, have not alwayes shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the firmest <hi>Friends</hi> to the <hi>Crown.</hi> But as to that money for <hi>Fines,</hi> which the Author speaks only about, we think it was employed about very <hi>good Works:</hi> Was not the Repairing of the Twenty years Losses of so many Learned, Pious, and Loyal Persons, of it self a very <hi>good work?</hi> The <hi>Repairing of Cathedrals,</hi> and furnishing of them, was a very <hi>good,</hi> and a very <hi>costly work:</hi> The <hi>Redemption of Captives,</hi> was a very <hi>good work:</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi>'s <hi>Favour</hi> was most humbly acknowledged in a large <hi>Benevolence:</hi> The re-building of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and <hi>augmentation of Vicaridges</hi> to eighty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> was a <hi>good,</hi> and a very <hi>great work.</hi> And to these let them add, how much was abated to the <hi>Tenant,</hi> of that proportion which any <hi>other Landlord</hi> would have taken; let us consider these things, I say, and we shall find, the summes of money which came really into the pockets of the Clergy at that time, not to have been in any proportion near that which Envy hath Suggested. I shall add but one Consideration more, which I did not joyn with the rest; because, though it was a great Loss and Charge to the Church, I can scarce reckon, to have been a <hi>good work;</hi> and that was, the Consideration, which was taken of the <hi>Purchasers,</hi> who of all men had perhaps the least rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be considered; yet so generous was the Churches mercy, as she did not only forgive, but reward those who had been the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of, and Spoilers of Her Houses and her Patrimony.</q>

What ever answer you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to so wild a Discourse, think upon and try, whether it would not justifie the Magistrates proceeding altogether as well as your own, you will find, there is a necessity of a Rule, and then your great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for each private Conscience, stating its own Liberty, is utterly and unavoidably laid aside and gone.</p>

               <p>These are fine projects, and if the Author thinks it worth his while, he may deal with those who are most concerned in his designed altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but the first of them makes us doubt, that the man may be encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be a <hi>Leveller;</hi> and so we leave him to the mercy of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords.</p>
               <p>But these Inventions do delight our Author so very much, That he thinks that they alone are security enough for the Everlasting Peace of the Nation; and they are enlarged upon, as if the man really thought that there were something in them; For, when things are brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, as he hath contrived, then there must needs for ever after, be amongst us a calm and a most setled Peace: For saith he, <hi>Where there are no hopes from Innovation, no body will go about to make it; But when a People have all that can be had,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then there will be no hopes from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation;</hi> Ergo, <hi>When these things are taken into Consideration, then shall our Government of Monarchy in this Land, (leaving the Persons of our Successive Sovereigns unto Providence and their Chances) be out of danger for future Generations.</hi>

               <p>What is here meant by (leaving the Persons of our Successive So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns unto Providence and their Chances) I wish our Author had farther explained himself; But as for his contrivance to settle things at that pass, that no body shall have hopes from, nor desire to, an Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I dare say that this Gentleman is no States-man, in that he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth such a thing so much as possible; this thing is only then to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, when there will be no Ambitious, no Revengeful, no Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, no Poor, no Mistaken man in the Nation.

               <p>If these things are really, and in good earnest against their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we are sorry for it, and do not know how to help it, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do, or when they please may do so: In the mean time, why should not this Author joyn with us, in Condemning those Preachers which infuse such needless jealousies into the Peoples heads, which himself confesseth (as we have often observed) that there is no real cause for? Himself confesseth that they are not more panick, than emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty terrors; he resembleth them to the fear of <hi>Fairies,</hi> and supposeth that there is nothing in them. But, Which, now think we, should give place? The publick Law, or the private Consciences? especially in our Case, where the Apologist owns the Law as to the matter, to be in the right, and verily believes that the Conscience as to the scruple is in the wrong. But what is now to be done as the Case stands? The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is only to a Lawful thing as it hath been often granted, but it is believed to be unlawful: I shall answer this which is the grand funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental doubt, out of the words of one of the chief Ring-leaders of that Party, (and for his sake, I hope they may meet with a fair Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Disputations about Church-Government, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>P.</hi> 483. <hi>If we do through weakness or perversness, take Lawful things to be unlawful, that will not excuse us in our disobedience, our error is our sin, and one sin will not excuse another sin;</hi> &amp; paulò post, <hi>It is their own erring judgment that intangleth them in a necessity of sinning till it be changed.</hi> with much more to the same purpose, in that whole Chapter throughout.</p>
               <p>But after all this Dispute, suppose at the last that it shold not be Conscience, and in many of their Leaders, we have great evidence, that it is not so. At the conference at <hi>Hampton Court</hi> before King <hi>James,

Dr. Reynolds, Mr. Knewstub, Mr. Chatterton,</hi> did clamour as loud about Conscience as any now do, or can. But when the Arguments upon which their Consciences pretended to be founded, were to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, all weighed and answered, there was then desired an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for some few worthy and sober men, because of their Credit: And are we sure, that Credit hath nothing to do in this Case? Men are loath to use those Ceremonies, lest they should lose the Credit of that zeal, which hath formerly appeared so much against them.</p>

               <p>And we do not at all doubt, but that if we had a mind to it, we could give one considerable Instance within the Memory of Man, how this whole Parcy here pleaded for, did unanimously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with great Vigour list themselves apace, did contribute their Persons, Prayers and Purses, toward the forming and maintaining of an Army, to say no more, not raised by the <hi>King.</hi> It doth therefore highly concern these People publickly to disown their Predecessors, and their own Principles and Practices, or else they cannot expect to be believed in This, so seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Loyal a Concession, <hi>That it is unlawful to expect deliverance from any but the</hi> King.</p>
               <p>I do not remember any other passage in this Proposition, to be at all Considerable; only one Notion he hath, which is scattered up and down his Book, that <hi>Penaltits</hi> and Rigour doth but alienate their minds farther from us; whereas Indulgence would work upon their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by degrees upon their Judgments. Now on the other side, we think, and that upon the Grounds of Experience, as well as Reason, That there is not good nature enough in them for kind usage to work upon; of this we shall give one, but that shall be a most convincing Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The <hi>Kings Majesty,</hi> immediately after his most happy Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, being desirous to satisfie so many of all Parties, as did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve for ever to remain unsatisfied, did accordingly give so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the clamours then made against the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> as to order a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of it. But withal did, by his Declaration set forth about that affair, desire, that so many of Them as would be thought Conscientious, or peaceable, would in the mean time read <hi>so much</hi> of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> as themselves had no Exception against: an easie request one would think; Read only so much as you have no Exception against: Here Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sure could not be pretended, when their own Conscience (nay their very jealousie) was the only Rule which was set Them to walk by, yet they stood it out, only because there was no danger in stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97171:15"/>
out and after all, the Act of Uniformity brought many of the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest to read the whole of that, of which before they could not be brought to read a syllable; so much is a <hi>Law</hi> more available than an <hi>Indulgence:</hi> And as many did come in that <hi>Bartholomew-tide,</hi> so (had there not been so great expectation of a Toleration) we have reason to believe, that many more would have come in.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>WE have now Considered every passage in this Treatise, which seems to be any way Material<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and must take leave to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that we are not able to guess what it is which this Author really would have; and we farther believe, that he himself cannot tell us: Nor need we desire the Laws to continue in force any longer, than till the Tender Consciences can agree what to have in the stead of them. The Penner seems in one place, to be one of the most Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and not to desire the removal of our present Constitutions, but only a temporary Indulgence toward some Persons, whom he thinks very well of, as being in his Opinion, men sober in their Judgments and in their Lives, only they have got some odd Jealousies in their Heads; which though the <hi>Apologist,</hi> is verily perswaded, <hi>that they have nothing in them;</hi> yet he would have the men born with, as being otherwise good men; and besides he thinks, that by this means there is great hopes, that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Custom may in time prevail over these acknowledgedly groundless fancies. This is his sense, <hi>p.</hi> 18. 29. 74. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But a Law, with an Indulgence annexed to it, is <hi>felo de se:</hi> It may something be resembled to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, whose feet were partly Iron, and partly Clay: (<hi>i. e.</hi>) as <hi>Daniel</hi> there interprets it, such a Kingdom shall partly be strong, and partly broken; and as it is there said that the Iron shall not mix with the Clay, so it will be here, the <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> and <hi>Non-conformists</hi> shall never care to joyn, or be heartily brought to love one another: the difference of Judgment doth unavoidably slide into distance of affection, and from the profession, we are naturally brought to mislike the Persons who are of it.</p>
               <p>Besides to Relax a Law upon the account of Conscience, or the pretences of a higher degree of Purity in the same Religion, is as much as to Proclaim the Dissenters, to be the most really Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: That those who do Conform, are meer Formalists, Time-servers, compliers with that which is uppermost; but the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> shall be taken for the Sincere men, who walk according to Light, and to keep the Gospel pure without the mixture of humane Inventions: And this alone will be a very great Temptation to many an honest, but weak
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97171:15"/>
man, who hath more Zeal than knowledg, to Enrol himself among those Men, who are allowed to differ from the Religion of the State upon the pretence of higher Purity, and greater attainments.</p>
               <p>But because that this Proposal pretends to be made very much upon hopes; that by this means, the differences will in a short time, be brought to cease of their own accord: We desire therefore to Know, how long he would have this time of Tryal last; or will he yield, that if this course doth fail, as to this promised effect, that after such a time is past, we shall have recourse to our old Laws again; and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, I wish it were Stated now, how far he would have this Indulgence reach: And that we knew certainly, what were <hi>a tender Conscience.</hi> Shall it be sufficient to pretend a Scruple at the Law? or is there any other Rule to know this by? Or must we believe every one who saith, he doth scruple it: St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, <hi>There be some who speak Lies in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, because of advantage:</hi> Who now shall distinguish, unless there be some other Judge, beside the party concerning whom this question may arise? I desire farther to know, whether this pretence shall reach absolutely and universally to all sorts of Consciences, and all manner of pretences of them, or else Limitedly, and Restrainedly to such a sort or number of them. And we would fain know certainly, what those sorts, kinds and numbers are. Let our Author pitch upon which of these two Members of the Division he pleaseth, and then try if with either of them, he can bring his whole Party to subscribe: This we all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to have, and thus much we will be content with; we are sure that the Sectaries will not be content with one; and we are sure that the time was, when the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> would not endure the other; And this very Author seems much Divided in the Points<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one while, he seems only for an accommodation between Us and the sober Protestant, by which soft phrase he understands the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and while he is in this mood, he explodes the wildness of the Sectary, and compares <hi>him and the Papist to the upper and nether Jaw of Destruction, opening her Mouth upon Us,</hi> p. 7.</p>
               <p>But in another place, he is plainly of another mind, pleading earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and openly for that <hi>Liberty of Conscience, which sate down and Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with</hi> Cromwel, <hi>p.</hi> 45. and that we know was down-right Sectarism; now it is but reasonable for us to demand, which of these two Pleas he would stick to; both he cannot have, because they are Inconsistent, and if the Law would consent, yet these two distant Pleas will not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree, but must necessarily everthrow each other.</p>
               <p>It highly concerns all those who are for making Alterations in Laws
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97171:16"/>
and Governments, to consider what it is they are about, and whether their present contrivances are like to carry them, lest they unawares bring things to such a pass, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves will be most sorry to see them at. Of all Projects, Innovation doth most often fail the hopes conceived of it, The Beginners being frequently ashamed before they come half way to the end; and it must needs always be so, because such a work is not to be carried on, but by great multitudes of several Interests and Inclinations; the greatest part of which must necessarily be disappointed, and consequently discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so many unforeseen accidents do perpetually arise, in a business of this nature; new people and new principles coming every day in Play, that the First beginnings are become utterly at a Loss, they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly out-gone and presently after laid aside. But not to carry this observation farther than our present business, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> however they may joyn now in the making of this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let it be but once granted, and they shall immediately differ upon the nature and bounds of it: late experience hath given us abundant Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that neither of these, have reason to trust one another: The one only meaning to change us into another sort of Government: The latter, not enduring any such thing: All <hi>Europe</hi> is witness, that nothing but the fear of a common Enemy, or a common Force over them, is able to keep <hi>the Godly of all Judgments</hi> from running foul one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If we should now ask a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> if he would be willing to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted accessary to the infinite number of Heresies, Schisms and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals which will immediatly, and unavoidably arise, if every one be left to walk according to their own Light and Conscience, he will answer, Far be it from him, to be guilty of so horrid a thing; he hath Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Preached, Written, bore Testimony against, so sinful and Intolerable a Toleration. And on the other hand, go to the <hi>Sectary</hi> and ask him, Is this your meaning, only to change our Form of Government, for another you like better of? he will answer, no by no means: They are all alike of humane Invention, and so alike blameable; besides, they will abhor to be oppressed by those of their own Party, while they Act but in pursuance of their common Principle; and this you shall have more fully, in the words of the common Champion and Patron of them, both about this very Argument and concerning the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, Had not they (viz.</hi> the Presb.) <hi>laboured but lately under the weight of Persecution? and was it for them to sit heavy upon others? Is it Ingenuous to ask Liberty, and to give it? what greater Hypocrisie than
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97171:16"/>
for those who were oppressed by the</hi> Bishops, <hi>to become the greatest oppressors themselves, so soon as the Yoak was removed?</hi> Oliver Cromwel <hi>in his speech at the Dissolution of one of his Parliaments,</hi> 1654. p. 18. These therefore, however they may now piece up into one, are really two Parties, have Designs absolutely inconsistent; that which soever prevailes, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is like to have little joy of it.</p>
               <p>But as it is Evident, that neither of these will Tolerate each other; so there is no reason, why the Magistrate should Tolerate either of them: And first, For the <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> the reason is clear, because he will Tolerate no body else, as appears plainly by the Covenant: and if you will have one shameful Instance of their Rigour, remember how they had the face to deny to that <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of Blessed Memory, the <hi>attendance of his own Chaplains;</hi> He must make use of their way of Devotion, or by their Consent, He must have none at all; give me such another Instance of Barbarity, and seek it where you can.</p>
               <p>After this, it is needless sure to give you another Instance of their rigour, indeed of their Inhumanity; but yet we must do it, to shew their constant temper. Deposing of Kings comes but seldom, therefore we shall see what private men are to expect from them; <hi>They have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to admit to the Communion, or to pray for people lying on their Death-bed, only for not taking the Covenant; have declared that all Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subscribers were Atheists:</hi> These mild inoffensive people, who must be dealt so tenderly with, because of their weakness, have preached it publickly, <hi>That Episcopacy must not only be pulled up, but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops must be hanged up before the Lord, and that the bloodiest and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est War was to be endured, rather than the least error in Doctrine, or in Discipline.</hi> See the large Declaration concerning the <hi>Scots,</hi> p. 404.</p>
               <p>And how the Magistrate is particularly concerned to reduce these men to order, appears from the Insolencies they have committed and defended against him, when they have been cited to appear before the King and His Council, for some of these seditious Preachments; <hi>i. e.</hi>

               <p>Having now done with these, the toleration of the Sects will I hope be d spatched easily. The Mother Sect being laid aside, the lesser under
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97171:17"/>
ones will not hope to stay behind: And surely if the Magistrate love Religion or himself, he will not be perswaded to tolerate these nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. First, for Religion, who seeth not that this Artifice makes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion weak and despicable by the being crumbled into so many pieces? it renders it most ridiculous by being so exposed to all sorts of dotage and imposture. What can possibly give unbelievers a more jnst and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occasion of scorn than this, that every one who hath but a freak in his brain, shall have free liberty if he pleaseth, to Christen it à mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit? when every thing that is most extravagant, may have Licence at pleasure to recommend it self <hi>as a degree of farther Light.</hi> Here we shall see men <hi>shaking</hi> all day, as if the Spirit came to them in Convulsions; there we shall see them run naked about the Streets as if with the Old Man they had put off all degrees of Modesty. But these things cannot perfectly be described, because they may vary every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no man living being able to tell how many more absurdities this may come to in the very next moment. Whether the Sects be fit to be tolerated, can only then be reasonably determined, when we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain how many, and what they are. And as to the outward part of the Magistrates care in this business, who shall secure us, that this Liberty of Conscience may not in a while be pleaded for, as to <hi>moral transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions?</hi> also according as the Light doth farther encrease upon them, <hi>Quid quod de furtis quo<expan>

               <p>Now that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> will find himself to be highly concern'd what <hi>opinions</hi> any numbers of men shall once come to profess in his <hi>Dominions.</hi> is hence evident, because that <hi>Opinions</hi> have a very great influence upon <hi>Actions:</hi> He who is allowed to raise a Sect, hath a very fair opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty put into his hands of making himself Head of such a Party, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to have their Consciences, he will find it no hard matter, to have their <hi>Persons</hi> and their <hi>Purses</hi> at his own disposal too. Hence it is, though some Princes have been sometimes forced to suffer dissenters from the Established Profession; (by reason that they were so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or so subtle, that they could not go about to suppress them without discovering how unable they were to do so) yet they always looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97171:18"/>
such <hi>Dissenters,</hi> as the next door to <hi>Enemies;</hi> and accordingly had perpetual eye and guard upon them, as those who were of all other the most likely to be the Authors, or occasion of the next disturbance. It is a great mistake, to imagine that Sects are things to be despised, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that men of Parts and Breeding are not easily nor usually the first which are seduced by them; we shall grant that its beginning, nay, and its greatest growth are amongst the meanest people, those whose for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are low as their understandings; but perhaps it may not end there neither; but like a <hi>Pestilence</hi> which may begin in an obscure Alley, and yet in a while no part of the City or Kingdom may be free from it: Besides, are not the vulgar People the Hands and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the greatest must always make use of? and a Deception got amongst them, may by a little Connivance multiply so fast, as to be able to dispute for Superiority, and instead of longer <hi>demanding</hi> an <hi>Indulgence,</hi> they may in a little time refuse to <hi>give</hi> one; and by how much the ordinary sorts of People are less masters of Reason, by so much the easier may they be set on in those courses, which are absolutely unreasonable.</p>
               <p>The safety of all Governments doth Depend upon This, That it is certainly stronger than each single Person; and for all sorts of Unions and Joyning Heads and Forces together, that There be no such Things, but under the Guidance of the Magistrate, and by His appointment: And then be the Discontented Persons never so many, yet so long as They have <hi>no</hi> way of <hi>Uniting,</hi> They are but so many single Persons, Scattered, Weak and Insignificant, having no means of any Common Councel, They can never joyn in any Common Design. But let them once have any one <hi>Phrase,</hi> to know one Another by, any <hi>setled Place</hi> for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Meetings, and a Set and <hi>Known</hi> Company for Them to Meet with; or any Bond whatever, which doth Unite Them, and They presently become a <hi>Distinct People</hi> and begin to be Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as having an Interest and Counsels of their own, which the Government is not the Manager of, nor Privy to; but shall quickly find it self highly concern'd, by all means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against.

                  </note> Some Confederations, Conspiracies, and Associations, things certainly which the Government had need to be much aware off. And it is a very vain thing to Imagine, that those who profess such great niceness of Conscience, whatever their opinions be, they will use none but lawful wayes to promote them: It is rather true, that they will reckon all wayes lawful, by which it is possible, that they may promote them.</p>
               <p>Let it once be permitted to crafty, active and talking men, to Instill into the minds of all sorts of people the necessity, usefulness, or the rare excellency of any one thing, or Contrivance whatever beyond all that which the present Laws and establishment doth provide for: and is not here a most readily prepared matter for any bold <hi>Bontefeu</hi> to work upon, who will take upon him to help the Nation immediatly to this so fine a thing: Hath not any such undertaker, a vast and already formed party in all parts of the Nation? Let him but represent it to them, that the present Government is the only rub which is in their way between them and this their so fancied happiness, and what will be a consequent resolution; but let us remove that obstacle, so publick a good is much to be preferred sure before any particular form or family, the welfare of the Nation is the great End, and Governors themselves were created but in order to that, and consequently are to cease as often as that End can be better attained without them.</p>
               <p>Though the pretence be nothing but <hi>Conscience,</hi> yet every discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will joyn to make the cry most loud and general. <hi>Schismes</hi> do of themselves naturally grow into Parties, and besides are most plausible occasions for any else to joyn unto them. The <hi>gathered</hi> Churches are most excellent materials to raise new <hi>Troops</hi> out of: and when they are thus far prepared they are at the service of any one who will attempt to lead them on.</p>
               <p>If <hi>All</hi> men were Wise and Honest, if every one understood well and would act accordingly, it were then perhaps reasonable enough to leave things clearly to Conscience, as the very best Rule we could possibly think of: But let us adde, that if this would supersede the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the coercive power of our Laws in Religious matters, it would do this much more in all civil Ones: For no Laws, which ever were or can be in the world, can provide in any degree for those large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Justice, Equity and Fair dealing, which would infallibly every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where be to be met with, if we were sure that men would alwayes have a care to keep a good Conscience: Truth, Justice, Temperance, &amp;c. are things which every mans Conscience doth, and must needs tell him
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97171:19"/>
are his Duty. Yet were it not for the fear of <hi>Laws</hi> we should find that Conscience is not <hi>alone</hi> to be trusted, even in these things which are her Natural, her most familiar Objects. And if we see that she doth daily praevaricate in these plain and obvious things where she is so easily sound out; we have no great cause to trust to her fidelity: that she will not also dissemble in those things which are more remote and obscure, and hidden so far from the best of our discovery. Let those therefore who plead for <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> consider, that there are <hi>Two sorts</hi> of men which ought to be provided against, to keep this Contrivance of theirs from being absolutely the most senseless and dangerous in the whole World: and we profess our selves unable upon their grounds to provide against them, <hi>viz.</hi> Those who do <hi>pretend</hi> Conscience; and those who <hi>abuse</hi> it. And there is a <hi>Third</hi> sort likewise which some care ought to be taken of, <hi>viz.</hi> Those <hi>vast</hi> numbers which are every day still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lyable to be more and more abused by such Pretences. Those Laws are not fitted for the Temper of this World, which proceed upon this Supposition, That every one who looks demurely is presently in good earnest, That men say nothing but what they think. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that it is very possible for men to Personate, and then we shall not be so eager to desire a general licence for every one who hath a mind to become a publick Cheat.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Inconveniences</hi> likewise, which such a <hi>Toleration</hi> will bring upon a <hi>Temporal</hi> account, will be very great and very <hi>Universal:</hi> not a City, not a Parish, nay perhaps not a Family free from them. And we shall quickly see what a sad pass things will come at, if the unconsidering part of mankind shall ly thus exposed to every one who will go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</p>
               <p>And then from these diversities of Judgments, and many times when it is only <hi>different</hi> forms of speaking, there will immediately arise great distances of affection: for these <hi>divisions</hi> of Reuben <hi>there will</hi> presently <hi>be great thoughts of Heart,</hi> Surmisings, Censures, Jealousies, Railings, Evil-speakings, Animosities, Peevishness, Malice, perverse Disputings, and every evil way, each Congregation will have some one little Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which all its Proselytes must be known by, which all their thoughts must be always running upon, and every body else must needs come up too. The smallest gathered Church cannot hold its Members together, unless it hath some particular thing to engage them upon, and to have them known by: For they cannot with any face separate from all Mankind, but they must have something to say for it.</p>
               <p>This Contrivance, however it be absurd and dangerous, will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97171:19"/>
that, have alwayes many who will be very fond of it, for it is a most ready way for every forward fellow to think himself some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in that he is got into such a Sect; and then he thinks, that if he can but improve the notion a little farther, he shall then be the more taken notice of: and if he finds that his Addition is but a little taking, he will then forsake his Masters to set up for himself; divide from that Church of which he is now so precious a Member, to gather a purer of his own: And so this <hi>Light</hi> will serve most bravely for himself to shine in.</p>
               <p>But if this had been a new Invention, its Contrivers might then have been allowed to have entertained huge hopes of it, but alas, it hath been often tryed and always brought great confusion along with it: and therefore there was then great care taken by the <hi>Romans,</hi> what Religion their subjects were of, one of the ancientest Laws; we read of, <hi>Separatim nemo habessit Deos, neve novos, sed ne advenas nisi publicè ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scitos privatim colanto.</hi> Tul. l. 2. de legibus. XII TABLES. This was an especial part of <hi>AEdiles</hi> care. <hi>Ne qui nisi Romano Dii, neque alio more quaem patrio colerentur, Liv. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 155. Easily concluding that as soon as ever they had another Religion, their Countrey had lost the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter half of them. In variety of worship the one must needs reckon the other Erroneous, perhaps Impious; and then how lamentably must that City be divided, whose Inhabitants think themselves bound as they love God to hate one another: and it hath been often seen that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy hath crept in at their intestine divisions, and destroyed both; while the one did not enough care to help the other.</p>
               <p>Be our Apprehensions concerning Divine matters never so different, I grant that we ought not for the sake of them to want the dutyes of common humanity; we shall grant that so to do, is a great error. But alas! it is too general a one; and law-makers are to consider not only what men ought, but what they use to do. Why shall I fight (saith one) for a Prince who is an Idolater? And why should I (saith another) take any care to relieve that City which is only a Bundle of Schismaticks? And what was the policy of <hi>Jeroboams calves</hi> think we but this? He did not cast of the true God, but only set up another way of Worship, as easily concluding, that if I can but perswade them to be of another religion, I shall easily keep them to be another Kingdom; do but divide their Faiths, and the Nations will never care to unite again.</p>
               <p>And pray tell me, what shall a <hi>Prince</hi> do in that case, where there are divers wayes of <hi>Worship</hi> allowed, and frequented in the same Nation? Shall he discountenance the professors of any one, by keeping them out of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97171:20"/>
all Office and Employment? If so, he disobligeth that whole Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, loseth so many hearts, who sure will think themselves to be very hardly dealt with in that they are disrespected, only out of their Zeal to God, and because they follow the <hi>best of their Light.</hi> And what will they think of such a State, which doth refuse to employ them merely upon this account, because (in the words of our Author) they use all manner of means to save their Souls? Or <hi>secondly,</hi> shall the Prince carry himself equally and indifferently toward all Perswasions, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and prefer them all alike? This can hardly be, because he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self must be of some <hi>One,</hi> and that will think it self not fairly dealt with if it hath not some preheminence; And when he endeavours to shew himself indifferent to all perswasions, it will then be said, that he makes use of all Religions for his own Ends, but himself really is of none; and so perhaps none of them will be really for him: And thus by endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to displease neither party, he shall certainly displease them both; at least the Zealots of all sides will represent him at the best as one Lukewarm, and so only fit (as it is in the <hi>Revel.) to be spit out at their Mouths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men may talk of their fine projects as long as they please, but surely where the Church is already so setled, as that it hath a great dependance on the Government, and the Government hath a standing influence upon that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those Politicks must needs be very strange which go about to alter such a Constitution, and instead of a Clergy thus regulated, it is no kindness sure to the <hi>Monarchy</hi> to set up such a Ministry which shall depend chiefly upon the <hi>People.</hi> And when the whole method of the Preachers maintenance, and reputation, must be the various Arts, by which he can either guide or follow the several humours of each of his Congregation; No man can tell what it is possible for a good Crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master to perswade the multitude unto.</p>
               <p>As to our particular case, if these People, what this book pleads for, had barely a <hi>Toleration,</hi> I do not know that it would satisfy them; I suspect it may increase their number, and so enable them in a while to demand much more, and when they are a little stronger, their way would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not only true but absolutely necessary. <hi>vid. Bancrof.</hi> dangerous <hi>positions,</hi> and practices. <hi>pag.</hi> 108.</p>
               <p>For however they do now speak us fair, and tell us, that the things imposed are all lawful, and all that they desire is, that some persons may in pity be borne with who do not think them to be lawful, yet we shrewdly suspect that they teach their Proselytes much <hi>otherwise;</hi> for the people as long as ever they have been under these mens Tutourage,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97171:20"/>
are not yet altogether so mad, as to make so great and withal so needless a separation: If their Teachers would but let them know so much, that these things are all lawful, which all this clamour and scruple is made about; they would never I say, be perswaded to have all these heart burnings and jealousies, to fight and make parties against that Church, which in these its chiefest adversaryes esteems, held or practised nothing which was at all blame-worthy, any otherwise than as its Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters by mistake conceived it to be so. No certainly, the poor people are without doubt still led on with those obsolete and forsaken pleas of <hi>Popery, Superstition, Will-Worship,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which though their Teachers know, and here confess to be nothing, yet I doubt they will not let their Disciples know so much: they are perswaded that we are <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and have been more than once animated to execute the rigor of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law upon us for it: and when the next opportunity offers it self, we shall be called <hi>Babylon</hi> once more, and then the consequent will be as formerly, <hi>Happy shall he be who taketh thy Children and dasheth them against the stones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In one word then, to allow this pretence of Conscience is no way prudent, because there is no probability that it can produce any good effect: It is a thing, of which you shall never be able to see a good end. <hi>Toleration</hi> then upon the whole matter is very unnecessary at this time, because the Impositions in the Apologists own Judgment are very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it is very unsafe, because we know not how great Evils it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; we have shewed, that they will not tolerate each other, and that the Magistrate hath no reason to tolerate either of them, it brings great scandals upon Religion, and must needs breed great quarrels in the State. And lastly, If it were granted, themselves are not yet agreed about its Nature and Bounds, and so if we should at present give it, they would as yet be at a very great loss what to do with it. Let us then be permitted to continue as we are; seeing it is not agreed in what manner we shall be altered, and the Alterations proposed by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor<note place="margin">A Discourse of the Religion of <hi>England</hi> asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity setled in <hi>ITS DUE LATITUDE</hi> is the stability &amp; advancement of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Lately printed.</hi>

               <p>There was another <hi>TREATISE</hi> lately <hi>Published</hi> concerning the <hi>due Latitude</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> that Author is likewise concerned to fix his own Latitude, and let us know how much it is; that he and his whole Party will be content with,

I shall make no present observations upon him, but only lay down <hi>two</hi> of his own <hi>Concessions</hi> by which he hath clearly given up his whole Cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first is,</hi> p. 28. Such is the complicated condition of humane affairs, that it is exceeding difficult to devise a Rule or Model that shal provide for all whom Equity will plead for. Therefore the Prudent and Sober will acquiesce in any Constitution, that is in some good sort proportionable to the Ends of Government. <hi>If so, they are in this Authors judgment neither Prudent nor Sober men, who call so loud for a</hi> Toleration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second is,</hi> p. 38. Nevertheless, if when all is said, some dissatisfaction doth invincibly possess the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, In that case, Christian Humility, and Charity as well as Discretion, adviseth such Persons to acquiesce in their private Security and Freedom, and not to reach after that Liberty, that may unsettle the Publick Order, and undermine the common Safety. <hi>If so, those men want Humility, Charity and Discretion, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a publick Liberty for their Consciences,</hi>
