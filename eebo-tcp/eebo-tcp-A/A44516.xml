            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe Book-seller being upon Printing a second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>HAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PY ASCETICK, or BEST EXER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISE,</hi> I thought it
<pb facs="tcp:30245:3"/>
might not be amiss, in order to make those Exercises more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, to adde some Prayers, and Aspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby Souls enamour'd with those pleasing <hi>Severities,</hi> might be enabled to arrive to a greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility in the practice of them. I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at first to adde them to the Book, but the Devotions, swelling under my
<pb facs="tcp:30245:3"/>
hand, I was upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, to let them come forth in a Treatise by it self. Though the Age we live in be full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diseases, and Impiety be mounted up to a very great height, yet in the midst of this crooked and perverse Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, there are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and those of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:30245:4"/>
too, who seem am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to emulate the Holiness of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> and the Sanctity of the Primitive Christians; and as we have reason to bless God, who lets such Wheat thrive in the large spot of ground that is over-run with Weeds, so it is but necessary, we should upon all occasions, strengthen and help their Faith, who like
<pb facs="tcp:30245:4"/>
               <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> do not onely preserve their innocence, but by a secret Fire working in their Hearts, rise to more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fervours. As in all other Sciences, there are young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who are arrived to perfection, so it is in Religion; There are <hi>Children</hi> in Grace, as well as <hi>Young men</hi> and <hi>Fathers;</hi> and as no
<pb facs="tcp:30245:5"/>
man can be so weak, as to imagine, that I design these Helps for the greater Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in goodness, so without my telling him, the Reader may guess, that these Crut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are intended for the weaker Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any benesit by them, I have my wish. To assist such, I was willing to let
<pb facs="tcp:30245:5"/>
these <hi>Devotions</hi> come abroad, not for the goodness of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure, but to put more Oyl to those Lamps, which alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>shine before men,</hi> that they may go on like the Sun unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and be ready, against a cry is made at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night;

               <p>O God Gracious and Merciful! who givest power to the Weak, and strength to the Feeble; who knowest the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30245:8"/>
of my Heart, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness of my Soul to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Duties; who understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest all my Wants, and art acquainted with all my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, behold how loth my Soul is to have her conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven, and what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses my Flesh makes to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my mind from frequent addresses to thy Mercy-seat. I entreat thee to apply thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Hand to my sickly Soul, and to fill it with Spiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Oh give me a praying Spirit, and let my Soul follow hard after thee! Teach me to make a Spiritual use of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and instruct me to see the Creator in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30245:8"/>
Lord, free my Spirit from the bondage of the Flesh, that it may mount up cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to thy Throne upon all occasions. Direct my Mind to look up in all my Actions, and let me take notice of the Operations of thy Hand in all occurrences whatsoever. Let thy good Spirit help my infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and when I know not what to say, my dearest Lord, suggest unto me how to fill my Mouth with Arguments. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with the art of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting good out of every thing. O that I had that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual temper, which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline me to think of God, whenever I behold the works
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30245:9"/>
of Creation and Providence! How sweet is it to walk with God! O let no company be so pleasing to me as thine! Make me desirous to embrace all opportunities to reflect on thy Perfections and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Thou hast both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and promised spiritual Wisdom; O bestow upon me that excellent gift, that I may know, how to glorifie thee in this world, and arrive at last to that glory which thou hast promised to them that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and continue faithful unto death, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

               <p>OThou who dwellest in the Heavens, and yet humblest thy self to behold the ways of the Children of men! Thou hast been graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleased to reveal thy Will to me, and given me Rules to walk by; Rules, which if a man follows, he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30245:10"/>
shall live for ever. How sweet are thy Testimonies! They enlighten the Eyes, and give understanding to the Simple. How glorious is that Soul in thy sight, that makes thy Will a Lanthorn to her Feet, and a Light unto her Paths! Lord in these pleasant Paths I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to walk; there is nothing like them. They end in peace. I read of those who have found it so, they could not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken. Thy Spirit inflamed their Souls. They have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their lives to attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. O the Serenity! O the Calmness of mind! O the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Joy, they found by wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Paths of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness!
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30245:10"/>
Why should not I take of this Tree of Life, as well as they, and live! This, O Lord, I often think of, and see great loveliness in all this, But my Will is weak, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions faint: When I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, I meet with Waves and Billows, that dash my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. O thou, whose power is infinite, open thy Store-house, and furnish me with Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to defend my self against all assaults from the world, or the Devil! O strengthen these feeble Knees: Hold up these weary Hands. I desire to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee; let thy Spirit list me up, and cause me to run. Touch my Will with thy Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30245:11"/>
that it may bow to thy Commands. Manifest thy Power in my weakness; give me courage to purpose, and to fulfil my purposes. When I would flinch in my resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do thou support me. When my Will would start back like a broken Bow, come in with thy Salvation. Endow me with power from on high; through thee I shall do valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: through thee I shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overcome all difficulties. O leave not my Soul in misery: Send from above and take me, draw me out of many Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; send out thine Arrows, and scatter my vain Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. With thee I will run

               <p>O Thou whose Wisdom cannot by searching be found out! who hast made me a rational creature, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me power to think of all thy wondrous Works. What excellent Objects dost thou set before me! Objects to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and edifie my Soul! O that my ways were directed to

keep thy Statutes! O that my Soul might ever dwell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side those still Waters! O teach me the art of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Give me a large and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive Mind. Awaken my slumbring Soul. Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it to fix upon adequate objects. My Soul is a Spirit, O let it delight in things agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its nature. Since my Mind must be busie about something, let it be employed in things that make for its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Peace. Oh! how fickle are my Thoughts! how inconstant my Contemplations! How soon, and how easily is my Mind drawn away from spiritual things! To thee I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30245:13"/>
flee, O hide me to save me. Let my Treasure be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that my Heart may be there also, O spiritualize my Affections, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to be where thou art. Let spiritual Objects become lovely, amiable, and charming in my eyes. Did I love them, I should think of them: Were they dear and precious to me, how could I forbear contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating of them! O let their beauty appear to me. Take away the Veil from my Face, which hinders me from seeing him that's altogether lovely. Encline my heart to thy Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Anoint mine Eyes with Eye-falve, that I may see
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30245:13"/>
greater loveliness in things that are not seen, than in those which are seen. My Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is dark, O enlighten it. Clarifie it with thy Beams. Let me hate vain Thoughts; but thy Law let me love. O let me not grudge the time that I spend in Meditation. Assure me, that this is Balsom to my Soul, and that by these means the lines will fall to me in pleasant places, and I shall have a goodly Heritage. The righteousness of thy Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is everlasting, O give me understanding and I shall live. There is Beauty, there is Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, there is Life in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Objects. O let me find them

sweeter than honey unto my taste.

O give me a fight of that Wealth, which is not liable to Corruption: I shall find it in the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gospel. Thou hast said, the pure in Heart shall see God. O purifie my Soul from fleshly Lusts which war against it, that I may see, and discern what thou hast laid up for them that fear thee: and seeing it, may long after an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

               <p>O Thou Lofty and Holy one, who inhabitest E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and dwellest in the high and holy place, with him also that is of an humble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit! Whether shall I go, but to thee who hast the words of eternal life! How shall I get this humble Spirit, but by thy power and influence! Ah! how proud is my Heart! how loth am I to submit to thy will! how loth to think ill of my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30245:15"/>
self! how loth to bear inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries! how loth to converse with thy poor members! How loth to be sensible of my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours! How loth to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a fault! And yet all this while, I believe that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdest the proud afar off, and that nothing is more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thy sight! How apt am I to admire my self! How apt to harbour high conceits of my endowments! How apt to hunt after the praise of men! And what is all this but Wind? What is it but Smoak, and Air, and Vanity? How suddenly do these things grow, and how suddenly do they die again! How sensual, how carnal must
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30245:16"/>
that Soul be, that minds such things! How void of a sense of greater beauties! how little affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, how little touched with the honour that comes from God! How weak in Grace! how feeble in Religion, that hath not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned yet to leap over such Straws! This is my case, O Lord; I am that weak, that empty Soul, and yet unwilling to confess that I am proud, and vain, and lifted up: Pity me, O my God; make me sensible how far I am from the Kingdom of God, till Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity brings me neerer. Crush whatever proud Thoughts and Desires thou spyest in me. O put me in mind of my
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30245:16"/>
Duty, whenever any vain thoughts rise in my Soul. Pull down in me all Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that exalt themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ Jesus. O let not my Heart be haughty, nor mine Eyes lofty; neither let me exercise my self in things too high for me. Give me a sight of mine own vileness. Let me not be cheated with false colours. Let thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness overaw my Soul. Let the example of my Saviour work upon me. How shall I be his Disciple, and think of my self above what I ought to think. Let God arise, and let all my vain Conceits of mine own worth be scattered.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30245:17"/>
What am I but a handful of Dust! What am I but a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and thy pensioner, and who lives upon thy charity! O let these thoughts subdue my Soul. Make me as ambitious of an humble Spirit, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mind, as others are of the greatness and admiration of the world. Humility will make me great and honourable in thy sight. Let that honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent me, let that priviledge sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my Soul. O let a deep sense of my guilt humble me; Then shall I with the Penitent Prodigal be welcome in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, and my Soul shall live, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of making so light of things which have been offensive, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30245:20"/>
contrary to thy Holiness. Fool that I was, to imagine that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing can be trivial and light which thou hast forbid! Can any Order or Precept pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from thee, but what is the product of eternal deliberation? Can any thing be needless which thou set'st thy Hand &amp; Seal to? What low thoughts must I have of thy Wisdom! What mean conceptions of thy Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if I harbour such Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations! Dull blockish crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that I am, when every Law thou makest, and every Work thou doest, and every Providence that comes to pass, is done according to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal counsel of thy Will, built

upon the strongest Pillars of Reason, and is an effect of the brightest, clearest, and most unbyassed Understanding, how can any thing be little and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable that thou do'st command. But alas! These are but the pretences of my Lusts! they are loth to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their pleasures, and therefore suggest such feeble Arguments. A little sin! what nonsence is there in that word! Why shouldest thou prohibit it? why shouldest thou warn, entreat, and beseech me not to do it, but that thou who knowest all things, knowest it to be prejudicial to my Soul. It's a sign I esteem, I prize

thee not. Did I truly look upon thee as the loveliest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and my onely and greatest Benefactor, I should be afraid of a disorderly thought. O let me never judge of sin any more by the sickly fancies of carnal men, but by the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy Nature: And as thou, my God, who hast cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me, art holy, so let me be holy in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. O let me not dally with sin any more, nor make sport with it because the world calls it little, but let it be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to me, that thou my God dislikest it, and make me entirely conformable to thy Will. Give me, O thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

of every good thing, just apprehensions of my duty. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease my love to thy Name, and my hatred of sin will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. O that I were more ravished with thy beauty! how odious would every thing be to me that is injurious to thy Glory! O the infinite obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations I have to love thee, and yet how cold is my Heart! and because it is cold, I startle at nothing but the greater sins. O let me remember that I am a Christian, and have vowed my self to thy service, and let me serve thee in keeping even of the least of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Discover to me the equity and reasonableness of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30245:22"/>
every Precept, that I may plead no excuses, no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but break through all obstacles, to express my love. O let me esteem all thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts concerning all things to be right, and let me hate every false way. Nothing can be lovely that thou forbiddest. Nothing can be sound that thou accusest of rottenness. Nothing can be safe that thou warnest me against! I have found the ways of sin false indeed; false as Hell. When I have thought to step into the bed of pleasure, I have rush'd into a Gulph of misery. When I have hoped to fill my self with content and satisfaction,

Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish from me all sourness of Spirit: Let all bitterness and wrath die in me. Let all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice flee away from my Soul. Rid me of that ill nature which lodges in me. Let gentleness and meekness be the welcome guests in my Heart. Make me peaceable and tractable, easie to be intreated, full of good works, ready to forgive. Let the Charity of the Lord Jesus be my guide, and let me

I believe thou interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest for me in Heaven! what favourable constructions must I suppose are put upon my Actions in that intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!

me to certain duties, of which thou wilt take an account one day. O convince me that I am not called to idleness, but to labour in thy Vineyard. When my carnal heart would baulk the work, thou hast set me, in the station I am in, let thy good Spirit crush my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness, and manifest his power in my weakness.

               <p>O Holy and most Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Saviour, who hast given us the best Religion, the wholesomest Rules of living, the most equitable Precepts that were ever given to the children of men; while I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire thy Mercy, I cannot but bewail mine own Misery. While I wonder at thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and tenderness to my Soul,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30245:53"/>
I cannot but deplore my back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness to the stricter Duties of Christianity! How loth am I to curb this Body! How loth to bring my Flesh in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection! How apt am I to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my self, that Heaven will come cheaper, than at the price of Mortification! O when will these vain Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions leave me! When shall I get the temper of thy dearest Servants! How sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishly do I serve thee! How apt am I to make Bargains with thee, and to limit my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. I want that free, that Princely Spirit, that fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent love, which may think nothing too good for Heaven.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30245:53"/>
Lord, shew me the vanity of my over tenderness to this dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body. I am sensible, that when I feed it high, it teaches my Soul to rebel against thee! O let me not be afraid of the Arguments it gives me to spare my self. These are but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, the designe is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve its own ease and quiet in Sin, and Vanity. Let me see through all these Cobwebs, and perswade me to keep under my Body, lest I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a cast away: Let my Fasts have those good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon me, which they have had upon thy Saints of old. Let my Lusts dye, my Corruptions decay, my Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30245:54"/>
become odious to me. Let Holiness become sweet, the Light of thy Countenance pleasant, and the Influences of thy Grace ravishing to my Soul. Let my abstinence from Food work in me abstinence from evil. Let it prove a means to make my Prayers fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, my Devotion quick, my Mind clear, my Affections live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I may at last enjoy the Festivals of Angels, and eat and drink with my blessed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster at his Table, in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; then shall I fast from sin for ever; then shall I fast from all Temptations. Then shall I hunger no more after the meat that perisheth: Then shall I
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30245:54"/>
thirst no more after the mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Streams of sensual Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Then my hunger shall be refined into fruition, my thirst exalted into Enjoyments, such as <hi>Abana,</hi> and <hi>Pharpar</hi> cannot give, and the Rivers of <hi>Damascus,</hi> and of <hi>Jordan</hi> too fall short of; then I shall need no Provision for this Body. Then my Flesh will long no more after forbidden fruit, then I shall feed on thy love for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; that will be my Meat and Drink, that will be better tome than all the Trees of a terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Paradise; that will nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish me more than Milk and Honey; that will give me a more cheerful Countenance
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30245:55"/>
than the bloud of the Grape; then I shall need to take care no more about what I shall eat, or what I shall drink, or wherewithal I shall be cloathed. Righteousness will be my Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then, and Holiness, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Holiness, my Robe of Glory.</p>

O let it suffice that I have so long followed mine own will, and for the future, let even thy severest Laws be my delight and comfort. Thou hast given me thine onely Son to die for my sins, and can I after this mercy, think much of denying my self in mine ease for thy service? O teach me to use moderation in all things, and even in my sleep to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press my self-denial!

Since I can use self-denial in sleep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Temporal account, O let it not be said of me, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Spiritual account I could not watch.

Thou art the Resurrection and the Life, if I sincerely believe in thee, though I were dead, yet shall I live. O let me live, that I may praise thy Name, and whether I live or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I die, let me live and die in the Lord Jesus. Give me a sight of the Eternal watchfulness of Angels.

I earnestly beg, it is the desire of my Soul to be enliven'd and awaken'd into a sense of this day, that to day while I hear thy Voice I may not harden my Heart. I have
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:30245:72"/>
delay'd my serious care of a future happiness too long, too long indeed! O that mine Eyes were Fountains of tears to weep for this neglect! I am sensible I must not trifle any longer. I must not defer a concern of that importance to another day. O my God, let me admire thy patience, that I have liv'd unto this hour, and accept of my Sacrifice, of the remainder of my days, which I humbly consecrate to Faith and Love in Christ Jesus. O let this future Judgement swim before mine eyes, when <hi>I</hi> speak, when <hi>I</hi> think, when <hi>I</hi> follow my lawful Calling, when <hi>I</hi> am in company, when <hi>I</hi> am alone,

How kind hast thou been to this misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature! How am I bound to magnifie thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! How excellent, how

Thou hast carried me on thy Wings, as the Eagle doth her young; thorough the various stages of my life, what Miracles of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences have mine Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held! How hath thy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence been at work for me, while I have been asleep, while I have been thinking, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving something else, even how to derogate from thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory!

O let thy Mercy melt my Heart! O let Mercy prevail with me to give up my Heart to thee. Let mercy and goodness force me to love thee! Give me that ingenuity, that generous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that noble Spirit, that thy goodness may do more with me, than Threatnings, and Hell, and everlasting Torments. Let thy Love and Charity, and

how cold in Prayers, how neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the duties of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Relations have I been! What pettishness, peevishness, impatience, touchiness! What envy, hatred, passion, secret grudges have I harboured in my Bosom! What impure, covetous, unclean, disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts and desires have I suffered to lodge in my Breast! What a stranger have I been to that veracity, meekness, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, humility, charity, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, compassion, steddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in holiness, and readiness to every good word, and work, which thou hast peremptorily commanded!

I cried unto the Lord in my trouble, and thou broughtest me out of my distresses. Thou hath delivered me from the great Waters, and my Life hath been precious in thy sight. Recreate my Soul with the thoughts of thy mercy, and while I am sailing through the boisterous Sea of this World, let thy Word be a Lanthorn to my Feet, and a Light to my Paths, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

               <p>O God, great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous! the Day is thine, and the Night is thine, thou hast made Summer and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thou hast made the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings of the Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening to rejoyce. How great is thy loving kindness! there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Children of men shall put their trust under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of thy Wings. We praise thee O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord. Thou
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:30245:116"/>
art the great preserver of men. Thou hast protected us the night past, and through thy mercy we have escaped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable dangers; thou hast been our refuge, our hiding place, our fortress, and our deliverer. One Generation shall praise thy Works unto another, and declare thy migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acts. We see thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness again in the land of the living. Thou hast spread thy Wings over us, thou hast co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us with thy Feathers. Thou knowest our frame, and remembrest we are dust. Thou knowest how unable we are to keep our selves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hast taken care of us, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:30245:116"/>
unto this moment thy favours and loving kindnesses rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Souls and Bodies. O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and declare his wonderful works to the Children of men! We cannot but remember, how like a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou hast pitied us all our days. We have always found thy help in the time of trouble. How precious are thy thoughts, which are to us ward; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reckon'd up in order unto thee. If we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbred. What Sacrifices of thanksgiving are we bound to offer unto thee for thy love to our Souls

in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> for the assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thy Holy Spirit, for thy Word, and Ordinances, and for all the encouragements we have to lay hold on eternal life! O make us sensible of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! Let us see how sweet, and how gracious thou art, and let this sight work in us a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred of sin, and a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent love to the ways of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:30245:117"/>
thy power, direct us by thy wisdom. Enable us to do thy will. Encourage us to cleanse our selves from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit, and whatever things are praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, let's not onely think of them, but practise them. Give us earnest desires to imitate the best of mankind. Let's delight greatly in thy Commandments. Lord! open the eyes of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, that we may look more earnestly upon the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual riches thou hast vouchsafed unto us, and may be enamour'd with them, and despise the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the world, and set our affections upon the things which are above, and may at

last obtain the end of our Faith, even the salvation of our Souls. Be with us this following day. Make us watchful over our senses. Work in us a detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all filthy discourses, and of all the ill we see in the world. Teach us how to live in thy fear, and whatever sin we are tempted to, let's tremble at it, and say, how can we commit this wickedness, and sin against our God! Let thy holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels keep us in all our ways. Order our steps according to thy Word. Direct and guide our thoughts, and words, and actions. Bless all our lawful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. Cross and disappoint us, in that which is offensive to

thy holiness. Prosper that which is expedient for us. Give us courage, and wisdom, discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and resolution in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour toward God and men, and let's use the world, as if we used it not. Keep our thoughts fixed upon a better life, that whenever thou shalt call us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from hence, we may be ready and willing to obey thy Summons, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

               <p>MOst holy, and ever-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God! how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is thy Name in all the World! Thou art to be seen in all thy works, and we have seen thee, the day past, in thy various Mercies and gracious Providences, for which we do here render our most humble and hearty thanks. O God! who is like unto thee? For though thou dwellest on high, yet thou humblest thy self to behold the ways of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:30245:119"/>
of men! What are we, that thou shouldest take notice of us! or what is our frame, that thou shouldest have such respect unto us! We see thy condescention, and admire it. We see thy loving kindnesses, and praise thy Name. Thy Mercy reacheth unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, thy Faithfulness unto the Clouds. Thou givest unto us all that our Hearts, and Faith, and Reason can desire! What a glorious gift is the Son of thy bosom! what rich Presents are thy Promises! how industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is thy Providence, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our hearts to love thee! yet how backward are we to this duty! How loath to raise
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:30245:120"/>
our Souls above the world! How unwilling to take thee for our greatest treasure! We say, and speak glorious things of thee now and then, but we feel them not. O touch our hearts, and warm them with the fire of the Sanctuary, and let's know no other thing, than to love thee with all our hearts, and with all our Souls. Be thou the pleasing object of our Souls, and let's be displeased with nothing but what displeases thee. Teach us to neglect our own will, that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comply with thine, and let's walk by this golden Rule, to speak little, to think little, and to do much. Thou hast done
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:30245:120"/>
great things for us, denied thy self in thy glory, majesty, and splendor to do us good, let's therefore scruple nothing that thou commandest; and give us strength to do what thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandest, and then command what thou pleasest. Enable us to act, and speak, and live, as in thy presence, where-ever we are, and whatever we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and let's so live in the world as not to be of the world. Let no condition thou shalt call us out unto, be uneasie or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant to us, and whenever thou shalt think fit to correct us, let's look upon the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as intended for our good. Whenever we are exercised
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:30245:121"/>
by Temptations, let's not grow impatient, but rest in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cheerful resignation to thy Will. Fit us for the hour of our death, and let's not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay our seriousness to a sick bed. Let's readily obey thy present call, and take heed of procrastinations. Let the great things that depend upon our death, be much in our thoughts, and let's not put the evil day far from us. Encourage us so to so journ here, that at our journeys end, we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into everlasting habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Take us all into thy protection this following night. O thou great Shepherd of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> who neither slumberest
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:30245:121"/>
nor sleepest, spread thy wings over us, and we shall be safe. Fit us for the duties of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day. Teach us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with our hearts upon our beds, and to meditate of thy wondrous works. Let our rest be comfortable to the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our bodies, and that we may be the better able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our duties the following day. Let our everlasting rest be never out of our minds, and from the sweetness of our rest on our Beds, let's take occasion to consider, how much sweeter our eternal rest will be in thy bosom. Banish from our minds all foolish and vain imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and let's ever think our
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:30245:122"/>
selves most happy when we do most converse with thee, who art most blessed for ever.
