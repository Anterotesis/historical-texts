            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Terrible PLOT Against the City of London and Westminster.</head>
            <p>THe papists have envied the prosperity of this Kingdome a long time, and have daily studied to kindle a fire of dissension, and distraction among the true protestants, and have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently plotted to bring the whole State of this Nation to a destructive ruine. Their Councels have bin alwayes imployed to advance the court of <hi>rome,</hi> and their popish Hierarchy, and as their Councels have bin conjoyned to depopulate this Realme, so their actions have beene sputred forward to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instigation thereof. Wherefore to bring their nefarious intentions, and intestine conspiracy to some ripenesse, &amp; maturity of perfection, they have oftentimes intruded themselves to become the Kings favorites: that so by this meanes being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to places of great dignity, and high command in this Kingdome, they might more easily execute their Plots (which they have a long time hatched against us) and with greater felicity, Sir <hi>William Balfour Lieutenant of the tower,</hi> having with great fidelity, faithfulnesse of affection, and reall zeale to
<pb facs="tcp:62781:3"/>
the publique good and accommodation of this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London,</hi> performed his Office very faithfully, being a constant enemy to the papists, and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, had some occasion of necessity to goe into <hi>Ireland,</hi> having a great estate there, and in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to lose it, if he did any longer procrastinate the time: as soone therefore as he was prepared to go, Col: <hi>Lunsford</hi> hearing of it, and obtaining the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of many popish Lords, hee presented himselfe unto the King, as a very true and loyall subject to his Majesty and the State: and thus by great coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance he was elected to be Lientenant of the tower, although indeed hee was a great Signior of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, stigmatized with the <hi>Papall Piploma,</hi> and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Faux or Executioner of their popish designs. Hereupon the Jesuits and papists having their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Captaines, and chiefe Conduct in so great a Command of the City of <hi>London,</hi> did immediatly convocate their Hell-nourished Councels, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled themselves together at a publicke Masse, every one striving to defend the <hi>Popes</hi> premacy, to inlarge his Kingdome, and by all possible means to subvert and supplant this famous City of <hi>London,</hi> wherefore their resolutions were thus moulded, when as Col: <hi>Lunsford</hi> should have free liberty, and immunity in the Tower, divers of the Guard should be feed and suborned, having great sums of money given them to conceale, and manage their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and about the dead time of the night they should place the Ordinance lower, and being charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed should incontinently blow up the City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62781:3"/>
About which time of the night the other papists would provide a sudden Army, and sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men to set <hi>Westminster</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> house on fire, and at the very same time they would provide shipping for the <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury,</hi> Bishop Wren, and many other popish Doctors, who should have bin all transported into <hi>Spaine,</hi> where the one should have bin made a Cardinall, &amp; the other Sainted. Their designe was sealed with an Oath, that every one shovld be constant to <hi>Rome,</hi> and put this new-hatcht conspiracie into execution, with all possible care and expedition. Whereupon eight of the Guard were sworne to their machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Ordinance were in agitation to be suddenly placed lower in the Tower against the City, and shipping was in great preparation for the Arch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and the other popish affected Doctors.</p>
            <p>But marke the successelesse event of their wicked <hi>intentions, and nefarious imaginations,</hi> and consider the miraculous providence of the mighty and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who delivered us from their cruell hands. The Apprentices having great suspition (as indeed they had great cause) of some treacherous plot which hereby might insue upon the City, did forthwith rise, and presented themselves unto the Parliament, totally and universally petitioning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the papists, and the Col: that was a papist in the Tower, shewing that great danger the city was in, Thus they went to <hi>Westminster</hi> to the parliament house 3 or 4 dayes together, <hi>and vvere then unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously resolved to pull him out of the Tovver, vvhich induced the King and Parliament immediatly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62781:4"/>
Thus we see how all the plots of the papists are brought to nought, and how miraculously God hath preserved us from all their conspiracies &amp; impious machinations: whose malicious envie hath bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kindled against us, yet notwithstanding the flame of their sin-aspiring thoughts have bin quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched they have divers times came upon us like great Goliah threatning our perpetuall destruction, yet we like little David, have alwayes become victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, witnesse that formidable Armado in 88. when like ravenous wolves they thought to have devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us, to the utter demolition of this whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet by the divine providence assisting us, their whole Navie was dissipated, their forces dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and repelled. Witnesse againe <hi>that Hell-begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Plot of Gun-powder treason, when the King, Peers, and Commons of this Land had bin all blowne up with a stupendious sufflation to the eternall ruine of this whole Nation: yet by Gods supreame omnipotencie, when this Realme was almost at the last gaspe, when the divellish Plot was almost come to the last period, and execution thereof,</hi> their conspiracy was miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered, themselves apprehended, their Plot blasted, and the Actors therof condemned, witnesse their open rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> at this time, where they reigne in trecheries and conspiracies, whose disloyalty denyes obedience to the Kings <hi>Imperiall Crovvne and Royall dignity,</hi> who wash their hands daily in the bloud of Protestants, and study with their cruelty to make a Sepulchre for the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell: but, we hope as all their former trecheries
<pb facs="tcp:62781:4"/>
have beene confounded, so this especially will sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be.</p>
            <p>And finally witnesse those daily plots, which are found out amongst us here in <hi>England,</hi> the Authors of all which have bin the Papists; who have most nefariously conspired against this Kingdome, at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, yet by Gods providence all hath come to naught, and this last amongst the other especially against this famous City of <hi>London</hi> &amp; <hi>Westminster</hi> have beene confounded.</p>
            <p>God grant that we may still bee preserved and defended from all their plots, Trecheries, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies,</p>
