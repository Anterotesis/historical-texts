            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And because the Lords iudgements are alwayes righteous, hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards shewes the causes which would prouoke him to inflict them. The first cause


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17869:7"/>
is set downe at large in the rest of the verses following in the same Chapter, the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, idlenes, couetousnes, and securitie of them which were appointed for teachers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: the neglect of their dutie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a speciall occasion of the peoples sinne, is alleadged as the first cause of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ensuing. The second cause was in the common people, set downe in the first verse of this Chapter, and that was their carelesse regard of the death of righteous men, though many of them were taken away, to forewarne them of some strange iudgement to come; yet they regarded it not, but still proceeded forward in their sins, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were like to caste of some miseries, from which the righteous were freed by their speedy death.</p>

of their death, is also set downe by two phrases, <hi>no man considereth it in heart: and no man vnderstandeth it.</hi> Lastly, the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they dyed was, to preuent future euils: <hi>the righteous is taken away from the euill to come:</hi> of these in order.</p>

For the former, you must know that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all are corrupt and vnrighteous, but yet may be made righteous by iustification, and sanctification: for there is a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of imputation, and also a righteousnes of sanctification; the one to make vs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, the other to make vs righteous before men. The righteousnes of imputation is the righteousnes of Christ imputed vnto vs by faith, for our iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>First, a righteous man may be knowne<note place="margin">1</note> by the generalitie of his obedience, if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it selfe to the whole course of his life, and to all the commaundements of God.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17869:11"/>
God will not dispense with any of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants for the breach of any one of his lawes, as Princes sometimes vpon speciall occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons dispence with some of their subiects for penall Statutes, and seeing that hee who binds vs to all in generall, bindeth vs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one in particular: <hi>and that whosoeuer</hi>

                     <hi>keepeth the whole lawe, and yet faileth in one point, is guiltie of all:</hi> a true righteous man will be as carefull to keepe one as another.

wife, he would not obey him, because that sinne serued most for his pleasure. Although a Ship bee sound in all parts but one, and leaketh in no place saue onely one, yet it may bee drowned by meanes of that one. Though the walls of a besieged Citie bee<note place="margin">Greg. mag. moral. 11. 19. cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</note> strong, and well fortified in all places saue one, and haue no breaches saue onely one, the enemies may enter in at that one, and spoyle the Citie. Our soule is as a Ship on the sea, if it haue but one hole where it leak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it may make shipwracke of faith and a good conscience: it is as a Citie besieged by the Diuel and his angels, if there be but one breach in the walls of it, the diuel may there enter, and spoyle it. A birde is catched in a snare or grinne, and held fast in it, as well by one claw, as by both legs, or the whole body: so the Diuell, who layeth snares for our soules, may catch and hold them as well by one sinne, as by many. I acknowledge there is imperfection in all. Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> had a fault, iust <hi>Noah</hi> had a fall, <hi>Dauid</hi> shewed his infirmity, and <hi>Peter</hi> his frailty: yet the righteous either sinne of ignorance, not knowing that they doe amisse: or if they know it, it is not often, but seldome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afterward they are grieued for it, and made


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17869:12"/>
more carefull to auoyde it. But he which without repentance continueth still in one grosse sinne, and often practiseth it, cannot be reputed a righteous man, though he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue many other sinnes. <hi>A little leauen sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the whole lumpe.

                  <p>Secondly, a righteous man may be known<note place="margin">2</note> by the end whereunto his workes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes are directed, and that is the glory of God. <hi>Let your light so shine before men</hi> (saith<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 16.</note> Christ) <hi>that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your father which is in heauen.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Whether ye eate or drinke, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 31</note> 
                     <hi>else yee doe, doe all to the glorie of God.</hi> Though men practise neuer so many good workes, yet if in doing of them they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound not this end, they are not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted righteous men; no more then he is to be esteemed a good Archer which can draw a strong bow, hath a faire loose, and doth shoote farre, and yet alwayes shootes a great way off from the marke. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the Pharisies were not to be reckoned<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> in the number of righteous men, for they


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17869:12"/>
did all to be seene of men: they did fast, and pray, and giue almes, to be seene of men.</p>
                  <p>The Papists also faile in this propertie: for they doe all to merit thereby, like to hired seruants and labourers, which worke for their wages, and would do little or nothing for their Masters, vnlesse they might bee well paied for their paines. But we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our selues not to bee seruants, but sonnes, and not sonnes of the bond-woman, but of the free-woman: and that we ought of dutie to serue the Lord all the daies of our liues, though we should receiue nothing for our labour. In all our workes we must seeke his glorie; if he bestow any reward vpon vs, we may take it as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserued gift of his bountifull goodnes. I graunt indeede that righteous men haue some hypocrisie and vaineglorie mingled with sinceritie in their best actions, and do some things as well for their owne prayse, as Gods glorie: yet if there be more synce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in them, then hypocrisie; if they doe more good works for Gods glorie, then for other sinister ends, they lose not the name and dignitie of righteous men. For as the Philosophers teach concerning elementary bodies, that they are not made of one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17869:13"/>
onely, but of all foure, yet haue their names of the praedominant element, as some are called earthly bodies, not watery, aeriall, or fiery bodies, because they haue more earth, then water or ayre in them: and as the Phisitians say of the humours in mans body, that although they be not pure, but mixed one with another, yet euery one doth carry the name of that humour which doth most abound: so may wee say of the generall conuersation and the particular actions of men, that if in them they seeke more the glorie of God, then their owne prayse or profit, they are truely righteous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly a righteous man may be knowne<note place="margin">3</note> by his perseuerance in righteousnes, for he which is truely made righteous by faith in Christ, and sanctification of the spirit, will<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 29.</note> continue righteous vnto the end. True and sauing righteousnes is one of those gifts of<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 24</note> God which are without repentance. It can not be lost fully and finally. Those which turne from their righteousnes and commit iniquitie, shall not liue: their former righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes shall be forgotten, and they shall dye in the sinnes which they haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If the righteousnes of any bee like a<note place="margin">Hes. 6. 4.</note> morning cloud, or as morning dew, which


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17869:13"/>
is dryed vp and vanisheth away, so soone as the sunne ascendeth on high, it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be acceptable to God. He onely which continueth righteous to the ende shall bee saued. As God neuer ceaseth to bestow blessings vpon vs, so should we neuer cease to serue him in holines and righteousnes all the dayes of our liues. Though we hire ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants for a yeare, and take apprentices for seuen yeares, yet must wee serue the Lord for euer. Yea the righteous do not only hold fast that which they haue receiued; but their teeth are so set on edge with the sweete taste of righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es, that still they desire to increase it. So many as are perfect, will be thus minded with <hi>Paul, not to count</hi>

                     <hi>themselues as if they had already attained to it, but they forget that which is behind, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour themselues vnto that which is before, and follow hard toward the marke of the price of the high calling of God in Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, a righteous man may be knowne<note place="margin">4</note> by his affection to righteousnes in others. He which loues righteousnes it selfe, will loue it as well in others as in himselfe: yea, he will loue all others in whom he behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth any seeds of righteousnes, his delight will be in the Saints that are in the earth,<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 3.</note>


                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:17869:14"/>

                     <hi>are couered.

contrariwise, he which receiueth mercie of the Lord, will shew mercy vnto men. For as the sunne beames lighten vpon the earth do not only heate the earth it selfe, but also by their reflexion do heate the next region of the ayre: so the beames of the Lords mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie lighting on the hart of any christian, do not only heate him with inward comfort, but also reflect backward, and cause him to yeeld some comfort vnto his brethren.

                  <p>There be two kinds of mercifulnes, the one shewed toward the soule, the other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the body, an example of both we may behold in Christ: <hi>when he saw the multitude</hi>

works of mercy: yea they are no more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to men redeemed by Christs blood, then they are to bruite beasts. If their Oxe or Horse want meate, they will feede him: if diseased, they will seeke help for him: if he be fallen into a pit or ditch they will draw him out: and wil they do no more for man, hauing an immortall soule redeemed by Christ?

His death shall free them from the second death, but not from the first death, which is the separation of soule and body. He hath onely altered the nature and vse of the first death, but not quite taken it away. Whereas at first it was


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17869:18"/>
ordained for a punishment of sinne, he hath made it a passage into heauen: it was threatned and inflicted as a curse, but he hath turned it into a blessing. It did at first depriue men of good, but now it putteth them in possession of good.

out of a curse. If Phisicians by their arte can extract an antidote or preseruatiue against poyson, out of poysonfull things: why may not God by his infinit power and wisdome, drawe good out of euill, a mercy out of iudgement, and a blessing out of curse?

                  <p>But now let vs more particularly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the titles giuen to the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. First it is said, that he <hi>perisheth,</hi> which must not so be vnderstood, as if he were quite destroyed, brought to nothing, and had no more being: as it befalleth bruite beasts at their death, whose soules being traduced with their bodies are mortall, and perish with their bodies: the righteous hath a being euen after death; yet may be said to perish in regard of outward appearance; in the iudgement of flesh and blood, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17869:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to perish. Yet we must know that the righteous consists of soule and bodie: his soule being immortall cannot perish by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes: it can liue out of the bodie, as well as in the bodie. When it leaues the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, it goes vnto the Lord. This <hi>Salomon</hi> taught: <hi>Dust returnes to the earth as it was,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 7. Phil. 1. 23. Luk. 16. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>and the spirit returnes to God that gaue it.</hi> This <hi>Paul</hi> wished, <hi>desiring to bee loosed and to be with Christ.</hi> This <hi>Lazarus</hi> enioyed at his death, being <hi>carried by the Angels into Abrahams bosome.</hi> And this <hi>Iohn</hi> in a vision saw performed to the Martvrs: <hi>vnder the Altar hee sawe the soules of them, which were</hi>

                     <hi>killed for the word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the bodie of a righteous man may bee saide to <hi>perish:</hi> because it loseth the forme, the nature, and propertie of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body. It is within a short space eaten vp of wormes, and turned into dust and ashes: so as there can appeare no signes of a body. Though wee make neuer so much of our bodies, yet can wee not keepe them from perishing: though we feed them most daintilie, clothe them most costly, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish them most carefullie; yet at last they will become a thing of naught: the beautie of them will fade, they shall be deformed,


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17869:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and most ougly to behold. The strength of them will be taken away, so as they shall not stirre an hand or a foote: the agilitie of them will be lost: they shall remaine stiffe and be nummed: the parts and members of them shall perish and fall away one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The flesh, blood and bones shall be so strangely turned to dust and earth, that there shall not remaine any propertie or qualitie of them: and a man, if he knew it not before, would neuer iudge that dust and earth to haue been flesh and blood and bones of a liuing man: yea so greatly shall our bodies be altered, that men shall not be able to discerne, which dust came of them, and which came of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Yet one thing I must needs adde, for the comfort of the righteous: that although his body seeme thus to perish in the iudgement of men, yet it still hath a being in the sight of God, and doth euen at that time, and in that case, remaine a member of Christs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall body. For the vnion betwixt Christ and the faithfull, is not of soules only, but also of bodies: the body of euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">1.

And as the husbandman doth make as great reckoning of that corne which he hath sowne in his field, and lies hid vnder the clods, as he doth of that which he hath laid vp safely in his garner, because he hopeth it will come vp againe and yeeld increase: so Christ Iesus doth as highly esteeme of those bodies, which are laid in their graues, as of those which yet remaine aliue, because he knowes that one day they shall rise againe vnto glory. They are sowne in dishonour, but they shall rise againe in honour. Their life is but hid for a time, and will be found out againe.

Now our bodies are as old rotten houses for our soules to dwell in, if God cause our soules to depart out of them for a time, and then destroy them, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he may reedifie them, and make them fitter habitations for our soules, what cause haue we to lament? Nay rather if we

                  <p>It was vsual with the Hebrues, to repeate things diuers times together, either in the selfe same, or in the like words.

These repetitions serue for good purposes. In prayers they shew the seruencie of him that prayeth, and his earnest desire of the thing which he asketh. In Prophecies they declare the certainty &amp; speedines of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: as appeareth by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreame, which as <hi>Ioseph</hi> told him, <hi>was doubled vnto</hi>

                  <p>But in this taking away, there is great difference betwixt the godly and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. They are also taken away, but why? The godly are taken out of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>world was not worthie of them:</hi>

they are vnworthie to liue in the world. Those are taken away in mercie, these in iudgement: those in the Lords fauour, and these in his displeasure. And whence are these taken, or whither? They are taken from the practise of sinne, to suffer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for sinne: from ease to torment: from the first life, to the second death: from men to diuels: from earth to hell: from prison, to the place of execution.

                     <hi>righteous, and let my last end be like his.</hi> And yet they will not liue the life of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but few of these obtaine their desire. Looke what way a tree boweth while it stands and groweth, the same way it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly falleth when it is cut downe: euen so, looke how men are inclined in their life time, to righteousnes or vnrighteousnesse; so shall they fall at their death.</p>
                  <p>Men can hardly begin righteousnesse at their last end. Late repentance is seldome sound repentance. Men drawing neere to their end, shall be so affrighted with death, so troubled with paine and grief, that they shal not be able to set themselues to repent soundly. They shall then rather seeke ease for their bodies, then mercie for their sins, or grace for their soules. The beginning of euerie thing is hardest, and therefore he<note place="margin">Dunidium sacti qui be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne coepit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</note> which hath begun wel, is said to haue done halfe his worke. As it is in other things; so is it with repentance: it is a harder matter to begin repentance at the first, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it afterward: &amp; therfore the fittest time should be taken for the beginning of it: &amp; that is rather the time of our life, then the time of our death: rather the time of our


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17869:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
health then the time of our sicknesse. In the time of our life and of our health, we be scarse able and fit to begin serious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but much more vnable and vnfit shall we be in the time of sicknes &amp; death. We read in scripture but of one which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came righteous at his last end, the theefe on the Crosse: wee reade of one, that no man might despaire; though hee haue deferred his repentance so long: we reade but only of one, that no man might presume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it so long. The surest and safest way is to begin in time, &amp; make no delayes: least afterward it be too late.</p>
                  <p>3 The third circumstance to bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the text, is the carelesse regard of the righteous mans death. <hi>No man considereth it in heart.</hi> It seemes that manie godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were already dead, &amp; their death did declare that God had some speciall worke in hand, yet the common people which were left behind them, did little regard it. This carelesse contemning of their death, doth shew that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harts of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were possessed with great securitie, to make so small reckoning of such a strange worke of God. All the workes of God are carefully to be regarded of vs, who are set


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17869:26"/>
in this world to take a speciall view, and to make an holy vse of them. And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> thought the wicked deserued <hi>to be broken downe, and not built vp againe, because</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 28. 5. Psal. 68. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>they regarded not the workes of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands.</hi> Now the taking of the righteous away, is one of his speciall workes. For to him <hi>belong the issues of death.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal 90. 3. Iob. 14. 5.</note> It is he <hi>that turneth man to destruction.

Certaine it is that none die sooner or later then he sends for them.</p>
                  <p>The works of Princes are much conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and often talked of among the people; and ought not the Lords workes be much considered of vs? Their works may be done foolishly, rashly, and vniustly: but the works of God, are done in number, waight and measure, in wisdome, iustice, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. <hi>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17869:26"/>
those things, which are deare and precious among Princes: and shall the death of the righteous which is so precious in the Lords sight, the Prince of all Princes, be lightly esteemed of vs his people? <hi>None of them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 7. 8. Phil. 1. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>to himselfe, neither doth any die vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi> Whether they liue, they liue vnto the Lord: or whether they die, they die vnto the Lord: whether they liue therefore, or die, they are the Lords. Yea they do glorifie God both by life and by death. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should not lightly passe ouer their life or their death. But consider how they<note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 19.</note> haue glorified God by their death and by their life, and praise him for the same.</p>
                  <p>But why are we to consider their death? What may we learne thereby? We learne these foure things: First, the certaintie of death. Secondly, the nature of death. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the cause of death: and lastly, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how we must die.</p>
                  <p>First, by considering their death, we may learne the certaintie of death in our selues, that we must dye as well as they: in which respect <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>it is better to goe to the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>house of mourning, then to goe to the house of feasting; because this is the end of all men: and the liuing shall lay it to his heart.</hi> That is to


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17869:27"/>
say, hee which remaineth aliue, by seeing one dead, shall consider in his heart that all men shall so die, and that he himselfe shall die as well as others. The death of others is as a looking glasse, wherein we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholde the vncertaintie of our owne liues. We may call their death, as some doe the sacrament, <hi>visible verbu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> a visible word or sermon, teaching vs our owne mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for we haue no better assurance of our liues then they had: what we now are, they haue beene: and what they now are, wee may be: and we know not how soone. He which hath taken them away now, may within a while (if it please him) take vs also away and bring vs vnto them. As death as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted them, so will it assault vs; and we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no more resist it then they could, but must yeeld as they did. We are ready to forget death, and the forgetfulnesse of death, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to forget our dutie vnto God: let vs therefore consider the death of others, thereby to be put in mind of our owne.</p>
                  <p>2 Secondly, by their death we may know the nature of death in al others: for it deals with all alike. We may there see how death doth deface that image of God which was in the bodie, and how it doth destroy the


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17869:27"/>
bodie, which was a temple for the holie Ghost to dwel in. If one see a faire house of a noble man to bee much defaced, &amp; fallen to ruine, so as one stone is scarce left vpon another, it will pitie his heart: so should we be moued in our hearts to see the bodie of a righteous man, which was an house for the holie ghost to dwel in, to be so pitifully rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by death. Againe, we may see what strange separations death doth make. The soule and the body which haue a long time liued together, as two familiar cópanions, are put asunder by death: and no man knowes how long it shal be before they can meete together againe.</p>

                  <p>But in these our dayes many may bee found, who either do not at al consider the death of the righteous, or else do consider it amisse. Though it be a matter worth consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; yet some do not consider it at all: because they see so many die, they make the lesse reckoning of it: til death knock at their owne doores, they neuer regard it: they must needes die themselues, before they can be brought to consider of death: they care not who sinck, so they swimme; nor how many die, so they may liue: yea this is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be lamented, that some do regard the death of a Christian, no more then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the death of a dog.

Those which hee seeth incorrigible, hee letteth alone, though they offend; yet he seldome corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth them, but casts them off: but others which may by correction bee brought to repentance and kept in awe, he often cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth, and for them is reserued an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance immortall and vndefiled in heauen: yea the world hateth them, because they are not of the world; yea among men they shall oftentimes suffer euill for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes sake.

Life and miserie are two twins, which were borne together, &amp; must die together. And therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> heard it from heauen, &amp; was commaunded to write it for the comfort of men on the earth: <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>

                  <p>The spirituall euils, from which they are freed by death are three. First their combat with the diuell. Here we are in continuall warfare: this is the militant Church: so long as wee liue and abide in it, wee must fight as the Lords souldiers, &amp; not against flesh and bloud; but against principalities, against powers, and against worldlie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, the Princes of the darkenesse of this world: and not for a naturall or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, but for a spirituall and eternall life: not for an earthlie, but for an heauenlie kingdome. And in this battell there is no time of truce. If the diuell be ouercome at one time, he will on a sodame, and none knowes how soone, giue a fresh assault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but death ends tho battell: not as if the diuell got the victorie by our death, as


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17869:41"/>
it is commonly seene among warriours on the earth, if the one die in fight, the other getteth the vpper hand: but the faithfull at their last end, get a finall conquest, and then ascend to heauen there to triumph. The diuell cannot assault them there. He may compasse the earth, but he cannot enter within the lists of heauen. He neuer came thither to assault any, since he was first cast out; though he tempted <hi>Adam</hi> in the earthly Paradice, and got him thrust out of it: yet can he not tempt any in the heauenly Paradice, to cause them to be thrust thence. And therefore as a souldier which hath endured an hard and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous battell a long time, doth greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce when he hath gotten the victorie: so may the faithfull reioyce at the houre of their death, because then they make a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall end of their spirituall enemies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their triumph ouer them.</p>
                  <p>2 Another miserie from which they are freed, is the practise of sinne. <hi>Who liueth and sinneth not,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith: <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> Though we be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>but what I hate, that doe I.</hi> And further, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the law of God concerning the inner man, but I see another law in my members, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling against the law of my minde, and leading me captiue vnto sinne.</hi> And nothing is more grieuous vnto a true Christian heart then the practise of sinne; and therefore euerie one in this case, will cry out with the same Apostle. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall</hi>

After death all the righteous shall be perfectlie sanctified; and made like the Angels to do the will of the Lord readilie, willinglie, and cheerefullie. As herbs and flowers breed wormes in them, yet those wormes at last will kill the hearbes and flowers: so sinne bred death in it selfe, but at last death will kill sinne. And as <hi>Sampson</hi> could not kill the Philistims, who were his greatest eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but by his owne death: no more can the righteous kil sin which is not their least enimie, but by their own death. At the first, death was ordained as a punishment for sinne, but now it is vsed as a meanes to stop the course of sin. <hi>It was then said vnto man, if thou sinne, thou shalt die the death: but now</hi>

If two friends should lye in prison together, or should dwell together in a strange countrey, where both of them were hardly vsed, were many wayes iniured, endured great want, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained much miserie: though they loued one another dearely, and the one were an helpe and comfort to the other; yet if the one should be taken from the other, and brought to his chiefest friends, and among them be not onely freed from all such mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as before he had endured, but also be aduanced to great preferment; will the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is left behind him, be disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at it? Will he not rather wish himselfe to be there with him in the like case; then desire, that either he had stayed with him, or might returne againe? This our life is as a prison, or straunge countrey, in which we indure great miserie, and may euery day looke for more: if therefore our deerest friends be taken from vs, freed from these miseries, and aduanced to great glorie with Christ and his Saints in the kingdome of heauen; we haue no cause to wish that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had stayed longer with vs, or might returne againe vnto vs; but rather desire that we might quickly go vnto them,

Though we may thinke that they dyed too soone for vs, yet they dyed not too soone for themselues: for the sooner they come to rest and happines, the better it is for them.

                  <p>I may the more boldly speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of this godly Gentlewoman, whose soule (I doubt not) God hath taken vnto himselfe, and whose body is now to bee committed vnto the earth, because I knew both the course of her life, and the manner of her death. It pleased God betime to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the vessel of her heart with heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liquour, whereof it did alwayes tast af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: good seede was sowne in her soule at the beginning, which budded and brought forth good fruite vnto the ende. She was by nature very humble and lowly, not disdaining any: very louing and kind, shewing courtesie to all: very meeke, and milde, in forbearing euery one; so as they which did daylie conuerse with her, could neuer see her angrie: and hereby she got the loue of all. For matters of religion few went before her. She gaue her selfe much to reading: as <hi>Paula</hi> did traine vp her maides<note place="margin">De scripturis sanctis quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidie aliquid discere.</note> to read, and learne euery day some thing in the Scriptures; so did she accustome her selfe to reade euery day eight chapters in the bible: and would not suffer any occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

She was also much giuen to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: for besides that shee would both mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening ioyne in prayer with the family, she was espyed to seeke out solitary places for priuate prayer and meditation. She did most dutifully frequent the publick exercises in the Church: had a speciall care to sanctifie the Sabboth; and was greatly grieued, if shee might not heare one or two Sermons on that day. Although she dwelt farre from the Church, yet would she neuer be absent, if shee were able either to goe or ride. Yea she might be found in the Church when others which dwelt neerer, and were able to haue come, might haue bin found in their houses, or vnfit places for that time. By these meanes shee did greatly increase in knowledge, not being like those <hi>women which are euer learning, but are neuer able to</hi>

                  <p>She had a very tender conscience, and would often weepe not only for her owne sins, but also for the sins of others; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if she espied a fault in those which were neere vnto her, &amp; whom she loued dearely.

had a dangerous conflict, yet a ioyfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. Not long after the beginning of her sicknes, being a weeke before her death, I comming to visit her, found her some what troubled in conscience; the enemy had then begun to assault her: but within a while, by conference with me and others and also by prayer, she was comforted. But after our departure, the enemy did more strongly &amp; strangely assault her againe, as might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to them which were present: for she neither would, nor yet could conceale it.</p>
                  <p>Though I was not present at this conflict, yet was I present at the conquest. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to her the day before her death, found her exceedingly rauished with the ioyes of heauen, praysing God most cheerefully for his great mercies, and wonderfull works of God toward her, repeating many verses of the Psalmes, and other places of Scripture, to expresse the worke of the Lord vnto her, and to set forth her thankfulnes vnto him. She said, <hi>the path was smooth, and strowed with flowers where she did treade, that she was as it were in Paradice, and felt a sweete smell, as in the garden of Eden: that the ioyes which she felt were wonderfull, wonderfull! repeating that word oftentimes together.</hi> I cannot rehearse

the least part of those heauenly speeches which then shee vttered. She often desired others to pray and to praise God for her: and when I had once ended prayer, within a while after she would desire me to pray againe. The next morning which was the day of her death, I saw her continue in the like sort, though not able by reason of her weakenes, to speake so much: she then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired our prayers againe for her, and when prayer was ended, and I gone out of the house toward the Church, she caused mee to bee called backe, to pray once againe with her; and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I departed, wished some faithithfull Minister to help me, and thus continued in godly speeches and prayers vntill her last end. This was the manner of her death.</p>
                  <p>I haue heard that some speake very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably of her, by reason of her tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereupon mutter much against religion it selfe: but such should remember that which I haue spoken before, that the Deuill most assaulteth them which be most godly, thinking to hinder all religion, if he may preuaile with such: <note n="*" place="margin">Origen. in Num. ho. 27 Hier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What counsell shall I take, now I haue lost him that was my comfort?</hi> So heauy a thing we see it is to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered for a time from those that are deere vnto vs. One only thing there is, which is able in this case much to temper our affections; when we see our friend to die in the Lord; that is, in comfort of conscience, &amp; assurance of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through <hi>Christ.</hi> And this his comfort he expresseth outwardly vnto vs, by performing those duties which are required of a man when he dyes, and so he makes a ioyfull and a holy end. When our friend departeth this life in this maner, we haue iust cause to take his death the more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.


<pb facs="tcp:17869:95"/>
And thus it pleaseth God many times to stirre vp some (especiallie such as in their life time haue a care to pursue Religion, and to keep themselues vndesiled of the world) at their death to expresse wonderfull comfort of spirit, and to shew forth such fruit of Religion, that we wonder at it, and acknowledge the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary worke of Gods spirit in them. They wrastle against temptations, they confesse their faith, feele the assurance of their saluation, condemne their sinnes, exhort the beholders, praise God, sing Psalmes, wish to dye, that in their death they are better Christians then euer they were in their life.</p>
                  <p>This blessed departure God giues to many, for diuers good purposes. 1. That the world may know that peace is the end of the iust, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in death is the portion of the righteous. 2. That his eternall truth in our holy profession may appeare to be able to comfort vs, not onely in our life, but in our death also, when all other comforts forsake vs. 3. That our enemies may see our faith is not in vaine. 4. That the weake by their example may be incouraged to a holy life, when they see it bring with it so happie a death, and that they may be strengthened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the feare of death, seeing it is alwaies comfortable to those that leade a godly life.


<pb facs="tcp:17869:96"/>
5. and finally, that the friends of the departed, by their heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly departure, may be admonished not to mourne so much for their death, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce for their life, <hi>and to thanke God, that euer it was their lot, in any degree, to be ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or matched with so blessed seruants of God.</hi>

                  <p>This Gentlewoman, <hi>Mistresse Katherine Brettergh</hi> was one of this number: her life, as long as God continued it, was deere to those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom she was, as the life of a friend might be. Her husband, friends, kinsfolks, brethren, sisters, and all the godly that knew her, inioyed a great blessing of God of her: and her death (no doubt) was grieuous to her husband, as the death of a vertuous yoke-fellow. And if worldly affection would haue holpen it, it was the same in him that <hi>Dauids</hi> was to <hi>Absolom</hi> his sonne, when he mourned for his death: <hi>O my sonne Absolom, my sonne, my sonne Absolom;</hi>

                  <p>These reasons moued me both to collect and publish this treatise, the doing whereof I trust, as it will be acceptable to many, so can it bee hurtfull to none, vnlesse possible it be to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darknes.

And this I assure the Reader, that howsoeuer I may sometimes misse the for me of words which possibly the Gentlewoman vsed in her speech; yet haue I faithfully set downe the substance of the matter, and for the most part also faithfully related the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and reported nothing but that which is most true, and testified by persons of good and honest report, as they are named in the margent: out of whose fresh memories the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that which I publish was presentlie

I had no other odours wherewith to imbalme her, I am but the pen-man, the thing it selfe was her owne, wrought in her by Gods spirit: and therefore not costly to me, though more comfortable to me, and all that heard it, then I can now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse: and I doubt not, but it shall yeeld thee also the same comfort, and giue thee occasion both to praise God, and imitate her wel-doing, which the Lord graunt.</p>
