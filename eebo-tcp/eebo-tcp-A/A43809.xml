            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <l>The pretty Birds did lay on load</l>

                     <l>did welcome in the pleasant Spring:</l>
                     <l>I drew me to the Gréen-wood side,</l>
                     <l>To hear this Countrey harmony,</l>
                     <l>Whereas er'e long I had espy'd</l>

                     <l>He lay along upon the ground</l>
                     <l>And to the Heavens he cast his eye,</l>
                     <l>The bordering Hills and Dales resound</l>
                     <l>the eccho's of his piteous cry:</l>
                     <l>He wailing sore, and sighing said,</l>
                     <l>Oh Heavens what endlesse grief have I?</l>
                     <l>Why are my sorrows thus delaid?</l>

                     <l>When Nature first had made my frame,</l>

                     <l>to end what Nature had begun.</l>
                     <l>She set my féet upon her knée,</l>
                     <l>And blest my tender age with store,</l>
                     <l>But in the end she did agrée</l>
                     <l>to mar what she had made before.</l>
                     <l>I could no sooner créep alone:</l>
                     <l>But she forsook her fostered child,</l>
                     <l>I had no lands to live upon,</l>
                     <l>But trac'd abroad the world so wilde.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>At length I fell in company</l>
                     <l>With gallant Youths of <hi>Mars</hi> his train,</l>
                     <l>I spent my life in jeopardy,</l>
                     <l>and got my labour for my pain:</l>
                     <l>I watched on the sieged walls</l>
                     <l>In thunder, lightning, rain and snow,</l>
                     <l>And oft being shot with powdred Balls,</l>
                     <l>whose costly marks are yet to show.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>When all my kindred took their rest</l>
                     <l>At home in many a stately Bed,</l>
                     <l>The ground and pavement 'was my nest,</l>
                     <l>my Flask a pillow for my head:</l>
                     <l>My meat was such as I could get,</l>
                     <l>Of Roots and Herbs of sundry sorts,</l>
                     <l>Which did content my hungry mind,</l>
                     <l>although my commons were but short.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>My powder serv'd to salt my meat,</l>
                     <l>My Murrion for a gilded Cup,</l>
                     <l>Whereas such drink as I could get,</l>
                     <l>In Spring or Ditch I drank it up:</l>
                     <l>My Rapier alwayes by my side,</l>
                     <l>My Piece lay charg'd with match &amp; light,</l>
                     <l>Thus many a month I did abide</l>
                     <l>to ward all day and watch by night.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>I lived in this glorious vain,</l>
                     <l>Untill my limbs grew stiffe and lame,</l>
                     <l>And thus I got me home again,</l>
                     <l>regarding no such costly fame:</l>
                     <l>When I came home I made a proof</l>
                     <l>What friends would do if néed should be,</l>
                     <l>My nearest kinsfolks lookt aloof,</l>
                     <l>as though they had forgotten me.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>And as the Owl by chattering charms</l>
                     <l>Is wondred at of other Birds,</l>
                     <l>So they came wondring at my harms,</l>
                     <l>and yéeld me no relief but words:</l>
                     <l>Thus do I want while they have store,</l>
