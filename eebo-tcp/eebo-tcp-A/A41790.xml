            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen I conſider how much it is your deſire, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Churches in general, that brotherly concord, peace and truth, might poſſeſs the room of all our diviſions, in affection, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and practiſe; and particularly in the fourth principle of Christianity. And how
<pb facs="tcp:107514:3"/>
many Prayers are daily made to God for ſo great a Bleſſing; And that hopeful way we lately ſeem'd to be in, to lay hold of the thing which hath been ſo long deſired: And therewithal that moſt unhappy obſtruction of our hopes (as ye know) ariſing from one who ſhould rather have been a reſtorer of the antient path which many have forſaken, and ſo a healer of the breach which hath been made, by its being neglected: Who being in reputation for Wiſdome, having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal great opportunity (and I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded really intended) to do the Church of Chriſt much good; Even then, by a little ſolly following his own Councels (doubtleſs through Satans malice, who envied our good) hath made himſelf and his enterpriſes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, and our wound more grievous.</p>
            <p>I ſay, when I conſidered theſe things, I could not paſs them over without a <hi>Sigh,</hi> (even this which here I preſent unto you) ſaying in my heart, Why hath the Lord done this? Which was no ſooner conceived, but I was immediately ſatisfied, that the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:107514:3"/>
was jealous for his holy way, which had been gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſly prophaned by an hypocritical confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity thereunto. And true for ever is that word, <hi>Hoſea 14. ult. All the wayes of the Lord are right, and the Juſt ſhall walk therein; But the Tranſgreſſor ſhall fall therein.</hi> And certainly, as our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns reſuſing to ſeek the Lord after the due order at the firſt, ſo this prodigious hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie at the laſt, may too truly be called <hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The breach of the Church.</note>Perrez Eccleſia</hi> at  <hi>this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou Lord art righteous, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the Hearts of the children of men, and haſt diſcovered the hidden things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and haſt pleaded the cauſe of thy precious (though much abuſed) Truth. Even ſo Lord let our iniquities be ever corrected, but yet in mercy forgive us our Treſpaſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay, ſhall we now no more go about this dreadfull work, to bring the Ark (the fourth principle of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I mean) to its proper place in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
<pb facs="tcp:107514:4"/>
or rather ſome irregular Churches to their due reverence unto it.</p>
            <p>If it ſeem good in the eyes of the Lord, let his ſervants ſtill convene to conſider of this matter, perhaps we ſhall find grace in his ſight; for there is hope that we ſhall one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand another, and with one conſent ſeek and ſerve the Lord God of our Fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>And this I am the more induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or hope for, from, not only the great deſire which I yet find to be alive in the hearts of Chriſtians generally, that peace in this matter might be upon Iſrael. But alſo from the great forwardneſs which I found in the Searchers themſelves to conſent unto certain Propoſals for Peace; the firſt of which is this,
<hi>That it be granted and profeſſed on all ſides by the formerly divided parties, That that laying on of Hands,</hi> Heb. <hi>6. 2. is one of the Principles of Chriſts Doctrine, and a part of the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:107514:4"/>
This Propoſition being conſidered, it may appear that there wants but a ſtep (as it were) to unity in the truth it ſelf, and ſo to a laſting Peace one with another. And methinks it ſhould be no impoſſible thing, for us to agree about the particular ſervice intended, <hi>Heb. 6. 2.</hi> (unleſs a ſpirit of perverſneſs be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled amongſt us) Towards the clearing of which difficulty, ſomething is ſaid in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel, which I deſire may be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Why the Searchers ſhould ſo much declaim againſt you, as if you unchurched all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s but your ſelves, I can ſee no reaſon, having never underſtood, that you did at any time by any agreement, deliver ſuch a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Nor is it ſo much your buſineſs to meddle with unchurching any body, as to keep your ſelves from corruption in Doctrine and Manners.</p>
            <p>Indeed the point of Communion with thoſe who reject or oppoſe your Faith and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the caſe depending, hath been much debated, and reſolved in the Negative (èſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially touching the Table of the Lord) but
<pb facs="tcp:107514:5"/>
this is ſo far from being an Argument, that you deny them to be Churches of Christ, that it plainly Argues you own them for ſuch; but yet ſuch, as for their rejecting or oppoſing ſome truth of God, are therefore uncapable of preſent communion with thoſe that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerve the truth by them rejected and oppoſed. For if you deem them to be no Churches at all, what need any debate be had, Whether it be orderly or ſafe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with them at the Lords Table?</p>
            <p>Now, that perſons may be allowed the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of Chriſtians (and ſo of the Church of Chriſt) and yet (as the matter may be circumſtanced concerning them) ought to be held at ſome distance in reſpect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Communion, with other Chriſtians, or Churches, implies no abſurdity, but is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very neceſſary, I hope the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>Something alſo I have ſaid in vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Meſſengers Office (which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be much queſtioned by ſome) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf nothing ſo fit a perſon to plead
<pb facs="tcp:107514:5"/>
this cauſe as ſome other. However, if that which I have done may give occaſion to any other to do more, or more effectually, in this point, I ſhall think my pains well beſtowed. I commit all that I have ſaid to the bleſſing of God, and the Conſideration of his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

But it is not ſo eaſie for thoſe who are ſick of Queſtions or <hi>demands,</hi> to receive ſatisfaction by any endeavour whatſoever. And as in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107514:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other points of faith; the Queſtions of ſome have been endleſs, even ſo now that humour hath been and is much at work, againſt that ſolemn ſervice of prayer, with the impoſition of hands for the promiſed Spirit of God, as a gift pertaining to the members of the body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. As is too apparent by ſundry papers extant, and among the reſt, one entituled, <hi>A Search for Schiſm,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining no leſs than an hundred Demands (though 40. only be the number ſet down by the Demandants) which are the more prodigeous for that divers of them have been anſwered, by divers hands, and no reply made by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers. What the reaſon hereof ſhould be is doubtful, unleſs the oppoſers of this truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſtate the Controverſie anew (for I was told that this Book of Demands is but a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to a greater work) and thereby become (more effectually) the diſturbers and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructers of that meaſure of unity remaining, and peace pretended.</p>
            <p>But as in this we ſhall be too ſolicitous, ſo, neither in our Anſwer, ſhall we need to be ovluminous, by tracing their demands one by one. For though the number thereof be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet they are reducible to three Heads, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which the truth being evinced, the whole Body of their demands are anſwered.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107514:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now the Heads to which their demands may be reduced are theſe:</p>
            <p>The firſt, concerns the conſtitution of thoſe Congregations of Baptized Diſciples who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that ſolemn ſervice of prayer with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands for the promiſed Spirit: <hi>viz.</hi> Whether they be true Churches of Chriſt or not?</p>
            <p>The ſecond, reſpecteth the matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between thoſe Chriſtians who reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerve prayer with the impoſition of hands, as a principle of Chriſts Doctrine, pertaining to the beginning of Chriſtian men; and theſe who reject and oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>The third, is touching the ſervice it ſelf, in reſpect of its grounds and ends; as alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the perſons concerned in the practice thereof at this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I may with the more facility and clearneſs proceed in the conſideration of theſe particulars,</hi> I ſhall begin with the laſt firſt; touching which particular, I ſhall endeavour to make good this propoſttion, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That as God hath promiſed to give the Spirit of his Son (or his holy Spirit) to all that are the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Lord: So he hath appointed a ſolemn way wherein his Servants and Handmaids, generally, are to wait upon him for the reception thereof, which way is the prayers of the Church (performed</hi>

                  </gap>gion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them in the min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rity of their Chriſtian ſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For explication of ſome parts of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it is meet that we ſhew, firſt, what we mean by the holy Ghoſt, ſith ſome now, (as well as heretofore <hi>Acts</hi> 19.—) either by reaſon of ignorance or ſome worſe cauſe, ſeem not to know, <hi>whether there be any holy Ghoſt.</hi> As if they had forgotten unto what they were Baptized. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
            <p>By the Holy Ghoſt then, we do not mean the Spirit of man in its moſt reformed and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſtate imaginable; neither any created Spirit whatſoever.</p>
            <p>But by the Holy Ghoſt, we mean that Spirit, by whoſe operation the Creation of the world was brought forth, and formed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Job</hi> 26. 13. And which knoweth all things, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the deep things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. And which is preſent every where, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 7, 8. 9. Which Spirit we therefore believe to be one with the Father in nature and eſſence, and therefore rightly ſaid to be God, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3, 4, 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when we ſpeak of mens receiving this holy Spirit, we do not mean that he dwels in them eſſentially and perſonally; for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107514:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo they cannot contain him. But he dwels in them by manifeſtation and operation. By gifts, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. By fruits, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Galath.</hi> 5. 22, 23.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the ground of this ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected truth, the fourth principle of Chriſts doctrine, lieth much in that great promiſe of the Spirit of God, as the right of all the Diſciples of Chriſt. It behoveth that we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the nature of that glorious promiſe, that being affected with the excellency, and made ſenſible of the neceſſitie thereof, we may the more devoutly ſeek for it, not only in our private devotion, but alſo in that ſpecial and publick way aſſigned in the holy Scripture for the obtaining ſo great a benefit.</p>
            <p>Let it therefore firſt be conſidered, that to be under the common influence and operation of the Spirit, in the Miniſtery of the Word, in order to converſion, is one thing; and the reception of the Holy Ghoſt, as a Seal and confirmation of the ſouls of Chriſtians, as it is the earneſt of their inheritance, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>It is certain, a perſon may be eminently under the operation of the Spirit, in the firſt conſideration; and yet be a ſtranger to the reception of the Spirit in the other; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107514:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firſt in the Apoſtles themſelves, who though they were the perſons which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the firſt fruits of the promiſed Holy Spirit, yet were they for ſome time in the profeſſion of the Goſpel before they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it.</p>
            <p>For they did not receive the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe till after the Aſcention of our Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5.<hi>—But wait for the promiſe of the father, which (ſaith he) ye have heard of me; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r John truly baptized with water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not many dayes hence.</hi> John 7. 39. <hi>The Spirit was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> In like manner the Samaritans were converted from the errour of their way, by the preaching of the word, and became the Diſciples of Chriſt, and yet the <hi>Spirit of promiſe was faln on none of them,</hi> Acts 8. 12, 15, 16. The Epheſians alſo believed in God after they heard the Goſpel of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; But <hi>were not ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe till afterward,</hi> Eph. 1. 13, 14. Agreeable hereunto is that queſtion of the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 2. <hi>Have ye received the Holy Ghoſt SINCE ye believed?</hi> The perſons to whom this queſtion was put, were believers in Chriſt, yea Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed believers. Whence we are to note, that Baptized Diſciples have right to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Holy Ghoſt; and indeed hence it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107514:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was that <hi>Peter</hi> could ſo confidently and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally promiſe (in the word of the Lord) the gift of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>to every one that doth repent of their iniquities, and are baptized in the name of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

laying on of hands at all practiſed here, as ſome imagine, namely a laying on of hands for the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt. For though it is true, that God did ſometimes give ſuch gifts of his Spirit in the way of Praier with laying on of Hands, yet that ſuch gifts was the only proper end of that ſervice, is confidently denied, becauſe (as before) it was impoſſible to know (in any ordinarie way) for whom to pray, or on whom to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Hands, whether on men or women, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither ſex is exempted from the extraor; dinarie gifts of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>It is certain that God gave the gift of Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Miniſterie of the Word. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. Yet it doth not follow thence, that ſuch gifts are the only proper end of preaching the Word; but the undoubted end of the Lord, in that Ordinance is, <hi>that men believe, and be ſaved</hi> (though perhaps they never receive the gift of tongues, propheſie, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and this is certainly that end which ſhall be attained by all that rightly accept that means of ſalvation. <hi>John</hi> 20. 31.

have doubted whether <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> laid hands on men, ſeeing the Text ſayes nothing particularly of them any more than of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

they had not received. So that ſtill we ſee, laying on of Hands was practiſed as generally as Baptiſm, or any other Ordinance, where the practiſe of it is recorded, and that is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the end of that ſervice was that gift of the Holy Ghoſt which is general, and conſequently not for the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, otherwiſe then as they are included within the compaſs of that gracious promiſe.</p>
            <p>That the laying on of Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. was not the laying on of Hands for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie gifts, but for the general donation of the Spirit to Diſciples indifferently, is yet more manifeſt; becauſe upon this only ground could <hi>Paul</hi> ask the Diſciples, whether they had received the Holy Ghoſt ſince they believed; and upon this only ground may the Miniſters of Chriſt ask this queſtion of the Diſciples at this day, I mean ſo to ask it, as thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that they ought to have it, for ſo much <hi>Paul</hi>'s queſtion doth plainly imply, as appears by his endeavours that they (who had been ſo long without it) might now be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it, and that for them all indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And upon this ground only could <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> uſe the means to obtain the Spirit for the Diſciples at Samaria generally, namely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the promiſe of the Spirit was univerſal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:107514:19"/>
Again from this conſideration, that that laying on of Hands <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. was a <hi>general practiſe,</hi> and the gift prayed for in that ſervice, <hi>a general gift,</hi> it will follow that the Apoſtles performed this ſervice of prayer with laying on of Hands, by vertue of their Miniſterial Authoritie, and not by vertue of any particular <hi>power they had to give the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as ſome do vainly imagine, otherwiſe it will follow, that by their gift of miracles they were bound to work a miracle for every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple at Samaria; and for every one of thoſe certain diſciples at Epheſus, <note n="*" place="margin">And then why not the like for all Diſciples where ever they came, no man can render a good reaſon.</note> which is abſurd to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or elſe that they did in this ſervice more than they were bound to do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by vertue of gift or office, which is as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous on the other hand; for though it is certain that they had no power to give the Spirit of God to any man; yet certainly they had power (or authoritie from God) to pray, with the laying on of their Hands, for the members of the bodie, that they might receive the Spirit of promiſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by thoſe heavenly confirmations which enſued upon their performance, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that it may be ſaid, this ſervice of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107514:20"/>
prayer with the laying on of hands is as much confirmed from heaven, to be a thing well pleaſing to him, as any other ordinance whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as the <hi>UNIVERSALITY</hi> of the practice of layng on of Hands, with prayer for the Holy Spirit, being evinced is a matter of that importance, that even thence it will follow, that it is no ſuch thing as many ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be <hi>(viz. a temporary practice only fitted for the Apoſtles times, that ſome few ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving practiſed or ſubmitted to it, It was to ceaſe, being only perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

No not ſo much as <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> for he conſented to <hi>Philip</hi>'s doctrine. And partly, for that there is the ſame reaſon to believe, that <hi>the whole City</hi> (or the generality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) <hi>was converted by Philip, as that they had been generally deceived by Simon the Witch</hi> (as that will not be denied) for as it is ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.

Doubtleſs, it may be ſaid without boaſting, that ſome Chriſtians in theſe days, are ſo endewed with the Spirit of God (at leaſt in compariſon of many of the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) that, <hi>they are full of the Spirit of wiſedom;</hi> yet the Searchers will not ſay, <hi>they are full of the miraculous gifts of the Spirit:</hi> ſeeing they have told us (though very untruly) that the end of laying on of Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. is ceaſed, or not attainable; which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>was only the miraculous gifts of the Spirit.</hi> Which conceit of theirs is the more prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when we conſider that ſome of them did lately ſubmit to laying on of Hands, with prayer to God.

            <p>It is worthy conſideration, that there was a Church at Epheſus, long before <hi>Paul</hi> laid hands on thoſe certain Diſciples, which he found there, at his ſecond comming to that City. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 19, 20, 26, 27.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107514:23"/>
by the Scriptures, that Jeſus was the Chriſt; we cannot now reaſonably think, that <hi>Paul</hi> would ſettle thoſe certain Diſciples <hi>Acts</hi> 19. in a Church diſtinct from the Church at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> already, much leſs in a way or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe <hi>contradiſtinct</hi> from the Church; and if not, then it follows, that the Church at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> were alſo in the practiſe of prayer, with the laying on of Hands, as well as thoſe certain Diſciples, who were now to be laid into the building with the reſt; which yet is the more conſiderable, if we note that paſſage in <hi>Epheſians</hi> 1. 13. which was ſpoken of the whole Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and ſhews plainly, that they had received the Holy Ghoſt or Spirit of Promiſe, after they believed the Goſpel of their ſalvation; which fully agree with the order, wherein the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Diſciples alſo received the Spirit.</p>

                  </gap> of Chriſt?</hi> By which unwary demand, no doubt they have led many a ſimple meaning Chriſtian into a Maze, and there left him; nor can they poſſibly give him relief, ſith they cannot extricate themſelves from the ſame meander; and as an addition to their folly, they demand, <hi>that ſeeing divers men are differently perſwaded, concerning that laying on of hands,</hi> Heb. 6. 2. <hi>Whether this be not a ſufficient ground for them to doubt, whether that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands practiſed by us be inſtituted by God?</hi> Which if it be, then they have ſufficient ground, to doubt of all things which they (as well as we) do hold for Gods inſtitutions;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107514:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For certainly divers men are (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their intereſt) diverſly perſwaded of moſt places of Scripture, on which they ground their faith and practiſe. But to leave them in this miſt, till they being weary, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to return to the Lord in this part of his will; I ſhall endeavour to ſhew plainly, what laying on of hands it is, which is called a principle of Chriſts doctrine, and a part of the foundation. And though the <hi>Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> are pleaſed to trouble their Readers, with a large enumeration of layings on of hands; yet they ſeem at laſt to be content, That, that laying on of Hands <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. ſhould be <hi>one out of two;</hi> namely, either that which was <hi>for healing the ſick,</hi> or elſe that which was for <hi>the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit:</hi> But they rather incline to the firſt, and as for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we have ſhewed there is no ſuch thing, nor ever was; being a thing out of the reach of mans underſtanding to whom ſuch gifts do belong, and conſequently they know not on whom to impoſe their hands.</p>
            <p>That the laying on of Hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. ſhould be that on the ſick is no way congruous to truth or reaſon. For, how ſhould this be one of the firſt principles of the Oracles of God, and Milk for Babes; ſeeing it is more bleſſed to believe without a miracle, than with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107514:28"/>
one, (but it is not more bleſſed to be without a principle of Chriſts Doctrine, than to have it) and thoſe who would not believe unleſs they ſaw them, are upbraided for the hardneſs of their hearts. Certain it is, That that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands to heal the ſick, if neceſſary, yet is prerequiſite to faith, ſigns being for them which do not believe; and not for them that do. But the laying on of hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. is ſubſequent to Faith, yea it follows Baptiſm; and that as it is a principle of the Oracles of God, therefore it cannot be that which was for the working of miracles. Again, laying on of hands on the ſick, is moſt proper (if not only proper) for thoſe that are without, and therefore not milk for Babes in the Church, and conſequently not that laying on of Hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. As for ſick perſons in the Church of God, they are not bid to have hands laid on them, but are bid to ſend for the Elders of the Church, that they may pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they have a promiſe, that the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick.</p>
            <p>And what though the healing of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 17. and the diſeaſed people of the Iſland, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 9, 10. may be teaching to all, yet this doth not prove, that it is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple appertaining to the beginning of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

and to follow his Baptiſm. Nor do I ſee, that it is properly teaching to a Believer as ſuch; for what doth it add to the Faith of a Chriſtian, <hi>who believeth already, that Chriſt hath one far greater things than the healing of a diſeaſe?</hi> For he believeth, that he hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death, and brought life and immortality to light, by the Goſpel. Indeed, to thoſe that doubt whether Chriſt be the Son of God, ſuch a ſight may be ſome way convincing to them. But ſtill this is for the begetting of Faith, and ſo not the fourth principle of a Chriſtian. We ſee then, that laying on of Hands on perſons which are without, to work miracles, can with no ſhew of truth, be ſaid to be that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which is therefore a further evidence, that it is not in any wiſe to be recounted as milk for Babes, in the Church of Chriſt. I will end this point, with an argument from our Brethrens opinion; which is, <hi>that laying on of Hands for working miracles is ceaſed;</hi> whence I argue,</p>
            <p>All the principles of Chriſts doctrine <hi>do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> of which principles, <hi>Laying on of Hands is one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Laying on of Hands for working miracles</hi> (ſay our Brethren) <hi>is ceaſed; Ergo,</hi> laying on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107514:29"/>
of Hands for working miracles, is not that which is called a principle of the doctrine of Chriſt. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Laying on of Hands to heal the ſick, is not that which is called a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the doctrine of Chriſt. That the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame that is mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thus, That in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. is a principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt, a part of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But why ſo? Not ſimply as a bare Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, or Act done by man; but rather in reſpect of ſome divine thing ſignified, and obtainable, in the religious obſervation of it, as the proper undoubted end of that ſervice, and <hi>that for Babes in Chriſt.</hi> That laying on of Hands <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. doth agree with theſe conſiderations, being diſpenſed to Babes in Chriſt, religiouſly performed with prayer to God; and ſignified a ſpiritual benediction, and was uſeful for the obtaining of it, even the ſpirit of promiſe; and was therefore fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental to their Chriſtian ſtate. Again, that laying on of Hands <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 2. doth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follow Baptiſm, as its proper place; and ſo doth that laying on of Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and <hi>Acts</hi> 19. which cannot be ſaid of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laying on of Hands whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The due conſideration of the place of this laying on of Hands, is very material for our
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107514:29"/>
information, what particular laying on of Hands, is intended <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. Yea, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in any caſe, that the order of the truths of Chriſt be maintained, otherwiſe we ſhall be very prepoſterous in Religion; Let us then reflect upon that order, in which the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſtianity are propoſed to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. Here that faith which juſtifieth, muſt needs follow brokenneſs of heart, as not only Scripture, but Chriſtians experience doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And the promiſe of the holy Spirit doth follow the Baptiſm of repentance, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. And ſo doth the means which God hath provided for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that gift or promiſe; and ſo doth the Reſurrection precede the eternal judgement. Nor can I imagine how our diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren can ſatisfie their conſciences, touching the place of that laying on of Hands, which they imagine to be a principle of Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For let thoſe that ſay, it is laying on of hands upon the ſick, tell me where they will place it in the order of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and why it may not as well precede Faith, as follow Baptiſm? And how can thoſe that will have it to be laying on of hands on Officers, make it the fourth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, or fundamental to Chriſtianity, ſith in reaſon the Church muſt be founded, before
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107514:30"/>
ſhe ordain her Officers. As for thoſe which ſay, the laying on of hands <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mens laying wicked hands on the Saints, I ſay a more prodigious dream was ſcarce ever heard of: For how can that be the fourth principle of Chriſts, which neither he, nor none by his appointment, ever taught at all. And though it is true he ſpeaks of ſuch a thing, and fore-tels it, yet that proves it not his doctrine, for then it will follow, that <hi>Judas</hi> his treaſon, and all the impious acts fore-told in the Scripture, are the doctrines of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall we intermit <hi>Doctor Hammond</hi>'s conceit, as if the laying on of Hands, <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For whiles they lean to the Doctor, they have quite forgotten, that laying on of Hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſts doctrine, and a part of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; yea milk for Babes in Chriſt. But what ſhall we ſay, do none attain to all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, nor to every part of the foundation, but ſuch as fall after Baptiſm? Again, are they only Babes which fall ſo, as to need the indulgence of reconciliarion; or do not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107514:30"/>
ſtrong men fall, when Babes hold on their way? It is not forgotten, that the chief Author of this Search, did ſo fall, as to need the indulgence of reconciliation; from whence I conclude, that he either is a Babe, or elſe ſtrong men may fall; If the latter, then I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude, that if there be any ſuch laying on of hands as the Doctor ſuppoſes; but proves not (though our brethren unwari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay that he doth) yet it cannot be that which is mentioned, <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> 6. 2. for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforeſaid. As alſo, for that it would follow from this conceit, that one and the ſame perſon, muſt have hands impoſed on him 70 times and ſeven, if he fall ſo often after his Baptiſm, and require the indulgence of reconciliation.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but that our diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren would eaſily grant, that the laying on of Hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. is the very ſame that is mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. provided we did not urge the continuance of the practice in the Church of God. But then I would know, how we can rightly own that principle, if we deſtroy the practick part? And here let me ſeriouſly ask our Brethren, what manner of inſtruction they give young Diſciples, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter? or how they principle them in it, or build them upon it? Their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107514:31"/>
conſcience is witneſs, (I ſpeak what I know, for I alſo was as they are) that they either wholly paſs by that principle in ſilence, not inſtructing them at all concerning it; or elſe, if any thing be ſaid about it; it is rather to make the matter doubtful, than to clear their underſtandings in it. And indeed it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould do otherwiſe (as the caſe ſtands) for ſeeing they know not what it is, are therefore ſuch (I ſpeak it confidently, yet I truſt humbly) as (notwithſtanding their largeneſs in the knowledge of many things) have need to be taught this principle of the Oracles of God. Let it not offend them, though I plainly tell them, that in this point of Faith, they are too much like the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in another caſe, for as they by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription <hi>to the unknown God,</hi> declared plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ignorantly worſhipped him whom they know not; Even ſo our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whiles they grant (and all men muſt grant) laying on of Hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. to be a principle of Chriſts doctrine, and yet cannot determine what laying on of Hands that is; they do little leſs than ſubſcribe, to the <hi>UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KNOWN PRINCIPLE; or the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NKOWN PART OF THE FO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDATION.</hi> If o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, let them determine poſitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this principle, what it is; and let
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107514:31"/>
their diligence appear, in teaching it; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the reſt of the principles: which yet (to uſe their own dialect) I deſpair ever to ſee them perform either the one, or the other; at leaſt, ſo long as they carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards thoſe who ſhew them that which they ſo ignorantly pretend to own, ſo much like the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as to account of thoſe to <hi>be ſetters forth of ſtrange Principles,</hi> as they accounted <hi>Paul, a letter forth of ſtrange gods.</hi> And though you (as they) ſeem to be very deſirous to hear what in this caſe we have to ſay; yet when we have told you the truth, then, as they thought it a thing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that God ſhould raiſe the dead; ſo you think it incredible, that we ſhould receive any bleſſing, in the way of prayer with the laying on of Hands; as evidently appears by your demand, in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How doth your practiſe of laying on of hands, agree with theirs,</hi> (meaning the Apoſtles) <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. <hi>having no ſuch bleſſing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, as they had?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which demand, you ſeem to lye under two very great miſtakes; as firſt, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had the bleſſing of the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to communicate to others; as if, they could give the gift of propheſie, tongues, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, <hi>&amp;c!</hi> Secondly, that on whomſoever
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107514:32"/>
they laid their hands, the ſame received ſuch a bleſſing; to wit, the miraculous gifts of the Spirit. Which blinde conceits you never learned of <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> for they are the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8. Whoſe blindneſs was rebuked by <hi>Peter,</hi> affirming, that that bleſſing was the <hi>gift of God.</hi> Yea, it is written, <hi>and the Scripture cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> that <hi>every-good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights,</hi> &amp;c. Yea the Spirit it ſelf is free, <hi>blowing where it liſteth, and is therefore not to be communicated by any man whatſoever.</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that the Apoſtles had no bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to communicate to thoſe, on whom they laid their hands; but could only beg it at the hands of God, as the very words of the Text doth ſhew, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. They prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghoſt, not that they might receive the gift of tongues, miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Ghoſt. From the Text thus conſidered, I argue; <hi>He did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the bleſſing only, to whom the prayer was made for it. But the prayer was only made to God, therefore he only did communicate the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi> Again, <hi>They that beg a bleſſing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or for others, do not communicate that bleſſing to themſelves, or to others;</hi> But, <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:107514:32"/>
               <hi>did only beg the bleſſing of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore they did not communicate it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let it further be conſidered, that if that which they ask be <hi>obtainable,</hi> and <hi>obtained</hi> by thoſe that now wait upon God in prayer, with the laying on of Hands, then our practiſe doth agree very well with theirs; now what did they ask? The gift of tongues? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No, they only asked the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſurely the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is now <hi>attainable</hi> and <hi>attained, even there, where tongues are not attained;</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it will follow, that the greater part of the Saints in the primitive times, as well as the Saints in theſe dayes, have not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Holy Ghoſt; which is not only foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, but very pernicious to imagine. For <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 32. its ſaid, the Diſciples were filled with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oy, and with the Holy Ghoſt; and the Church is exhorted to be filled with the Spirit. All which may be attained to now, although the miraculous gifts of the Spirit be not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor indeed are they neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto; as the places laſt quoted do ſhew.</p>
            <p>Now that there is an agreement between the laying on of hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. and that which we practiſe, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear by this parallel: <hi>The Apoſtles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed laying on of Hands, with prayer to the</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:107514:33"/>
               <hi>Lord,</hi> and ſo do we; <hi>They performed this ſervice on Diſciples, as ſuch, whether male or female,</hi> and ſo do we; <hi>It was practiſed by them in order to the receiving the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſo it is by us; <hi>They placed laying on of Hands, in the fourth place of Chriſtian principles,</hi> and ſo do we; <hi>They asked not Tongues, and Miraculous gifts,</hi> no more do we: <hi>The effects of that ſervice depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not on them,</hi> no more it doth on us; But <hi>that was according to the will of the Father then,</hi> and ſo it is to us.</p>
            <p>Juſtly might we return our Brethrens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon themſelves, in their practiſes of prayer and preaching, when we conſider how God gave the Spirit in the likeneſs of fiery tongues, to the hundred and twenty Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who prayed with one accord, in one place: The like to which effect, never fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the moſt ſerious prayer, that ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from our Brethren. Muſt we then conclude, that there is no agreement between their prayer, and the prayer of the Church in thoſe dayes? This is the way to make void the the wayes of God, unleſs he give us the like effect at all times, which he ever gave to any, at any time. The like may be ſaid of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; For when <hi>Peter</hi> preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. the Holy Ghoſt fell on all that heard the word, ſo as that they ſpake with tongues. Would it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107514:33"/>
not be abſurd now to ſay, that <hi>Peter</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the bleſſing of tongues here? And thence to conclude, that none may preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have the bleſſing of tongues to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to thoſe to whom they preach.</p>
            <p>Nor may we ſay, that the like effect did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes follow the preaching of <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf; no nor his laying on of Hands neither. For there is no mention that thoſe Diſciples at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> received the gift of tongues; but only that they reeeived the Holy Ghoſt: For we have ſhewed, that the Holy Ghoſt may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo, as that perſons may be known, and ſaid by others to be full of the Holy Ghoſt, and yet the miraculous gifts of the Spirit may be abſent. Nor is it to be doubted, but that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had hands impoſed on him, in common with the reſt, ſith he was a Believer, and Baptized, and ſhewed as much zeal as the reſt (if not more) for its ſaid he continued with <hi>Philip,</hi> and wondered, beholding the miracles which were done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor was the deceit of his heart perceived, till after the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of laying on of Hands was performed, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. And yet certainly his receivings in reſpect of Spiritual bleſſings, was not ſo great, but that it may be ſafely preſumed, that many Chriſtians in theſe dayes, do receive the Holy Ghoſt as much as <hi>Simon M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gus</hi> did. And
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107514:34"/>
though <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to him, thou haſt no part or lot in this matter, yet the words [this matter] cannot refer to <hi>Simons</hi> deſire of ſubjection to laying on of Hands; but to his ambitious and avaritious deſire, to be a Miniſter to diſpence that ordinance to others, for carnal advantage.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is much doubted, whether laying on of Hands, was ever taught or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by authority from heaven, me thinks this ſhould not be hard to be underſtood. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we can be ſo void of reaſon, as to dream that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> when they came among the Diſciples, went prepoſterouſly, from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to perſon, praying and putting their hands upon them, and that without telling them what they meant by it.

            <p>That the Apoſtles ſhould practiſe with ſuch frequency, this ſervice of prayer with the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands, upon Diſciples generally; That it ſhould be recorded among the chief of their Acts, in promoting the Goſpel, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Churches, that it ſhould be placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the principles of Religion, and all this without authority from heaven, is unworthy the followers of Chriſt or his Apoſtles to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as divers have laboured to ſatisfie the contrary minded in this point, whoſe works are extant &amp; unanſwered, I ſhall not inſiſt farther; ſave that I do briefly ſhew that our Brethren, are not conſiſtent with themſelves in this particular. For they do that themſelves, which they will not allow themſelves to do; for they practice laying on of Hands on Officers, for which there is as little by way of precept as for the laying Hands on Diſciples, or rather leſs. For ſince
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107514:35"/>
they do now acquit that Text, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. as not having any thing to do with the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Ordination; and to ſtrengthen a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary interpretation, do bring the Suffrages of Dr. <hi>Hammond, Victor, Cyprian,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Carthage; ſure I am they have no Text which hath ſo much as the face of a precept [I mean in ſo many words] for laying hands upon Officers; although it is beyond doubt with me, that that way was ordained of God, to depute his ſervants in the Miniſtery, to their works reſpectively; wherefore I will conclude this diſcourſe, with this Enthememe.</p>
            <p>There is ſufficient ground in Scripture for laying on of Hands on Officers in the Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is ſufficient ground in Scripture for laying hands on Members of the Church. And whereas our Brethren do make a ſhew (by their actions out of ſome ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as well as Modern) as if Antiquity were on their part in this Controverſie; I will therefore put in ſomething by way of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to the contrary, as I finde them; partly from the Authors themſelves, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from ſuch as have gathered certain ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of the works of the Ancients concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter.</p>

                     <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> Heb. 6. 2. <hi>was held and practiſed by the primitive Church, as a principle of Chriſts Doctrine;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ergo, <hi>It ought to be held and practiſed as a principle of Chriſts Doctrine now, by the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Antecedent is proved above, therefore the conſequence is indubitable; which yet I may demonſtrate thus.</p>
                  <p>Argument 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>None of the principles of Chriſts Doctrine (which were practical) are aboliſhed, no more then thoſe which are not practical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ergo, <hi>Laying on of Hands as a practical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> Heb. 6. 2. <hi>ought now to be practiſed by the ſervants of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Antecedent cannot be denied, without manifeſt danger to all the principles of Chriſts Doctrine; for if one be aboliſhed, then why not the reſt? So then the conſequence muſt not be denied.</p>
                  <p>The third branch of my poſition proved, Viz. <hi>That the Laying on of Hands,</hi> Heb. 6. 2. <hi>is a part of the foundation there mentioned.</hi>
                  </p>

But firſt, for explication of the word <hi>[Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation]</hi> it is to be conſidered; That when it is applied to Chriſtianity; or the Church of God; It may be conſidered firſt originally, and in the main, and ſo Chriſt our Lord is only the foundation. Or ſecondly, demonſtratively, or in the mean; and ſo his doctrine may be ſaid to be the foundation, by an uſual manner of ſpeech, when the thing containing or holding forth is taken for the thing contained or held forth. For, whatſoever Chriſt is in himſelf, certain it is, he is not a foundation <hi>TO <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> But as he is held forth in his doctrine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence I argue,</p>
                  <p>Argument 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The word Foundation,</hi> Heb. 6. 1. <hi>cannot be refer'd to Chriſt, as the foundation of his Church, originally, or in the main, or in the higheſt or moſt ſublime conſideration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ergo, <hi>The word [Foundation] is refer'd to the doctrine of Chriſt, in the firſt, or moſt eaſie demonſtration; to wit, the firſt rudiments, or principles of Religion; even ſuch as Babes in Chriſt may know them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Antecedent is true, otherwiſe what ſhall we think of <hi>Paul.</hi> Would he not teach the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107514:42"/>
Chriſtians concerning the knowledge of Chriſt in the more ſublime points of Chriſtianity? Surely he profeſſes to do this, at the time he wrote to them; and indeed, how elſe could he lead them on to perfection? <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11. and 6. 3. So that our conſequence is very ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                  <p>Argument 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The word Foundation,</hi> Heb. 6. 1. <hi>is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of all theſe particulars, to wit, Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, <hi>the word Foundation,</hi> Heb. 6. 1. <hi>is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of Laying on of Hands,</hi> Heb. 6. 2. <hi>as well as any of the reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Antecedent is true, may in part be perceived by the Searchers themſelves; For they were more rational than <hi>to deny,</hi> the word Foundation to be meant, of this or that particular only; and <hi>grant</hi> it to be meant of the reſt. Therefore they would have <hi>none of the ſaid particulars</hi> to be underſtood by, or comprehended in the word <hi>Foundation,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it only to Chriſt; which yet is contrary to their own opinion, ſith they have ſince granted, <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> Heb 6. 2. <hi>to be a part of the Foundation.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:107514:43"/>
The conſequence is good, becauſe no reaſon can be aſſigned, why the doctrine of Baptiſm ſhould be a part of the foundation there meant, rather than the promiſe of the Holy Spirit, with the way of God to ſeek for it.</p>

            <head>The Second part. Of the Conſtitution of a true CHURCH.</head>
            <p>NEither are the demands of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, about what truths, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof are neceſſary to the Conſtitution of a true Church, ſo difficult; but that we ſhall give them a direct anſwer, at leaſt to a larger degree, than what they in that caſe have aſſigned; for they only ſet down Faith, Repentance and Baptiſm, with a holy life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> omitting not only the fourth principle of Chriſts Doctrine, (though they confeſs laying on of Hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. to be a part of the foundation) but alſo they omit the Belief of the Reſurrection, and the eternal Judgment. If it ſhould be ſaid that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the two laſt principles in that of Faith towards God, we muſt tell them they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107514:44"/>
had better by far have expreſſed them; for certainly in this caſe we cannot be too expreſs, if we expreſs nothing but the truth. But to be plain, it's juſtly ſuſpected that they do not make the Knowledge or Belief of the Reſurrection and eternal judgment neceſſary to the Eſſence of a true Church; for if they had, they would ſome where or other have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted theſe truths to be neceſſary in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; which they have not done, but rather argued to the contrary, whiles they reaſon from the ſtate of the Church before Chriſts Aſcenſion to the ſtate of the Church after it, as we ſhall ſee more anon.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, I anſwer directly to their demands, (in this caſe) That the belief and practice (ſo far as they are practical) of all theſe principles or truths, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. Are neceſſary to the right or perfect Conſtitution of a true Church, which I thus demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the firſt principles of Gods Oracles</hi> (from the time they were in being) <hi>are neceſſary to be known, believed, &amp;c. in the Conſtitution of a true Church:</hi> Ergo, <hi>all thoſe trutbs, Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. <hi>Are neceſſary to be known, believed, &amp;c. in the conſtitution of a true Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> I prove, becauſe, <hi>firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are either neceſſary in the conſtitution of a true Church, or not at all. But firſt principles are</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:107514:44"/>
               <hi>neceſſary;</hi> Ergo, <hi>they are neceſſary in the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a true Church.</hi> This will yet further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by conſidering every principle apart af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Repentance from dead works be not neceſſary to the conſtitution or beginning of a true Church, no man can ſhew a reaſon why it ſhould be neceſſary at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Faith towards God be not neceſſary to the conſtitution of a true Church, then not at all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If Baptiſms be not neceſſary to be taught, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the conſtitution of a true Church, then not at all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If Laying on of Hands for the promiſed and Sealing Spirit be not neceſſary in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a true Church, then not neceſſary at all.</p>
            <p n="5,6">5,6. If the Knowledge that the dead ſhall riſe again and be judged, be not neceſſary in the conſtitution of a true Church, then not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at all. And therefore I argue further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Milk is neceſſary for Babes, or mankind in his firſt eſtate;</hi> Ergo, <hi>all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe principles,</hi> Heb. 6. 1, 2. <hi>Are neceſſary to Churches in their beginning, or conſtitution.

And that which pertains to Babes in Chriſt,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107514:45"/>
and conſequently to the conſtitution of Churches.</p>
            <p>Again, If the Principles of Religion be not to be taught in the beginning of our Chriſtian State, no man can tell the time when theſe things ought to be taught. For paſs but the time of the beginning, Plantation, or founding of Churches, and let our Brethren reſolve us concerning the proper time to begin to teach the Principles of Religion, and particularly, that principle of Laying on of Hands? Mean while we conclude, that the proper time to inſtruct Men concerning the promiſe of the Spirit, and conſequently touching the means to obtain it, is at or about the time of their beginning their Chriſtian courſe, or being made the Members of Chriſts Body, becauſe every Member of that body ought to be vivified by that one Spirit, which God hath promiſed to them that obey him.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>The whole foundation is neceſſary to the constitution of a true Church;</hi> Ergo, <hi>all the principles,</hi> Heb 6. <hi>are neceſſary to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a true Church.</hi>
            </p>

               </gap>ucture is not like to be ſecure, if the Foundation be defective The conſequence is good, becauſe every principle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. is a part of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107514:45"/>
and ſo Laying on of Hands among the reſt, as is granted on all ſides.</p>
            <p>Nor will our Brethrens <hi>demands</hi> grounded on <hi>the ſtate of the Church before the Aſcention of our Lord,</hi> prejudice ought that we have ſaid, ſeeing it is evident, that they were not only ignorant of the <hi>promiſe of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>by what means it ſhould be obtained,</hi> but they were plainly ignorant that Chriſt muſt die for the ſins of men, and riſe again for their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as appears <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>And he</hi> [that is Jeſus] <hi>ſaid unto them</hi> [that is his Diſciples] <hi>what things? And they ſaid unto him concerning Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>which was a Prophet mighty indeed, and word before God, and all the people. And the chief Prieſts and how our Rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him; But we</hi> TRUSTED <hi>that it had been he that ſhould have delivered</hi> Iſrael. <hi>And beſide all this, to day is the third day ſince theſe things were done;</hi> yea, <hi>and certain women alſo of our own company,</hi> made us aſtoniſhed, <hi>which were early at the Sepulchre, and when they found not his Body, they came, ſaying that they had alſo ſein a Viſion of Angels, which ſaid</hi> That he was alive. <hi>And certain that was with us went to the Sepulcher, and found it even as the women had ſaid, but him they ſaw not; Then he ſaid</hi> [that is Jeſus] <hi>unto them,</hi> [that is his Diſciples] <hi>O fools, and ſlow of</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:107514:46"/>
               <hi>heart, to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken, ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence theſe three things are evident. 1. That Chriſts Diſciples were ignorant that he ſhould work mans deliverance by dying for them. 2. That he ſhould overcome death by riſing again from the dead. 3. That Chriſt both reproves their ignorance, and inſtructs them in the knowledge of the Scriptures touching theſe principles.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee what our Brethren have gained by quering from the ſtate of the Church before, to the ſtate of the Church after the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of our Lord; ſurely not an hairs-breadth of proof, that Laying on of Hands ſhould be diſpenſed with in the perfect conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a true Church, any more than that the knowledge of Chriſts dying for our ſins, and riſing again for our juſtification, may be diſpenſed with in like manner.</p>
            <p>But howſoever it was the pleaſure of God to wink at the days of this ignorance, yet ſurely we know that men are not now under the promiſe of ſalvation, unleſs they confeſs with the mouth the Lord Jeſus [that is, not to cry Lord Lord only, but acknowledge him their Lord purchaſer, and their Lord commander] and ſhall believe in their heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead: whence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107514:46"/>
if they be not under the promiſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they are very unfit for Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>And here we will take notice of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Where the Apoſtles Laid Hands upon any after they had received the Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ground of this demand ſeems to be corrupt in two reſpects; firſt, in that it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that if the end of an Ordinance be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the Ordinance ceaſeth. The contrary to which is evident in the caſe of Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47, 48. For Baptiſm in the ordinary way of Gods communicating the graces of the Goſpel is antecedent to the reception thereof, &amp; is propounded as a means wherein not only the Remiſſion of our ſins ſhall be granted to us, but as a condition whereupon we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 38. yet we know the Spirit was (once at leaſt) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and received before Baptiſm was diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yea thoſe perſons had the chief end of Baptiſm; for God that knew their hearts did now evidence the Remiſſion of their ſins, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyng their hearts by Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. yet did not all this in the leaſt make void that ſolemn Ordinance, the Baptiſm of Repentance for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, which was fore-ordained to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and Sacramentally to confer the grace of the pardon of ſin, and the inward waſhing of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107514:47"/>
the Conſcience by Faith in the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt. If then the end of an Ordinance being obtained, doth not make void the practick part (during the time that the Church is under Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances) then who can forbid prayer with the Impoſition of Hands, for the gift of the promiſed Spirit, even for thoſe that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a meaſure thereof already, ſeeing none will ſay (I truſt) that they have received ſo much, but that they are capable of receiving more.</p>
            <p>Again, it is the will of God that there ſhould be no Schiſm in the body, nor confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Doctrine or practice of his holy things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 33. And therefore hath not ordained a divided or confuſed order in the conſtitution of his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which yet cannot be avoided, if once it be allowed that part of a Congregation (under a pretence that they have the Spirit or gift of the Holy Ghoſt already) muſt be admitted to all manner of priviledges in the Church, without any regard had to an Ordinance, or principle of the Goſpel, without the obſervation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the other part cannot arrive at the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Communion in the ſame body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being guilty of the breach of order. A weak ſight may perceive whither ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit would lead us at laſt, even into that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107514:47"/>
whither many are gone, who (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) becauſe they have the kernel, to wit, the Spirit, they have no need of the ſhell, to wit, the Ordinance of God [as if that Spirit which leads men into diſobedience were the Holy Ghoſt] till at length they have <hi>ſo much Spirit,</hi> that the knowledge of Chriſt crucified without the gates of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is of as little eſteem with them as his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>The other corrupt ground of this demand ſeems to be an <hi>over-weaning conceit of preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings,</hi> and hath too much of that Language, <hi>What pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe latter words (I confeſs) do make a fair ſhew, yet are as little ſatisfactory to us with reſpect to the truth under conſideration, as the like reſolution would be to them, from ſuch perſons of other perſwaſions as ſhould deſire Communion with them, only deſiring to be born with, in the caſe of Holy Baptiſm, till they ſee it to be their duty; though in the mean time, they frequently diſpute and write againſt it, and do more than any other Adverſaries what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to weaken the Hands of many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who religiouſly obſerve it, as neceſſary to the perfect conſtitution of the Church of Chriſt. I ſay, like as this kind of reſolution, would little comfort our Brethren, ſo doth the other as little comfort us, till we ſee them in good earneſt more ſolicitous for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth which they ſee not, than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto (or at leaſt than by this their ſearch) they have appeared to be. But notwithſtanding this, and much more of like nature which might be ſaid, I ſhall anſwer this demand with all integrity and ingenuity: And firſt Negatively.</p>

               <hi>the conſtitution of Churches, if there be one in all the New Teſtament]</hi> I ſay, that our Brethren hath <hi>ſuch a conſtitution,</hi> or <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> I muſt plainly deny, and for the grounds of this denyal I dare refer my ſelf (if not to the Conſciences of our differing Brethren yet) to the Reaſons and Scripture-evidences preceding: But Secondly,</p>
            <p>That our Brethren have a Church-ſtate in ſome good meaſure according to truth; I muſt and do chearfully grant, like as I muſt grant him to be a man in reſpect of the genus, who wants an hand, or foot; as alſo in reſpect of that meaſure of Form and proportion which he holds with other men, and yet deny the ſame perſon to be a man in reſpect of the ſpecies or parts, which are neceſſary to the perfect Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, compoſition and Form of a man. Or as I may call an Edifice by the name of an houſe, though it want not only much of its compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in reſpect of the Superſtructure (as God knows all Churches do) but alſo though it be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way defective, by reaſon of the <hi>abſence</hi> of ſome material part of the <hi>Foundation,</hi> which <hi>defect</hi> no Churches (but by reaſon of their wilful want) need to have; for though it is certainly true, <hi>

yet doubtleſs we may learn all the <hi>Rudiments</hi> or firſt principles of Chriſtianity, maugre the oppoſition of Sathan and all his Auxiliaries; otherwiſe it will follow that we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ſtature of Babes in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And that we may improve our Simile (by which we have explained our ſelves in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the moſt important of our Brethrens demands) for the defence of the truth under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Let it be conſidered, that look how far forth ſuch a neceſſary Member as the Hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth conduce, not only to the well-being, but even to the very being of the body Natural, ſo far doubtleſs the leaſt Foundation principle of Chriſtianity, conduceth not only to the well-being, but to the very being of the Church of Chriſt; and conſequently as he that taketh a Member from the body Natural (be it Hand or other Member) detracteth ſomewhat from the being of ſuch a body, even ſo, he that taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the principles or Foundation of Chriſtianity, doth intrench upon the being of the body Myſtical.</p>
            <p>Now, that the Laying on of Hands, Heb. 6. 2. is ſuch a principle as is a part of the Foundation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is granted by our Brethren (as we have heard) and therefore we do with good right ſtand for it, as neceſſary even to the Eſſence of a Church, <hi>in ſuch ſort as we have even now decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>

puniſhed, yet he hath no where by any <hi>ſtanding Law</hi> enjoyned ſuch a penalty; but on the contrary, hath permitted ſuch Marriages to continue as have been unlawfully made, as is evident in the caſe of <hi>Leah,</hi> who was fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently given to <hi>Jacob,</hi> by which means <hi>Rachel</hi> the lawful Spouſe was withheld from her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>

            <p>Nothing can be ſaid, why the Marriage of <hi>Leah</hi> to <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould ſtand, that will not as well argue the continuance of the Marriages of ſuch as err in the caſe of their choice as aforeſaid, the ſin being rather greater in the one, than in the other; for it was not lawful to marry two Siſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially not in the life-time of each other.

a <hi>wicked man,</hi> yet divers ſuch Marriages were permitted (when contracted) though never commanded, and ſo never lawful by any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God.</p>
            <p>When the ſin of marrying unlawfully was puniſhed, by ſeparating the perſons ſo coupled, the <hi>Children</hi> alſo was put away as well as the <hi>Wives,</hi> which howſoever it might ſtand with the ſtate of the Jewiſh Church (and perhaps was neceſſary in reſpect of their Terreſtrial Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and the policy of their Nation) yet ſurely it would be great cruelty for men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtianity, to turn their Wives and Children out of doors, who both by <hi>the Law of Nature, and Nations</hi> have as clear a right to all Temporal or Domeſtical priviledges now, as the Husband himſelf in any Nation whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

and take the thing which God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of our Churches about Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel is this, that the adorning of Chriſtians ought not to be that of <hi>plating the hair, wearing of Gold, nor coſtly array,</hi> with Rings and toys, as the humour of phantaſtick perſons in City or Country commonly leads them. But that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, moderation, modeſty, and yet decency, according to the ſtate and condition of perſons reſpectively, ſhould be obſerved on all ſides, that ſo Chriſtians might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to others, even in theſe matters. And what though ſome perſon or perſons in the Church be more than ordinary ſet againſt the vain faſhions of our days, and ſometimes lets their zeal go a ſtep too far, is this ſo offenſive to our Brethren, that they can no way bear this without ſuch a publick reprehenſion? I fear in ſo doing they may have done the Church more diſſervice, then thoſe whom they inveigh againſt.</p>
            <p>What the Searchers ſhould mean about theſe matters being made the <hi>Eſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107514:55"/>
aſhamed, (yet we mean not that they ſhould be accounted as enemies, but admoniſhed as Brethren) and ſurely, if this be their meaning, that offenders in theſe caſes muſt be let alone in their ſins; we ſhould in ſo doing looſe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in time the Eſſence of Churches. For ſuppoſe now a gallant of the Times ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be Baptized, and to walk in Communion with the Searchers, only he tells them they muſt give him leave <hi>to marry out of the Church,</hi> and allow him the liberty to tranſgreſs the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical decrees,</hi> in eating bloud and things ſtrangled, and meats offered to Idols: and therewithall that he may <hi>wear</hi> Gold, <hi>and</hi> tread the ſteps of the <hi>Gallants in matters of Apparel, &amp;c.</hi> Would the Searchers now admit ſuch a perſon into their Communion? if not, then they make theſe things as neceſſary to Church-communion as we do: And certainly that which is ground ſufficient to keep men out of the Church, will juſtifie a Church in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from ſuch, if they refuſe to reform.</p>
            <p>To give evidence by Oath, to terminate ſtrife among men, we have not one Congregation in <hi>England</hi> (that I can hear of) doth oppoſe it, (indeed ſome particular perſons are doubtful in that matter, becauſe of our Saviours words, <hi>Swear not at all)</hi> and therefore it was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily put to publick obſervation, as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107514:56"/>
an Eſſential of our Church-Communion.</p>
            <p>What the Searchers do ſuggeſt againſt ſome, as <hi>denying that Chriſt took fleſh of the Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> is, I confeſs, a matter of great importance. And ſure I am, many of our Congregations never heard of ſuch a thing, till the Searchers became their informers: nor do I think there is ſo much as one Congregation in <hi>England</hi> that holds ſuch a thing (for particulars no man may ſpeak) however upon this occaſion I can do no leſs then proteſt againſt that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a moſt <hi>dangerous conceit;</hi> nothing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to theirs that <hi>deny that glorious and bleſſed perſon to be God by Nature;</hi> for as the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies his <hi>Manhood,</hi> the other denies his <hi>Godhead,</hi> and ſo between them we have little left to fix on, for our Redemption and Salvation.</p>
            <p>And as I have ſhewed my diſlike to theſe conceits (to ſay no more at preſent) ſo I hold it requiſite to proteſt my Faith in this caſe, as I have been taught, and as I have believed, and as (I truſt) I ſhall hold faſt unto the end.</p>
            <p>That Faith which I have learned (and is the Faith of our Churches generally) is this, Firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the - Lord Jeſus, the Saviour of the World is God by Nature, and therefore of one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the Father as touching his Godhead.</hi> He is called the only begotten of the Father.

               </list>
Thoſe and ſuch like tend only to the ruine of Churches, having no tendency at all to Edification.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe ſhewed it ſelf among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when they ſtrove to ſet up men; ſome this man, and others that, and this in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition one unto another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.

            <p>The ſecond is rebuked, Rom. 14. <hi>But why doſt thou judge thy Brother, or ſet at nought thy Brother?</hi> (meaning for things indifferent) <hi>Therefore who art thou that judgeſt another mans Servant? to his own Maſter he ſtands or falls, yea he ſhall be holden up, for God is able to make him ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is detected, Gal. 5. 15. for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the queſtion was, this was their ſin, they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107514:62"/>
did <hi>bite one another.</hi> Thus men may <hi>hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and without Charity, <hi>preach Chriſt meerely of envy to add thereby ſome affliction to the bonds of their brethren.</hi> Thoſe kind of diviſions in the ages bordering upon the Apoſtles <hi>became the Heathens ſport (and the Chriſtians ſhame) upon their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pen Theaters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore now return to conſider the Nature of that diſtemper which hath befallen our body about the fourth principle of Chriſt his Doctrine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>The Searchers have declared it to be the ſin of Schiſm; and the part diſtempered to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Congregations under the practice of Laying on of Hands, as is evident from the whole Contexture of their ſearch, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recton of the Epiſtle prefixed to it, as if there were nothing amiſs in this matter on their part who (if I may ſo ſpeak) have made (and defended) a Schiſm in the principles of the Doctrine of our Lord, and there withall divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves from a principle thereof.</p>
            <p>And this word SCHISM is taken by the Searchers not in a mild ſenſe, ſuch as wherein it may be taken by propriety of Speech to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie diviſion in ſome lower conſideration, as the word is tranſlated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. But they have hoyſed it in their application of it to the Congregations, profeſſing the fourth principle
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107514:62"/>
to the moſt extream ſignification, even that of <hi>Sedition;</hi> yea to ſuch a degree, as if we <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Which how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true that is, their own Search doth teſtifie, for there they confeſs that we own them for Churches at ſome turns, (they ſay) but ſurely, (to let go this taunt) what, we confeſs them to be at any time, we confeſs them to be at all times, and that is a Church of Chriſt, though ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular in point of Conſtitution.</note> 
               <hi>all Churches but our ſelves.</hi> As if it were a light matter to brand all thoſe Churches for <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> But they ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that bare abſtaining from communion, chiefly at the Table of the Lord (which is all that hath been done <hi>generally,</hi> if ſo much have been done) and that upon ſuch <hi>immergent</hi> occaſion, as hath (at leaſt in the time of hot conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) been given for it, is far from being ſufficient to bear them out in this their <hi>raſh charge</hi> againſt their Brethren. Seeing our Saviour himſelf puts a bar for coming to the Altar, while diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between Brother and Brother, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains undecided, which being duly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may juſtly cauſe the ſober Chriſtian to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of ſuch a communion as (I perceive) the Searchers would <hi>(hand ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r head)</hi> involve us into.</p>
            <p>Now, what hath been done by ſome <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons</hi> among us in reſpect of <hi>Church-rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:107514:63"/>
or unchurching other Churches through <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>prepoſterus zeal,</hi> as I do not perfectly know, ſo I will not in any wiſe go about to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. But ſure I am, it is no good ground for you to aſperſe all our Congregations with ſuch mens actions; no more then the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous actions by ſome among you (for ſuch there hath been, both particular perſons and Congregations) will juſtifie us to faſten the like reproach upon you, which hitherto we have not done, nor intend to take the advantage of your procreation to do it now.</p>
            <p>And what though there hath been (during the time of theſe contentions and oppoſitions) a diſtinction in communion between the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations aforeſaid, held to be needful, at leaſt in ſome things (wherein Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating one with another, cannot be very comfortable without unity in their Doctrine and practice) yet ſure this hath been done (generally) without contracting the guilt of <hi>Schiſm</hi> on either ſide, in reſpect of all ſuch as in the midſt of all theſe <hi>diſſentions,</hi> have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the great engagement of <hi>Charity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another. And for thoſe that have not ſo done, its juſtly feared the guilt hath been as great on the one ſide, as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:107514:63"/>
This <hi>diſtinction in communion,</hi> hath been held (I preſume) by all wiſe Chriſtians, rather of neceſſity, then for any delight they have had in it, partly for that the truth in queſtion would otherwiſe have been ſlighted <hi>as a thing but at moſt indifferent;</hi> And there is no readier way to deſtroy any truth, then to let it paſs with ſuch an eſtimation. And partly, for that contention would ever have been riſing between Members of the ſame particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and no means remaining to pacifie thoſe diviſions. For, what pious Paſtor of the Church can juſtifie his admitting ſome to the Lords Table without imbracing (nay though oppoſing) the fourth principle of Chriſtianity, and yet with the ſame breath deny another that liberty? The truth is, this diſparity in judgment and practice muſt admit of one thing out of two (at leaſt ſo long as the Spirit of contradiction worketh,) <hi>viz.</hi> either that the parties diſſenting may ſit down in diſtinct Congreations, without the offence or grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one againſt another, or elſe it muſt admit of diſpencing with moſt of the principles of our Religion, one by one till indeed we have none left intire; as will appear by ſingling them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and yielding to each opinioniſt the plea which our Brethren do uſe in the caſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, which in effect is this.</p>

Why ſhould we not ſit down at the Lords Table with you; Seeing we own all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſts Doctrine as you do (which yet I fear, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> except the fourth? and as touching that, we ſay and believe, that <hi>the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands in</hi> Heb. 6. 2. <hi>is a principle of Chriſts doctrine, and a part of the founlation;</hi> yet we deny that Laying on of Hands, which you hold to be that principle. This plea being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, a ſecond comes and pleads thus,</p>
            <p>Let us build with you, for we own all the principles of Religion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1,2. as you do, except that of Faith, and yet we ſay Faith is a principle according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. but we deny that faith which you ſay is there meant to be that principle.</p>
            <p>A third comes and ſays, we have right to ſit down in communion with you, for we do own all the principles, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. only the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Baptiſms which you ſay is there meant, we deny to be a principle of Chriſts Doctrine, and do ſay that it is your own <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> or <hi>tradition,</hi> yet we own the Doctrine of Baptiſms.</p>
            <p>A fourth pretends they own all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only that Reſurrection of the dead, which we ſay is a principle of Chriſtianity, they term an <hi>Humane innovation,</hi> yet they profeſs to believe the Reſurrection.</p>

And upon theſe pretenſions they demand the priviledges of Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us in all things.</p>
            <p>Now admitting laying on of Hands (as we hold) to be as undoubtedly a principle of Chriſts Doctrine, as any of the reſt (as that is our caſe.) Let our Brethren reſolve us how we ſhall diſpenſe with them in rejecting and oppoſing that principle, and yet do nothing at all to the prejudice of any other principle, or part of the Foundation?</p>
            <p>Certain it is (as before we have hinted) there is no Artifice of Sathan ſo likely to wear out this or any other truth, as to make it ſubject to the wills of men, <hi>viz.</hi> to admit men to the ſame degree of Eſtimation and fitneſs for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the Church, though they deny this truth, as if they owned it. And whilſt our Brethren are labouring with all their might to bring the fourth principle of Chriſts Doctrine to this ſtate of ſubjection, others are as bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily tampering with the Doctrine of Baptiſm and have prevailed to the great reproach of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107514:65"/>
thoſe Chriſtians who have ſuffered themſelves and the truth to be thus abuſed.</p>
            <p>Open oppoſition though too bad, yet is more advantagious to the truth, then ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended friendſhip; for truth being oppoſed, hath ſtrength and Authority to withſtand its greateſt Adverſary. <hi>But if once ſubtil men creep into the Church under a ſpecious pretenſe of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the knowledge of ſuch truths as they have a deſign to overthrow;</hi> theſe prove the greateſt prophaners and ſubverters of the ways of God in the world.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107514:66"/>
as it was written in the Law, but this was an extraordinary caſe as we have ſhewed before.

about ſome <hi>differing apprehenſions</hi> about <hi>the end of that Miniſtration,</hi> ſith themſelves are divided both about the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>the principle it ſelf.</hi> I ſay, put caſe now, that ſome among you ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Layng on of Hands on Officers <hi>to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of God,</hi> and tell you it is <hi>an innovation of man</hi> (to ſay no worſe) and that you have no command from God for it; and thereupon they bring all the Arguments againſt you which you deviſe againſt us. And not only ſo, but they carry on all the Affairs of the Church without any regard had to that orderly way of ordaining men to Office by prayer with the Laying on of Hands. Only, becauſe its your <hi>humour</hi> to have men ſo ordained, therefore in condeſcention to your <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and that they may the better <hi>bring you off that uſage</hi> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you once, twice or thrice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to preach up ſuch a thing in their Congregations. Do you now make ſo little conſcience of that Laying on of Hands which you practice, and that as a part of the Foundation (ſay ſome of you) as that you could maintain a free and chearful communion with ſuch perſons? Howſoever you may ſhuffle in this caſe, conſidering the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which you encline to in the other, yet ſurely were you free from that temptation, you would find no ſmall difficulties to hold ſuch communion with thoſe who ſhould not only
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107514:70"/>
make void, but even deſpiſe (for 'tis no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that wholſome and Divine order which God hath left for the Government of his Houſe.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>general Aſſemblies,</hi> which are ordained for general Controverſies, and which through the bleſſing of God are the beſt expedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun, for compoſing diviſions in the Churches. Here the liberty of Chriſtians ſhould be; yea, muſt be maintain'd, though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer right much in their opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in matters of Religion, and therefore we have (indeed) very Chriſtianly admitted the Searchers to ſuch our Aſſemblies; knowing well, that not only the Chriſtians in the <hi>ages bordering upon the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> but even <hi>the Apoſtles of our Lord did allow</hi> Chriſtians of very different perſwaſions, freely to deliberate on things propounded in ſuch Aſſemblies. But yet we little thought that our Brethren would have abuſed us in the ſight of the World, for this our Chriſtian reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as if we were inconſiſtant with our principles in ſuch our condeſcentions, unleſs we alſo communicate with them at the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Surely this kind of dealing is unlikely to effect the peace and concord of our too much divided Congregations.</p>
            <p>For my part, I could heartily wiſh that all the Congregations of Chriſtians in the World
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107514:70"/>
that are baptized according to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 2. 38. would make one <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> (at leaſt ſome times) to conſider of the matters in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference among them. For, if this be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there is no means under Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining (as I conceive) to heal their diviſions, and conſequently to obtain that peace which ſhould rule in the hearts of all Gods people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are thereunto called in one (univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal) body.</p>
            <p>And herein (I conceive) an union in the main may be held, though in our particular communities, for the avoiding (otherwiſe inevitable) inconveniencies, we are conſtrained to hold ſome diſtinctions. For, it is one thing <hi>to forſake</hi> the Church of Chriſt, and another to ceaſe communicating with ſuch a particular Congregation, as in the time of Reformation, will needs ſtay behind in the ſteps of irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The firſt can be no other than Schiſm, ſith there can be no cauſe to forſake the Church of God, though there may be cauſe to <hi>forbear</hi> communicating with ſome particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or Congregations thereof. The other is ſo far from <hi>Schiſm,</hi> that it is more truly called <hi>Reformation,</hi> nor doth it follow that becauſe we efuſe to communicate with our Brethren in rheir irregular proceedings in the matters of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107514:71"/>
Religion, that therefore we reject them in thoſe principles of truth which they do religiouſly obſerve, and zealouſly profeſs: neither is our diſtinguiſhing our Congregations from theirs, ſo much <hi>a ſeparation</hi> from them, as a <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of our ſelves, ſo that the 10. and 11. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the <hi>Searchers</hi> might well have been ſpared, ſith as things ſtand among us, they are not only unneceſſary, but I fear may prove very pernicious to the peace of our Churches.</p>
            <p>Let me now conclude with a free Word to the Brethren of both perſwaſions; And that is, to beſeech you to conſider one another as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and not as Adverſaries, and as Brethren to put on Charity one towards another; and chiefly you that are zealous for the principle under debate; the more you walk in the truth, the more it concerns you to ſhew forth your works with meekneſs of wiſdom, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in that gift of the Spirit which hopeth and believeth all things, which doubtleſs will teach you to believe this of your Brethren in general, that if they ſaw the truth as you do, they would be nothing leſs zealous for it then your ſelves, and conſider in the mean time as they are erroneous in our judgments (and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly erroneous they are) ſo we ſeem to be to them. And though the conſequence of their rejecting one principle of Religion, do indeed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107514:71"/>
endanger the reſt, yet let us believe, that if they were awar of this, they would abhor ſuch an opinion as doth ſo prejudice the Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Our Brethren do err, it is true, but they err with a conſcience void of errour, becauſe (as may be hoped) they know not that they err. Now Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind, is not puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up againſt any that zealouſly ſerve the Lord, though perhaps they err from many of his Precepts. Charity is not the companion of that <hi>exceſs of indiſcreet zeal</hi> which abounds in ſome men, for it knoweth that temperance is as neceſſary in our zeal, as mercy is in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, violent Spirits ſeldom or never doth the Church ſervice without diſſervice; And let us conſider that the truth we ſtand for, hath no need of our paſſions to defend it; no, its own authority will ſupport it againſt the ſtrongeſt oppoſition, therefore <hi>let your moderation appear to all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Brethren on the other ſide, Let me thus ſpeak, beware that you deſpiſe not your Brethren eſpecially you that are men of parts, becauſe you being taken for Brethren of high degree, muſt now if you own the truth which you have oppoſed, ſeem to be abaſed. You that have been Inſtructers of the ſimple, muſt now learn of Babes, or at leaſt ſuch things as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107514:72"/>
to Babes. Whereupon if you ask your conſciences, I am perſwaded you (or at leaſt ſome of you) have met with ſuch reaſonings, as once a Wiſe man met with upon an occaſion like to this, when he reaſoned with his friend after this manner. <hi>Becauſe others are gone before, is it a ſhame for us to come after? or is it not rather a great ſhame not at all to go after them.</hi> Aug. Confeſſ. l. 8. c 8.</p>
            <p>And let it be conſidered how upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the right manner of Baptizing (for men had forſaken the way of God both in the ſubject and manner of that Ordinance) there was found a kind of neceſſity for Chriſtians of ancient ſtanding, as it were to begin again. And yet ſome then, (as you now) was by no means to be prevailed with, but would (at leaſt) have the way of baptizing left to every mans liberty (as you would have the 4th principle) and now the Lord hath pleaded that cauſe, when no other endeavour could prevail, for thoſe that ſtumbled at that truth, are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wholly extinct in this Nation, whilſt thoſe that imbraced it are bleſſed with great encreaſe. And what ſhall befall you if to your diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you ſhall add pertinacity, a little time may determine.</p>
            <p>By that which hath been ſaid you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (Brethren) how the caſe ſtands betwen
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107514:72"/>
us, gladly would we have communion with you in all Chriſtian priviledges, but your will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful want (as of ſome may be feared <note n="*" place="margin">At leaſt ſome of of you.</note>) of one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſtian Religion, and therewithall your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to deprive our Churches of it (as is too evident to be denyed) puts a ſtop to that which is ſo much deſired, and how it ſhall be obtain'd is the buſineſs for time to determine, and O that the ſet time were come. Mean while we muſt leave <hi>the Searchers, and their ſearch; our ſelves,</hi> and our <hi>Sigh,</hi> to him that will cauſe <hi>all the Churches to know that it is he that ſearcheth the heart, and tryeth the Reins, and will give to every man according as his work ſhall be.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now that the chief Apoſtles have ſome to ſucceed them in the Apoſtleſhip, as we have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed will appear firſt from the conſideration of that Commiſſion which our Lord gave for the Teaching of the Nations, or for the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to every Creature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the duration of thoſe gifts in the Church which our Lord obtained and gave, by virtue of his Aſcention.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the conſideration of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches, their having ſuch Apoſtles or Meſſengers.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, from the practice of thoſe who moſt queſtion the neceſſity of Meſſengers at this day.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, from the ſtate of the World, their neceſſity to be taught the truth as it is in Jeſus. And in regard of the danger they lie under by means of falſe Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:107514:76"/>
And firſt it is evident from <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19, 20. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. that it is the will of God that the Nations be taught, and that every Creature ſhould have the Goſpel preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, wherefore it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that we ſtick to <note place="margin">If the Church have not a Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Meſſengers, then none are bound by virtue of Office to preach to the Nations.</note> one thing out of three, and that is, either ſome body in ſpecial are bound to preach the Goſpel to thoſe that are without; or elſe that all Chriſtians are equally bound to perform this work if capable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of gifts, or elſe that this work ended with the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>The laſt will not be ſaid by any that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that the making one branch of that Commiſſion, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16. void or not obliging or binding to the Church now, or any perſons in it, is in effect to make the whole commiſſion void, for if none have power by virtue of this Commiſſion to teach the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how can it be that any hath power from hence to baptize? both works being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as it were in one breath. Nor can the Church obſerve all things whatſoever Chriſt commanded his Apoſtles, if they be not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this great work to preach the Goſpel to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:107514:76"/>

            <p>Which is yet more evident by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thoſe gifts which our Lord obtained and gave to his Church by virtue of his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Eph. 4. 11. <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtours, and Teachers, for the perfecting the Saints for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the body of Chriſt. Till we all come into the unity of the Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>See</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 28. It were certainly a very dangerous thing to ſay that any of theſe gifts are taken away from the Church of God, albeit ſome of them are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps but rarely found, at leaſt in that part of the World which do profeſs the name of Chriſt; eſpecially Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which yet may not be ſaid to be wholly abſent from the Churches in theſe days, and in this Nation, of which I could ſay ſomething, partly from ſuch information as I know to be true, and partly from what I have heard and ſeen in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. But as touching the gift of Offices here repeated, why any of them ſhould be taken away from the Church, I ſee not any ground at all, they being ſo evidently fixed in the Church <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </hi> the whole Church be compleated; and the uſe of theſe Offices reſpectively, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have defined, ſo needful, that the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107514:77"/>
Church would eaſily find the want of them if indeed they be taken from her as we ſhall ſee more anon. And although we ſaid before that the gift of Miracles, Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Office of the chief Apoſtles, and yet was only temporary: and now ſay the gifts of Miracles may not be denyed to have a being or continuance in the Church. In this there is no contradiction; for, the making thoſe gifts temporary (or but for a time) as they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Office of thoſe which firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel, doth not at all conclude that they are wholly abnegated, or taken away from the Church. And when we ſay that theſe gifts were neceſſary to the Office of the chief Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſtles, our meaning not that Miracles was a part of their office, but only a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comicant thereto; ſo that though this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant ſhould not befound, it is no prejudice to the Office conſidered as we have defined it.</p>
            <p>We come now to enquire into the order of the Primitive Churches, who certainly had many Apoſtles beſide thoſe that were Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion layers and Maſter-builders, ſuch were <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia,</hi> Rom. 16. 7. who are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But evident it is, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not fixed in any particular Church, but was Pauls <hi>fellow-traveller</hi> among the Churches in divers Countreys, and frequently ſent by him to ſundry places, from the time that he was called by the Apoſtle to go forth with him, till <hi>Paul</hi> ſent for the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which was not long before he was taken priſoner, for all which ſee. <hi>Act.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2, 3, 4. and 17. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 18, 5 the 19. 22. the 2. 4. to 18.</p>
            <p>And though in a certain <hi>Poſt-ſcript</hi> added to 2 Tim. it is ſaid, that <hi>Timothy was ordained the firſt Biſhop of the Church at Epheſus,</hi> yet this cannot be true, ſeeing the Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> had <hi>Biſhops,</hi> Acts 20. 18. even whiles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> were companions in preaching the Goſpel in divers Countrys. Nor are the ancients poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in this matter, for I find <hi>Euſebius</hi> only ſaying that it is reported that <hi>Timothy</hi> was the firſt <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Creet;</hi> but he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107514:80"/>
affirms nothing in this matter. But that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> his care was for other Churches, as much as for that at <hi>Epheſus</hi> is evident <hi>Philip.</hi> 2, 19, 20. <hi>But I truſt in the Lord Jeſus to ſend</hi> Timotheus <hi>unto you—for I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your ſtate—But ye know the proof of him that as a Son with the Father he hath ſerved with me in the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>Titus</hi> the ſame conſideration may be had, ſeeing he was <hi>left in</hi> Creet <hi>to ſet in order the things which were wanting, and to ordain Elders in EVERY Church,</hi> plainly ſhewing that his power in the Affairs of the Goſpel, and, his care for the Churches was the ſame <hi>for every Church,</hi> that it was for <hi>any one;</hi> which is a far different charge from that which was given to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Acts 20. for they are not bid to look to all the Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> but only to the flock (in the ſingular number) over which <hi>the Holy Ghoſt had made them Epiſcopos, Overſeers or</hi> Biſhops, nor was <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> his care, for the Churches in <hi>Creet</hi> only; for <hi>Paul</hi> calls him his partner &amp; fellow helper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church at Corinth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any do enquire of</hi> Titus <hi>he is my partner, and fellow helper concerning you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the ſame import is that place, Gal. 1. 18, 19. <hi>I went up to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to ſee Peter—but other of the Apoſtles ſaw I none ſave</hi> James <hi>the Lords</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Ierom</hi> would ſometimes make theſe two one ſelf-ſame man, and yet otherwhiles doth call him <hi>Decimum tertium Apoſtolum,</hi> that is, the thirteenth Apoſtle, but that <hi>James</hi> the Lords brother was not one of the 12. is evident 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 5. to 8. where it is ſaid that <hi>our Lord apppeared firſt to</hi> Cephas, <hi>then to the</hi> 12. <hi>after that he was ſeen of</hi> James <hi>then of</hi> ALL <hi>the Apostles.</hi> Two things are hence to be noted. 1. That <hi>James</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from the 12. and ſo are thoſe perſons ſignified by ALL the Apoſtles; for it cannot be that by all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſhould be meant the chief Apoſtles, for they were mentioned before, and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf who was an Apoſtle of the ſame dignity, is mentioned afterwards, but by ALL the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, is moſt like to be meant the 70. Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whom our Lord ſent out as meſſengers to preach the Goſpel in every City whither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would go, and who no doubt became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Miniſters of the Goſpel after the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord, and with this <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth ſeem to agree; we ſee then, partly from evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Texts of Scripture, and partly from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional probabilities, that the Primitive
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107514:81"/>
Churches were endewed with a Miniſtry of many meſſengers or Apoſtles beſide thoſe who were the Foundation layers and Maſter-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church of Chriſt; And hence we infer that God hath ordained ſuch a miniſtery to continue in his Church till the body of our Lord be perfected.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>From the practice of thoſe brethren who moſt queſtion the being of meſſengers, as a miniſtery in the Church at this day. It will appear that ſuch an Office doth remai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, do they not frequently ſend out men to act Authoritatively both in preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to them that are without? in ſetting things in order in remote Congregations? to exerciſe Diſcipline by Excommunication of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders? and remitting the penitent? by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining them Elders, and diſpencing to them the holy Ordinances? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As theſe things cannot be denied, ſo we may juſtly enquire how it comes to paſs that they do thus? if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Church hath none to act in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Apoſtles, or meſſengers of the Goſpel, at leaſt as we have defined them, ſeeing it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved, (neither I think do our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren affirm) that Elders of the Churches have equal power in other Congregations, as in that which they are choſen to ſerve neither is it in the power of any Congregation to take the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107514:81"/>
Paſtour of any Church from them; neither may any Church impoſe their Paſtour upon another Church, wherefore unleſs there be a miniſtery remaining in the Church which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to all Congregations indifferently, we may perceive what confuſion is like to enſue. Moreover if thoſe who go to preach to the World cannot juſtiſie their calling, how ſhall they comfort themſelves in their undertaking, or anſwer oppoſers when queſtioned concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Commiſſion? eſpecially in ſuch places where the Scriptures are received ſith all that have read them may eaſily perceive, that as the Goſpel is to be preached, ſo thoſe which go forth as Miniſters thereof, muſt be ſent either by immediate miſſion from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (which our brethren pretend not to) or ſome mediate miſſion from the Church of God, which none can pretend to, that deny the Office of meſſengers ſith other Officers are not by vertue of their Office to go out into the World to teach the Nations, or to preach the Goſpel to every creature. If to that which we have ſaid it ſhould be replyed, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107514:82"/>
have their power <hi>(de jure)</hi> made either leſs or greater by the conſent or non-conſent of any perſon or perſons whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Again, It would be underſtood <hi>how long the power our brethren gives to men to act as Elders in thoſe Congregations doth remain?</hi> Whether they thenceforth ſtand equally engaged to Overſee thoſe Churches, as the Church that firſt call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to ſerve as Paſtors? And alſo <hi>how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeveral Congregations they may act in as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours by conſent?</hi> Whether two only, or ten only, or an hundred, and ſo <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if once they give particular Paſtours, power to act as Elders in more Congregations then they were at the time of their Ordination, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Overſee; they can never bound their power; and then what <hi>meſſenger</hi> of the Church did ever exceed them in that reſpect. And further, if our brethren can give their particular Paſtours power to act as Paſtours in many Churches <hi>for a month</hi> or <hi>half a year,</hi> then why not <hi>a year</hi> 2. or 3. and ſo for the term of life, the occaſions ſtill being the ſame? And how much comes this ſhort of the power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any meſſenger in the World at this day? Wherefore ſeeing that our brethren do exerciſe as great Authority in ſending men to preach to the World, and to ſettle their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as we do, it is ſtrange they ſhould diſlike
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107514:82"/>
our calling thoſe Offices by ſuch names as the Scripture gives them, rather then by ſuch names as are excluſive of that Authority, which is exerciſed either by thoſe who go out to preach the Goſpel to every creature, or thoſe that take the care of all the Churches. True it is, that <hi>Peter</hi> calls himſelf an <hi>Elder,</hi> and that he was <hi>Elder</hi> in one Church as well as in another, but this was becauſe he had an Office which was comprehenſive of all Offices in the Church, and hence it is that we find the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſometimes performing the Office of <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> when it might be done without lett to the preaching of the Word, but though it be true that the <note place="margin">Acts 6. 2. Gal. 2. 9, 10.</note> greater contains the leſs, yet the leſs doth not contain the greater; for it cannot be denied, that the Office of a <hi>particular Elder of a Congregation</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a charge to <hi>Teach all Nations,</hi> are things inconſiſtant to one and the ſame perſon.</p>
            <p>What may or ought to be done in preaching the Goſpel by perſons gifted in the Church, as a <hi>general priviledge or duty,</hi> it is not my buſineſs here to diſcourſe, but only to ſhew what it is <hi>which neceſſarily is to be done by vertue of thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which God hath ordained in his Church,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it were eaſie to ſhew that God hath not only provided <hi>a Liberty</hi> in his Church for

            <p>The world is the Lords Harveſt, into which he is pleaſed to ſend his Labourers, and the Church is commanded to pray that the Lord of the Harveſt would ſend forth painful Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers into his Harveſt, <hi>Luke.</hi> 10. 1, 2. It will not be denied that theſe labourers are at leaſt chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly) ſome that are in a miniſterial capacity to preach the Goſpel. And they cannot ſo well be underſtood of any particular function in the miniſtery, as that of meſſengers, partly for that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107514:83"/>
the other Officers in the miniſtry are bound to particular congregations as we have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and partly for that our Saviour gives this direction to the Church, upon the occaſion of his ſending forth meſſengers to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. If then it be the duty of the Church at this day, to pray to the Lord that he would ſend forth painful Labourers to preach to the world (as ſure none can deny that) there is not any room left to doubt of the continuance of ſuch an Office, as that of meſſengers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for that very clauſe touching their being ſent forth, and that as Lambs in the midſt of Wolves, doth ſufficiently inſtruct us what Labourers theſe are. A neceſſity therefore lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the Church of God to diſpoſe of her Members to that needful work, as the Lord vouchſafes to fit them for; leaſt otherwiſe ſhe be like thoſe who make many prayers for that which they never intend to do.</p>
            <p>It is certain the Church hath no power to cauſe the world to come to her Aſſemblies, nor is it like that the world will ſend to the Church of God for inſtruction. It remaineth therefore, ſeeing the Goſpel is for the illumination of all, that as Gad hath wont to ſend forth his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to beſeech the world in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled to God even ſo, one fruit of the Aſcenſion of our Lord (at this day) is a

gift even for the Rebellious, that the Lord God might dwel among them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68 18. which being compared with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. may very well be interpreted of a gifted miniſtery to turn Rebellious ſinners from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. To which agrees that place, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8. where our Lord doth aſſure his Diſciples, that when he ſhould ſend the Holy Ghoſt, he ſhould convince the world of ſin, of Righteouſneſs and judgment, and this (no doubt) as he ſhould operate or work upon men by the miniſtery of the word, which promiſe either ended with that age (which is abſurd to think) or elſe if it remain to theſe days, then it ſuppoſes a miniſtery to hold forth to the world the everlaſting Goſpel for the obedience of faith, I mean ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry as are bound even by virtue of their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as debtors to the wiſe and unwiſe, to preach the Goſpel to thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And here let it be noted that the preacher (or preachers) of the everlaſting Goſpel, hath not a Goſpel to confirm with Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but a Goſpel to preach to every Nation, Kindred, Tongue, and People, even the ſame <hi>that was preached by our Lord, and confirmed to us by them that heard him.</hi>

            <p>When we ſay the meſſengers of the Goſpel are <hi>unfixed miniſters.</hi> Our meaning is not thereby to deny, but that for the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient mannagement of the great Affairs of the Goſpel, they may divide themſelves into divers parts, and ſo may be called the <hi>meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of ſuch Countreys, as with whom they moſt frequently converſe of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 2. 9. <hi>when</hi> James, Cephas, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>perceived the grace which was given to me and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>they gave unto me and</hi> Barnabas <hi>the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip that we ſhould go to the Heathen, and they to the Circumciſion.</hi> In <hi>Aſia</hi> we read of <hi>ſeven</hi>

               <hi>Churches</hi> which are particularly nam'd, for in the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> (which is <hi>the firſt</hi> of the ſeven) we find divers <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> before <hi>John</hi> wrote from <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is true, the <hi>Ancients</hi> call theſe ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or meſſengers, <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>chief Miniſters.</hi> But then we know by <hi>Biſhops</hi> they commonly mean ſuch as had the charge of many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregations. Thus they make <hi>Timothy</hi> a Biſhop, yet confeſs him to be a preacher of the Goſpel from <hi>Epheſus</hi> unto <hi>Illiricum,</hi> and throughout <hi>Hellas</hi> in <hi>Achaia. Titus</hi> they make Biſhop of <hi>Creet,</hi> yet ſuch an one as preached the Goſpel in all that Country. They alſo make <hi>Silvanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſsalonica,</hi> but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as we have ſeen calls him an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as well as the reſt. Now whether it be more ſafe to call thoſe travelling Miniſters of Chriſt <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> after the manner of men; or <hi>Apſtoles,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is the buſineſs for the ſober and unprejudiced Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
