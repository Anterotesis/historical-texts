         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How didſt thou, poor Lamb, eſcape theſe Wolves, theſe boody murtherous Prieſts and people. Thy brother <hi>Amos,</hi> the Prophet, was accuſed by one of theſe murtherous Prieſts for a conſpirer againſt the King in the midſt of the Houſe of <hi>Iſraol,</hi> and that the Land was not able to bear his words, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 10, &amp;c.

And therefore we having ſuch a Cloud of Witneſſes and fellow-ſufferers for the truths ſake going before us, we may be comforted and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in all our tribulations knowing that we are hereunto called, not only to believe, but alſo to ſuffer for Chriſt

            <p>Further, oh all people! you may hence obſerve and take diligent notice for your good, that it hath been an old cuſtome of the worlds Teachers, ſuch as are called of men Maſter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. and who preach for hire, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. and ſeek their gain from their quarter, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. I ſay, that it hath been an old cuſtom of ſuch Wolves to murther ſouls and people of God; for in ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is mention made of the ſpiritual, and in others of the bodily murther that they had and would be guilty of. And further take notice, that theſe banding Prieſts are a lewd generation, which in other expreſſions is all one as to ſay, Thieves, Whores, &amp; Harlots; and ſo indeed are they alſo in Scripture uſually ſaid to be, and therefore typed and ſet forth under the name of painted whoriſh <hi>Jezza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> and the wel-favoured Harlot, and here under the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Troops of Robbers waiting for a man; and <hi>Paul</hi> calls them <hi>Miniſters of Satan, having a form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, denying and reſiſting the power and truth of godlineſſe:</hi> And therefore (oh all people!) you are exhorted by the ſpirit of truth to turn away from them, yea, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to come out from amongſt them upon pain of <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death, Jer</hi> 23. throughout. <hi>Rev</hi> 14. 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. throughout. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 12, 15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5, <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>Read Scripture, and ſee if theſe things be not ſo, and fear the living God, and bow to truth, and be exhorted and perſwaded all people now at length to learn wiſdom, and to underſtand whom you follow; for you ſee the Scripture tells of murtherous lewd Prieſts that ſtood over the people for Teachers in former days; and in Chriſts time there was <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> hypocrites, who were taken by the blind people to be ſufficient guides and Teachers, whom Chriſt called <hi>blind guides, children of the <note place="margin">

devil, painted Sepulchres, whited Walls,</hi> yea <hi>Vipers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</hi> And ſo you people that gather together to the <hi>Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Houſe,</hi> which you call your Church, when you hear your Teachers, who now-a-daies go under the name of Miniſters with you, take a Scripture, and out of it chuſe a verſe (or ſo) of a chapter, according to their wills, for filthy lucre, and calls it their Text, and from it draws Doctrines, and Reaſons, and Uſes, as they call them, ask them whether there be any ſuch company of falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers now-a-daies in <hi>England</hi> to be found, as this Scripture ſpeaks of, who <hi>as troops of Robbers wait for a man, ſo wait to murther in the way by conſent;</hi> and who they are, and what, and who they murther; and with what they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and how theſe murtherers may be knovvn; vvhat be their fruits, <hi>for by their fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And ask them further, Whether theſe falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers vvhich the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> here calls lewd murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be not the ſame in nature with thoſe vvhich <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the 56. chap. and 10. v. of his Propheſie, calls greedy dumb dogs, that ſought their gain from their quarter, and could never have enough: and the ſame that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpoke of in ch. 5. ver. 1, 2. &amp; 23. ch. of his Propheſie, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <hi>That ſtole the word from their neighbor, and uſed their tongues, and ſaid, he ſaith, when the Lord never ſent them, and ſo could not profit the people at all.</hi> And vvhether they be not the ſame that <hi>Micah</hi> the Prophet <hi>(Mic. ch.</hi> 3. 5, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> ſpeaks of, who <hi>preached for hire, and divined for money, and spake peace to the wicked for the gift ſake, but if any put not into their mouths, they prepared war against them,</hi> and yet like all hypocrites vvould lean upon the Lord in vvords, &amp; ſay, <hi>Is not the Lord amongſt us? no evil ſhall come unto us.</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe murtherous Prieſts vvere not one with thoſe that Chriſt Jeſus cried vvo againſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>who were ſayers, and not doers; who loved to be called of men Maſter, and bound heavy burthens upon the people, and touched them not with one of their own fingers, but ſhut up the kingdom of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118936:4"/>
heaven againſt men, and would neither enter in themſelves, nor ſuffer others.</hi> And finally, ask them whether ſuch men now as ſtand over the people for Teachers, though under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name, and making another profeſſion in words, yet if they be found in the foreſaid ſteps, doing the foreſaid deeds of thoſe forementioned falſe Teachers, are not to receive the ſame judgement, and to be cried againſt and denied, and forſaken by all the children of light now, as formerly, yea or nay.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Hoſea,</hi> thou holy Prophet of God, thou haſt ſaid and laid down theſe two Doctrines or high Charges againſt the people in general, and againſt the Prieſts in particular: The firſt, <hi>That the people in general are pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with blood.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>That as Troops of Robbers wait for a man, ſo the company of Prieſts murther in the way by conſent:</hi> How doſt thou prove and make theſe good, for the <hi>Gileadites</hi> are deeply concerned in it; and they will have thee to make it good, or ſuffer for default? Yea, by the ſpirit I make it good, thus: <hi>Gilead is a (ity polluted with blood, becauſe they are ſuch as work iniquity; and the Prieſts murther in the way by conſent, becauſe they commit Iewdneſſe:</hi> And this is witneſſed not only by the Scriptures, but alſo by the ſame ſpirit of truth that gave it forth in all the children of light to be ſo. But <hi>Hoſea,</hi> thou muſt not be tried <hi>per pares,</hi> that is, them of like condition or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with thee, to wit, the holy Prophets and children of God, who are Witneſſes with thee againſt the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their times, and ſins that rules in Prieſts and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for that will not ſatisfie nor ſerve the <hi>Gileadites</hi> turn, for ſo the great men of all ſorts in City and Countrey would be found faulty: But theſe Prieſts and people think it fit (according to their Nation-Law) to have a Judge, and Juſtices fit upon the Bench, and to have a Jury of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſummoned and to have a Bill of Indictment found againſt thee, and then if thou plead thy innocency, and ſay thou art not guilty of doing them any wrong, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118936:5"/>

May not ſhame cover you all, to commit men to priſon for the exerciſe of pure conſcience towards God, becauſe they cannot ſwear, or reſpect mens perſons, or maintain Idol-ſhepherds, and Idol-temples and worſhips, which is abomination to the Lord; and for taking peaceable men out of peaceable meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and out of their travel on the High-wayes, and firſt whipping them, and ſending them to priſon, the example of this which you have done, never went before in any age, and

And this perſecution novv in England ariſeth mainly from the blind zeal that many have for keeping up their Miniſters as they call them, from being ſpoken unto in the Aſſembly, either in, after, or before the time of their preaching, eſpecially on the firſt day of the vveek, by them called the Lords day, and Sabbath day, and this the people are prompted unto by the wicked ſpirit in their Teachers, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure the light that God hath raiſed up in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in theſe Iſlands in theſe dayes: and ſo this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of all ſuch children of darkneſs, whether Prieſt or People, that light ſhines, and they love darkneſs more then light becauſe their deeds are evil.
