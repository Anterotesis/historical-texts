            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Heere is no matter of state, diuinity, nor Phisicke, but, and so foorth, such stuffe, as will giue you occasion perhaps, when you haue worne it out, to commende it to your friends: tis no outlandish, but made at home, and nere the worse, for I know no reason to barre any man of his wits, that can tell kindely how to vse them: There are so many excellent writers in high Poetry, and strange plots, that poore men, who would do well, are afraide of euery Scholler, for feare of a scoffe, and of him that hath no learning, for lacke of wit. But at aduenture, this is done: how well, I knowe not, but you that Reade, may iudge as you list, there are changes in it enough to make a Play: but the foole in the midst may marre all: whose part, let it be put vpon my selfe, for too much prattle, I care not, if I here take an order with my pen to make an end of an idle Epistle.</p>

            <head>The Worldes Folly.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ithin the compasse of the world ther is an island, whose name I haue not reade, and therefore I care not if I leaue it out: now, in this I slande, were diuers Townes, and Citties, among which, there was one greater then all the rest, the name whereof, was written vpon one of the Gates, but the letters were so worne out that I could make no English of them: and therefore, least I should do wrong to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, to set it downe by a false name, I will say no more of it but that it was a faire cittie, and so leaue it. Now in this cittie, were many faire houses: but among all, one, of that bignes, that the Lord of the Towne had bene able to k√©epe his Christmas in it, it was full of windows, for a man might looke through it: and all the smoake of the house went out in one Chimney.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11685:5"/>
There were to this house, thr√©e Gates; and all in a forefront, which shewed that it had the foundation of some Caitle: but by decaie, was brought to be an Almes-house. Now in this Towne were many sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie sorts of people of all ages; as Old, and young, and middle age: men, women, and children: which did eate, and drinke, and make a noyse, and die: but such as liued, had there, their sundry lodgings, that they might quickly be founde out, when there was occasion of their imploymeut. The house was large, and the Gouernor a great Man: I doe not meane in fat, (and yet he was well lined in the Pursse:) but he hadde a great commaund, especially of those about him: which because they were of small wealth, there is little to be saide of them: onely they were Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that serued the time, followed Shaddowes, fitted humours, hoped of Fortune, and found, what? I cannot tell you.</p>
            <p>But at the entrance into the first base Court, wher walking of Horses was the chiefest exercise of Idle people: ouer the Gate, I sawe written <hi>(Madde Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes)</hi> Now, asking the meaning thereof of an olde Man (who was the Porter) who had written vppon his breast, <hi>The Kalender of Experience,</hi> he tolde me, this house was called the <hi>Fort of POLLY,</hi> where such as sold Lande and followed <hi>Fortune,</hi> to teache them Patience after poasting, were put to walking of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: Where great spirits, stouping to little bodyes, made miserie a meane to happinesse: Where in the Crosse of Patience, companie gaue much comfort: yea but (quoth I) Doe all walke Horses? and haue
<pb facs="tcp:11685:5"/>
they no other intertainment? yes (quoth the Olde man) within the house, are many, put to more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing seruices: As, they that haue spent their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony vppon Wantonnesse, are made <hi>Pandars</hi> to wickednesse He that lost his wealth at play, muste hold the Candle to Gamsters: and he that melted it in banquetting, must waite on a Churles Trencher: and he that spent it in the Warres, must learne to pray for Peace.</p>
            <p>Alasse (quod I) I haue beene a yonger Brother, and glad I would be to see fashions, but if here be no better intertainement, I haue no hart to goe in any further. Oh sir, quoth he, Content your selfe, you may doe better then you are aware of: For, if you haue any extraordinary qualitie, here you may make a gaine of it: If you can make a Ditty to a tune, you may fill your belly for your witte: If you can mende a decayed complexion, you shall be paide for your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: If you can deuise a new fashion, there are that will be for your humor: if you can tell a strange tale, you shall be thought wise: if you can swthe a lie, you will growe plausible: if you can mannage the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Foole, you may haue sauour in faire Eies: if you can cheate at play, you may thriue by trickes: if you haue any languages, you may do good vppon strangers. And if you haue the strength of the backe, you shall not want necessaries of the Bellie: But whatsoeuer you doe, beware of conscience for she is in little credite: Alas quoth I then, what should I do h√©ere? For I had rather die, then liue dishonestly: Honesty (quoth hee) whatsoeuer you thinke of it,
<pb facs="tcp:11685:6"/>
speake not a word of it. For in the course of <hi>Folly,</hi> a faithfull seruant is a good Asse: a kinde friend, is a sw√©et foole: A liberal hart is a feare of Beggery: and a charitable man is a pittifull creature. And yet, howsoeuer they come h√©ere, I knowe not, but our house is full of them, and therefore if you be as you say, so scrupulous of <hi>Conscience,</hi> or so carefull of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,</hi> you were beste make one amonge a number h√©ere, then loose your selfe in a wildernes with want of companie. For h√©ere, you may be <hi>Beauties</hi> Foole, <hi>Wealthes</hi> slaue, or <hi>Wittes</hi> asse, or <hi>Prides</hi> vassall, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> shaddowe, or <hi>Powers</hi> subiect: you may be a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster among fooles, a Iuggler among <hi>Gypsies,</hi> a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-teller among fayre hands, or a flattrer among fine Eares: and perhappes, if you can be wise, bee nere the worse for weldooing.</p>
            <p>For tis no shame to honestie, to furnish necessitie, so that the lawe doe not touch you, for I haue lyued long, and neuer saw a tempred spirit out of Tune: and if you will be ruled by your friendes, you maye doe well. The Mistresse of this house hath no meane power in the world: for in the Warre, she hath her <hi>Mutiners:</hi> in the Schooles, her Truantes: in the Court, her Prodigals: in the Cittie, her Minions: in the countrie, her Lols: and at Sea, her Pyrates: and at Lande, her out-lookers. And let me tell you, that once a y√©ere, (howe often more, I knowe not) they all do her homage. The Cuckold hangs downe his head: the thiefe hideth his face: the Prodigall fetcheth a d√©epe sighe: and the Louer with infolded armes, and (perhappes) a w√©eping Eye, singes a
<pb facs="tcp:11685:6"/>
Ballad of his Brainsicknes, to the tune of <hi>O man in desperation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore thinke not much, among so many of such reputation, to haue a place of Entertainment: Which, if you like not, and can mend your selfe, tell me your minde, and I will helpe you in what I can: but, this I say, she is a kinde woman, and will giue you countenaunce whensoeuer you come: for shee loues Straungers exc√©edinglye, and entertaineth them most kindely. Alas (quoth I) these wordes of yours are straunge, I knowe not when to make of them: I am not for hir hand, except she haue n√©ede of me in some better seruice, then I yet h√©ere of.</p>
            <p>Why (quoth he) let me tell you, it were straunge, that you should spend your wits, with your wealth, if the worste fall, let me tell you, if you can f√©ede an <hi>Owle,</hi> teach an <hi>Ape,</hi> or catch a Spaniell, I will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you pleas`d for your paine. No (quoth I) ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of ydlenesse, are but losse of time, and therefore trouble not your selfe, I had rather neuer serue, then be at such commaunde: But, since <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> hath brought me hither, I pray you do for me, what you can, that I may not so far loose my hopes, that I pay two d√©ere for my Repentaunce. I will (quoth he) come on thy wayes: so in he brought mee to his great Ladie: who in a great brauerie, vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her selfe, asked me who I was? I aunswered, a <hi>Cipher</hi> among figures: well said, (qd she) more wit in the words then in the matter: now, whence come you? From idlenesse, (quoth I) well, (saide shee) that is the righte waie to Ignoraunce: <hi>Eperience,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11685:7"/>
take this fellow, to thee, and let him reade the rules of Patience, which done, let him know his place.</p>
            <p>So taking leaue of his Lady, he led me into a large Roome, paued with rough flint stone in the midst whereof, was a kinde of standing water, that (when it was sticced) gaue a kinde of sent, that would haue kilde a horse: Alasse (quoth I) Father, what shall I doe h√©ere? Why (quoth he) you must know, they that haue spent their wealth in perfumes, sweete waters, and delicate Odors, must first, h√©ere haue patience with a little vnpleasing sauour, for he that comes into such a great house, as your <hi>Forte of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:</hi> must not looke for all places, after the finest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion?</p>
            <p>For he that cannot away with Sir Reuerence, must not come at Patience: but after you are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vsed to it, you will easily away with it: Oh, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> is a vertue, though it waite vpon many vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines: but you must away with many viscontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, before you can be acquainted with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes of this house, or haue fauour with our Mistresse.

            </p>
            <p>So, knocking at one dwre, comes me out a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some man, but poorely apparrelled, pale faced, thin hayzed, and lowe voiced: who, (with a soft sp√©ech, as in a feare to wake some sl√©eping Children) badde vs welcome, whome the olde man thus saluted:
<pb facs="tcp:11685:7"/>
Scholler, I haue this morning, met with a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whome I haue preferred to my Lady mistresse: who hath giuen me in charge, to instructe him in all thinges fit for him in her Seruice: nowe, knowing your perfection in the first point of the Principalles of this Purgatorie, I will leaue him for this day to your entertainment: He is Welcome (quoth he) so, (leauing me till the next morning,) he went his may, and I (in a pittifull taking,) was brought by this <hi>Anathomie</hi> of flesh, into the discomefort of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where oppenning a little dwre, and that lowe, where we must stoope ere we got in, there did I s√©e (with much adoe) through a huge Sea-cole smoake, by a little light, that came through a hole, in the top of the house, a Roome filled with people of diuers hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, aswell olde as young, (but the pittifullest of Creatures, that the Earth carried aliue:) all sitting vpon the bare ground: some sighing; other groaning, some w√©eping, other wringing their hands: and not one, but in one Agonie, or other.</p>
            <p>Now, what with feare, and what with Sorrow, in a kinde of maze to beholde this mappe of mtserie, this poore wretch appointed for my Reader in the Rules of Patience, while I expected some booke or other, that he should fall to lay open to such purpose: he brought me to them all, one after another, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me to note them seuerally, to giue eare to their sp√©eches, and to take notes of them for my better me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</p>
            <p>So sitting downe with him (as it were) in the midst of them, without any regard, either of me or
<pb facs="tcp:11685:8"/>
themselues, while melancholy so domineired in all, that there was not a good humour among them: they thus began their blacke <hi>Sauntis.</hi> One, who (it shoulde s√©ente), had b√©ene a trauailer, and nowe retyred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, from a worlde of Countries, fell thus to talke to himselfe. O Heauens, what a Hell is this? Tyre the bodie, spende the spirite, emptie the purse, weary friendes, waste the wittes deserue well, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire little, and haue nothing: What comforte on the earth, but death? Fortune is such an enimie to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the rowling stone gathers no mosse, the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of varietie settes the wittes a wooll-gathering, where the Sh√©epe are woorse then woolues, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile toylesome, victuall chargeable, apparrell cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, companie iealous, the sea daungerous, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vicious.</p>
            <p>These passages who hath paste, and is come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ende of his pilgrimage, let him sing with me in this purgatorie: <hi>Oh the winde, the weather, and the raine.</hi> When shaking of his heade, with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie hearte, hee putte his tounge to silence: when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing learned by his trauaile, (hauing little money in his purse,) to fare harde, hee fell to breake his fast nowe aboute dinner time, with the pill of an orange, a rawe roote, and a little salte: which with a harde cruste of drye biskette, and a cruze of colde water, hee made his patient repast: when, calling m√©e to him. Sir (quoth h√©e) if it please you, that you will take parte with a poore manne, wellcome shall bee your best cheare. A trauailers Table is soone couered: I haue beene verie well acquainted
<pb facs="tcp:11685:8"/>
with kick-shoses, but now I haue learned to satisfie Nature with a little.</p>
            <p>Alasse, thought I, to take a bone from a Dogge, I should starue the dumbe beast, and rather had I fast, then fall to such hungrie fare. So, hauing manie more to looke ouer, the next was a man of Middle age, who had binne a man of some wealth: but, with entering into suretie, and taking vp Creditte, and giuing interest, fell so farre to decay, by leauing his Trade to his Seruantes charge, and followinge the course of his owne Pleasures, satte there with a n√©edle and a thr√©ed, mending of Byr√©eches, Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coates, and Stockinges: In which, being so practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as got him now and then a little woorke, he had standing by him, for meat and drinke, a pot of strong Ale, which was often at his his nose, that it kept his face in so good a coulour, and his braine in so kinde a heate, as forgetting part of his forepassed Pride, in the good humour of grieuing Patience, made him with a hemming sigh, ilfauourdly singe the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad of <hi>Whilom I was, To the tune of Tom Tinker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This poore soule I pittied, but finding little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in him, I went to the next: who being an olde man with a siluer head, and a snowy bearde, hollow ch√©eked. Iawe-fallen, and bleare eyed, shaking with the Palsie, and tormented with the Stone, not so Rich, as to haue the Gout, hauing beene a man of some possessions, and with too fat feeding of Horses, too high k√©eping of Haukes, and too much delighting in banquetinges, through lacke of husbandrie, was forced to leaue himselfe without Lande, and hauing
<pb facs="tcp:11685:9"/>
no more mony left, then in soiourning with <hi>Patience,</hi> might pay for his bourde in this purgatorie, hauing in a little Boxe, an Electuarie, which, with a little spirite of the iuice of Grape, kepte lyfe and soule to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; this poore man, talking to himselfe, of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefulnesse of the proude; the vnkindenesse of the rich, the hatefulnes of the wicked, the wo of the wan ton, and the miserie of the poore, the wilfulnesse of youth, and the wretchednesse of age: after many a d√©epe sighe, with a hollowe voice, in a solemne tune, with a heauie hearte, fell to sing the song of <hi>Oken Leaues began to wither:</hi> to the tune of <hi>Heauilie, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which poore soule had no sooner ended, but for his best ease, falling fast asl√©epe, to his good slumber I left him.</p>
            <p>When nexte to him, sat a dapper fellowe with a smarte countenance: one, who (it s√©emed) in his youth had b√©ene experte in the <hi>Passe a Measure:</hi> but, for want of a good eare to k√©epe time, made no lasting commoditie of his idle qualitie. Nowe this fellows (as it s√©emed) had spent a greate deale more then his getting, vpon the gay furnishing of an euill fauoured carkasse, which growing out of square with good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, and with some great cold after a heat, in some extraordinarie labour, hauing gotten the crampe of the iointes, sat with a combe in his hande, dressing of haire to send to the Perriewigge-makers, which being a verie poore occupacion, gotte him little, but nowe and than, a little broken meate after the hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlde had dined: who after hee had spit on his fingers
<pb facs="tcp:11685:9"/>
and wiped them on his patched br√©eches after dinner, in steade of grace; fell to sing the ballad of the blinde Beggar, to the tune of <hi>Heigh ho.</hi> Nowe, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no great pleasure in this <hi>Pawne</hi> at <hi>Chesse;</hi> I took note of the nexte: who was a young man, faire of face, flaxen head, fine hand, and foote, streight body, good legge, and a reasonable good countenance; but with all this, twas pitty he was a foole; for as I found after ward by him, hee had b√©en a possessor of some small portion: which, through lacke of a good forewit, brought him into this purgatorie of <hi>Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For allas poore man, he had been so far in loue, that hee was almost out of his wits, ere his wealth was halfe gon; and being brought to a bare point, hauing no further credit with beautie, then cost, not able to mantaine the course, was sains to giue it ouer in the plaine field: where so far forlorne of all comfort, that he knewe not where to bestowe his litle talent that hee had lost, fell by chaunce vpon this forte, where, hee nowe sat making of ballads; where with a crust of breade out of his pocket, eating, and singing, hee howled out the dittle of <hi>When I was faire and young:</hi> to the tune of <hi>Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to heare how he cursed the vvenches that had (as he said) missused him vvith faire looks, kind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and such tricks; oh fie vppon them, a man is vvorse then mad that hath to dooe vvith any of them; and then, hovv he vvould curse himselfe, for selling of his lande, spending of his money, and loosing of his time, if a man in that place could haue laughte, it vvould haue put him to his passion.
<pb facs="tcp:11685:10"/>
But there let him sing, and they that liste buye his Ballads.</p>
            <p>Now from him, I tooke note of the next, which was of the feminine Gender, one that was once a virgin had b√©ene a little while a Mayde, knew the name of a wife, fell to be a Widdow, and laste of all, eyther through desire of change, or mislike of choice, or the instinct of Nature, or the corruption of the spirite, or want, or pride, I know not, but for want of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trade, after she had giuen ouer her shop, betooke her to her Chamber: and there, not able to maintain house-k√©eping with Idlenesse, fell to occupye suche wares as were most gainfull: Where, hauing stufs of all coulours, she so pleased her chapmen, that for a while she had good resort: but many of them falling to decaie, her ware growne old, and her stuffes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, she that had b√©en a whore in her youth, and a Bawde in her olde age, was now become an Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, and liued vpon a poore pittance, when after many a d√©ep sigh, and bitter teare or two, she would sing the <hi>Lamentation of a Sinner,</hi> To the tune of <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladaye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all these, I sawe a yong woman, of reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beauty, indifferent good countenance, and of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not much amisse, who being in all her life none of the richest, nor for her wit, none of the wisest: yet for that, she had a conceit beyond all good vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that because a Knaue for a fit of Fie-for-shame or a companion, for gaine of a little coyne, woulde perswade her, that she was wonderfullie Faire, and exc√©eding wise, she, out of the great lacke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb facs="tcp:11685:10"/>
in her little discretion, thinking, that if sh√©e, out of the Common of two, shoulde be of a better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clension then a simple Creature, perswading hirselfe that casting a Sh√©epes eye at a Rams-head, the Hornes shoulde not be s√©ene, till the Ewe mighte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch the Lambe, by the pride of a few pence, often frequenting the Market, and m√©eting her Willers at the Tauerne, it fell out, that after an ydle and loos life, by breach of promise of one expence vppon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ill dealing of all, hauing lost all fauor with her friends, loue of her Kinne, and the greatest part of her Portion, hauing now nothing left, but a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked face, and a worse bodie, a gowtie legge, and a splay soote, fit for nothing, but a base exercise, sh√©e was nowe with a little coyne, in a leather pursse, a sowle kerchiefe, a course Petticote, and a clowted shoo, become a Laundresse to the house: where with her handes vppe to the Elbowes in a washing-boul, rubbing vppe a baby-clowt, stood singing the Ballet, of <hi>All a greene Willowe,</hi> to the famous Tune of <hi>Ding, dong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there were diuers others in exc√©eding badde takings: as Lustie, Gallant youthes, that had spent and made hauocke of their Patrimonies, in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon vaine hopes, and loosing their times, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming vpon Fortune, growing (euen as it were) madde for lacke of money, here in this place were let to diuers Exercises, of whome the number was to be accounted verie great, and therefore I care not if I skippe them over: But yet amongst them al, there was one, that I tooke a speciall regarde vnto: a man
<pb facs="tcp:11685:11"/>
of a good personage, a faire complexion, a quicke wit, and a gratious spirit, who either for punishment of his siunes, or for triall of his patience, had bene mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a most vilde woman: who, as she was neither faire, nor greatly well fauoured, yet, was she most exc√©edingly foolish, and intollerably frowarde: one, whome nothinge contented, but money, which she knew not well how to vse, when she had it, and yet, with this piece of vngratious creature, had this poore man tugged out twelue y√©eres of his life, when, b√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so continually wearied out with vnquietnesse, that he knewe not where to bestowe himselfe, after long losse of time, expence of much money, and many a heactes griefe, thinking no Purgatorie so full of paine, as the passion of her frowardnes, satte there, reading of the vertue of Patience, when with his Eies full of teares, and hart-broken sighes he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out the Ballad of the Breeches, to the tune of <hi>Neuer more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this man (after his song,) I had some talke withall, who told me, that of all the Torments of the world ther is none so intollerable, as the vnquietnes of a frowarde wife. Oh shee is like Thunder in his Eares, like lightning in his eyes, like a Beare in his bed, and a dog at his Table, so that if there may be a Deuill in a humane shape, he will shevv himselfe in her picture: Oh quoth he) I pray thee trouble mee not with speakinge of her, I haue griefe inough to think of her, for she was the plague of my youth, and is now, the miserie of mine age, for, in respect of her Pestilent tongue, this very Purgatorie, is a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise:
<pb facs="tcp:11685:11"/>
sh√©e hath b√©ene the losse of my credite, the crosse of my Fortune, the hurt of my witte, and the onely vexation of my spicite: but peace (quoth hee) noe more wordes; for nowe shee beginnes to awake, you shall s√©e a proofe of my sp√©eche: when stretching out a mouth, as wide as halfe a worlde, after a sl√©epye yawne or two, scarce well out of her dead slumber, (persmading her selfe, that she hadde heard som part of her description) out she breakes into her Naturall fittes: With yea, I heare you well enough, a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of all such Husbandes.</p>
            <p>Good wife, saide he, know where you are, haue patience: Good Asse (sayde shee) Wherefore?

            <p>A Purgatorie ind√©ede, saide sh√©e, to be yoaked and matcht with a Slaue, as is by no meanes able to maintaine me, as well as others doe their Wiues: If thou canst not liue, heere is a knife to cutte thy throte, goe to the Sea and drowne thy selfe, or else vnto the Gallowes and hange thy selfe, I promyse thee I care not for th√©e: If I were well ridde of thee, I would haue thy betters, I haue no Trade to gette my liuing, and therefore doe as thou wilt or canst, I care not: Naye then (saide she) if that so be you doe

               </gap>ging mouth she fell to reading, till shee was fast a sleep: where, he (not willing to wake hit) rose quietly away from her, and with me stealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the company, brought mee out of that Roome into another Roome, more lightsome and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and yet, very pittifull to beholde, when the miseries there, were well considered: for, one that had bene in loue, sat looking on his Mistresse Picture, making such a legge to it, writing such verses in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to it, and committing such Idolatrie with it, that poore man, I pittied him: and in his behalfe, sorrowed to s√©e how the Foole did handle him: but there sat he, hanging the head, lifting vp the Eyes, and with a d√©epe sigh, singing the Ballad of, <hi>Come liue with me, and be my loue: To the tune of adew my Deere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to him, sat a young woman, that was verie faire, and indifferent wise, of a right good stocke, and reasonably honest: but, for want of a good purse, she had lost her louer, and being grown into some y√©ers, hauing no excellent good qualitie, was there set with a pan of Coales, a starch-pot, and a setting-sticke, which being now the Trade of Attendance, to hope of the preferment of mariage, to some fellow of more
<pb facs="tcp:11685:12"/>
wealth, then vnderstanding in the world, there sat with her poting sticke, stiffening of a fall: and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ballet of Fortune hath stolne away my loue to the tune of <hi>Greene Sleeues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which song leauing her, I cast mine eies vpon a pittifull creature, which, in the shape of a woman, made a pittifull sight: for, being both in proportion, countenance, and qualitie, an obiect woorthe the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on: yet no sooner began she to vtter her passion, in the method of lamentation, but, she did so turne my hart in my belly, that if in hope of her better reco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerie, it had not turn`d backe: a thousande to one, but my kindnes had cost me more then I should haue gotten by it: for, to tell you some part of her sp√©eche, (though it were neuer in the <hi>Grammar</hi>) yet, being in the Rules of the <hi>Accidents,</hi> for the better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Reader, I will set it downe as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it. Oh Lord (quoth she) what plague can be greater to a woman, then to be married to a <hi>Muskle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat,</hi> which neuer goes further then a cricke, to fish for a Frog, with a Goose-net: was euer any woman in the worlde brought into such a hell? Oh let me thinke vpon my dingle dangle: in my bed, a log, at my table a Hog, in discourse, a Baby, in iudgement, an asse, and for all Imperfections, the substance of worse then nothing, And yet, I must, and haue, (but, will no more,) done reuerence to this monster, and bene a seruant to this slaue, and all, for a little money: but I haue done, I will h√©ere rather pine to death, in this Purgatory of Patience, then passe one day longer, in the Laborinth of sorrow, to liue with
<pb facs="tcp:11685:13"/>
such a none-such, a fool? Why, I had rather be a beg gar with true wit, then a Lady without true honor: but, since Patience is a medcine for all Malladies, if he continue the coxcombe a little longer, I will fit him a pennyworth to the purpose: and in the meane time, till I s√©e him (which I hope neuer to doe:) let me sing my new Ballet, of the fine foole, to the tune of <hi>Tarlton:</hi> wherwith pulling a paper out of her poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, wherein was written both the dittye and the note, she beganne like a <hi>Nightingall,</hi> to singe with a voice, that if I had not knowne her to haue bene a Woman, I shoulde haue thought her some better creature: but there let me leaue her in her dumps of <hi>Wella-day,</hi> and tell you further on, of my passage; taking a little viewe of all these obiects, nothing what I thought most n√©edefull, I tooke the company of my friend, and came into an other Roome, greater then that before: where I saw diuers, sitting at a rounde table: and (as it were) at dinner: for euery one, had his Trencher furnished.</p>
            <p>One, hee fedde on Flies, and B√©es, which so stunge his tongue and bit him by the lippe, that hee was forc`st to giue vppe houshold, and leaue all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitalitie, and studie onely to please the Lady of the Castle: but, while he was in studie, he fed still vpon flies, that, (had not his throat bene the wider) hee had bene choaked with a flie, inst√©ede of some better fare: but loathe to leaue him, without some further knowledge of him: I vnderstood, that, he had bene a man of some vnderstanding, but, so carried awaye with conceit: that because he thought himselfe wise,
<pb facs="tcp:11685:13"/>
there was more hope of a Foole, then of him, for true wit to do good vpon? for, trusting to the compasse of his owne capacitie, so much, that he disdained better company, he was so cosened with the cunning of wit, as, thinking to ouer-reach the Moone with imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he fell through the clowdes of Error, so low in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lap of <hi>Folly,</hi> as being swaddled vp, in her Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies bands, he must be very olde, ere he recouer his wits againe: but, poore wretch, there let him rest, and watch the Spiders webbe for a flie, for I had no more to do with him: but the next to him, sat a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some woman, in shape, but, for her beauty, nointed with the curriers oyle: and for her wit, it was so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, that Art had nothing so do with it, yet hadde this vns√©emely creature, among better company, a kinde of Pride, that she was woorth the looking on, till after great expences of apparrel for her filthy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and fine diet for her fowle chappes, she grew to so bare a reckoning with her purse, that her portion must now be raised vpon her qualities, which b√©eing chiefly in her N√©edle, she was forced to be sparing of her dyet, and make layd-worke the greatest parte of her liuing, whereof though she had her handes full, yet Cut-worke being more in vse, she was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take exc√©eding great pains for little profit: but hauing now newe risen vppe from her worke, and set downe at the Table, her meate was most chiefly on a fryed Mouse, and the reason thereof was, for that she being as watchfull as a Catte, and as broade ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and euil faced, neuer gotten without the consent, agr√©ement, or conceite of some such like Creature,
<pb facs="tcp:11685:14"/>
it was a dish set before hir to discipher hir disposition: and so let her sitte, her neighbour with a flie, and she with a fried mouse, like good fellowes, or good Fooles togither.</p>
            <p>Now, next her, sat a man, well stept in y√©eres, but fine in apparrell, and so briske in countenance, as if he had fed vpon an Elixar, to recouer the losse of his strength, and he more strong in mind, then in body, to preserue the smoothnesse of his countnance, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the sight of a simple Eie, fedde onely vppon a Snayle, and so litle at once that he kept an exceeding spare diet: which, not being wholesome for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, I meant not to meddle with: but so, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him to his perillous dishe, tooke note of her that was nexte him: who in the shape of a woman, was nothing pleau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ng to man: for as she was olde, (and therfore not Eiesome,) so was she froward, and that was cumbersome: one, who in her youthe had been so lauish of her kindnesse, that now in her Age, she had nothing left but the contrary: and, where she might haue bene commaunder of many friends, sh√©e now was growne to be an ouers√©er of Idlenes: wher being so busie, with a crabbed humour, that she was vnfit for good company: lighting amongst beggers, that would flatter her for a poore reuersion, for want of a paire of spectacles, to leade the right way to her graue, she fell, (by I know not what chaunce) into this <hi>Fort of Foll,</hi> and so, in the society of these Fooles, sat at this table of good fellowshippe: where the most of her foode, was of the clawe of an olde Crabbe: a true Figure of her substaunce: for her little Eyes,

her crawling f√©et, and her scratching fingers, the salt khewme, like the Sea water, and her graue, like a hole in the mudde, where, after her going forwarde and backward, she went stealing of time to litle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, feeding vpon the gaine of young people, as the crabbe doth on little ashes, she was sweetly disciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in her diet but, least I grow tedious in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, I will tell you of the rest.</p>
            <p>The next was a nimble witted, and glib-toung`d fel low, who hauing in his youth, spent his wits in the <hi>Art</hi> of loue, was now, become the Iest of wit for his looks were so demure, his words were so in print, his graces so in order, and his conceites so in tune: that he was, yea Iwis was he, and that he was, such a Gentleman for a Iester, that the Lady <hi>Folly,</hi> could neuer be better fitted for her entertainement of all Straungers. The picktooth in the mouth, the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the Eare, the brush vpon the beard, the kisse of the hand, the stoupe of the head the leers of the eye, and what not, that was vnn√©edefull, but he hadde so perfecte at his fingers endes, that euery she, was my faire Ladye, and scarce a Knight, was, Noble Sir, the Tabacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe was at hand, when <hi>Trinida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> was not forgotten: and then a Tale of a roasted horse, to make an asse laugh, for lacke of witte: why, all thinges so well agreede togither, that at this square Table of people, or table of square people, this Man, (made by rule) could not be spared for a great summe. Now, his meate was most of a Goose to which he had so much sawce, that it would haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for many dishes: but, for that his talke, was to
<pb facs="tcp:11685:15"/>
little purpose, and he himselfe but a picture of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I leaue him among his fellowe partners, and will tell you onwards of the next two, for the Table was fully furnished.</p>
            <p>The next to him was a woman, I cannot wel say much more of her; for her beautie was worne out; her bodie was able to carrie her limbes, her handes had fingers, and shee wanted not a tongue, whiche was the member she now made most vse of; for sh√©e woulde so praise my Lady, so sooth vppe my coosen, so magnifie my Lorde, and be so pleasing to euerie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that hauing lost much in her youth by plain-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, she thought now to recouer it by plaine knaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: but meeting with such wittes as met with her wiles, finding no place of worth, fitting her vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie company, for lacke of better meanes to liue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke her self to be a gossip among fooles, where accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to her qualitie, she was serued with tongues on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie for her diet: which tempred to so manye Tunes, and turning to so manie matters, that it troubled my eares with the hearing of them, I will leaue her to her tittle tattle, and tell you a little of the laste, who was in shape a man, and not a man, I knowe not what to saie of suche a man, for he had the eyes of a Calfe, the bearde of a Goate, the head of a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-spaniell, (meaning the haire,) the Eare of an Asse, the necke of a Bull, the Nose of a bottle (or a Bottle Nose) and the lippe of an Horse, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of a Dogge, and the voice of a Hogge, which being fedde vppe for Larde, was a huge p√©ece of Fatte, as for good and firme fleshe hee hadde but a
<pb facs="tcp:11685:15"/>
little.</p>
            <p>Now, this vgly creature, who was scarce able to go from his bed to the boord, must there sit in a chaire made of downe quilt, with a pillow at his backe, and a cushion at his f√©et, f√©eding vpon sw√©ete Gelly, and laughing at a bawdy tale. Nowe imagining by the Poets fiction, he should be GOD, or rather, Deuill <hi>Bacchus,</hi> loth to haue to do with such loathsome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I left the company as they sat, and came into the next roome: where, being brought in by my guide, (the poore man, that was in miserable taking with a woman, I will not say his wife:) there he tooke me by the hand, and setting downe by me, willed me to be silent, and onely giue eare to the discourses that I should h√©ere betwixt two fooles, that in losse of time, should lay open their imperfections: and what I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worth the laughiug at; to smile, and say nothing: so, after a few friendly instructions for obseruations in that place, he sets behind a cloth, yet not so close, but thorough a light sufficient to looke on <hi>Folly,</hi> I might s√©e two goodly personages comming in, hande in hande, who hauing past some complementes of common curtesie, sitting both downe togither, fell into some kinde sp√©eches: and hadde not she bene painted, <hi>Venus</hi> hadde beene but a Blowse: and had not he b√©ene pranckt vp, he had bene the shape of a handsome man.</p>
            <p>But as they were like the Idols of Idlenes, let them passe, with their imperfections, and let me tell you a little of their tattle: he, as it fell out for his turne, beganne thus to goe aboute her: by this
<pb facs="tcp:11685:16"/>
faire heauen: (O Lord thought I, thou art I feare neerer hell but on, Did you know sw√©et Lady, could you guesse, or woulde you conetiue, the true, and faithfull, and vnfained, harty, inwarde, constante, and resolute and vnmoueable loue, (alasse thought I, whats h√©ere to doe, the mans wittes are out of breath, to spend so many words about nothing, but let me goe on) the loue that I beare you, and onely you, and none but you, the Sunne of my daie, the light of mine eies, the any of my hart, and honour of my minde: (yet againe quoth I to my selfe, what ayles this poore man, is he saying a lesson to his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse? But a little further.) Then you could not be so hard harted, so cruell minded, nor so vninercifully disposed, to grieue, to torment to her and to disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, this poore afflicted, woefull, sorrowefull, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable heart of mine. When, with a sigh he pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and saide no more for the first part. Much adoe I had to forbeare laughing, but I was glad, when he had done: expecting some woorthy aunswere from her, who, putting vp her loose hatre with her hande, remouing a pretty worme from his place, with a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Bodkinne, shaking the heade, with a straunge wincke, setting a face fit for her sp√©ech, begun thus her reply. Oh sir, your words, nor your wittes, nor your wiles, nor your wittes, nor your oths, (whats the matter now thought I? But on) shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue nor blind, nor ouercome, nor go beyond me, so farre, but, I know, and perceiue, and vnderstande, what you mean, and purpose, &amp; intend, we I enough: (Lord helpe me, thought I, h√©ers strange Eloquence:

but let me goe further) but, I hope I will not be a seruant, where I may commaund, be bound, where I am at libertie, and be betrayed in my most trust. (But then to heare the poore man, how he played the foole, tis pirty that euer it should be spoken: but for the stories sake, let it passe.) Mistris (quoth he) h√©ere is my brest, cut out my hart, s√©e my thoughts: h√©ere is my purse, take my gold: my whole state is at your seruice. (At these words my heart began to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for nowe the poore man is vndone, for shee will make him a begger, and then will he be a stark foole, but to go on, she tooke his purse and his Iewels, and kissed his brest, and said) nay w√©epe not, for I did but try your truth, there shall be no loue lost, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I pray you onely, be not Iealous of my lookes to any other, for you onely shall haue my loue: and therwithall giuing him a Iudas kisse, she whippes a bracelet of Pearle off from his Arme, with these words, this shall be your pawne, that I will weare for your sake till to morrow: for euer mistris (quoth he) and all that I haue at your seruice; and I prate you mistris, grace me with your voice, to a dittie that I haue mede to the tune of, Lady, Lady, my faire Lady: A vengeance on the foole thought I, it freakes me to heare him play the Asse: but when I heard him fumble the strings of a <hi>Bandore,</hi> as if it had bene the Backe side of a battle-doore, and her straine <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

man after the countrey manner, and a woman after the our towne fashion: he, no more witte, nor shee, more vnderstanding, then was fit for the plough and the milke paile: And yet, these two (contrarie to all Rules of reason howe it shoulde fall out: fell, as it should s√©eme, in loue, for, after they had sat downe a while, and he had blow<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now, I am not one of these fine toung`d fellows, that will forsweare themselues for a fit of knauerie: I meane truely and honestly, and so I hope, doe you, or else, I would you were hang`d for me, and all that meane otherwise, for I do not, bel√©eue me, and you will, I will saie and holde, I doe not loue to make euery man priuie to my secretes, twere but folly: you knowe I loue you, and more then our selues, no man knowes any thinge of my minde, but your cosenne <hi>Hobblin,</hi> by whome I sent you the last Sunday, a paire of Gloues, cutte out of the best of the Sh√©epes skinnes, they cost me thr√©e-pence, that they did, and I hope, that it shall not be the last loue-token, that I will sende, and you will take, for, I haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a br√©eding for you, and therefore, since you knowe, your Father haue lefte you the pied Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and your mother haue giuen you the Cosset Lambe, my Gray Mare and the Colte, that I had

so, with a little controuersie, the simple people were soone agr√©ed: he so besmouched her, &amp; she so beclapped him, and there tumbling together, as merrie as they coulde wish, I sighed to thinke, what a supper they would haue after break-fast: for when the meat was spent, they might learn to fast for a supper. Alas pore fooles, but they are simply foolish, and coulde not doe withall: for loue had catcht them, and they were in for a bird: and therefore god helpe the poore, for they were in a pittifull taking, but let them goe: when they were risen and parted, came in thr√©e men, <hi>a Poet, a Musition, and a Painter:</hi> but when I sawe them in their fits, oh what an humor did I fall into? I knew not what to thinke.

But no sooner were they gon then came in thr√©e o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: a lame Soldier, a poore Trauailer, and an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start Courtier: where euerie one hauing spoken his minde, in the manner of a play they departed. The Soldier, he beat his boy for lack of attendance, when he had plaied away his allowance at <hi>Primero.</hi> The Trauailer he talked so of straunge matters, that for lacke of money, hee was glad to fast for his dinner. The Courtier he was so fine in his compleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts, that his obligation grew scarce currant for his clothes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las thought I, surely; only <hi>Folly</hi> hath made these men poore, and now pouertie hath made them fooles: but, in pittie let me speake it, they were proper men, and so let them passe. Now, no sooner were they gone, but came in thr√©e other: a s√©ely Lawyer, a simple Usurer, and an honest Broker. The Lawyer (as it shoulde s√©eme) had too much care of conscience, for his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>moditie; who weying the weight of euery cause, and the estate of euerie client, was more gratious, then polliticke: and so like an honest poore man, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter studied in the lawe of God, then profiting by the law of man; more fit for praier, then for pleading, sat reading of a case betwixte the vertue of necessity, and the pride of superfluitie: where <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of heauen shewed the blessing of patience; and <hi>Diues</hi> out of <hi>Hel</hi> shewed the reward of vncharitablenes. But let him there sit shaking the heade at Usurie: and let me tell you a litle of the behauiour of that <hi>Monster:</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing b√©ene, (for the most parte of his life,) fed with the offall flesh, the pairings of ch√©ese, and the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of tappes, wringing out the toyle of the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
<pb facs="tcp:11685:19"/>
the harde market of the tradesman, the prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the rich, and the miserie of the poore. Those heapes of goulde, that had shutte vp his heart in his purse, sate in the chaire of iniquity, tortured with the gowte, nummed with the palsie, cramped with the collicke, and torrmented in the soule with the woorme of conscience: cryeing by fittes (as he had any case) oh the hell of a wounded conscience: widdowes rise out of your graues, take your leases of your houses, and pray for some ease of my passion: children of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie parents, receiue the gaine of vnlawefull inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, take your portions, too long kept from you: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray for my comforte, that I bee not vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; miserable men, come out of your prisons, I forgiue you your debts, and wil restore you your due. Oh the ertreame reward of extremitie, where lawe is without loue, andcouetousnes without conscience; oh the teares of the widdow, the cries of the orphane, the miserie of the poore, and the lamentation of the destressed: I s√©e them, I heare them, I f√©ele them: Oh I knowe not what to doe, nor where to rest for them; they rise vp to heauen, and weigh mee downe to hell.</p>
            <p>Oh, what auaileth all the worlde to him, that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his owne soule: but farewell world, I defie th√©e; wealth, I hate th√©e <hi>Auarice</hi> I detest th√©e, <hi>Charitie</hi> I imbrace th√©e, <hi>Pittie</hi> I loue th√©e, <hi>Necessitie</hi> I relieue th√©e, <hi>Oppression</hi> I abhorre th√©e, <hi>Mercie</hi> I adore th√©e, <hi>Hell</hi> I haue not to doe with th√©e, <hi>Heauen</hi> I come to th√©e. So distributing to the poore, and comforting the miserable, disposing of his worldly goods, to the good
<pb facs="tcp:11685:19"/>
of the distressed christian, bequeathing to the lawyer for his care of conscience, an annuitie, to k√©epe him from vncharitable f√©es: and the Broker a reasonable portion, to make him leaue his griping kinde of trade or profession: rising from his seat of torment, fell so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly on his kn√©es to praier, where his paines miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and his praiers ended, he became a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: chusing rather to die a poore christian, then to liue a rich Iew. A strang sight, but worth the looking on: but there let me leaue him, in a good exercise, and tel yon what followed of the Broker: that poore man f√©eing the lawyer, and the vsurer, both gone from the world, and himselfe left in a pittifull taking to tarrie in it, followes his good maisters before him: deliuers vp his pawnes and his bonds, vpon such reasonable consideration, that within a while he grew out of cre dit with the money-maisters, and so giuing ouer his shop, and contented with a meane pittance, liued like a good foole, with his good masters: but since the folly before men, is wisdome before God, I hold such fools in better estate, then greater knaues in more recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but when these men had a while talked of the comfort of their concertion, I scarce turned my head aside, but they were gone. When presently came in an olde fellowe with a penne in his eare, and a booke in his hande: who sitting downe in a seate, (like a Sumner in a Church portch, or an <hi>A B C</hi> schoolemas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) laid downe a great booke before him, where hee read certaine names, but his voice being somewhat law, I could not heare him, but his words (I take it were after this manner.</p>

            <p>Now tie vpon gr√©ene Plununes, in troth they make my stomacke wamble: good Lord, I haue so sweat, with making me ready, that if it were not for wearines, I would not haue rose before noone: But I haue met with my breakefast: and therefore I may stay my stomacke to dinner: oh the <hi>French</hi> fail, and the <hi>Spanish</hi> stitch the <hi>Italian</hi> bodies, and the <hi>Persian</hi> skarfe, I hope I will be furnisht to the proofe.</p>
            <p>And yet, to say troth, I am so fantasticke, that I shall be weary of them al, within a while: Heigh-ho: well said Sister, (sayes the old man) fantasticke: another badge of my Ladies; sit you downe; which done, came in diuers couples to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, an olde blinde man, and lusty a young wench, and born before them vp in a shielde: A <hi>Cornucopia:</hi> vnder with was written, <hi>Plenty.</hi> Next after them an old lame woman, and a nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble young man: and before them borne, a <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11685:22"/>
Ouer which, was written, <hi>Poyson.</hi> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a young man, and a young woman, both poore in purse, but in good state of body: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them borne <hi>Gemini,</hi> and ouer them written, <hi>Loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then followed a Riche Cuckolde, and a poore Whore, and borne them <hi>Aries:</hi> and written <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many other pretty <hi>Figures</hi> there were expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the meaning of these <hi>Maskers,</hi> which, for lack of a note booke, are suddainlie slipt out of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</p>
            <p>But, when this <hi>Maske</hi> had once gone aboute the Roome, comes out a <hi>Foole</hi> in a pied coat, and tels them, they must make an ende quickly, and take their places, for the Lady was comming, to see an Enterlude, and prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tly a noise of shames, with an outery of knaues, came out, with such a Shoute, that, (while I looke for some fine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) wakt me suddenly out of my sleepe.</p>
            <p>So that I neuer heard more of any of them, but was euer man so troubled in his sl√©epe? wel I was exceedinge glad when I was awake, I was so vvell and safely deliuered out of this <hi>Pur gatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, there cannot be such a thing: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:11685:22"/>
as a dreame, let it passe: and so, hoping that if you note well this dreame, it will doe you no hurte, when you are awake, hoping you will heare with Sl√©epers, if any thing be not as it shoulde be: in some hast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other businesse, I bid you hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly farewel.</p>
