            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Impartial Account OF THE TRYAL OF FRANCIS SMITH, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ON <hi>Saturday</hi> the ſeventh of this <hi>Inſtant February,</hi> 1679/80. at the <hi>Guildhall,</hi> in <hi>the City of London,</hi> there was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation between our Soveraign Lord the <hi>KING,</hi> and <hi>Francis Smith</hi> Bookſeller, brought before <hi>Mr. Juſtice Jones,</hi> one of the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi>; and after the <hi>Jury</hi> was ſworn, Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> began after this manner:</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, here is an Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preferred in behalf of the <hi>KING</hi> againſt <hi>Francis Smith,</hi> Bookſeller, and it ſets forth, that, after Sir <hi>George Wakeman, Will. Marſhall, Will. Rumley,</hi> and <hi>James Corker,</hi> were indicted and tryed on the 18th. of <hi>July,</hi> 1679. for divers <hi>High Treaſons</hi> at the Seſſions-houſe in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> before Sir <hi>James Edwards,</hi> then Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> and others, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, <hi>Francis Smith,</hi> publiſhed a ſcandalous Libel, relating to the late Tryals, which was intituled, <hi>Some Obſervations upon the late Tryal,</hi> &amp;c. the words are particularly ſet forth in the Information; to which the Defendant pleads not guilty; but if we prove it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, you of the Jury are to find for the King; and if you find he is not guilty, you are to ſay ſo, and no more, &amp;c. </p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then <hi>Mr. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder</hi> ſpake to this effect:</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am of Council againſt the Defendant for the King, who ſtands informed againſt for a very great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: the Information particularly ſets forth, that whereas ſome certain perſons were indicted at the Seſſions-houſe in the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> before the then Lord Mayor, Sir <hi>James Edwards,</hi> and other perſons then in commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and <hi>Gaol-delivery</hi> for that place, and particularly, my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice Scroggs,</hi> and after the Tryal was over, and the perſons thereupon acquitted, there was a Book, which is mentioned in the Information, printed and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it is a Book that is known by the name of <hi>Tom Ticcklefoot</hi>;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50885:3"/>
a very abuſive thing; but perſons now begin to grow wonderful witty in the beginning of their Books, in hopes to inſnare people to read them, and to prevail upon them ſo far as to make them believe there is ſomewhat extraordinary by the title. You ſee, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice finds out all the waies in the world to inſnare and gain upon the people; to ſo bad an Age are we come.</p>
               <p>But I confeſs, it is the ſecond time ever ſince I had the fortune or happineſs to know this City of <hi>London,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> have known ſuch expectations, as have been upon two Cauſes in this place: the firſt was but two daies ago, the ſecond is at this time, wherein is truly, a ſort of countenance, <hi>I</hi> am afraid, too much given by perſons that dare pretend to be no other ſort of Proteſtants, but can impudently outface all ſort of Governours. Now, as all perſons ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor and deteſt that damnable Doctrine, that men hope to be Saints in another world, becauſe they may commit Murders in this; ſo this ought too as much to be condemned by all Proteſtants as the other, that men ſhall endeavour to rebel, and be factious in this world, that ſo they may be reckoned good Subjects: the One are as far from being good Saints, as the Others from being good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. <hi>I</hi> take this occaſion to ſpeak all this before your Lordſhip, and this Court, becauſe <hi>I</hi> hope the City of <hi>London</hi> will never be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the baſe inſinuating of ſome idle buſie-bodies in it. Men, who cannot, or will not be pleaſed, becauſe (forſooth) every thing does not go according to their mind and fancy; and though by no means they will allow the <hi>POPE</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> yet every factious fellow will expect, that every one ſhould pay him that tribute as <hi>Infallibly,</hi> as if he were the only fit perſon to give Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Governours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we come to have extraordinary caſes and perſons, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occaſions ought to be taken to inflict due and juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them.</p>
               <p>And when they ſhall dare to come to diſparage <hi>great men</hi> that act by <hi>Supream Authority,</hi> men that act by their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be ſteered by the humours of theſe ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore they muſt be looked upon as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or at leaſt, as <hi>bribed,</hi> becauſe they cannot comply with that baſe humour which ſome ſort of perſons have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> take notice of this to your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> becauſe one that is intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in as great a place for the welfare of this Nation, as any whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is extreamly concerned in the affair of this day; <hi>I</hi> mean, the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> who, being aſſiſted with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50885:3"/>
other Judges, becauſe, as far forth as it did appear to him, did deliver the ſenſe of the whole Court, who, for acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Conſcience, and as he ought to do, hath been <hi>libelled</hi> and <hi>reproached</hi> with as baſe a <hi>Book</hi> as ever was written againſt any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate whatſoever: If ſuch things as this ſhall be permitted, then there will be an end of your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> ſitting here, or any where elſe, or of any other that ſhall act as a Magiſtrate ought to act, and that ſhall not be afraid to do his duty. But ſuch is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this <hi>City,</hi> in this <hi>Jury,</hi> that, <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs, <hi>I</hi> receive ſo much the greater ſatisfaction that it comes before them: for as <hi>I</hi> know the men to be men of Loyalty and Affection to the Government, and will be ſo juſt to him, that if they do not find him guilty of the matter of the Information, they will acquit him; ſo, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, they will not think themſelves to be awed by a <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> or inſlaved by private inſinuations, to debauch their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, either in reſpect to God above, or to the King, his Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent here on Earth; therefore obſerve your duty to both, that you may render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that be <hi>Caeſars,</hi> as well as to God, the things that are God's.</p>
               <p>Now as the <hi>KING</hi> is God's Vicegerent, ſo is every Magiſtrate the <hi>KING</hi>'s Vicegerent in that particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> would not take up ſo much of your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> time, but that I ſee this is a matter of great expectation: and <hi>I</hi> know that every word is taken in ſhort-hand, to be commented upon as perſons humors ſhall ſteer them. <hi>I</hi> do think, as being the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>City of London,</hi> it is my duty to ſpeak thus much, that I hope, nay, <hi>I</hi> may dare confidently affirm, that the Generality of the City of <hi>London,</hi> all good men, and men of abilities <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are for the KING, and the Government, as it is now eſtabliſhed by Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>[<hi>At which there was a general hem through the Court.</hi>]</p>
            <sp>
               <p>Having ſaid thus much againſt this perſon <hi>Mr. Francis Smith, I</hi> muſt ſay, that if the way of common report were evidence enough to convict a man, he would be convicted without any more adoe, but ſuch is the happineſs of our Lawes, that they expect teſtimony, beſides common fame.</p>
               <p>I would rather a great deal it might be a caution to <hi>Mr. Smith,</hi> if there had not ben many before, and that he could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, and the Evidence not plain in proof againſt him.</p>
               <p>Well, he printed this Book in the name of another perſon, one <hi>Mrs. Brewſter,</hi> he ſold ſeveral of them in Quires to ſeveral people, and <hi>Mrs. Brewſter</hi> queſtioning wherefore he ſhould put
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50885:4"/>
her name to this Book, truly, he ſaid, he intended no harm to her, for he was reſolved to ſave her harmleſs, and this we will prove to you; and likewiſe that ſeveral Books have been taken in his ſhop, and he juſtifying himſelf in what he had done, and his further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to expoſe them ſtill to ſale: and if we ſhall prove this to you, there will be an end of all ſort of Juſtice, if in caſe that you, who are the only means of bringing men to juſtice, will not contribute to have juſtice executed where it ought to be; none can be legally puniſhed, unleſs they be legally convicted; and I doubt not your honeſty and loyalty, but that you wil do your part by conviction, and by juſtice too.</p>
               <p>Againſt all Libellers, I am ſure, there is Law enough, and every honeſt man will endeavour to have it put in execution againſt them, as far forth as it lies in his way. I hope the generality of thoſe that are here, do come to ſhew an abhorrency againſt this perſon informed againſt, and not to give any countenance to ſuch baſe actions.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>Council for the Defendant. My Lord, the Libel is ſufficiently infamous, we muſt needs own, and I do not come to juſtify the thing, neither <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> my Client, nor any body elſe that ſhall be guilty of it: The queſtion is, whether he be guilty of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is laid in the Information.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Sir do you admit the <hi>Record?</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Juſtice Jones.</speaker>
               <p>If you do not admit it, you muſt call in your witneſſes, and prove what you can.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereupon</hi> Rob. Stephens, Anne Brewſter, <hi>and</hi> Margaret Clark <hi>were called into Court, and ſtood up behind the Jury.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, If you will give me leave, you ſhall hear what we will admit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Come, come, Sir, if you do not admit the <hi>Record,</hi> we will have none of your Anticipations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>What call you your ſpeech but Anticipation?</p>
               <p>My Lord, the poor man, my Client, is a lanquiſhing, ſick, and dying man, and one that is almoſt ruined, if any ſubmſſion will ſerve the turn, he will give all the ſubmiſſion that is fit for a man to give: all that we ſay is this, that he did not order this to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it is laid in the Information.—But I think we may admit—</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Fettiplace</hi> ſaid, (who was Council on the ſame ſide) he had no ſuch order given him by his Client, as to admit the Record.</p>
               <p>Then they were juſt going on to ſwear the witneſſes, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50885:4"/>
Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> ſaid, <hi>It would be very well if they would admit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Defendant come to ſubmiſsion.</hi>

               <p>Ay, that is your beſt way, for it would be a great means to teſtifie that your ſubmiſſion is really intended as a ſubmiſſion; but if it be to prepare you to think that you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, then we will not have your ſubmiſſion—And I am for a ſinners Repentance with all my heart.</p>

               <p>If your Client be willing to ſubmit, let the <hi>KING</hi> have a Verdict in Law, and then he will find my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> full of pity and compaſſion; and if I can ſee any ſigns of Repentance, I will promiſe you to intercede to my Lord for him.</p>

               <p>My Lord, my Husband is very ſick and weak, and is not able to come himſelf, or elſe he would have done it; but <hi>I</hi> asked Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> if it were not beſt to ſubmit to the Court.</p>
