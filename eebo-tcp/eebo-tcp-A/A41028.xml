            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So now in theſe laſt days the Prophets of the Lord have warned the <hi>Turk,</hi> warned the <hi>Pope,</hi> and warned moſt of the Kings in Chriſtendom, of their <hi>Perſecution;</hi> whoſe Field lies like a Field of Blood, who ſtaines the Earth with it, that the Inhabiters of it are Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, like <hi>Cain</hi> that killed the Righteous; ſo that the Earth doth not yeeld her full ſtrength: Therefore are there ſo many Beggars, deſolate people in Poverty among them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> propheſied, and ſaw a perſecuting <hi>Cain</hi> (that would kill about Religion) was getting up among the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans before their deceaſe, which would be Preachers or Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; who were by the Apoſtles judged.</p>

               </hi> who prayed to the Lord to <hi>Revenge</hi> him of his <hi>Perſecutors, Jer.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome that had been accounted Chriſtians amongſt them that were <hi>Doggs:</hi> that after a time <hi>turned</hi> again and <hi>lickt up the Vomit,</hi> (as many do now, and theſe <hi>Doggs</hi> were <hi>greedy</hi> and <hi>hungry Perſecutors,</hi> and <hi>Devourers,</hi> that <hi>lick up their own Vomit</hi>) and will not feed upon the <hi>bread that comes down from heaven, Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And ſome that went under the Name of Chriſtians, after that they were <hi>waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> did run into the <hi>mire again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So Conſider</hi> this ye who are not Heirs of God and Elect before the World began, ſee if ye be not of the <hi>Doggs</hi> and <hi>Swine renting,</hi> and <hi>tearing,</hi> and in the <hi>mire,</hi> and <hi>licking up your own Vomit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>VVoman,</hi> the <hi>true Church,</hi> was <hi>Perſecuted,</hi> which <hi>brought forth the Man Child.</hi> Sea <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> who is born after the <hi>Fleſh, Perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 4. For he that is born after the <hi>Fleſh</hi> is a <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> though he may Profeſſe all the Scriptures, Church-Worſhip, and Miniſtry, yet he is a <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queen Mary Perſecuted</hi> the tender Vines and Budds, and Plants as they ſprang up; Whoſe End and Dayes the Lord ſhortned: And <hi>woeful</hi> and <hi>miſerable</hi> was the end of many of thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Bloody Tyrants,</hi> which in her dayes were the greateſt <hi>Perſecutors.</hi> As ye may read in <hi>Foxe's Monuments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And alſo, we warned the <hi>Long-Parliament</hi> of their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> who heard not, nor regarded the Prophets of the Lord; who at the laſt were turned out as unfit for his uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We</hi> warned <hi>Oliver Protector,</hi> in whoſe Dominions there was <hi>Perſecution</hi> almoſt in every place, who would not here and conſider as he ought to have done; and ſo his Days alſo were ſhortned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We warned other Parliaments</hi> of their <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and to ſtop and limit <hi>Perſecutors.</hi>

               <hi>We warned Richard Cromwel</hi> of <hi>Perſecution</hi> and <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,</hi> to ſtop and limit them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We warned the Committee of Safety</hi> (ſo called) of the <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Judgements</hi> of God that were coming upon their heads: and of the blood of the <hi>Innocent</hi> in the Nation that lay ſhed, by <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> in <hi>Goals, Priſons,</hi> and <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Correction;</hi> And mens <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi> were taken from them by men in <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Perſecution;</hi> yet great Talking and Profeſſing of God and Chriſt with the Lipps, but out of his Life and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſt of all</hi> we have <hi>warned Charles</hi> the <hi>King</hi> who hath his day, and all his Officers and Magiſtrates under him, by whom many of the <hi>Innocent</hi> are caſt into Goals, lying on ſtraw in Dungeons, ſome whereof are ſick and weak, and ſome dead, and Wives and Children, and neceſſary things denyed them: Therefore conſider theſe things for this is the day now of your Tryal.</p>
            <p>All you that do <hi>Perſecute</hi> about <hi>Religion, Church, VVorſhip, Miniſtry, Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Offerings,</hi> are no more <hi>Reſpected</hi> of God than <hi>Cain</hi> was, neither hath God any more regard to your <hi>Services</hi> than He had to his.</p>
