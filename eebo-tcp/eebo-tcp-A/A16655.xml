            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow noble, how auncient, and how effectuall the Arte of Musicke is, many excellent discourses of Theoristes deepely learned in the science haue already so confirmed &amp; illustrated, that it might seeme as much arrogancie in me to attempt the prayse thereof, as it argues malice or ignorance in such as seeke to exclude it out of diuine, or humaine soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie. I will onely alledge one testimonie out of an Epistle, which that auncient Father <hi>Martin Luther</hi> did write to <hi>Senfelius</hi> the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, which is so ample in commendation of this art, that it were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to adde any other. Musicke, saith he, to Diuels we know is hateful and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I plainely thinke neither am I ashamed to auerr it, that next to Theologie, there is no Arte comparable with Musicke: for it alone next to Theologie doth effect that, which otherwise onely Theologie can performe, that is, a quiet and a chearefull minde. Now if Musicke merites so high a place, as this holy man hath giuen it, can wee deny loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, that with their grace and bounty raise the professors thereof? Or to whome shal we that labour in this qualitie, better recommend our workes, then to our patrones and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors? Receiue therefore (most honoured Knight and my worthiest Patrone) the fruites of your bounties and the effects of those quiet dayes, which by your goodnes I haue enioyed. And as the glory of a new finisht house belonges not so much to the Worke-man that built it, as to the Lord that owes it, so if any part of this new worke of mine can excite commendation, the grace is chiefly yours, though the labour mine. But because there is no man more distrustfull of his owne endeuours then I am my selfe, by the weakenes of my nature: I beseech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my labours howsoeuer into your protection, whose worth can best countenance the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from misfortune, &amp; spirit defend them, I will onely assist you with a poore mans bounty, I meane my many humble prayers to the highest protector, beseeching him to blesse you with long life and prosperity to his glorie and our comforts, that must euer owe you our seruice and loue.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow noble, how auncient, and how effectuall the Arte of Musicke is, many excellent discourses of Theoristes deepely learned in the science haue already so confirmed &amp; illustrated, that it might seeme as much arrogancie in me to attempt the prayse thereof, as it argues malice or ignorance in such as seeke to exclude it out of diuine, or humaine soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie. I will onely alledge one testimonie out of an Epistle, which that auncient Father <hi>Martin Luther</hi> did write to <hi>Senfelius</hi> the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, which is so ample in commendation of this art, that it were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to adde any other. Musicke, saith he, to Diuels we know is hateful and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I plainely thinke neither am I ashamed to auerr it, that next to Theologie, there is no Arte comparable with Musicke: for it alone next to Theologie doth effect that, which otherwise onely Theologie can performe, that is, a quiet and a chearefull minde. Now if Musicke merites so high a place, as this holy man hath giuen it, can wee deny loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, that with their grace and bounty raise the professors thereof? Or to whome shal we that labour in this qualitie, better recommend our workes, then to our patrones and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors? Receiue therefore (most honoured Knight and my worthiest Patrone) the fruites of your bounties and the effects of those quiet dayes, which by your goodnes I haue enioyed. And as the glory of a new finisht house belonges not so much to the Worke╌man that built it, as to the Lord that owes it, so if any part of this new worke of mine can excite commendation, the grace is chiefly yours, though the labour mine. But because there is no man more distrustfull of his owne endeuours then I am my selfe, by the weakenes of my nature: I beseech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my labours howsoeuer into your protection, whose worth can best countenance the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from misfortune, &amp; spirit defend them, I will onely assist you with a poore mans bounty, I meane my many humble prayers to the highest protector, beseeching him to blesse you with long life and prosperity to his glorie and our comforts, that must euer owe you our seruice and loue.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow noble, how auncient, and how effectuall the Arte of Musicke is, many excellent discourses of Theoristes deepely learned in the science haue already so confirmed &amp; illustrated, that it might seeme as much arrogancie in me to attempt the prayse thereof, as it argues malice or ignorance in such as seeke to exclude it out of diuine, or humaine soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie. I will onely alledge one testimonie out of an Epistle, which that auncient Father <hi>Martin Luther</hi> did write to <hi>Senfelius</hi> the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, which is so ample in commendation of this art, that it were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to adde any other. Musicke, saith he, to Diuels we know is hateful and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I plainely thinke neither am I ashamed to auerr it, that next to Theologie, there is no Arte comparable with Musicke: for it alone next to Theologie doth effect that, which otherwise onely Theologie can performe, that is, a quiet and a chearefull minde. Now if Musicke merites so high a place, as this holy man hath giuen it, can wee deny loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, that with their grace and bounty raise the professors thereof? Or to whome shal we that labour in this qualitie, better recommend our workes, then to our patrones and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors? Receiue therefore (most honoured Knight and my worthiest Patrone) the fruites of your bounties and the effects of those quiet dayes, which by your goodnes I haue enioyed. And as the glory of a new finisht house belonges not so much to the Worke-man that built it, as to the Lord that owes it, so if any part of this new worke of mine can excite commendation, the grace is chiefly yours, though the labour mine. But because there is no man more distrustfull of his owne endeuours then I am my selfe, by the weakenes of my nature: I beseech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my labours howsoeuer into your protection, whose worth can best countenance the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from misfortune, &amp; spirit defend them, I will onely assist you with a poore mans bounty, I meane my many humble prayers to the highest protector, beseeching him to blesse you with long life and prosperity to his glorie and our comforts, that must euer owe you our seruice and loue.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow noble, how auncient, and how effectuall the Arte of Musicke is, many excellent discourses of Theoristes deepely learned in the science haue already so confirmed &amp; illustrated, that it might seeme as much arrogancie in me to attempt the prayse thereof, as it argues malice or ignorance in such as seeke to exclude it out of diuine, or humaine soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie. I will onely alledge one testimonie out of an Epistle, which that auncient Father <hi>Martin Luther</hi> did write to <hi>Senfelius</hi> the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, which is so ample in commendation of this art, that it were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to adde any other. Musicke, saith he, to Diuels we know is hateful and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I plainely thinke neither am I ashamed to auerr it, that next to Theologie, there is no Arte comparable with Musicke: for it alone next to Theologie doth effect that, which otherwise onely Theologie can performe, that is, a quiet and a chearefull minde. Now if Musicke merites so high a place, as this holy man hath giuen it, can wee deny loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, that with their grace and bounty raise the professors thereof? Or to whome shal we that labour in this qualitie, better recommend our workes, then to our patrones and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors? Receiue therefore (most honoured Knight and my worthiest Patrone) the fruites of your bounties and the effects of those quiet dayes, which by your goodnes I haue enioyed. And as the glory of a new finisht house belonges not so much to the Worke-man that built it, as to the Lord that owes it, so if any part of this new worke of mine can excite commendation, the grace is chiefly yours, though the labour mine. But because there is no man more distrustfull of his owne endeuours then I am my selfe, by the weakenes of my nature: I beseech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my labours howsoeuer into your protection, whose worth can best countenance the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from misfortune, &amp; spirit defend them, I will onely assist you with a poore mans bounty, I meane my many humble prayers to the highest protector, beseeching him to blesse you with long life and prosperity to his glorie and our comforts, that must euer owe you our seruice and loue.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow noble, how auncient, and how effectuall the Arte of Musicke is, many excellent discourses of Theoristes deepely learned in the science haue already so confirmed &amp; illustrated, that it might seeme as much arrogancie in me to attempt the prayse thereof, as it argues malice or ignorance in such as seeke to exclude it out of diuine, or humaine soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie. I will onely alledge one testimonie out of an Epistle, which that auncient Father <hi>Martin Luther</hi> did write to <hi>Senfelius</hi> the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, which is so ample in commendation of this art, that it were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to adde any other. Musicke, saith he, to Diuels we know is hateful and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I plainely thinke neither am I ashamed to auerr it, that next to Theologie, there is no Arte comparable with Musicke: for it alone next to Theologie doth effect that, which otherwise onely Theologie can performe, that is, a quiet and a chearefull minde. Now if Musicke merites so high a place, as this holy man hath giuen it, can wee deny loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, that with their grace and bounty raise the professors thereof? Or to whome shal we that labour in this qualitie, better recommend our workes, then to our patrones and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors? Receiue therefore (most honoured Knight and my worthiest Patrone) the fruites of your bounties and the effects of those quiet dayes, which by your goodnes I haue enioyed. And as the glory of a new finisht house belonges not so much to the Worke-man that built it, as to the Lord that owes it, so if any part of this new worke of mine can excite commendation, the grace is chiefly yours, though the labour mine. But because there is no man more distrustfull of his owne endeuours then I am my selfe, by the weakenes of my nature: I beseech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my labours howsoeuer into your protection, whose worth can best countenance the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from misfortune, &amp; spirit defend them, I will onely assist you with a poore mans bounty, I meane my many humble prayers to the highest protector, beseeching him to blesse you with long life and prosperity to his glorie and our comforts, that must euer owe you our seruice and loue.</p>
