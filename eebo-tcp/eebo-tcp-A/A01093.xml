            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

offer vnto your censure, this vnperfect worke, as matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
for your more reserued time: wherein, I nothing

graces, which he hath bestowed vpon him for that purpose. And this
we may plainely see, euen in those holy Instruments, that haue been the
writers of the holy</hi> Scriptures: <hi>how, as God had endowed them with
their seueral gifts, so he likewise appointed them to their seueral works:

disposed their affections, to serue the Church of God, with all their best
indowments and endeauors; and euery one of them (according to that
Talent, which God hath giuen vnto him) to helpe to build it vp, in
true piety and religion. So that, they all of them being ioynt-laborers

            <p>The same <hi>Prouidence</hi> (still carefull for the good of the Church)
hath continually raysed vp, throughout all succeeding ages, many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and wise, and industrious Pastors, to instruct and teach his Church,
in true piety and godlinesse: some by preaching, some by writing, and
some by both. But yet, in no Age, hath God shed out all the riches of his
blessings, both of <hi>Wisedome,</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> and all his <hi>high Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi>
more graciously and plentifully, than in this Age of ours. For,
what learning, or what knowledge hath God euer bestowed vpon any
of all the preceding ages, which he hath not greatly amplified and inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in this of ours? Yea, and that to high degrees.</p>
            <p>And, as he hath in this our Age, bestowed vpon many men, great
variety of Gifts, so hath hee also designed them to great variety of
workes. To some he hath giuen <hi>diuersitie of Tongues,</hi> and those hee
hath called to examine <hi>Translations:</hi> to some, skill in disputing, and
those he hath called to labour in <hi>Controuersies:</hi> to some, a faculty in
Exhortation and Teaching, and those he hath called to instruct men by
Preaching. And thus, as God hath dispensed his gifts diuersly; so hath
he assigned men their Prouinces accordingly: to one after one manner,
and to another after another; appoynting vnto euery one, that, <hi>as he
hath receiued the gift,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>So that, now (God be praysed) the Church of Christ goeth vp on all

Whose worke, though in view, it be lesse honorable then therest;
yet, is it in vse, as profitable as the best: yea, and of so great necessity,
to the perfecting of the building; that, as in temporall building, the

those foure maine Corner-stones, which vphold (like foure pillars) the
whole frame of the Church. I meane, the first, foure principles of all
Religion: namely, <hi>That there is a God. That there is but one
God. That Iehovah our God, is that one God.</hi> And, <hi>That the
holy Scripture is the word of that God.</hi> These vnder-groundworks,
hath it pleased diuine prouidence, to assigne me for my taske. So
that, whilst other men doe so are aloft, like Eagles in the ayre; I must
creepe heere below, like a worme vpon the earth. But yet, let no man
despise the basenesse of this worke; because it is about the <hi>Basis</hi> of the
Church. For, the worke of the foundation, though it be in sight, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
worke belonging to the building, yet, is it not the least, but in truth,
the very greatest; as being the whole support and stay of all the rest,
euen of the very highest: A Worke which requireth both the skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
head, and the cunningest hand, vnto the doing of it; if it be done
as it ought.</p>
            <p>And therefore, I could haue wished, that some excellent Maister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workman,
more plentifully abounding, both in leisure, and learning,
would haue taken it vponhim. The worke is due to such:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 10.</note> yea, and our
Church hath store of such (Gods name be praysed for it.) But yet, no
man (that I see) hath set his hand vnto it. Many worke vpon the
walls, to make them firme and strong: many vpon the roofe, to keepe
<pb facs="tcp:22084:5"/>
it close and tight: many vpon the pillars, to erect and straighten
them exactly, <hi>ad perpendiculum:</hi> some pariete and smooth it: some
painte and adorne it; some furnish,<note place="margin">Cic. Orat. 3. in Verrem. p. 79.</note> and garnish it with beautifull pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>like apples of gold, in pictures of siluer.</hi> But yet, no man
looketh downe into the ground-worke of it,<note place="margin">Prou. 25. 11.</note> that it be layd so low, as to
reach vnto the Rocke. Whereby there is a space left, for pioners and
vnder-miners, and such like deceitfull workers, which are not able to
breake through the wall, yet do dig vnder the foundation, and so to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
all. And therefore I haue aduentured vpon this great taske, though
farre vnequall to it; hoping that the the <hi>same Spirit</hi> which hath giuen
me <hi>the will,</hi> will also assist me in the worke, in some measure, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

            <p>The <hi>Difficulty</hi> of the worke, ariseth from hence, that this Argument
now intended to be handled by me, is the most deserted part of all <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie;</hi>
and wherein the fewest <hi>Diuines</hi> haue bestowed their paines.
For, whereas there be but two wayes, to bring men vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

namely, <hi>Creatura, and Seriptura,</hi>

the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Word:</hi> there haue so many men laboured in
this latter, that, for number, almost they be without number: but, in
the former part, so few, that they likewise, in comparison, be number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
too. Some few, I confesse, haue written before me, of this matter:
but none at all in this manner: as I leaue it to be iudged by the wise and
learned. So that, I may truely take vp that excuse for all incident er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
which Lucretius doth, euen in this very case, that,
<q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22084:6"/>
The naturall <hi>Difficulty</hi> of the Argument, hath deterred the most
men from writing vpon it: and the paucitie of such writers, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
a second difficulty vnto me. Those whom I haue seene to haue
written vpon this Theme (for I goe not beyond the compasse of mine
owne Library) are onely these following. <hi>Aquinas contra Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;
Raymundus de Sabunde, in Theologia naturali; Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardinus
de Causa Dei;</hi> and <hi>Valesius de sacra Philosophia.</hi> But
these foure, dealing onely <hi>Scholastically,</hi> by way of Logicall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which doe not <hi>influere,</hi> they cannot affect, nor leaue any great
impression in the mind of a man but (as the Orator aptly censureth
such short and sharpe conclusions) <hi>Haec spinosiora, prius vt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teamur

               <hi>quam vt assentiamur. Such thorny and
prickly conclusions of Logique, do rather inforce men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
them, then induce men to beleeue them.</hi> There is further,
<hi>Augustinus Eugubinus;</hi> who in his Booke <hi>de perenni Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi>
hath laboured in this Theme, with singular learning, congesting
out of <hi>Poets, Philosophers,</hi> and <hi>Orators,</hi> an incredible masse of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
and Sentences. But as the fore-named Authors delt onely by
argument, without any testimony; so dealeth he mostly by testimony,
without any argument. There is yet further, <hi>Ludouicus Viues, de
veritate Fidej Christianae;</hi> and <hi>Philippus Mornaeus,</hi> of the same
both argument and inscription<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Zanchius</hi> also, <hi>de Operibus Dej;</hi>
and the <hi>Second Part</hi> of the Booke of <hi>Resolution:</hi> all which haue
done learnedly, in their seuerall kindes. But yet, for those heads, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
in this Book, I doe principally insist, they passe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r them so
sleightly, and perstringe them so briefely, that all of them may be truly
affirmed, to haue beene, by those Authors, rather touched, then hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
It hath beene mine endeauour, so to temper my writing, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Authorities should lacke their arguments; nor arguments their
Authorities; nor the Reader store of both. And yet in vsing the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of those fore-named Authors, I haue entertayned this course: that
whatsoeuer any of them hath prolixely handled, that haue I either who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pretermitted, or (at the most) but lightly touched. What they haue
pretermitted, that haue I sought out (so farre as I could) and more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously
inlarged. Whereby neither their writings shalbe preiudiced by
mine, nor mine thought a <hi>Plagium</hi> out of theirs: and yet the Reader
be inriched by the store of both of vs. And this hath also bred a <hi>third</hi>
difficulty vnto me. A <hi>fourth</hi> there groweth likewise from the destinate

end, and scope of this worke: which is, to compell the Heathens to
preach the truth of Christians; and <hi>Philosophy</hi> to proue the grounds
of <hi>Diuinity:</hi> yea and to inforce, by strength of Argument, both <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi>

            <p>Now secondly, for the <hi>Variety</hi> of this Worke; that is such, and so
great, as none other could come neare it; if it were handled as it should.
For, this Worke intreateth both of God, and all his Workes; which
containe all those <hi>varieties,</hi> which God and Nature yeeldeth. In <hi>God</hi>
there commeth to be considered, all those diuine properties, which hee
hath adumbrated in any of his creatures; his <hi>Simplicity,</hi> his <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi>
his <hi>Immensity,</hi> his <hi>Eternity,</hi> his <hi>Strength,</hi> his <hi>Wisedome,</hi>
his <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> his <hi>Dominion,</hi> his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> his <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
and his <hi>Omnipraesence;</hi> and such like; thinges incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
in themselues, but yet such, as may in part be sufficiently
vnderstood, by that shadowy resemblance of them, which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto our soules. In his <hi>Creatures,</hi> there commeth to be discussed,
both the <hi>little World,</hi> with all the faculties of his body, and all the
powers of his mind; and the <hi>great World,</hi> with all his most excellent
and glorious parts; the <hi>Heauens,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Seas,</hi> and all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
creatures contained in all these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea and the admirable working
of Gods diuine prouidence, both in <hi>making,</hi> and <hi>preseruing,</hi> and in
<hi>ruling</hi> of al of them. Which (as euery simple man may easily see) be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the greatest <hi>Variety</hi> that can be. In all which points, I haue
giuen the Reader so much taste as may delight him, yet not to glut him.
For the full handling of them, would both be nauseous vnto him, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
vnto me, and supersluous vnto both of vs; a meere deviation
from the scope of this worke; and in it selfe an attempt, not onely fond,

When I consider the Heavens, the worke of thy handes, the

Fourthly, as concerning the <hi>Necessity</hi> of it: Looke what absolute
necessity the work of the foundation hath, vnto all the rest of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
the same (and no lesse) hath the proofe of these Propositions,
vnto all the other parts of Religion: For let but these foure positions
be substantially proued; <hi>That there is a God: That there is but one
God: That Iehovah our God, is that one God: And that the
Scripture is the Word of that God:</hi> and then all the other parts of
Religion, in the whole Scripture contained, are soundly supported and
vpheld. For then it will follow of it selfe, that <hi>whatsoeuer is in the
whole Scripture prescribed, it ought to be obeyed, as the very
word of God.</hi> But (on the other side) let either all, or any of these po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
be disproued; <hi>That either there is no God;</hi> or, <hi>That there
is not onely one; or, That I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hovah is not that one;</hi> or, <hi>That
the Scripture is not his word:</hi> and then all Religion must needes
presently fall downe, as an house that lacketh his foundation. So that,
whether we consider the difficulty of this work in respect of the writer;
or the <hi>Variety, Vtility,</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> of it, in respect of the Reader:
it will (as I hope) be no labour ill spent, to bestow some time in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it.</p>
            <p>And yet I doubt not (courteous Reader) but this my labour and
indeauour will, of some men, be esteemed to be needelesse, and redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant:
that in this so cleere a light and sun-shine of the Gospell, I should
goe about to proue those grounded principles of Religion, which so
long haue beene receiued without all contradiction: the very seeking
to proue the vndoubted truth of them, carrying with it (in shew) a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
doubting of them; at the least wise, a calling of their truth into
question, which hath hitherto beene questionlesse amongst all good and
sound Christians.</p>
            <p>I represent the whole Obiection in his true and proper forme, as it
formerly hath beene represented vnto me by some, neither ill-learned,

            <p>And yet, for the better remouing of the fore-alledged Exception,

out of their minds, all those scrupulous exceptions, which (by

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>First therefore, as concerning the fore-named Exception, <hi>That all
these foure Positions, which are the subiect of this Treatise, be
already amongst vs sufficiently beleeued; and that therefore it
is superfluous to call them now to be proued:</hi> Vnto this Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
I answer three things. First, that the principall scope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of this Booke, is, rather to conuince those that beleeue them not,
then to confirme those that beleeue them. Though <hi>this</hi> also be intended
as a secondary end, as it likewise is, in <hi>the Creatures of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> But
the <hi>prime end</hi> of this Worke, is, to confute all those, which either dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
against Gods <hi>Essence and being,</hi> as the direct <hi>Atheist</hi> doth; or,
against his <hi>Prouidence and gouerning,</hi> as the <hi>Epicure</hi> doth, who
is an indirect <hi>Atheist:</hi> and to proue both of these to be men, not onely
destitute a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all Piety and Religion, but also of common sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And further, to shew vnto those acute <hi>Naturalists,</hi> who hold it a
seruility to be led with brutish-beleeuing, and will therefore entertaine
no more of Religion then they find to be consonant vnto Reason; that
<hi>here</hi> they may find reason for their <hi>Religion.</hi> All which seuerall kinds
and degrees of <hi>Atheists,</hi> it is not more incongruous for me to confute,
amongst beleeuing <hi>Christians,</hi> then it was for the <hi>Psalmist</hi> to confute
the same,<note place="margin">Psal. 14. 1. &amp;</note> amongst beleeuing <hi>Iewes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 53. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But secondly, I answer, that my conceite is too shallow to sound the
depth of that bottomlesse reason, <hi>That it should not bee lawfull to
prooue those Positions, because they bee already beleeued of
Christians.</hi> For if it were not lawfull to proue those points of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
which are now already accepted and beleeued; then (if we will
proue any thing) we must euery day bring forth a new <hi>Creed.</hi> For the
<hi>old</hi> may not be proued, because it is approued. And then were the
writings of the most <hi>Diuines,</hi> both <hi>ancient and recent,</hi> to be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
For, what poynt of Diuinity doth any of them proue, in all their
writings, but that which was before admitted, and approued by all good
and sound Christians? Is it not lawfull to prooue the Articles of our
<hi>Creed,</hi> because they be already beleeued? or, is it lawfull to proue all
the rest; and is it not lawfull to proue the first? Is it lawfull to proue,
<pb facs="tcp:22084:9"/>
that our Sauionr <hi>was conceiued by the holy Ghost? borne of the
Virgin Mary? suffered vnder Pontius Pilate? &amp;c.</hi> And is it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to proue that <hi>There is a God? That he is our Father? That he
is Almighty?</hi> and, <hi>That he is the Maker of heauen and earth?</hi>
What strange infelicity is fallen vpon this one Article (which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ground and support of all the rest) that to seeke to proue <hi>it</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
reprehension, when to proue <hi>all the other</hi> deserueth commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
I cannot reach (I say) the profoundnesse of this Reason.</p>
            <p>But, thirdly, I answer: that it is a false position, That either all, or
any one of these foure fore-named positions, is so generally and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
beleeued, as that it hath no need, to be proued and confirmed.
For, there be but too too many men that haue their beleefe so vnperfect
in all of them, that it is mingled with much haesitation, doubting, and
wauering: so that, the best of them may say with him in the Gospell,

men now doe almost at euery table. But yet this againe is very worthy
obseruation; that all this sharpenesse of wit, and abundance of learning,
is oftentimes abused, but onely to dispute, and make Obiections against
God. So that he taketh himselfe for the ioylliest fellow, that can shewe
himselfe best able to make some witty Obiection against the Bible: thus
abusing the great gifts of their wit and vnderstanding, euen against
God himselfe, who is the giuer of them.</p>

is grounded, not so much vpon <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as it is vpon the
opinion of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> And yet such is the <hi>Atheisme</hi> of this our time.
That which men at the first (like good Christians) receiued with the
simplicity of beleeuing; they now (being growne vnto greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
<pb facs="tcp:22084:10"/>
desire to haue prooued, with the subtilty of disputing: else,
will they beleeue nothing. The greatnesse of mens wits sharpneth
many of them on, to see all things prooued by arguments, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
vnto sense. The Scriptures (with many) haue lost
their authority: and are thought onely fit for the ignorant, and
idiote: The World now swelling with an opinion of learning, though
it be indeede, in such men, but onely an opinion; yea, and that, a
very false one. For (as the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath very truely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
them) <hi>Wherein they professe themselues to be wise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21. 22.</note> 
               <hi>therein

<hi>visibly be seene by the creation of the world;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 20.</note> 
               <hi>or, to beleeue
that the world was neuer created, because we see not visibly the
first creation of it</hi> This, though such vaine men doe conceite and
accompt to be their <hi>wisedome:</hi> yet is it indeed their palpable folly:
yea and that not onely in the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> iudgement, but also in
the iudgement of the very Heathen Poet, who calleth such mens
doubting, <hi>rationis egestatem, the very beggery of reason.</hi>

               </q>
Yea as thicke and grosse a folly, as if a man looking vpon some goodly
building, should professe, hee would not beleeue that it euer had beene
made; because he himselfe did not see the making of it. For, how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
they?</p>
            <p>Therefore it is but an erroneous opinion, to thinke, that either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Christians there can be no Atheists; or, that secret Atheists are
not to be convinced, as well as the publique: or, that the principles of
Religion are beleeued of all, by whom they bee confessed: or that they
ought not to be prooued vnto those men, of whom they bee already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued.
All these (I say) be very great errors, but especially the
first. For beside the two fore-named sorts of Atheists, the one both
inword, and heart denying God; the other in word confessing him,
but in heart renouncing him; there is yet a third sort of them (yea and
those euen amongst Christians) who though both in word and in heart
they confesse him, yet doe they <hi>in their workes deny him.</hi> They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

               <hi>They
professe they know God, but by workes they deny him.</hi> Yea,
and his censure is approued, euen by the Heathen Poet: who sentenceth
all wicked, and licencious liuers, to bee no better, then a kinde of prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
Atheists.

<hi>obtorto collo, will they nill they,</hi> vnto God. Which, I hope, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
(I am sure indeauoured) in this Booke. Wherein, the first sort
of those Atheists, which deny <hi>there is a God;</hi> are forc't, by strength of
reason, to confesse that, they denied. The second sort of them, which
confesse there is a God, and yet beleeue it not; are taught to beleeue,
that which they haue confessed. The third sort of them, which both
beleeue, and confesse him, and yet haue no care to worship, or obey
him; are heere taught, to liue as they doe beleeue. So that, this
Booke hath great vse, towards all those sorts of Atheists, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
not these positions. Yea, and no lesse (I hope) likewise, towards
those that beleeue them. For those true and sound Christians, which
both confesse the truth, and beleeue as they confesse, and liue as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
it notably confirmeth, both in their true faith, and in their good

euen the Lambe may wade ouer them.</hi> And therefore the worke (as
I hope) will not be without his fruite, neither towards the Infidels, nor
yet towards Christians; neither towards the Learned, nor towards
the Vnlearned: which was the doubt of some men (themselues not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned)
as concerning the Subiect and Argument of this Booke.</p>
            <p>It therefore now remayneth, that, hauing giuen satisfaction vnto
such, as haue obiected against the matter of my writing, I should now
likewise indeauour to remoue those Exceptions, which some haply
<hi>may</hi> take against the Manner of it.</p>
            <p>As first, it may be, that some Man, will except; that there is in this
Booke so much <hi>Philosophie,</hi> and so little <hi>Diuinitie.</hi> Whereunto I
breifely answer; that with those Aduersaries, against whom I am cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to deale in this Booke, the <hi>Diuinity</hi> of Christians hath much lesse au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
then the <hi>Philosophie</hi> of Heathens; naturall Reason a much
higher place, then supernaturall Religion; and the writings of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
much greater credit, then the holy Scriptures. So that (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the nature of those Aduersaries) there is more cause of exception
that here is so much Diuinity, then that there is so little. And yet euen <hi>for</hi>
this also, there is a iust Apologie: That this is done, <hi>ex abundante,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to confirme those that beleeue, then to informe those that beleeue
not: that so the Booke may not be without his profit, whether it light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of Christians, or of Pagans.</p>
            <p>Some againe (it may be) will except, <hi>That such a multitude of
Testimonies are congested to one purpose.</hi> But that hath many
vses, to the profit of the Readers. For first, The Matter questioned, is, by
multitude of Testimonies more substantially proued. Secondly, though
those Testimonies alledged, be by me often applyed, but to mine owne
present purpose: yet may the learned, Reader make manifold vse of
them, vnto diuers other purposes: and so in their varietie, haue choise
and election to take, or to leaue, as will best serue his turne. So that the
writers <hi>store,</hi> ought not to be accompted the Readers <hi>sore:</hi> if but in this
respect. But thirdly, though many be alledged to one and the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
yet may it be obserued, by the indicious Reader, that they doe not
all proceed by one and the same tenor: but that (for the most part) eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one bringeth some thing that the other had not: which may serue
the attentiue Reader, either for the better confirmation, or the clearer
illustration of the point, then in quaestion. Finally, if they will needs
haue this to bee the writers error; yet may I defend my selfe, with
<pb facs="tcp:22084:12"/>
that same excuse, wherewith<note place="margin">Quintil. lib. 10. c. 1. p. 575.</note> 
               <hi>Quintilian</hi> defendeth <hi>Stesicorus:</hi> that,
<hi>Id si est reprehendendum, est tamen nisi Copiae vitium.</hi> Which
though it hath made the Booke some what bigger: yet hath it also (I
hope) made it better.<note place="margin">Athenaeus. lib. 3. p. 55.</note> So that I am the lesse fearefull of <hi>Callimachus</hi>
his censure, that, <hi>Magnus Liber, est magno malo par. A great
Booke is little better then a great euill.</hi> Yea and so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because in those sentences I haue made choise of mine Authors, not
corrading out of all <hi>promiscue,</hi> and <hi>sine delectu,</hi> but taking only such
as are both ancient, and Classicall, as well <hi>Seculars,</hi> as <hi>Diuines.</hi> In
citing of whose Testimonies, I haue not alledged them all pariter, as they
stand in their Author: but (leauing out all exorbitant and heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Clauses, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itted not my purpose) I haue taken onely so much as
was properly incident vnto mine owne ends, and hindered not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
and roundnesse of the speech: yet alwayes, with this care, neither
to wrest, nor wrong the sense of the Author.</p>
            <p>Some againe may except, against the citing of mine Authors so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly;
Booke, Chapter, and Page; as carrying with it, some touch (or
at least, some shew) of Vanitie. But, vnto that I answer that it was not
to ostentate, and make shew of mine owne reading (which it greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth
me to be so little) but to helpe my Reader with it, such as it is:
not envying his profit, but seeking, with all my best endeauour, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it. And indeed, I haue alwayes esteemed it a great ouersight, yea
and a kinde of vnkindenesse, in any writer, in the citing of his Authors,
to send his Reader to seeke in an indefinite compasse, when as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
can direct him vnto the definite place: by that meanes also, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating,
the very end and purpose of his owne paines in writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
is, onely to increase his Reader in all knowledg and vnderstanding. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
Whereas in the citing of those Authors, I doe oftentimes allude
but in a word or two, vnto many great Matters, which in the Authors
themselues are set downe more prolixly: this directing of my Reader
vnto the plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> so particularly, will oftentimes serue him in stead of a
Commentarie, storing him to euery purpose, with a great deale of more
matter, then I haue extracted out of the Author.</p>
            <p>And yet, no man is hereby tyed vnto the same edition of the Authors
that by my selfe is vsed. I doe but only direct them, which haue the same
editions, how to make more ready vse of them. As for those that haue
them not, I haue noted, not onely the Author, but the Booke also, and
the Chapter: and so come as neere them, as I could possibly imagine.</p>

Another Exception may perhaps be also taken: <hi>That Verses bee
sometimes cited, and yet not as verses.</hi> But this may be defended,<note place="margin">Fraz, Poet. pag. 141. Versorum pro versuum.</note>
with that excuse of <hi>Laberius,</hi> that, <hi>Versorum non numerorum
numero studuimus. I therein followed rather the power of the
sense, then the number of the syllables.</hi>

            <p>Some againe may except that Greeke writers are not cited in their
owne proper language. Whereunto I answer: First, that the weight of
those Testimonies, which I haue taken out of them, doth seldome, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
rest vpon the proprietie of the Greeke word or phrase: but mostly
vpon the matter, and the sense. Secondly, that if it did: yet the credit
of the Translator hath no lesse authoritie, then any Nomenclator, or
Dictionarie maker, but rather much greater: Because, hee is led vnto
his translation; by exactly perpending the true weight of euery word as
it is in that place vsed, rendring it most properly out of the congruitie
of those circumstances that he hath before considered, both in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teceding
and succeeding passages: which are the best directions, and
cannot be considered by the bare reciter of the words in their seuerall
significations. But thirdly, and lastly (which stoppeth all reply) I haue
cited those Authors, as I had them: contenting my selfe with the vse
of those Booke, which were onely mine owne, and in mine owne posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
not affecting to be curious, either in this, or in any thing else which
tendeth not directly vnto the profit of my Readers.</p>
            <p>Againe it may be obiected; that the Sentences alleadged are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
translated.<note place="margin">Aul. G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the opinion of an excellent Criticke And the Poet telleth vs, that hee

            <p>Againe, yet an other, <hi>That I haue not alwayes cited them to the
meaning of the Author.</hi> To which I likewise answer: That, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
I produce them, as Testimonies for the confirmation of the point
then in question, I cite them exactly, vnto the Authors meaning. But
<pb facs="tcp:22084:13"/>

commodious expressing of mine owne sense and meaning. A thing very
vsuall and familiar with <hi>Plutarch;</hi> whose character, and forme of stile
I haue (in that point) propounded to imitate.</p>
            <p>Finally, it may be, that some men will except against the publishing
of this first part alone, before the rest be ready: in putting vnto me, the
incurious error of <hi>Curio</hi> the Orator.<note place="margin">Cic. in. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

First the example of very many learned men; whom wee dayly
obserue to practice the same, and to propine vnto their Readers

If I haue to doe with Christians, I shall quickly proue the cause: But if
with infidels and Pagans, I scorne to lose my paynes. Not that I am in doubt to
be defectiue in my proofe, but that I am out of doubt not to speake vnto their
profit. For it needs must be an idle and vnprofitable labour, when the proofe is
not receiued by the euill disposed Auditor.</hi> This was the resolution of that

And therefore, the best way of preuailing with them, will be, onely to vrge
such Arguments vnto them, as haue passage amongst them; and such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,

that <hi>That is a God:</hi> For that would be but a foolish kinde of proofe. It
would be meerely idle, to call vpon our Aduersaries to heare an Argument,
<hi>from Authoritie:</hi> and then to cite such Testimonies, as with them haue none
<hi>authoritie:</hi> This would make the cause ridiculous. But if we wil preuaile either

so much vpon hope to doe any great good vpon the <hi>Atheist</hi> with them, by
pressing directly their <hi>Authoritie</hi> vnto him, as indirectly to grow somewhat
vpon him, by an Artificiall circumduction of him: and that by these two
reasons following.</p>
               <p>First, because of my often allegation of the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> consenting so
fully with other Heathen writers, the <hi>Atheist</hi> may the better be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne;
that there is an vniuersall agreement, and a generall consent of the
whole world, against him; both of <hi>Christians, Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Pagans:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
see more plainely, his owne nakednes and pouertie; how bare, and weake,
yea how desolate he is, and vtterly forsaken, both of God, and men: and
by that meditation, be more easily drawne, to apprehend the singular follie
of that his singular opinion: which hath made him such a <hi>spectacle,</hi> both
to <hi>Angels, God, and Men:</hi> as it were some vncouth monster. And so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he is.<note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. p. 13 39.</note> For, <hi>Magnum est ipse prodigium, qui, mundo credente, non credit</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Augustine) He is</hi> (surely) <hi>some great Monster, that will abide in
Atheisme, when he seeth the whole world to beleeue, beside him.</hi> So that, in
this respect, the allegation of the Scriptures, will not be meerely idle, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the very <hi>Atheists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, nor yet in an other: which is the second reason of my so frequent
alledging them. And that is, because the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> (beside that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
authoritie, which is naturally inhaerent in them) doe oft-times, carry
also great strength of reason with them: which inforce many points more
strongly and effectually, against the <hi>Atheists,</hi> then the acutest reasons,
brought by any of the Philosophers. As that of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> for the
proofe of Gods omniscience:<note place="margin">Psal. 94. 9.</note> and that he needs must (of congruitie) both
heare, and see all things. <hi>He that planted the Eare, shall he not heare? and he
that formed the Eye, shall he not see?</hi> What Philosopher in the world could
more necessarily conclude, from the true and proper causes of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
then the <hi>Scripture</hi> here hath done? And diuers such places of the
<hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> the Reader shall meete with, throughout this whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise;
which presse, yea, and euen oppresse, the <hi>Atheists</hi> with the weight
of their Reason: howsoeuer the weight of their Authoritie be eleuated by
them. For though those sacred Authors haue but small authoritie with
<hi>Atheists,</hi> speaking as meere Witnesses: yet, when their Testimonies carry
with them also reasons, those reasons must be answered, if they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their cause. And if they cannot answer them, they must then yeeld
vnto them: which is the second reason of my so often citing them.</p>
               <p>Now vnto these two reasons, in respect of the <hi>Atheists,</hi> I may also adde a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:22084:25"/>
third, in respect of <hi>Christians.</hi> And that is, that by this allegation of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
&amp; other the most learned Ecclesiasticall Writers, euen <hi>Christians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
will be the better confirmed, in those points of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> which
are by them affirmed. For when they see these doctrines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are chiefly
here prooued by naturall reasons, and by Heathen mens authorities; yet not
to rest wholly and onely vpon them; but to be such, as haue both <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Fathers</hi> to approue them; it must needes much confirme them in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
Faith: yea, and that a great deale more, for the simple authority of the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> themselues, then for the strongest reasons of all the learnedest Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.
For this Authority alone, without any reason,<note place="margin">Illorum autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas est omni rationabili fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultate validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. Nazian. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. 47. p. 770.</note> ouer-swayeth both all

both many and weighty.</p>
               <p>First, because in euery disputation, both the disputants must consent, in
two generall agreements: else they can neuer bring the matter, then in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
vnto determination. The first of them, is this: That they must both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in certaine grounds and principles, which are common vnto both. For,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22084:26"/>
as two cannot talke together,<note place="margin">Qui sermonem invicem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municaturi sunt, oportet vt ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatenus invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem intellig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which they both vnderstand: so cannot two dispute together, except they
haue some one common principle, in which they both consent. Now those
principles and grounds, must not be principles of Religion; but of Reason.
Not of Religion; because that is proper, but vnto the one part: but yet of
Reason; because that is common vnto them both. The second generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
wherein they must consent, is, Who shall be their <hi>Iudge,</hi> and vnto
whom they will submit, and vnto whose decision they will referre all their
Question, as to a man impartiall, and indifferent betweene them? Now that
cannot be the <hi>Scripture:</hi> but it must be Heathen Writers. To the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
the <hi>Atheist</hi> will neuer submit; because then his cause is lost: but to the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
the <hi>Christian</hi> may submit; and yet his cause be gained. For, the truth
that is spoken by the most heathenish of the Heathens, yet can neuer bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the truth of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Two lies and vntruthes, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
one another; but two truthes can neuer. So then, the <hi>Heathens</hi> being
made <hi>Iudges</hi> of this cause, and admitted, as indifferent, by consent of both
parties; there can no other testimonies be so apt, and so proper, to inforce a
conclusion, as those that be produced from the writings of the Heathen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because the writings of the Heathens (beside the great credit,
and authority which they haue with our Aduersaries) haue also greater store
of artificiall Arguments, to satisfie both naturall reason, and sense: Whereas
<hi>Scripture,</hi> for the most part, presseth rather the <hi>Conscience,</hi> by virtue of that
diuine authority, which it hath naturally in it, then leadeth our <hi>science,</hi> by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
out of it. Sometimes it also argueth, and that very excellently, as
before I haue instanced: but this very rarely, relying most commonly vpon
his owne natiue authority.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Sect. 2. before.</note> because (if we seeke to conuert <hi>Atheists</hi>) the testimony of their
owne Writers haue with them farre greater force and power of perswasion,
then the Testimony of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> be they neuer so plaine. And therefore
(saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) that <hi>De suis instrumentis,</hi>

<hi>by them that oppose the truth.</hi> Not that the <hi>Atheists</hi> do giue credit to the
<hi>Heathens,</hi> any more then to vs <hi>Christians,</hi> in their direct assertion and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of God, (for therein they hold vs both to bee equally vnequall vnto

<hi>Axioms,</hi> belonging to Philosophy, and to other humane Arts, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

it will follow as necessarily, that there needes must bee <hi>A God,</hi>
as if they had affirmed it, in direct and expresse words; as I purpose (God
willing) to make plaine, in the second of these Bookes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, because (if we seeke to confute the <hi>Atheists</hi>) the testimonies of
the Heathens are the fittest meanes;<note place="margin">Lactan. l. 1. c. 6. p. 17.</note> that so we may, <hi>eos suorum testimonijs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincere,</hi>

which is the strongest conuiction,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Hom. 3. in Tit. Tom. 4. p. 1614.</note> that can fall vpon them: as is truely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,

in sunder that band of prophane and wicked <hi>Atheists,</hi> which band them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

compelled the wicked <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>

Which weighty and important reasons, of my so frequent alledging of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane

that <hi>God vpholdeth all his workes, both without them, and within them:</hi> so is it

               </p>
               <p>The first Argument then, to proue <hi>There is a God,</hi> is an internall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and that is taken from a naturall and inbred conclusion, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ingrafted into the hearts of all men; that surely <hi>There is a God.</hi> This is
the most ancient and generall praenotion, that Nature hath begotten in the
mind of a man. Which naturall perswasion, though it be both bred and borne
together with vs; yet must it needs be a syence of Gods owne planting in vs.
For if it be true, which is affirmed by <hi>Seneca,</hi> that, <hi>Insita sunt nobis omnium
artium semina, sed Magister ex occulto Deus, producit ingenia: That it is God,
that hath implanted in the soule of a man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Senec. lib. 4. De Benfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the first seedes and principles of other
humane Arts:</hi> then must hee needes much more haue implanted in him this
first seede and principle of all religion, which is the proper Art of Gods holy
worshipping: an Art, of which himselfe is the true and onely Obiect. For <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
is nothing else,<note place="margin">Laert. vita Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonis p. 248.</note> but onely <hi>scientia Diuini cultus: an arte of worshipping
God aright,</hi> as <hi>Zeno</hi> rightly defineth it.</p>
               <p>And therefore, it is not probable, that hee, which hath replenished the soule
of a man, with those notions and conceptions, that are the first seedes of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arts and Sciences, should onely leaue out that which belongeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
But howsoeuer the Atheist be perswaded in this point, that this inward
perswasion is implanted by God, or not; yet can he not deny, but that there
is in mans heart such an inward perswasion: because, all the world confesseth
it, euery mans experience teacheth it; and all learned men, both of <hi>Christians</hi>
and <hi>Heathens,</hi> doe both know, and acknowledge it.</p>

hath his Religion; not any People in the world, but that they haue
their God.</hi> Let vs now come to see, how this saying can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
For, it is easie to say any things. But those things that
are sayd, if they be not duly proued, may, with the same facilitie be reiected,
that they be affirmed. So that, we cannot, in equitie, exacte a beleefe, where
we doe not exhibite (if not en exact) yet a competent proofe. But in this
case now present, easie proofe will be competent. For, it requiring nothing
of vs, but an historicall faith, we neede exacte no more, but an historicall
proofe: because historicall positions, are sufficiently proued by historicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations.
Why then, the highest proofe that wee can vse in this case,
is to confirme it by the testimonie, of either such <hi>Historiographers</hi> as

men: yea and both of these two writers haue deliuered vnto vs, not onely a

either ancient or moderne, that euer the sinne of <hi>Atheisme</hi> ouerspred any

beene any <hi>nation of Atheists,</hi> throughout the whole world, they should surely
haue beene noted. And, if wee can neither see, nor heare, nor reade, that there
were euer any such; why should wee be so light as to beleeue there should be
such?</p>
               <p>But, because an argument from Authoritie, doth not follow negatiuely;
let vs goe one steppe further, and proue it affirmatiuely. There be published

againe vnto him their religion and that they be not of his. Or, if any be
(haply) omitted by them; it is not, because they haue no religion; but, because
their Religion is, as yet, not fully knowne. None are noted, as knowne, to be

as we may plainely see, by the commendable, and industrious Trauells, of Mr.
<hi>Richard Hackluyt,</hi> in collecting our <hi>English Voyages.</hi> Amongst which, there
is relation of two worthy Gentlemen, of this our owne nation: who haue
compassed the Globe of the whole Earth about. Which notable exploit
hath not by any other Nation, as yet, beene twice atchieued. The first of
which,<note place="margin">Eng. Voyag. vol. 3. p. 737. 738.</note> was <hi>Captaine Drake;</hi> who, in his furthest trauell vnto the <hi>North-west,</hi>
taking land in <hi>Noua Albien,</hi> he saw there the <hi>Sauages</hi> busied about a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi>
who, when they had tasted of our mens liberalitie, they supposed them to bee
Gods, and diuers times offered vnto them their sacrifices. Which they neuer
would haue done, but that both they were perswaded that <hi>There is a God:</hi>
and that, <hi>offering of sacrifice is a part of his worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second of those Gentlemen,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 819.</note> was <hi>Captaine Candish,</hi> who, in his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
trauell vnto the <hi>South-East,</hi> taking land in the <hi>Island</hi> of <hi>Capul,</hi> obserued
the Inhabitants, to be the worshippers of the <hi>Diuell.</hi> And the like may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
in diuers other of their voyages: who, euen in the furthest and most
remote parts, could neuer, as yet, finde any Nation of <hi>Atheists.</hi> They neuer
yet tooke landing, but if they once found men, they found also some religion:
which they neuer brought with them when they came; nor carried with them

Which seemeth to me little lesse then a wonder, that the <hi>Romanes,</hi> so wise and
so seuere a nation, yet should shew themselues so foolish in the vse of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
But this sedulitie of mans soule about such false gods, must needs
importe vnto vs, that it thinkes there is a true one. And thus you plainely see
by all the former instances, that there is no Nation so Barbarous, but it will
haue a God, though neuer so ridiculous. Which euidently proueth, that
this one conclusion [<hi>That there is a God.</hi>] is a generall principle, throughout
the whole world, wherein all kinde of people remaine still of one language,
euen after the generall confusion of tongues: conspiring more fully in this
one common principle, then they doe in any other, either of Art, or Nature.

by <hi>Lucian,</hi> in his booke <hi>De Sacrificijs.</hi> Which euidently proueth, that they

faculty of <hi>Poets</hi> dependeth much more vpon a diuine incitation, then either
vpon any naturall gift, or any artificiall instruction and teaching. And this
he there confirmeth, by two obseruations. The first whereof is this, that diuers
of the Poets, being (at their beginning) but very ignorant Bardes; yet haue
had on a suddaine, a notable faculty infused into them, whereby they haue
made very excellent Poems: as in the same place he instanceth in <hi>Tynnichus

whence he there collecteth, <hi>Poetas nihil esse aliud quàm Deorum interpretes:
That Poets are nothing else, but onely Gods Interpreters.</hi> The Poems they make
are his; and they, but the Reciters. <hi>Quod quidem Deus ostendere volens, de

the simplest Poët, to make the excellentest poeme.</hi> The second of his
obseruations, is this: That in all Poesie (if it be good and worthy) there
must be, not only an incitation, and commotion; but also an elocation, and
emotion of the minde. The <hi>Poet</hi> must be, <hi>extra se positus, &amp; a mente alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus.

God, that is the true cause of the making of good Lawes.</hi> Which honour is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed

                  <note place="margin">Pro. 8. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>By me Kings reigne, and

of themselues (and there is a woe pronounced against such <hi>wicked Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>)
but they cannot decree Iustice, but onely by him. So that, it is truely
sayd in <hi>Iob:</hi> that <hi>Nullus ei similis in Legistatoribus: There is none like vnto
him, amongst all the Lawgiuers.</hi> Nay, he is indeed the onely true Lawgiuer;<note place="margin">Iob. 36. 22. in. vulgata.</note>
&amp;, in the whole world, there is not another: as the Apostle S. <hi>Iames</hi> plainely
testifieth vnto vs: <hi>There is but one Lawgiuer, who is able to saue, and to destroy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ia. 4. 12</note>

<hi>Hebrewes) Statute-maker:</hi> Howsoeuer the Heathen Lawgiuers haue robbed
the true God of that honour, and ascribed it falsely vnto others. But thus you
see, that all Lawgiuers, as it were, by a compact, haue agreed together in this
common sense, to ascribe all their lawes, vnto the making of their Gods. And
therefore, none of them could possibly be <hi>Atheists,</hi> at least in outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
no not euen by <hi>their profession,</hi> in that they were Lawgiuers.</p>
               <p>Neither could the people that were vnder them be of any other dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
both because of that inward naturall instinct, which inforceth euery man
to worship some God; and because, by nature also, all Subiects are Imitators
of their rulers; and because againe, all rulers praeserue their owne Religion by
coerciue Lawes: as <hi>Iosephus</hi> instanceth in <hi>Socrates, Anaxagoras, Diagoras,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioseph l. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cont. Apion. p. 914.</note> and
<hi>Protagoras,</hi> all of them seuerally mulcted for the opinion of their impieties
against the Gods. So that, if any man would not be religious, for loue; yet
durst he not be irreligious, for feare.</p>
               <p>3 Let vs now proceede vnto <hi>Plutarch's</hi> third instance, that is,<note place="margin">All Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers beleeue that There is a God.</note> vnto <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;</hi>
and see, whether any of them haue beene <hi>Atheists.</hi> Wherein it cannot
be denied, but that those infamous persons, who haue beene noted by their
name, to be <hi>Atheists;</hi> haue, all of them, beene, by their profession, <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:22084:36"/>
But yet this againe may be truly affirmed of them: that, howsoeuer some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men of that profession, may haply haue beene infected with <hi>Atheis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me;</hi>
yet that there was neuer any <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Familie</hi> of them, but that it was of
a cleane contrary profession. There was neuer any sect of <hi>Philosophers</hi> that
were professed <hi>Atheists:</hi> No, nor yet neuer any, but professed the cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.
And yet, it cannot be dissembled, but that all the <hi>Philosophers</hi> haue
had so infinite auiditie, and appetite of glory; that none of them could say
any thing, though with neuer so great reason, but that some other would
oppose it, and hold the contrary vnto it, were it neuer so absurd. Yea, and
this fell out, as well among their whole families, as amongst priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> perpetually opposing the <hi>Epicures;</hi> the <hi>Peripatetikes,</hi> them
both; the <hi>Academikes,</hi> them all. Insomuch, that their contentions and digla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatious
grew to be so notorious, as made them all ridiculous: as that bitter
scoffe of <hi>Seneca</hi> very notably declareth; <hi>That, Faciliùs inter Philosophos, quàm

to be his God: No man denieth him, No man adorneth disputation

<hi>Protagoras</hi> himselfe, if he be rightly construed: though his words were rackt

God, without all doubt, is both the Conseruer, &amp; Creator of all things in the

there be throughout that whole Booke. Which hath occasioned some men,<note place="margin">Aristotles Booke De Mundo.</note>
to doubt of the credit and authoritie of it, as not being truly his; grounding
vpon but sleight and very weake coniectures. I may not stand to discusse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
euery Authoritie: whether the Booke then alledged be the Authors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly?
For then we should haue so many, and so great digressions, as would
turne to be transgressions. And therefore in all places, I take them, as I finde
them, without any curious or strict examination: knowing, that euen those
Bookes, which are thought to be supposed; yet are, for the most part, both
ancient, and learned: and that, if they appeared in the name of their owne
Authors, they would be no lesse approued, then they be now in theirs, vpon
whom they be fathered: as I could plentifully instance. Yea, and <hi>Viues</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectureth,<note place="margin">Lod. Viues in l. 4. Aug. De. Ciuit. Dei. c. 2. 10. 5. p. 222.</note>

               <p>Insomuch, that it may be obserued, in the most of them, that they doe not
onely retract many opinions in their age, which they defended in their youth,
but also, that almost euery sixe or seuen yeares, they betake them vnto new
opinions. Which hee ascribeth, not so much vnto the imconstancie of their
iudgement; as to a greater experience, &amp; further parefaction of the truth that
reformeth it. But yet, in this one point, of beleeuing there is a God; there is
neither difference of opinion between nation &amp; nation, profession and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
person and person; no, nor change of opinion in any singular man: but, as
all men agree in this, in all places; so doth euery man agree with himselfe, at
all times; when he is himselfe, and not, by the violence of inordinate passion,
transported out of himselfe. Onely this change we may obserue: that some
men, who in their youth haue denied God, haue changed their opinion;
and in their age confessed him: as we shall see <hi>hereafter,</hi> in a seueral Chapter.<note place="margin">Cap. 13.</note>
But no man, that in his youth confessed God, did euer change his opinion. So
that, though the <hi>Philosophers</hi> (as it were a kinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Gentile Pharisies</hi>) desire the

which, euen without his interpretation, might well be gathered by their
names. So that, there was no Arte or profession, amongst all the Heathen,
but they had both their generall and their speciall gods. And therefore
none of them could possibly be <hi>Atheists.</hi> Much lesse could those Artificers
that are professed <hi>Christians:</hi> of whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> truly writeth, that, <hi>Deum
quilibet opifex Christianus et inuenit, et ostendit. That euery Christian being a
Christian, can easily both finde out and shew forth God.</hi> Besides, it is a thing
that is worthy the noting, that, of all the Arts in the World (though there
be innumerable of them) yet there is not any one that is founded vpon
<hi>Atheisme.</hi> No Arte is grounded vpon this supposition, that <hi>There is no God;</hi>
No Arte dissolued, by beleeuing, <hi>there is a God.</hi> But many Arts and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are grounded vpon the contrary supposition; that <hi>There is a God:</hi> and
presently dissolued, by beleeuing, <hi>There is no God;</hi> as all <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,
Diuiners and Sacrificers,</hi> and all those other Arts, which either depende vpon
<hi>Temples,</hi> or <hi>Altars.</hi> All which as they haue their immediate foundation, in

in beleeuing <hi>There is no God.</hi> As we may see in <hi>Baals Priests;</hi> it being
once beleeued, that <hi>Baal</hi> was no God; you see how his Priests were all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
destroyed. And so likewise, when by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, it beganne to
be beleeued,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 24. 25. 26. 27.</note> that <hi>Diana</hi> was no goddesse; in what a feare was <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and
the rest of his Siluer-Smiths, that their Art would be dissolued? So that,
there is no Arte, which either hath his being, by beleeuing <hi>ther is no God;</hi> or,
which loseth his being, by beleeuing <hi>there is a God:</hi> but there be many Arts,
which both haue their being, by beleeuing <hi>there is a God:</hi> and which lose
their being, by beleeuing there is none. And therefore no Artist (as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist)
is fit to be an <hi>Atheist:</hi> because religion and piety is the very maintainer
of many Arts immediately; and of all the rest mediately. For all Arts haue
their very being, vpon the coalition of humane society: which if it were
dissolued, all Arts must (by consequent) of necessity perish with it. And pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
it surely would, if religion did not hinder it. For the chiefest tye, and
bond of all humane society, is neither reason, nor speech, nor indigency;
but religion, and piety. <hi>Qua sublata, confusio ac perturbatio vitae sequitur</hi>

               <p>By all which weighty Reason, both out of the Heathen writers, and out
of <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> it euidently appeareth, that all men in their swearing, both
presume, <hi>There is a God;</hi> and that he truely heareth, whatsoeuer is spoken; and
that he will reuenge him, of the impietie of those men, that by their false
swearing dishonour his holy name. And therefore, no Swearer can be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
an <hi>Atheist,</hi> euen by the very nature of his owne proper act, if hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
as he sweareth. For the very act of swearing, presupposeth there is a
God, not onely in the inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in the world. For, though in his heart, he may (haply) beleeue <hi>there
is no God:</hi> yet, in his act, he would seeme to beleeue, <hi>there is one:</hi> euen by
his action of swearing, he would haue other men to beleeue, that he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
<hi>there is one.</hi> Because, the congruitie of very Reason requireth, that he,
which sweareth by God, should certainely beleeue, that <hi>There is a God,</hi> to
by sworne by: or else he sweareth vainely. Nay, he that sweareth by God, if
he thinke that there is none, disableth the very force of his owne asseueration
For, no man would euer sweare, but to be the better beleeued for his Oath.
But, he that desireth to be beleeued for his swearing by God, if hee thinke,
<hi>There is no God,</hi> is as vtterly absurd, as if he should desire, that men should
beleeue him, when he professeth before hand, that hee sweareth <hi>by nothing:</hi>

I sweare (By nothing) that this I say is true.</hi> His iust reward in swearing by
nothing, should be to be beleeued in nothing. Thus Swearers (as you see)
if they properly be Swearers, they cannot properly be <hi>Atheists:</hi> the very
action of swearing, destroying directly the opinion of <hi>Atheisme.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">Aristoph. in Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibus. Act. 1. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is to speake any euill of good. But now commonly, Blasphemie is to speake
onely euill of God. For of Men, we may doubt, whether they be euill or good: But
of God we cannot doubt, but that he must needs be good.</hi> So that, the word <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie</hi>
hath two significations: the one a lardger, which is to <hi>speake euill of
good:</hi> the other a stricter, which is to <hi>speake euill of God.</hi> Against the first of
those Blasphemies, God hath pronounced a woe: <hi>Woe vnto them that speake

woman was stoned for blaspheming;</hi> giuing occasion very iustly, of the
making of that notable Law against Blasphemie. Wherein we may obserue,
that the Blasphemer was no <hi>Atheist.</hi> And that, by two reasons: the one
drawne from his person; the other from his action. For first, for his person: he
is sayd to haue beene the sonne of an <hi>Israelitish woman,</hi> and of an <hi>Aegyptian:</hi>
by neither of which parents hee could be instituted in <hi>Atheisme.</hi> For first,<note place="margin">Leuit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gyptians;</hi> they were so farre from being <hi>Atheists,</hi> that they were of
all other the most palpable <hi>Polytheists.</hi> And for the <hi>Israelites;</hi> though they
were the worshippers of <hi>an invisible God;</hi> yet had hee shewed amongst them
so many visible signes of his omnipotent power and goodnesse, as that hee
was confessed, euen by the very Heathens: and therefore could not be denied
by any of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> Blaspheme him they might (as this <hi>Israelite</hi> in his
furie,<note place="margin">Iosh. 2. 10. 11.</note> and impatience did) but denie him they could not; the euidence of his
wonderous workes was so great. And this is the first reason, why hee could
not be an <hi>Atheist.</hi> The second is this: that this Law against Blasphemie,
being made by occasion of this Blasphemers fact, and forbidding onely that,
which he had committed, doth euidently shew that hee was not an <hi>Atheist.</hi>
For then, the Law would haue runne against the denying of God: <hi>Whosoeuer
denieth God, let him be stoned.</hi> But, because this mans sin was not a denying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God a being (which is the sin of <hi>Atheisme</hi>) but a cursing of that God whom
he beleeued to be; therefore the law was made, not against the denying, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the cursing of God: <hi>He that blasphemeth the name of God, shall be stoned.</hi>
And therefore, <hi>blaspheming</hi> doth not suppose a denying, nor the blashemer,
vpon neccessitie, to be a denyer of God. Nay, indeede, it directly supposeth the
contrary: it supposeth there is a God: As may plainly be collected, both by the
beginning &amp; the end of that irreligious passion, which begetteth in them the
sin of blaspheming. For, first, from the beginning of their passion: it is a sodaine
anger conceiued against God, vpon a supposition, of either some euill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
from him, or of some good denied by him. For <hi>blasphemare</hi> (as <hi>Aquinas</hi>
defineth it) <hi>est contumeliam vel conuitium inferre,</hi>

                  <hi>in iniuriam Creatoris:
To blaspheme, is, to offer, either contumelie, or obloquie, by way of dishonor, vnto
the Creator.</hi> Which necessarily supposeth, that he needs must haue a being.
Otherwise, hee must needes confesse, that hee is angry with <hi>Nothing:</hi> and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:22084:42"/>
so might,<note place="margin">Homer. l. 9. Odyss. p. 66.</note> as iustly be derided, as that foolish <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> who raued for
that wrong that was done to him by <hi>Nullus.</hi> Againe, the same may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
from the ende of their passion: which is, desperately to prouoke
God to be angry with them: because they before haue beene angred by him,
and so to quitte him with his owne. Which likewise must needes inferre,
that they thinke he hath a being. For, otherwise, they should be as vtterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
as if they should endeauour to moue <hi>Nothing,</hi> vnto anger; spending all
their rayling, as foolishly against him, as the Doggs doe their barking, when
they howle against the Moone. And therefore it followeth not, that though
some men doe Blaspheme, and raile against God; that therefore they thinke
that there should he none: but rather, that there is one: Which they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
acknowledge, euen in their very rayling; vnlesse, they will make
themselues to be knowne for noted-fooles. Who would raile vpon a thing,
which they thinke to haue no being? Yea, and diuers of the Heathens were
so farre from supposing, that rayling and blaspheming should inferre, there is
<hi>no</hi> God; that they made it the essentiall worship of diuers of their gods. For
<hi>Nazianzene</hi> reporteth it of the <hi>Lindianes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nazianz. Orat. 47. p. 770.</note> that they worshipped their <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi>

<hi>Fortune: Conuitijs colitur. Shee is worshipped with rayling and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</hi>
And therefore Blasphemie doth not inferre impietie: Nor, that hee
which blasphemeth God, must of necessitie denie God. For, of necessitie hee
granteth him, though of impotencie hee blaspheme him. So that, neither
common <hi>Swearers,</hi> nor yet <hi>Blasphemers,</hi> be <hi>Atheists.</hi> That they be great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
it cannot be denied: but that they be <hi>Atheists,</hi> it cannot be affirmed.
Their sinne is not <hi>Atheisme:</hi> it is of another kind. The <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> is not
<hi>Atheus,</hi> but rather <hi>Antitheus:</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> speaketh. And his fault is not
<hi>Atheisme,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lactant. l. 2. c. 9. p. 103.</note> or lack of religion; but outrage against the true Obiect of religion.
Which yet (in a large acception) may be called <hi>Irreligion:</hi> though it bee
not a priuation of all religion; because it is an impugning of the true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

may I now, of <hi>Idolaters:</hi> that they are taught, by their profession to denie

Yet hereby it appeareth, that, euen the very Heathen, in worshipping things
of so diuers natures, were inwardly perswaded in their mindes; that the nature
of God was glorious, and therefore to be honoured; liberall, and therefore to
be loued; powerfull, and therefore to be feared: which manifestly argueth,
that they beleeued, there was a God. But, to remoue all those Obiections
at once, wherein those fore-named considerations, may seeme to be the
ground of their Religions; and, to instance where none of all these can be

                  </note> nor yet the veritie of this notion, <hi>That there is a God:</hi>
Nay, indeed it confirmes them both. For first, as concerning the generalitie
of it; that followeth, by necessitie, vpon the affirmation of the particularitie.
<hi>Qui Socratem dicit, Hominem dicit. He that affirmeth Socrates to be, hee must
needs affirme, a man to be because, Socrates is a man.</hi> And so, hee that affirmeth
either <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> or <hi>the Sun,</hi> or <hi>Moone,</hi> or <hi>Stars,</hi> or any other
particular either <hi>Person,</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> to be a God; he must needs, by consequence
affirme the generall, <hi>That there is a God.</hi> Yea, and though a thousand should
dissent, as concerning this or that particular God; yet, if euery one of them
doe name some one particular God, though he denie all the rest; yet, euen in
that one particuler, hee must needes conclude the generall, that <hi>There is a
God.</hi> As for example: if one man should say, that <hi>Socrates</hi> were no Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
but yet grant that <hi>Plato</hi> is; another, that <hi>Plato</hi> were none, but yet that
<hi>Aristotle</hi> is one; another, that <hi>not he,</hi> but <hi>Xenocrates;</hi> and so <hi>in infinitum:</hi> all
these agree in the generall, that <hi>A Philosopher there is:</hi> though they disagree
in the particular, <hi>Who he is.</hi> And so it is likewise, in the opinions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
as concerning their gods. Though they particularly denie this, or that
thing, to be God; yet, in affirming some other particular, they doe generally
affirme, that there is a diuine nature. Their dissent in destroying of this, or
that particular, doth not argue a consent, in destroying of the generall; no nor
a dissent of any one of them from that; but a generall consent in it. As well
may bee obserued, both in <hi>Tullie,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch:</hi> who, in the same sentence
and complexion of words, wherein they report the generall dissent of all men
in their particular gods; yet confesse their generall consent, in hauing of some
God. So <hi>Tullie. Multi,</hi>

barbarous Nations, who neuer had trade or commerce with them, yet to bee

barbarous Nations (abused in their ignorance) that hath dispersed it so wide:

of an <hi>Academick,</hi> doth play the part of a very <hi>Atheist.</hi> Hee bringeth this
praecognition and anticipation of God, as a very good argument, to proue,
<hi>There is a God:</hi> and <hi>he</hi> againe bringeth Exceptions against it, seeking vtterly
to disable it, playing so vpon both sides, and abusing the liberty of that licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
profession (which was to speake for and against euery thing) to the vtter
ouerthrow of all Religion. And he beginneth with the infringing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
praenotion, which is the first foundation of all piety and Religion. The
summe of his exception against it, is this. That it is, <hi>cùm leue per se, tum etiam
falsum: That it is, both a light argument, and a false.</hi> The lightnesse of it, hee
lightly ouerpasseth: but vpon the falsenesse of it, he somewhat more insisteth.
And that he seeketh to proue by these foure reasons. First, because we cannot
know the opinions of all Nations. <hi>Vnde tibi notae sunt opiniones Nationum?</hi>
Secondly, because he was verily perswaded, that there were diuers Nations,
which had no opinion of God. <hi>Multas esse gentes sic immanitate efferatas, vt

<hi>Leve,</hi> that it is <hi>but a light argument:</hi> I am sure, that this is but a light answer
vnto it. An answer, then which there cannot be a lighter: which hee would
neuer haue giuen, if he had had a better. Hee himselfe, in another place, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this argument as weighty, as here he makes it light. <hi>Firmissimum hoc est
cur Deos esse credamus: quòd nulla gens tam est fera, nemo omnium tam imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,
cuius mentem non imbuerit Deorum opinio. This is the strongest argument,
that can possibly be brought, why we should beleeue, that there is a God: because
there is no Nation so vnciuill, no person so vile, whosi mind is not possessed with
the opinion of some God:</hi> Here you see no light account made of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but a great and weighty testimony for the weightines of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
all the lightnesse is rather in the disputant, then it is in the Argument,
that turne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h off that so lightly, which he here esteemes so weighty. This is
lightnesse indeed. For if he had any weight, when he alledged it for weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
then hath not it, but he lost his weight, when he accounts so lightly of it:
contrarying his owne praeceeding iudgement. So that the same censure,
which he passeth of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> may as iustly be passed vpon himselfe: that
<hi>Quanuis fuerit acutus vt fuit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cic. l. 4. Acad. p. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>tamen inconstantia leuatur authoritas:</hi> that
<hi>though he were very witty (as he was indeed most certainely) yet by his inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
he lighted his authority.</hi> And therefore, passing ouer his <hi>Leve</hi> thus lightly,
let vs now come to his <hi>Falsitie,</hi> that it is not onely <hi>Leve,</hi> but also <hi>Falsum:</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:22084:47"/>
which may truly be affirmed to be a false Exception.</p>
               <p>But yet this he seekes to proue, by foure seuerall Arguments: vnto which
it is behooffull, to giue their seuerall answers. The first whereof is this, That
we cannot come to know the opinions of all Nations: and therefore cannot
say, that all agree in one. But, vnto this I answer, that we may as surely know
the Religions of all Nations, as they can know their Regions. For the same
meanes, which can serue to instruct vs in the one, can with the same facility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
vs in the other. For, whereby doth the <hi>Atheist</hi> know, that there be such
and such Countries, <hi>Scythians, Barbarians, Indians,</hi> and other such like Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whose eyes he neuer saw? If he answer, that he knoweth it by the credible
relations of <hi>Histories,</hi> and <hi>Trauellers,</hi> that haue seene them with their eyes:
we may answer him againe, That by the selfe same Authors wee know also
their Religions: yea, and their generall consent, in this generall ground, that
they all will haue a God:<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> as I haue already proued.</p>
               <p>Now, for his second proofe; that there be such sauage Nations, as hee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
is perswaded, not to haue so much as the least conceit of God: as hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
it very weakely, <hi>Equidem Arbitror:</hi> so he confirmes it much
more weakely,<note place="margin">Cap. 4. Sect. 1.</note> naming not so much as one; which evidently proueth,
that he had not one to name. for else, he would as well haue recited the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
names of particular Nations, as he doth, in the next, of particular persons.
And we may note the same defect in <hi>Plinie</hi> likewise:<note place="margin">Plin. l. 2. c. 7. p. 2.</note> who saith, that, <hi>Alijs est
nullus Deorum respectus: that with some there is no respect, no reuerence at all
of God.</hi> But yet he nameth none (though he affirmeth <hi>some</hi>) neither there,
nor yet throughout his whole Booke; though in all other matters, he be most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very curious. But indeed, he could not name any particular Nation: and
therefore contents himselfe with this generall assertion, of <hi>Alijs;</hi> without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any instance. Now here must needs be very small store of good proofes:
when as <hi>Arbitror,</hi> and <hi>Alijs,</hi> are the strongest Arguments.<note place="margin">Cap. 4. Sect. 1.</note> For I haue shewed
<hi>before,</hi> that there is not, in the whole world, any Nation of <hi>Atheists:</hi> No
Author, either old, or new, doth certainely report it. And therefore it is <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
Arbitrium</hi> indeed, vpon his owne bare <hi>Arbitror,</hi> to affirme it.</p>
               <p>For his third proofe,<note place="margin">Cic. l. 3. De Nat. Deor. p. 227.</note> by instance of diuers named <hi>Atheists,</hi> I will quit him
with his owne words, euen in this very case. <hi>Placetnè igitur tantas res, opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
stultorum, iudicari? Are Fooles, the fittest Iudges, to determine so great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</hi>
This Obiection he himselfe maketh, against both the generall consent
of all men, and praescript of all time, as though all the world (excepting onely
<hi>Atheists</hi>) were now turned fooles. Are all those wise Lawgiuers, who haue
giuen Lawes and orders to all people and nations, on a sudden become fooles;
because they beleeue <hi>a God?</hi> And are all the great <hi>Philosophers,</hi> whose wisedom
and learning the whole world admireth in all other matters, become also
fooles, for this onely cause? And is onely the <hi>Atheist</hi> wise, because he denieth
God? Is this the onely wisedome, to deny there is a God? We should then
haue a wise world.<note place="margin">Arist. l. 4. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phys. c. 5. To. 2. p. 1406.</note> For then it would fall out indeed (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> imagined)
that <hi>if all the world were fooles, and but two or three wise men in it; they
should be counted fooles, and all the rest to be wise.</hi> And so it is indeed; if the
<hi>Atheists</hi> be the wise men: for they are condemned for fooles,<note place="margin">Cap. 14. Sect. 1.</note> by the generall
consent of all other men: as we shall hereafter see.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:22084:48"/>
Now, for those noted <hi>Atheists,</hi> whom he nameth in that place, <hi>Diagoras,
Theodorus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Protagoras:</hi> It may be, that none of these could be truely counted
<hi>Atheists,</hi> though they all were called so, by the censure of the vulgar: who
strictly examine not the proper application of names vnto their things. For,

                  <note place="margin">Clem. Alex. in Protrept. p. 10.</note> yet at the last, he fell into <hi>Autotheisme:</hi>
professing himselfe a God, as <hi>Laertius</hi> recordeth. Now this he could not haue
professed, if he had maintained that there was no God. Yea, and it may bee
gathered out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that, euen in his former opinion of <hi>Atheisme,</hi> hee
might be mistaken.<note place="margin">Laert. in vita Aristip. p. 73. 77</note> For, euen he himself complaineth of the iniquity of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
that he did <hi>rationes suas dextra porrigere, illos verò laeua accipere:<note place="margin">Plutarch. l. De Tranquid. To. 2. p. 312.</note> That
he deliuered his speeches with the right hand, but his hearers receiued them with
the left.</hi> In which place also, <hi>Plutarch,</hi> rendring the reason, why he was called
<hi>Atheos,</hi> alledgeth no more, but this, <hi>Quòd Deos esse videretur negare: Because
he seemed to deny, that there was any God.</hi> Was not here a faire proofe thinke
you? And, for <hi>Protagoras,</hi> he neither denied God, no, nor so much as doubted
of him. He did but onely professe, that he would not as then, entertaine the
disputation, <hi>Whether there were a God or no?</hi> Which <hi>Coecilius</hi> ascribeth not
vnto his prophanenesse,<note place="margin">Arnob. l. 8. cont. Gent. p. 748. Cap. 5. Sect. 3.</note> but rather to his warinesse. He saith, that in declining

it will from thence follow, that there needes must be a God: as you shall see

of it: that there is not among men any such generall consent, as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
imagined, and commonly praetended: vnto which, in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I haue answered.</p>
               <p>The second (vnto which I am now to answere) is this:<note place="margin">The Atheist's second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. That Religion is but an humaine inuention.</note> That, though there
were such a generall consent, as is conceiued; yet, that this is not a naturall,
but an artificiall consent: not begotten in mens harts, by a naturall instinct,
but implanted in them, by the cunning of euill arte. For that, all diuine reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
is indeed nothing else, but an humaine inuention; artificially excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

illusion.</p>
               <p>And indeed this is a very sore Obiection, striking at the roote and the
heart of all Religion. Which, though it be in truth but a mere idle fiction,

(fearing the rigour of the Lawes among the <hi>Romanes,</hi> as <hi>Euripides</hi> did before

and suborned <hi>Cotta,</hi> as an <hi>Academike,</hi> to dispute against God: who, by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of that licentious profession,<note place="margin">Cic. l. 2. De Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. p. 285.</note> might more safely doe it. For, the sect
of the <hi>Academikes</hi> would determine nothing: but yet did professe, that they
would freely dispute, both for, and against euerie thing. And so, by that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he divulged that impietie, in the person of <hi>Cotta,</hi> which he durst not
haue done, in the person of <hi>Cicero:</hi> as euen he himselfe, in a manner, confesseth.

to denie it, in the praesence of the multitude: but yet, safe ynough, among the
wise and learned.</hi> Whereby he insinuateth, that the most part of the learned

ante omnem rationis vsum: Euen before hee haue any vse of reason:</hi> as <hi>before</hi>
I noted of him. Which, if it be true, then could not Religion be a politique
inuention, to beguile the simpler sort of men. For, how could it then be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed

When as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth of politique doctrine, that it is too high for the

But, for the true Antiquity of it, let vs but follow the stepps of it, as they be
expressed to vs in the word of God, and we shall finde, that Religion is more
ancient, then any fiction; and the practise of piety, then any deuised lye. For,
when there were but three men in the vniuersall world,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 3. 4.</note> we reade, that two of
them offered vp their sacrifices vnto God: when as yet there was neither
cause of the making of lawes against publique oppressions, nor, of diuising
such fables against secret offences. And therefore, Religion could not grow
from either of those causes. Nay, it appeareth euen in their examples, that
oppression (though <hi>per accidens</hi>) grew rather from religion, then religion
from oppression. For, before those two Brothers had offered vp their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
there was no oppression: but when they were once dispatched, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
followed; the one brother violently oppressing the other; yea and that
meerely vpon this one emulation, because he was better accepted in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:22084:50"/>
Whereby it appeareth, that religion is almost as ancient as man;
nay, altogether as ancient. For the very first man is sayd to be <hi>cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>3 Yea, and so doth likewise the <hi>Vniuersality</hi> of it. For there was neuer yet
any humaine inuention, so generally spred, as the vse of <hi>Religion:</hi> no not
those, that seeme most necessary for the vse of men. Not cloathing
of our bodies, which is for meere necessity: nor couering of our shames,
which is for publique honesty. For, we meete with diuers nations, among
the west <hi>Indians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fet. Mart. Decad. 1. l. 5. p. 30. b.</note> which neither cloathe their bodies, nor couer their shames;
and yet can meete with none, but that they haue their gods. Which sense
of Religion, could not possibly be implanted into euery Nation, either
by imitation from their neighbours; because some be so wilde and sauage,
that they do not admit of any entercouse or commerce: Nor yet by institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among themselues; vnlesse we should imagine, that in euery Nation,
there should sodainely steppe vp such a politique wise man; and (as it were
by fate) tell the same Tale of Religion: or that <hi>Euripides</hi> his man had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
the whole world about, like the Sunne, and read his prophane lecture
in euery Nation. Both which suppositions were idle and ridiculous. And
therefore it is apparent, that Religion cannot be of humane institution; but
that the same common Nature, which hath giuen vnto all men their hearts,
hath also giuen Religion into all their hearts,<note place="margin">Lactan. l. 3. c. 10. p. 143. Item l. 2. c. 3. p. 75.</note> to be among them, as common,
as their naturall forme. For so indeed doth <hi>Lactantius</hi> esteeme it. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compteth
Religion, to be the most proper and essentiall difference, betweene
a man and a beast; more, then either <hi>Risus,</hi> or <hi>Ratio,</hi> or <hi>Oratio;</hi> then either
<hi>Laughing,</hi> or <hi>Speaking,</hi> yea, or <hi>Reason</hi> it selfe. All which he there proueth to
be (in some degree) communicated vnto Beasts; but Religion to bee proper
and peculiar vnto Men: and yet common vnto all men. But, that, neither
by domesticall instruction at home; nor yet, by mutuation, or imitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
but only, by that naturall instinct and disposition, which God hath
ingrafted, into the hearts of all men: as <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro,</hi>

therefore he concludeth from this so generall a consent in Religion, that it
could not be possibly an humane inuention.</p>
               <p>5 And yet the same may be further declared by the perpetuall succession,<note place="margin">The Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Religion.</note>
and propagation of Religion: which hath thriuen, from the beginning,
with such admirable prosperity, that it hath not decayed in any Country, or
City: but, wheresoeuer it hath bene planted, there hath it euer florished, and

yea, and vtterly starued. For, no humane inuention, had euer, either such a

sought onely, to obscure the truth, with a lie.</hi> And therefore, for this his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse,
in this his deuice against religion and piety, he better deserueth that
inured note of <hi>Tullie [Capitalis Euripides</hi>] then for his iniustice against
right and equitie,<note place="margin">Cic. l. 3. offic. p. 387.</note> in that his other sentence:

Here yet was, in some things a conseruation of equitie: but his Tale against

and that very truly: <hi>Qut dixerunt totam de Dijs immortalibus opinionem

there be recorded, in the writings both of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> the very

were in the world, may be numbred in this multitude, that confesse <hi>there is a

               <p>For first, as concerning the number of those <hi>Atheists,</hi> it is so poore and
contemptible, that it is an infinite disgrace, and reproach vnto their cause, to
haue beene, in all mens eyes, so abiect, and profligated, as to be able to get no

such learned <hi>Philosophers,</hi> as they would insinuate. This is a foule disgrace vnto
their cause, that so great learned Teachers, could get so few Disciples; especially
being followed by so many Auditors: as <hi>Laertius</hi> obserueth in <hi>Bion</hi> of <hi>Boris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenis,</hi>
one of the chiefest <hi>Atheists,</hi> that; <hi>Nemo illius Discipulus inscribitur, cùm

not a pure <hi>Atheist,</hi> we may probably gather, by two Arguments, out of that
description of his life, which is written by <hi>Laertius.</hi> The first of them, that
he maketh <hi>precationem</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

not thinke, that there was no God. For, he would neuer pray to nothing. If
he had bene perswaded, that the name of God, were but an idle name, and
that there were no <hi>thing,</hi> that were answerable to it, he would neuer bestow
his prayers vpon it.</p>
               <p>Againe, among his workes, there was one of his Bookes inscribed, <hi>De ijs

                  <note place="margin">Ibid. page 322.</note> Now, if he thought that there were <hi>Inferi,</hi> he must

for any thing that hath hitherto bene sayd, <hi>Protagoras</hi> was no <hi>Atheist:</hi> he

their weake faith in God (especially for the present) but it could not conclude
their denying of God. And, no more could it in him: especially his other
writings implying, that he beleeued him.</p>
               <p>Let vs yet proceed further, and consider of <hi>Euemerus:</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

But yet it appeareth, that his crime was not a generall denying of all
Gods, but only a denying of the heathen gods: and an affirming of them,

Therefore, to hold this, that the Heathen gods were men, was no prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or impietie; but a solide veritie: which though it might not be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
professed; yet was it priuately vnderstood, and beleeued. Whereby
it appeareth, that <hi>Euemerus</hi> his <hi>Atheisme,</hi> was not to Diuulge any vntruth
against the true God; but to diuulge a truth, against the false gods. And, the
rather may this be beleeued to be true; because <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,<note place="margin">Theophil. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och. l. 3. ad Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. Bib. Pat. To. 5. p. 156.</note>
that <hi>Euemerus</hi> did hold, not onely <hi>Animae immortalitatem,</hi> but also
<hi>Dei vnitatem: not onely the immortalitie of the soule, but the vnitie of the
Deitie.</hi> Neither of which points can congruously be held, by him, that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
There is no God. The word indeed which <hi>Theophilus</hi> there vseth, is
but, <hi>disputarit. But, that he disputed it;</hi> not <hi>problematice,</hi> but <hi>assertinè,</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
there was a God; it appeareth by this; because he saith, that therein he
was contrary vnto himselfe, in his former denying him. Which, though <hi>he</hi>
doe there impute vnto his inconstancie; yet may it bee probably thought, to
haue beene his <hi>palinodie:</hi> if he euer before had held, <hi>That there was no God.</hi>
For I will not peremptorily define, neither for him, nor for any of the rest,
that they were no <hi>Atheists;</hi> but only dispute the contrary, vpon probable
grounds: and that the accusations which haue beene layd against them, doe
not neccessarily conuince, that they were absolute <hi>Atheists;</hi> or that they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
denied all gods, though they denied those, with whom they were
charged in their accusations. And this interpretation, I desire to be applied

haue they beene infamed for such, if they were not such? Whereunto I briefly
answer: that this was onely through the iealousie and tendernesse of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
in defending of their Countrey-gods: ouer whom they were so tender,
that whosoeuer denied <hi>them,</hi> they held that he held none: and though hee
professed that he beleeued others; yet they held, that he reiected all, if hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
not theirs. And this we may plainely see, in the iudgement of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi>

as cleane contrary to themselues, in the two maine heads of their accusation;
to charge him with <hi>Atheisme,</hi> that is, a denying of all gods, in the one head;
whom they discharge in the other, by obiecting his new gods: deriding this
foolish intoxication, to be (in effect) as if they should haue said: <hi>Contra leges
agit Socrates, Deos non putans, sed Deos putans;</hi> yet their zeale in their religion
preuailed so farre, as to worke his condemnation: accounting it not much
lesse impiety, to assert any new gods, then to deny all gods. As wee may see
also by their catching at the speech of S. <hi>Paule:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee seemeth to be a setter-out
of strange Gods.</hi> And it is like enough, that if hee had stayed there, it might
haue cost him his head. For, though his new God were, in truth, the true
God; yet, because he disliked their old gods, they would haue held him for an
<hi>Atheist:</hi>

they did not constantly hold out their opinion: but that oftentimes they so
checked themselues, that they could not but inwardly beleeue there was a
God, though they outwardly denied it. Yea, and it may be likewise, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of them, vpon vaine glory, or vpon studie of singularity, that they might
seeme to be wiser then other men, haue outwardly professed (though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:22084:59"/>
whole worke serueth, which is written against <hi>Atheists,</hi> if they be few, or
none such? Whereunto, though I haue partly answered in the preface to the
Reader; yet, I here will adde this further: That though there be but few such
<hi>Atheists</hi> (or rather indeed none) as resolutely and constantly beleeue with their
hearts, that <hi>There is no God;</hi> yea, and not many such, as professe it with their
mouthes, though not beleeuing it constantly: Yet be there very many, that
beleeue it weakely: and, that being ouercome by sodaine passions and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
do oftentimes doubt, and distrust; whether there be any God?

And few men can escape the very same temptations. Therefore, of this sort
of <hi>Atheists,</hi> there is as great a plenty, as of the first sort, a scarcity. Nay, there
is almost no man, but at some time or other, he falleth within the compasse
of this doubting.<note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. 52. To. 8. p. 509.</note> So that (as it is truly obserued by Saint <hi>Augustine) Hoc

(at the most) but in a few.</hi> Therefore, many may reape profit, by the reading

with him this distinction: that I be not often driuen to make this repetition:
namely, that when we deny that there be any <hi>Atheists,</hi> as be properly so called,
which generally and constantly beleeue <hi>There is no God,</hi> and hold so vnto the
end: (Of which sort there can be none, though many haue beene so reputed
and taken: because (as it is truly obserued by <hi>Nouation) Deum, mens omnis
humana sentit, etiamsi non exprimit: There is no man, but in his soule he doth
inwardly feele, That there is a God; though hee do not outwardly confesse it.</hi>)
When we confesse, <hi>There be Atheists,</hi> and dispute against them; wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
onely such as deny there is a God, rather by outward profession, then
by inward perswasion: or, if they haue indeed any such inward perswasion, it
is but onely vpon some sodaine passion: which vanisheth as sodainely, as it
was conceiued fondly. And of these sodaine and passionate eruptions,
may that place of the Psalmist bee vnderstood:<note place="margin">Psal. 14. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>The Foole hath sayd in his

                  <note place="margin">Atheists hold but weakely their opinion of Atheisme.</note> whom we finde to be
most celebrated, in the monuments &amp; writings, not only of heathens, but also

so weakely, and left the beleefe of it so easily, that it could not, in common

Now, what a miserable seruant of Ambition was this man, that durst thus
impotently affect it, where hee might so easily be detected? And the same
seruile affectation of <hi>Vaine-glory</hi> and Ambition,<note place="margin">Lact. l. de Ira Dei. c. 9. p. 455.</note> may likewise be obserued, in
all the rest of them. Insomuch, that <hi>Lactantius</hi> maketh their ambition, to be

the very fountaine of their impiety, and <hi>Atheisme.</hi> And, he giueth there for

to themselues, by any new inuention of their owne; they sought to

for the subiect of their contradiction, that most ancient, and most generally
approued opinion, <hi>That there is a God.</hi> And this (for their glories sake) they
would needs confute. In the second of which two, that is, in <hi>Theodorus</hi>
(who, for his notable impietie, was called <hi>cognomento, Atheos</hi>) it is a thing
that is very worthy of obseruation; that, as by meere ambition, he was ledde
vnto his <hi>Atheisme:</hi> so by the same ambition, he was ledde to renounce the

a time, came vnto him: and, being willing to make a triall, whether he could
inwardly be perswaded (as hee outwardly pretended) That there was indeed
no God? he set vpon him, with this Question. <hi>Tell me (ô Theodorus) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that he had meant; <hi>Whether he were indeed, a true Atheist, or no?</hi> answered
him; <hi>He was so:</hi> that hee was the very same, that the people esteemed him.
<hi>Why then</hi> (sayth <hi>Stilpo) thou art surely, no Atheist; but thou art, indeed a very
God:</hi> artificially insinuating, that so the people esteemed him. With which
idle conceite, <hi>Theodorus</hi> being tickled, and loath to repell so glorious an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription;
he thought it better to renounce his former opinion. And so, from
thence forward, he held, <hi>That there was no God; vnlesse that he himselfe were
(haply) a God.</hi> By which his ambition, hee cast himselfe into so great a scorne;
that he, which before was called in detestation, <hi>Theodorus</hi>

gayneth not his libertie, by all his impiety. But, though hee renounce Gods
religion; because he would not serue him: yet serueth hee much more basely,
vnto his owne <hi>Ambition.</hi> And in seruing of it, he serueth the Deuill himselfe:
because he will not serue God. For <hi>Ambitionis via, est Diaboli adoratio:</hi>

that now, the <hi>Atheist</hi> hath not only a Master, but also a God to serue: though,
by the choise of his <hi>Atheisme,</hi> hee sought to exempt himselfe from both of
them. But in them both, hee is intangled. For that, being a base seruant, hee
must needes haue a Maister, and he must needes haue a God. And so, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

Thus the <hi>Atheist</hi> (as you see it directly proued) is neither without Maister,
nor a God: but is indeed, a base seruant, both of many Maisters, and of many
gods. For, though hee doe most impiously reriounce all others gods; yet
serueth he, most basely, these three <hi>Belly-gods; Bacchus, Ceres, Venus.</hi> All

So that, though all other gods doe <hi>frigere,</hi> with the <hi>Atheist;</hi> yet those three

               <p>Thus the <hi>Atheist,</hi> though he seek to make himselfe a free-man, by the choice
of his <hi>Atheisme:</hi> yet is he, in very deed, the greatest bond-man in the world;
seruing his owne most base and refuse parts, with all most denout and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
seruice; compelling the most excellent and imperiall parts of his soule,
to serue the most abiect and ministeriall parts of his body: and honouring
(in a sort) those parts, as his gods, which are scarcely worthy to bee his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.
Which is indeede, a true seruitude, yea, and a most base one
too.</p>
               <p>5 But it may be here obiected, That in all this,<note place="margin">The Atheist is a base slaue vnto himselfe. <hi>Cic. Paradox. 5. p.</hi> 424.</note> he serueth but himselfe,
and not any other thing. And therefore is truely and properly a freeman.
Because, <hi>Libertas, est facultas viuendi vt velis: Freedome, is nothing else, but
onely a faculty, to liue as we please.</hi> So the Orator defineth it. And so the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
confirmeth it.

Nay, it is a false collection, not onely in the iudgement of those rigid Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,

And this feare groweth vnto <hi>Atheists,</hi> from a double cause; which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:22084:69"/>
both of them are founded in their seruile feare of God. The first is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of their owne impietie and wickednesse: which they needed not to
feare, if they thought there were no God. The second is, the terror of those
nocturnall apparitions, that represent themselues vnto them in their dreames:
which they might easily contemne, for vaine and idle fancies; but that they
are printed deeper, then can be blotted out, with all their artificiall and forced
irrisions.</p>
               <p>For the first of those two causes, that is, the conscience of their owne
wickednesse: though they can easily passe it ouer in the day time, when they
wake; yet returneth it vnto them in the night time, when they sleepe: and
then tormenteth and afflicteth them, with the feare of those punishments,<note place="margin">Plato. l. 1. De Repub. p. 532.</note>
which they doubt may expect them after their deaths. As <hi>Plato</hi> truly noteth:
<hi>Qui multas habet, in vita, iniquitates, ex ipso somno (tanquam puer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

excitus, extimescit, &amp; in pessima speviuit. Those men, that are guilty
of many iniquities in their life, are often times (like fearefull Children)
wakened out of their sleepe, and leade their liues with very little comfort.</hi> And
therefore <hi>Tullie</hi> (by a kinde of morall exposition) interpreteth those <hi>Furies,</hi>
which are represented in <hi>Tragoedies,</hi> affrighting the mindes of impious and
vngodly persons, to be nothing else,<note place="margin">Cic. 1. De Leg. p. 317.</note> but the affrightments of their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehces

no sacrifice for Atheisme. For the mindes of all Atheists, are tormented by
Furies; yet, not with burning Torches (as we see it, in Tragoedies) but with
the griefe and anguish of their owne guilty Consciences.</hi> Now, what reason can
be alledged, why they should be so perplexed and affrighted with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
(especially in their secret and hidden transgressions) but onely, that
they know, that they will be their accusers, to lay them all open, vnto the
great Iudge? This then is the first night-torment of the <hi>Atheist;</hi> the terror,
which he sustayneth, from a corrupt and guilty Conscience.</p>
               <p>The second is, the terror of diuers strange dreames, and fearefull visions;
wherein God doth sometimes, onely conferre and talke with them: and
sometime beside, plainely shew himselfe vnto them, not only conferring, but
also appearing. For the first of those two sorts, <hi>Iob</hi> telleth vs in his Booke, that
<hi>God will speake vnto a man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 33. 14 15.</note> 
                  <hi>once or twice, though he see it not, in dreames and
visions of the night.</hi> As we may see in King <hi>Abimelech:</hi> with whom God
conferred,<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 3.</note> and talked in <hi>a dreame, and threatened him with death, for detay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Abrahams wife away from him.</hi> And these interlocutorie and dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guising
dreames, were not vnknowne, euen to the very Heathens; as it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appeareth by that position of <hi>Possidonius:</hi> That,<note place="margin">Cic. l. 1. De Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. p. 251.</note> 
                  <hi>Dij cum dormienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
colloquuntur: That the Gods doe oftentimes talke with men in their sleepes.</hi>
Of the second of those kindes; wherein, not onely a voice is heard, but also
an image and resemblance seene; we also reade in the Booke of <hi>Iob:</hi> where
<hi>Eliphaz</hi> giueth himselfe for an instance,<note place="margin">Iob. 4. 12. 13. &amp;c</note> saying: <hi>In the thoughts of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the night, when sleepe falleth vpon men; Feare came vpon me, and dread,
which made all my bones to tremble. And the winde passed before me, and
made all the hayres of my flesh to stand vp. Then stood one; and I knew not his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:22084:69"/>
face; an image was before mine eyes, and in silence I heard a voyce.</hi> And
this kinde of apparition was likewise knowne vnto the Heathen: as
appeareth in <hi>Iamblicus:</hi> who describing the visions, which are sent from
God, he saith, that they doe commonly come betweene sleeping and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
and that then,<note place="margin">Iamblic. l. De Mysteriis. c. 22. p. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>Breues audiuntur voces, quid agendum sit admonentes;

Qui tamen non perspicitur, sed alio quodam sensu, &amp; animaduer si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
percipitur. We heare certaine short voices: which, of diuers things admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
vs: Yea, and sometimes certaine Spirits (though not corpulent, nor palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
doe compasse round about vs: which, though they be not visibly discerned,
yet may they, by another kinde of sense, be perceiued.</hi> The like appeareth in
<hi>Lucretius.</hi> who numbreth these fearefull visions, among the first causes, which
begate in mens mindes, an opinion of the Gods.

                  </q>
By which appearance of God, so immediately vnto the minde, the best men
are oftentimes much perturbed and troubled: though there be none other
cause, but onely the Maiestie of the Creator, striking a naturall feare and
awe into his Creature. As we may euidently see, in that example of <hi>Eliphaz</hi>
who confesseth, his owne vision to haue bin with feare and trembling; though
it contayned nothing, but a most gracious and milde instruction. Then must
it needs appeare, both with terror, &amp; horror vnto the <hi>Atheists;</hi> when it giueth
them signification of Gods wrath and iudgements. Their visions, must needs
be such, as the Orator describeth, that,<note place="margin">Cic. l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

confesseth that his dreame made him <hi>sore afrayd, and troubled his thoughts,
vpon his bed.</hi> And, of this kinde, are all those dreames and visions, which
appeare vnto <hi>Atheists.</hi> They be alwayes the Messengers of Gods wrath and
iudgements. And therefore they are alwayes tormented with them, and (as
it were) set vpon the very rack by them. As the <hi>Poet Iuuenal</hi> hath notably
described them, comprizing both the two fore-named causes of their feare,
together in one sentence, namely, both the guiltines of their owne corrupt
conscience, and the fearefull apparitions of strange sights and visions.

Out of which sentence of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> we may gather many Arguments; that
euen the most impious <hi>Atheists</hi> in the world, do inwardly beleeue, <hi>That there
is a God;</hi> though they outwardly dissemble it. For he saith, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

perculsi timore: that they be strucken, with a terror and feare of the Gods. Ergò,</hi>
they must needs beleeue, <hi>That there be Gods.</hi> For no man feareth, that which
he beleeueth not to be.</p>
               <p>Nay this testimony of <hi>Lucre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

and <hi>Christian,</hi> that no man can disclaime from any one of them.
Whereby it will appeare, that though the <hi>Atheist</hi> would deny both God,
and all Religion, yet that hee is inwardly inforced to beleeue them: and to

                  </gap>d (euen against his will) many notable points of Christian Religion, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
of all his obstinate resolution for <hi>Atheisme.</hi> All which may naturally be
collected, from his euident feare of lightning, and thunder. As namely these
which follow.</p>
               <p>First, hee beleeueth, that, <hi>There is a God:</hi> or else hee needed not to feare
him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he beleeueth, that, <hi>God is such an one, as is to be feared:</hi> or else
he would not (nay, he could not) feare him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee beleeueth, that, <hi>God is not an incurious God,</hi> (as the <hi>Epicure</hi>
conceiteth him) who sitting idlely in heauen, regardeth nothing that is done
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:22084:71"/>
vpon the earth: but that <hi>he is a most curious and obseruing God;</hi> both seeing
all that is done, and hearing all that is spoken: or else, he neede not feare the
punishment, neither of his <hi>admissa,</hi> nor of his <hi>superbè dicta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, he beleeueth, that <hi>God is present in all places:</hi> or else hee could
neither see his euill deedes, nor heare his euill words.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, he beleeueth, that <hi>God doth not onely looke vpon things as an idle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder;
but also as a iust rewarder;</hi> for else he needed not to feare his behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
if afterward he intended to doe nothing. But hee feareth him as a iust
Reuenger, to execute iudgement vpon euery offender. He beleeueth, <hi>both
that God is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and that he is a iust rewarder:</hi> as it is in the Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, hee beleeueth, that <hi>God is of that power,</hi> as is able to humble, and
to inflict due punishment, vpon the greatest Prince and Pote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tate of the
World.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, he beleeueth, that <hi>Lightning</hi> and <hi>Thunder</hi> doe not come, either
by <hi>Chance,</hi> or by <hi>Nature:</hi> but that they haue <hi>God himselfe</hi> for their maker.
For else, though he feared them, yet he needed not to feare <hi>him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eightly, he beleeueth, that <hi>God hath made those creatures,</hi> as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his wrath, to strike and to punish, when hee purposeth to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, he beleeueth, that <hi>Impiety and wickednesse</hi> do iustly deserue Gods
heauy wrath and iudgements.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, he beleeueth, that <hi>God is iust:</hi> and therefore will pay them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their desert.</p>
               <p>Eleuenthly, he beleeueth, that <hi>there is a time appointed,</hi> when this paiment
shall be made.</p>

appointed time is come; and that God will certainely take vengeance vpon
him.</p>
               <p>All these consequents doe follow, by necessary connexion, vpon the <hi>Atheists</hi>
fearing of thunder and lightning, especially, as the arrowes of Gods wrath
and vengeance. And thus, the <hi>Atheist,</hi> who denieth, there is a God: yet is
forced to beleeue many truths concerning God. He beleeueth his <hi>Essence;</hi>
he beleeueth his <hi>Power;</hi> he beleeueth his <hi>Prouidence;</hi> he beleeueth his <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence;</hi>
and he beleueth his <hi>Iustice.</hi> All this he be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And, this we may plainely see, not onely by the testimony of these fore-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

when the plague of <hi>Lightning</hi> and <hi>Thunder</hi> fell vpon him, (which is able to

As I haue largely shewed before, in the whole eleuenth Chapter. And partly

and would resolutely seeme at all times to contemne; yet by other so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
fits of feare, seazing violently vpon him, and quashing all his formerly
pretended iollity, he really confesseth him, whom he verbally denieth. Yea,
and that in farre more base and abiect manner, then any other man in the
world, whosoeuer. There is no man, that professeth the feare of God, which
feareth him so slauishly, as the <hi>Atheist</hi> doth, who yet would seeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
him most considently. As I haue likewise declared in the whole
twelueth Chapter.</p>
               <p>But yet, this is not all that the <hi>Atheist</hi> doth,<note place="margin">Three sorts of confessions of God from the Atheist.</note> in acknowledging of a God. For,
if we looke further into the <hi>Atheists</hi> life, and surueigh the tenor of it vnto his
death, we shall find, that (beside those oblique and indirect confessions, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the fore-named Chapters) euen the most resolute and dissolute of all
that impious rancke, which glory to bee compted the deniers of God; yet
haue sometimes confessed a God, as directly, as any that euer adored him
most religiously; as expressely, in plaine and apert termes, confessing him, as
euer they vsed in their deniall of him. Which confessions of the <hi>Atheists,</hi>
may (for distinctions sake) be ranged into three diuers orders and rankes: that
Some of them be made vnwittingly, and beside their will; Some of them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly,
and by an extorted will; and Some of then both wittingly, and

               <p>2 For the first of those three kindes,<note place="margin">Vnwitting confessions of Atheists.</note> the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> telleth vs, that,

                  <hi>yet that the answer of the tongue is of God.</hi> So that
no man is maister of his owne tongue, to speake at all times what hee himselfe
speaketh: but he oftentimes speaketh that displeaseth himselfe, to speake what
God pleaseth. He alwayes speaketh what God pleaseth, though not alwayes
what pleaseth God: no, nor what pleaseth himselfe neither. For, God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
openeth the lippes, euen of the wicked, and maketh euen <hi>their mouth to

                  <hi>that their tongues are their owne, and that they will speake, for who is Lord

haue beene the deriders of God; that oftentimes, when they thinke to curse,

confesse him. Let me giue an example, or two, to this purpose. There

is able to doe for them?</hi> Where, there euidently appeareth a manifest confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both of their speech, and of their reason. For, what can be greater madnes,
then either to call him <hi>Almighty,</hi> of whom they aske, <hi>What he can do for them?</hi>
or, to deny that God can doe any thing for them; when as they acknowledge
him to be <hi>Almighty?</hi> Their purpose was to deny his <hi>Omnipotencie:</hi> and yet
the <hi>Omnipotent</hi> so ouer-ruled their tongue, that hee made it, in the same sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
to confesse his <hi>Almightinesse: sending a spirit of giddinesse,</hi> into the

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:22084:75"/>
them from them against their willes. Thus dealt hee with
King <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> who was at the first so irreligions, that, when as <hi>Moses</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him in the name of God, <hi>Thus saith the Lord;</hi> hee presumptuously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,<note place="margin">Ex. 5. 2.</note>
                  <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> as holding scorne to obey him. But yet, afterward,
he being scourged by the righteous hand of God, and brought vnto some
better vnderstanding of himselfe, he was forced to confesse, that <hi>the Lord
was iust,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ex. 9. 27. 8. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>and righteous; but that both he, and his people, were wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious:</hi>
Yea, and <hi>beseech Moses, to pray for him, vnto the same God,</hi> whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee had most impiously contemned, and despised. Thus dealt God
likewise with <hi>Herod Agrippa:</hi> who,<note place="margin">Iosep. l 19. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit. p. 565. Act: 12. 21. 22. 23.</note> araying himselfe, one day, in most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Apparell, spangled all ouer, and spred with plates of gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones, assembled all the people, to speake vnto them, in a solemne
Oration: wherein hee purposely so disposed himselfe, that the shine of the
Sun-beames should reflect vpon his fore-said Spangles, and Iewels: through
which artificiall reflexion, he seemed to shine more bright then the Sunne.
With which glorious sight, and his eloquent Oration, the people being stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefied,
they gaue him this impudent acclamation; that <hi>His speech then vnto
them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 12. 21. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>was the voice of a God, and not of a man.</hi> Vnto which their impious
assentation, he more impiously assenting, God sent his Angell, presently to
strike and to punish him. Who, quickly finding this stroke to be mortall,
and that it was inflicted vpon him from heauen; though before he was silent,
and would not confesse God, but was well ynough contented, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should substitute him into his stead: yet now, hee confessed him, most
humbly; acknowledging both the peoples error, and his owne mortalitie.
Whose repentant confession,<note place="margin">Ioseph: vbi supra.</note> is notably expressed by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> in these words.
<hi>Conuersis in amicos oculis; En (inquit) Ille ego, vestra appellatione, Deus, vitam
relinquere iubeor; fatali necessitate, mendacium vestrum coarguente: &amp; quem
immortalem salutâstis, ad mortem rapior. Sed ferenda est voluntas coelestis
Numinis. He casting his eyes, vpon his flatt'ring friends: Now behold me (saith
he) whom, but euen now, you saluted for a God; how I am commanded to forsake
this world: my fatall necessitie conuincing your flatterie of a lie. He, whom
you blazoned to be immortall, am now carried violently vnto my death. But it is
meet, to be subiect, vnto the will and pleasure of the highest God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This notable confession, hee made before he died: which, if hee would haue
made in time, hee had surely liued. Thus likewise, God dealt with <hi>Antiochus
Epiphanes:</hi> who was so madded with malice,<note place="margin">1. Mac. 1. 46.</note> against the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> that
he blasphemed his Name, ouerthrew his Altars, destroyed his Temple, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
his Lawes, and persecuted his People; yea and that with all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manest
examples of the bloodyest crueltie, that he could possibly deuise. No
<hi>Atheist,</hi> in simply denying of God, could be so great an enemie vnto him,
as this prophane King was, in fighting against him. But the hand of God
so seazed vpon him, and smote him with so sore and incurable a disease, that
it forced both his pride and his malice to submit; and to begin his forced
submission with this humble Confession;<note place="margin">1. Mac. 9. 10. 11. 12. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>It is meete to be subeict vnto God,
&amp; that a man, who is mortall, should not thinke himselfe aequal vnto God through
pride.</hi> Making many vowes and supplications, vnto that same God, in vaine,
whom before he had compelled all his people to blaspheme.</p>

insomuch that diuers of his Phisitions not being able to endure his abominable
sauour, were killed with the very ayre.</hi> And, in these miserable torments, they
both of them exhaled their execrable soules. Thus exactly did God proceed,<note place="margin">2. Mac 9. 28.</note>
from point to point, in all the seuerall degrees of their punishment; equalling
the one of them vnto the other in their vengeance, as they had equalled
themselues together in their wickednes. Thereby plainely declaring,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 5. 4. Heb. 11. 6.</note> that he

confession, and repentant recantation, the point which most properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
vnto our present Treatise. As those two profane Kings did answere
one another,<note place="margin">Pro. 27. 19.</note> as exactly, as two faces vse to do <hi>in the water,</hi> both in their <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,</hi>
and in their <hi>calamity;</hi> so did they likewise in their <hi>Palinodie.</hi> For first,

When hee once was afflicted with so many euills, then did hee beginne
to haue a sense of those euills which hee himselfe had inflicted vpon
Gods holy Seruants.</hi> Secondly, as <hi>Antiochus</hi> was inwardly perswaded,<note place="margin">1. Mac. 6. 12. 13.</note>
that all those euills inuaded him, onely for his impiety against the God of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> in persecuting his seruants: so was <hi>Maximinus</hi> perswaded, that all his
euills happened, onely for his impiety against the God of the <hi>Christians,</hi> in
persecuting his seruants. <hi>Haec se,</hi>

haue bene iustly inflicted for his impious praesumption and fury against Christ.</hi>

Thus doth he preach both God &amp; godlines out of Hel; who renounced them
both, while he liued vpon earth. Yea, and our Sauiour Christ himselfe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
the very same point,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 27. 28.</note> in the historicall parable of <hi>Diues;</hi> who beeing
tormented in Hell himselfe, yet desired to haue his brethren fore-warned of
that wickednesse and vngodlinesse, which had worthily brought him vnto
that misery and wretchednesse: The meaning of all this is no more but this;
that God will force the tongues of those men, to confesse him, that haue bin
most vngodly and impudent in denying him. He that made the Deuils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
him vpon the earth, will make the Damned confesse him out of

               <p>4 But yet we may meete with diuers other wicked ones,<note place="margin">Willing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of the Atheists.</note> with whom
God hath taken a more milde and gracious course: not inforcing them to
confesse him by his iustice and iudgements (as he did the former) but indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them vnto it by his mercy and goodnesse: inlightning their minds with

were not in the highest degree of <hi>Atheists,</hi> in denying of all Gods; yet might
he be numbred in an inferior degree of them, in denying the true God, and
worshipping prophane and wicked Idols in his stead. But yet hee wisely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abseruing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:22084:78"/>
those great plagues and iudgements, which God had poured
downe vpon the Aegyptians, for the deliuerance of his seruants, he thereby
receiued instruction, and openly brake forth into this notable confession:
<hi>Now I know, that the Lord is greater then all the Gods. For as they haue dealt
proudly with them, so are they recompenced.</hi> Thus dealt hee likewise, with the
Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 9. 1. 3 4.</note> as furious a persecuter (in his small authoritie) as euer the
Church had any. But yet <hi>Christ,</hi> in his great mercie, appearing vnto him,
and, out of heauen, reprouing him; he likewise receiued instruction: and,
reforming his former error, became afterwards, as zealous a Preacher,
as euer before he had beene a persecuter. In so much, that it passed of him,

               <p>The like Confessions, and recantations, may be here accumulated, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
other of the Heathens: who haue plainely renounced their impieties
and prophanesse: and, in the end, acknowledged a God, whom at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
they denied. It is reported of <hi>Diagoras,</hi> the most renouned of all that
are called <hi>Atheists,</hi> that he began his Booke of <hi>Poems,</hi> with this <hi>Exordium:</hi>

                  </q>
Which may probably be thought, to haue beene the recantation of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
opinion. For, his <hi>Atheisme</hi> and impietie (if it were truely such) he had
from the common opinion of his countrie, the <hi>Island</hi> of <hi>Melos:</hi> which held
a scornefull opinion of all the Greekish gods. And therefore this so direct
a contradiction of his former opinion, cannot otherwise be construed,
then as his retractation. And the like may be thought, as concerning <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi>
who, for the opinion of his impietie, was likewise named <hi>Atheos.</hi> And

his, intituled <hi>De Dijs;</hi> and that it was, <hi>Liber non contemnendus.</hi> Which

beene very worthy to be contemned: which <hi>Laertius</hi> denieth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Booke, being censured, to be <hi>a worke not worthy to be contemned;</hi>
yea, and that by the same man who before had taxed him for his <hi>Atheisme;</hi>
may also probably be thought, to haue contayned a retractation of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
opinion. And so likewise <hi>Euemerus,</hi> whatsoeuer his opinion was, which
among all the Heathen was so condemned for <hi>Atheisme:</hi> Whether it
were a generall denying of all the gods; or but a particular denying of the
Heathen gods: yet euidently appeareth, out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that when he grew
old, hee grew cold, in defending it. A manifest Argument, that he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of his broching it. Which his coldnesse in asserting it, bred also a like
coldnesse in the peoples assent vnto it. As it euidently appeareth in those

For, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> well obserueth,<note place="margin">Plut. in Gryllo. To. 2. p. 102.</note> 
                  <hi>There is no beast, that differeth so much from

differeth from all men, and that in the maine ground, both of religion, and of
reason. And therefore, is not worthy to be numbered among men.</p>
               <p>Thus you see, how base and vile account all <hi>Atheists</hi> haue had, at all times,
amongst all wise and learned men: who haue esteemed them none otherwise,
then a kinde of vainely conceited fooles. Which is the worst kinde of follie,
and the least to be hoped of. <hi>Seest thou a man that is wise in his owne conceit?
there is more hope of a foole,</hi>

                  <hi>then of him:</hi> more hope, euen of a mere <hi>Naturall:</hi>
for such is the wisemans foole here. And though perhaps, those <hi>Atheists,</hi> in
the hight of their pride, and thicknesse of their ignorance, make as small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of wise men, as <hi>they</hi> can doe of them; accounting them for the fooles,
and themselues to be the onely wise: yet matters it nothing, whom they that
be fooles, doe either esteeme to be fooles, or to be wise men: but whom wise
men so esteeme. For (as the Orator very truely obserueth) <hi>Statuere quis sit

called for meat almost euery moment. Further, his intestines brake out into

<hi>Atheos,</hi> as (before him) was <hi>Diagoras:</hi> he, for that his impietie, being
questioned publiquely, was, by the sentence of the Iudges, both condemned,
and executed; being forced to <hi>drinke a cup of deadly wine,</hi> as it is in the
Psalme. For, that was the punishment appointed by their Lawes, for the death
of such profane and impious persons: That they, which had made others
drinke in the poyson of their wicked opinions, should themselues, by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poyson end their owne wicked liues.</p>
               <p>For the fourth of them, <hi>Socrates;</hi> though he were a man, so rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
for all morall vertues,<note place="margin">Cic. l. 5. Tusc. p. 168.</note> that he is said to <hi>be the first, that euer called Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie

among men: yet, because his morall vertue was not seasoned with the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall</hi>
vertue of true Piety; but, that hee was esteemed (though falsely) to
be a derider of all the Gods; the same Law, which before had seazed on <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus,</hi>
tooke hold likewise on him: and sentenced him to the same condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
whom it held to be guilty of the same crime. And so, hee drinking
of the very same Cup, did end his life also with a draught of poyson.</p>
               <p>Now, if any man do thinke, that the iudgments of those forenamed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
are not rightly ascribed, to bee the iudgments of God; because they
were pronounced, by the mouth of men; he is greatly deceiued, in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For (as the Prophet <hi>Moses</hi> very truly affirmeth) <hi>The iudgment is the
Lords,</hi>

<hi>standeth among the Gods; but also iudgeth among the Gods:</hi> as not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with them, but also president among them. So that, though their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was framed in the <hi>Councell</hi> of men; yet was it decreed by the counsell
of God. He it was, that decreed the sentence, though he appointed the
mouth of a man to pronounce it. The same God, who gaue the sentence;
that,<note place="margin">Leuit. 24. 14.</note> that Blasphemer should be executed, among the <hi>Iewes;</hi> was he, that gaue
the sentence, that <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and the rest, should likewise be executed among
the <hi>Athenians.</hi> So that, though they died by the iudgement of man; yet
died they, not without the iudgment of God. But, to proceede with the rest.</p>

For the fifth of them, <hi>Epicurus:</hi> though he denied Gods prouidence, yet
he died not without Gods prouidence: but had such a death befallen him, as

loathsome, that he was faine to auoyd the society of men, and to shut vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
(as it were) in a close prison. So that, whenas any of his friends resorted
to visite him, he was growne so deformed, and so ashamed of himselfe, that he
would neuer be seene of them. But when they called to him, and inquired of
his health; he would shew them his finger through the rift of a doore, most
miserably consumed and eaten vp with lice: and then tell them that his whole

to see this great misery of his Sonne, if he could haue fore-seene it. No drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
no burning, no rotting, of any of all the fore-named <hi>Atheists,</hi> could haue

               <p>So that, none of al the fore-named <hi>Atheists</hi> escaped the stroke of Gods reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

all that they haue, and they goe downe quicke into the pit; then yee shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,

strange and vncouth death, is, not onely the worke of God, but the worke of
his wrath. Yea, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> (vpon the like occasion) insinuateth the same.
For he noteth it, as the iudgement of God, not onely vpon <hi>Tullus Hostilius</hi>

                  <hi>Nullus eorum obijt, secundùm Naturae leges: That
none of them had their deathes according to Natures lawes.</hi> Which may, much
more generally be affirmed of <hi>Atheists,</hi> then of any other sort of vniust and
wicked persons: that none of them doe die faire and naturall deathes; but
all violent and vnnaturall. By which immediate iudgements of God, falling
downe so certainely, and so directly vpon the heads of <hi>Atheists,</hi> more then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
any other wicked ones; yea, and so generally too, vpon euery one of
them, without all exception; God doth much more effectually prooue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be, in the euidence of those workes; then all the <hi>Atheists</hi> in the world
can prooue God not to be, by the efficacy of their words.</p>
               <p>5 But, here it may be obiected, that diuers of those men,<note place="margin">An Obiection answered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those Atheists.</note> whom I here

haue bene <hi>heretofore,</hi> by my selfe excused, and proued to be no <hi>Atheists</hi>
indeed: howsoeuer in the receiued opinion,<note place="margin">Cap. 10. Sect 4</note> they were commonly so esteemed.
Whereby it may be thought, that either there or here, I haue done wrong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the truth. For, if they were not <hi>Atheists;</hi> why were they by God punished?
If they were indeed <hi>Atheists;</hi> why were they by me excused? For the better
remoouing of which semblance of contradiction, I answer; that mine excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them in that place, was not simply to free them from all those degrees of
<hi>Atheisme,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 10. Sect. 2. Item Cap. 10. Sect. 4.</note> which God might in iustice punish; but onely to free them from
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:22084:87"/>
that highest degree of <hi>Atheisme,</hi> which in the vulgar opinion was imputed
vnto them: Namely, from being such desperate and obdured <hi>Atheists,</hi> as simply
&amp; constantly denied there was any God. For, it is very true, which <hi>Plato</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that there was neuer in the world any such kinde of <hi>Atheist;</hi> but that,<note place="margin">Plat. l. 10. De Leg. p. 871.</note> 
                  <hi>All of
those who denied God in the beginning, yet still confessed him in the end.</hi> And
that therein he held a very true opinion, I plainely exemplified, by all those
knowne <hi>Atheists,</hi> that haue beene most noted and branded for such: who
haue all of them, at sometime, and some of them, at all times acknowledged
some gods: notwithstanding they denied the gods of their owne countries;
to be truly gods. So that, mine excusing of them, was not, to free them <hi>a
toto,</hi> but <hi>a tanto.</hi> Not to free them vniuersally, from the whole sinne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme;</hi>
(which hath a great latitude, and is a body consisting of many parts
and members: as I purpose,<note place="margin">Lib. 8.</note> God willing, <hi>hereafter</hi> to make plaine) but to
free them from the crime of denying all gods; which is the highest pitch, and
(as it were) the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ead of it. And yet, euen this also, not by peremptorie asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by probable collection, onely out of those heads of their accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which haue beene most inforced against them, by their enemies.</p>
               <p>Now, though they were not guilty of this highest degree of <hi>Atheisme,</hi> in
generally &amp; obstinately denying all gods: yet might they be guilty of many
other inferior degrees of <hi>Atheisme;</hi> for which God might iustly punish them:
and, by their example, teach others to beware of them. For, as it followeth
not, on the one side, that, because they denied their false gods, that therefore
they must needs denie the true God too: so followeth it not, on the other side,
that, because they denied their false gods, they must needs confesse the true.</p>
               <p>For first, they might denie their false gods to be Gods; and yet neuer seeke
further to finde out any other, vpon a meere dulnesse, &amp; negligence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And so liue, without any opinion at all of God. At the least, for the most
part, though totally they could not. As those men, of whom the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
that they were,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they might deny their false gods; &amp; yet therewithall, deny the true

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, they might (in some degree) finde out the true God, and yet
ascribe his works vnto other false gods: as the Heathen did, the ruling of the

               <p>All these wayes (and many more) might those men be impious, against the

themselues, who make it their profession, to professe, <hi>There is no God:</hi> yet do
euidently enough confesse him, in their deedes; though they deny him, in

whereby they idolize themselues; and by that inward feare, which they haue
of another God, aboue themselues. Yea, and sometimes they are driuen to
confesse him in words too: and openly, both to acknowledge and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their former vngodlinesse. Finally, that, though none of all the
<hi>Atheists</hi> should euer haue confessed God; neither verbally, nor really; neither
directly,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 13.</note> nor indirectly: yet that God, <hi>who is faithfull, and cannot deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi>
he confesseth himselfe, by those remarkeable, and exemplarie punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which he notoriously and constantly inflicteth vpon <hi>Atheists;</hi> more

himselfe, both to <hi>be,</hi> and to be vnto the <hi>Atheist,</hi> a professed enemy. So
that, there is no part of all the vniuersall, from God vnto the Deuill, but that
it proclameth God: no part of nature so disordered, or distorted, but that in

in any other,<note place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> hath beene noted and obserued, almost by all the learned: as I
haue <hi>formerly</hi> declared.</p>
               <p>2 In which their allegation,<note place="margin">The Consent of all men in beleeuing a God is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors as an Argument of the truth of it.</note> this may further be obserued (which I haue
purposely reserued, for the close of this first Booke) that the Authors there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
haue not onely related it historically, that such a generall consent
there is, in beleeuing that there is a God: but they haue also pleaded it logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
as a good and a sound Argument, to proue, that <hi>therefore</hi> there is one
indeed: inferring the truth of the thing so beleeued, from the vniuersalitie of
mens consent, in beleeuing it. In which their probation, we may obserue this
<hi>Gradation,</hi> consisting of three degrees. First, that they affirme this generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and agreement of all men, without the dissent of any man whosoeuer, to
be the very voice of nature. Secondly, that they affirme, a generall consent,
in any other matter whatsoeuer it be, to be a good Argument of the truth.
And thirdly, that they affirm, that in this particular truth, which is questioned
by the <hi>Atheist,</hi> it is the strongest Argument, that can be brought to proue it.</p>
               <p>3 For the first steppe of which <hi>Climax,</hi> That this generall consent of all
men, in beleeuing <hi>There is a God;</hi> is not, either any casuall,<note place="margin">To beleeue a God is of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Cap. 3.</note> and accidentall
agreement; nor any politike composition, made by mutuall stipulation: but
the simple and vncorrupted voice of nature, working alike in al men, and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vnto them, with one and the same tongue, though they be of diuers
tongues, it is expressely affirmed, by diuers learned Authors; both <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>

in beleeuing <hi>There is a God,</hi> to be a branch of the Law of Nature,<note place="margin">A generall Consent is an Argument of truth in all things.</note> and

                  <hi>Nature neither saith, nor
doth any thing in vaine.</hi> And therefore, if Nature say, <hi>That there is a God,</hi>
it is not vainely said: but there is surely one indeed. Now, that which all
men affirme, they say it not of themselues; but it is Nature that saith it in
them. For, as I haue shewed out of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Orator, <hi>Consensus omnium,</hi>

                  <hi>est Naturae vox: The Consent of all men, is the voyce of Nature in them.</hi> And
therefore many learned Authors, both of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> doe reckon
such Consent, to be alwayes a concomitant of the truth: yet not following
after it, as an ordinary seruitor; but going before it, as a Gentleman Vsher.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue in the former Booke instructed the <hi>Atheist,</hi> out of
<hi>The voyce of Nature;</hi> and proued vnto him, <hi>That there
is a God,</hi> by that naturall perswasion, which is generally
begotten in the hearts of all men. Which, like a priuate
and domesticall Schoole-master, teacheth the <hi>Atheist</hi>
that Lesson, by a secret suggestion, as it were, the <hi>A, B, C,</hi>
and first elements of Religion. The force and power of
which inward instruction, the very <hi>Atheist</hi> himselfe feeleth sensibly within
him. For, there is no <hi>Atheist</hi> in the world, so obdurate and hardened, but hee
is oftentimes inforced to confesse, <hi>There is a God.</hi> Yea, &amp; that not only <hi>against</hi>
his will, by the stroke of Gods iudgements, which extort an vnwilling confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from him; but also sometimes, <hi>by</hi> his will, and of his owne free motion,
without any violence or outward compulsion, onely by the force of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
perswasion. Nay, there is none of them all, so desperately wicked, but
that, at some time or other, in some sort or other, he will serue some God,
though he pretend to contemne all. Or, if he refuse to serue him; yet hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuse but feare him, euen because he serueth him not: as being conscious
vnto himselfe, euen by Natures inward lessoning, that his seruice is due vnto
him. And that therefore, for his neglect of it, he is subiect to due punishment:
which is a reall confession of him, yea, and that a very strong one. Thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
an operation, hath this inward voyce of Nature, in the hearts of all men,
euen in the wickedest among them.</p>
               <p>Now, hauing thus, in the former Booke,<note place="margin">All Arts leade to God.</note> instructed the <hi>Atheist</hi> in this first
principle of Religion, by the voyce of his owne Nature, as of a domesticall
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:22084:92"/>
and priuate Instructor: in this Booke I intend to bring him out, a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to send him abroad vnto the Heathen Philosophers, as vnto the
Schoole of more publique and expert Teachers. For that, which dame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth but only affirme vpon her bare word, that doe the <hi>Philosophers</hi> both
confirme by reasons, and declare by sensible Demonstrations. And though
none of all those <hi>Arts,</hi> which they inuented, doe purposely propound to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of God, as of their proper subiect; neither any of them haue this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
position [<hi>That there is a God</hi>] for one of their principles, as <hi>Theologie</hi>
hath: Yet is there none of them, but that it affordeth vs some matter or other,
from whence we may collect, that <hi>there needes must be a God.</hi> As we may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently
see, in all the seuerall parts of <hi>Philosophie.</hi> Let me giue you but a taste
of some few, for all the rest: because the Argument is not popular. And
therefore, it is but equall, that my stay vpon it should bee the shorter.</p>

can any part of the world be infinite, if the whole be not. Vnlesse we should

               <p>Let me giue you an instance or two,<note place="margin">Arist. l. 4. Phys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Earth,</hi> that <hi>is bounded and limited with the Water; the Water with the Aire;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:22084:92"/>
the Aire, with the Fire; the fire with the Heauen. The heauen is not bounded, with
any further Body.</hi> How then is the Heauen bounded, if it be not boundlesse?
Why thus. Euery one of the lower heauens is bounded or limited, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

onely the Prerogatiue of the Maker of all things: as <hi>Prosper</hi> very well, and

no <hi>Reason,</hi> nor <hi>Vnderstanding:</hi> as <hi>Birds,</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> and <hi>Fishes,</hi> and such like.

both <hi>Essence,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> too: as we see they

that he, which notes them not, is more worthy to be numbred among beasts,
then among men. Now, if it should be demanded; Why a <hi>Stone</hi> hath not

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> other reason, can be giuen of all this, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that those powers are not in their owne power, to take so many of them,
as they themselues thinke good: but, that they be limited and assigned vnto
them, by a nature farre aboue them: euen the same nature that made them.
And that they therefore <hi>haue</hi> them not; because that Nature <hi>gaue</hi> them
not.</p>
               <p>From whence, there follow these <hi>two Conclusions.</hi> First, that all those fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
faculties and powers, though they be <hi>in</hi> those things, that haue them;
yet they be not <hi>of</hi> those things, that haue them. They haue them, <hi>in</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
but they haue them, not <hi>of</hi> themselues. For then, all would haue all of
them, and none would content themselues with any part, were it neuer so
great. Would a Tree (thinke you) be content to sticke fast in the earth, as a
dead and rotten stake; if it could giue it selfe motion? Surely, no. The blinde
man, in the Gospell, that thought he <hi>saw men walking like vnto Trees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 8. 24.</note> should
surely see Trees walking like vnto men, if they could take vnto themselues
the facultie of mouing. Againe, would a Beast be content, to be so subiect
vnto man, if it could giue it selfe Reason? Or would a Man be content, to
liue here vpon the earth, if he could flee vp into heauen, and make himselfe a
God? Surely, he neuer would. That which <hi>Tertullian</hi> affirmeth of the <hi>Romane</hi>
Emperours, is true also, in all others, that; <hi>Si ipsi,</hi>

certè quidem, homines nunquàm fuissent. If they could haue made themselues
Gods, they would neuer haue continued Men.</hi> And so in all other things, as well
as in these, they would all haue all those faculties, if they could giue them to
themselues. Therefore, seeing that, which hath onely <hi>Being,</hi> cannot giue it
selfe <hi>Life;</hi> and that, which hath onely <hi>Life,</hi> cannot giue it selfe <hi>Sense;</hi> and that
which hath onely <hi>Sense,</hi> cannot giue it selfe <hi>Reason;</hi> this euidently sheweth
vnto all that haue any Reason, that the ampliating, or restrayning of those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:22084:95"/>
indowments, is not in their owne free disposition, or election: but in his
onely power, who freely bestoweth them. This is the first conclusion.</p>
               <p>The second, That seeing those fore-named faculties are not in the power of
the things themselues, that <hi>haue</hi> them; therefore they must needes proceede
from some other power that <hi>gaue</hi> them; and that hath in it selfe, the whole
power of dispensing them. And that can be none other, but a diuine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
power. For, <hi>that nature</hi> must needes be supernaturall and diuine, which
is the fountaine and wel-spring both of <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>Liuing,</hi> and <hi>Mouing,</hi> and
<hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Reason:</hi> and which hath the power, to deriue the streames of those

distinguished by their naturall properties, that some haue onely <hi>being;</hi> some
other, <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>motion;</hi> and others, <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason:</hi> yet doth it not appeare,
that it is only God, that hath so distinguished and distributed those faculties;

should beleeue the reports of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> it hath also begotten <hi>Men,</hi> with
their <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> So that this great worke, which wee ascribe
vnto God; and which we vse as an Argument, to perswade men, that <hi>there is a

done. And therefore doth not leade vs by any consequence, vnto Gods
vnlesse we will acknowledge the Sunne to be God.</p>
               <p>But vnto this obiection I answer: that if the Sunne performe this by his
owne power and vertue, it must then needes bee a God; as performing
that worke, which is proper vnto God. For who can giue <hi>life</hi>
and <hi>motion,</hi> and <hi>sense,</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> vnto things, by his owne power, but onely
the <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Creator</hi> of all things? Who by those very workes declareth
himselfe to be a God. So that our fore-named instances, in leading vs vnto
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:22084:96"/>
the Sunne, doe leade vs vnto a God; if he be the giuer and distributer of those
powers, by his owne strength and power. But, if the Sunne doe this not by
his owne proper power, but onely by the delegated power of his <hi>Maker</hi> and
<hi>Creator,</hi> who vseth him but as his minister: then doe our fore-named instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

vnum: That though he acknowledge him, to be the Maker of all things; yet that
it is, but vnder another, who is farre superior; being the first, and the onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the rest.</hi> So that, both wayes, the limiting and distributing of those
naturall faculties, in such diuers measures, vnto diuers subiects, doe necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leade vnto a God: either vnto the true one; or vnto one in opinion. Which
against the <hi>Atheist,</hi> is fully sufficient. That, by way of supposition. But now,
for our position: it must be resolutely held, that, though the <hi>Sunne</hi> doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
diuers of those great works, in giuing those faculties vnto certaine
bodies, according vnto their seuerall capacities: yet that it neither giueth
them all (for it giueth not <hi>Reason,</hi> which is the chiefest of all) neither yet those
which it giueth, doth it giue, by his owne vertue; but onely by a kinde of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
facultie, which God his Creator hath giuen vnto it, to worke thus and
thus, as the matter is prepared. So that, if the Sunne (the supposed giuer of all
those other faculties) could but take vnto it selfe the facultie of speaking, it
would certainely make the very same protestation, which was made by Saint
<hi>Peter,</hi> in another like matter. <hi>Ye men of Israel, why maruaile ye at this, or why
looke ye so stedfastly on vs?</hi>

                  <hi>as though we, by our owne power, had made this man
to goe. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Iaacob, he hath glorified his Sonne.—
And his name it is, that hath made this man sound.</hi> And this same profession
which the Apostle here maketh, for giuing motion vnto this Lame man,
would the Sunne also make (if it were able to speake) for his giuing of motion
vnto any other thing. Yea,<note place="margin">La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Starrs haue a meane and a power in them, to dispatch their owne motion.
But it is onely God, that hath giuen that power vnto them; Who is both the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,

him, but, <hi>Secundum Deum, hunc mundum gubernantem: But a second Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
of the world, vnder God.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that the Sunne is
not that infinite limitour, which giueth seuerall gifts, and setteth seuerall
bounds, vnto all other things; being it selfe boundlesse; but, that it must be
numbred, among things limited. Yea, and that a great deale more straitly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
then many other things, that seeme inferior vnto it. And this may
euidently be seene, both in his Working-power; and also, in his Mouing-power.</p>
               <p>6 For first,<note place="margin">The Sunne is limited in his working.</note> for his working-power; it is most plaine and euident, that the
Sunne is two wayes restrayned in it, that is both, in the Matter, and in the
Manner of his working. By both which it appeareth, that hee hath not an
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:22084:96"/>
omnipotent, but a limited power in him.</p>
               <p>And first, for the matter. We see this by experience, that it is not in the Suns
power, to put euery forme vpon euery matter: but is confined, to the habilitie
and capacitie of the matter, as it is either prepared, or vnprepared by nature.
The S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nne cannot, by that heate, put hardnesse vpon waxe, by which, hee
putteth hardnesse vpon a stone: Nor, by that heate, put softnesse vpon clay,
by which hee both softneth and dissolueth the Snow. This cannot be done
by him: because the matter will not suffer him. Againe, the Sunne hath not
power to giue euery naturall propertie, vnto euery naturall body. Hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
giue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> vnto a Tree, vpon that hard Rocke, where yet hee giueth <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
vnto a Stone: Neither can hee giue being vnto a Stone, within that soft
Dung-hill, where yet he giueth both being, and Liuing, and Mouing, and
feeling, vnto a Worme. These things, hee can worke in one place; because
the matter is prepared for him: in another hee cannot; because the matter is
vnprepared for such and such a forme. For, hee cannot worke any where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the possibilitie or receptiuitie of his matter. Which euidently sheweth
that the Sunne is not the first and vnlimited limitour, which distributeth
those faculties, as he himselfe pleaseth: but is a meere seruant, that is limited
himselfe, to doe no more then his Master pleaseth. Now, who is it, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth
this power vnto the matter; that some matter should only be capable
of life; some other both of life, and sense; some other (beside these) of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and some of none of these, but onely of simple Being? This distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Sunne cannot make, in euery matter, but onely where the habilitie
thereof will suffer. Therefore, the limitour of this susceptiue power vnto
the matter, in such differing degrees, and measures, and manners, can (in
truth) be none other, but onely that omnipotent <hi>Creator</hi> of the <hi>Matter:</hi> of
whom it is sayd,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 1. 2.</note> in the beginning of Gods Booke; that, <hi>In the beginning,
God made Heauen and Earth: and the Earth was voyde, and without forme.</hi>
God hauing <hi>therefore</hi> made the <hi>matter,</hi> without any certaine forme of his
owne, that it might be capable of euery other forme. And yet, not delegating
so large a power vnto any Creature, as to superinduce any forme whatsoeuer,
but onely as hee limiteth the capabilitie of the matter. And yet, vnto himselfe
he hath reserued an infinite power, to put any forme vpon any matter. Which
hee alwayes findeth plyant, and obsequent to his pleasure, euen against the
proprietie of its owne particular nature.<note place="margin">Euseb. l. 4. De Praepar. c. 8. p. 155.</note> For (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> citeth out of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius)

the Sunne is not able, to worke and effect what it will, where it will; but, like

with such a necessitie, but onely God himselfe? who (as the Apostle expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:22084:97"/>
of men.</hi> Here is plainely, <hi>Iupiter terminalis: the true setter of bounds,
and limits, vnto things:</hi> whose bounds and limits, though the Sunne it selfe
haue no power to alter; yet God, the setter of them, hath. Hee can change
and alter them, at his pleasure. As he plainely gaue good proofe: first, vnto
<hi>Ioshua;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosh. 10. 13.</note> in so holding the Sunne from mouing, that he could not go forward:
and secondly, vnto <hi>Ezechias;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Kin. 20. 11. Eccle. 48. 24.</note> in so withholding, and pulling him, that hee
made him goe backward. Which manifestly sheweth, that the Sunne, in his
mouing, is not in his owne power, but vnder the command of a superior
Ruler: who turneth him, and returneth him, at his owne will and pleasure. So
that, the Sunne, of it selfe, hath not so much scope and liberty in his motion,
as many a man hath: nay, not, as any Beast hath. For they can runne, either
this way, or that way, at their pleasure: but so cannot the Sunne. Hee is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by another; by whom hee is so tied vnto a strict and vnalterable motion,
that <hi>Astronomers</hi> can surely tell (vnto the very minute) all the <hi>Eclipses,</hi> that

Which <hi>Zacharias Mitylenensis</hi> also expressely confirmeth. For hee saith of
the Sunne,<note place="margin">Zach. Mitylen. l. De Mundi Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. Bib. Pat. To. 5. p. 739.</note> that, <hi>Habet motum voluntatis expertem, velut seruus: That his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is involuntarie, like the motion of a seruant:</hi> which must be directed by his

and goe downe into the signes of the Winter, and who, to ascend backe againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the signes of the Summer? Who leadeth him along from the East into the West?
And who fetcheth him againe, from the West into the East? These workes to vs
are wonderfull: but onely to God are possible.</hi> So that the Sunne is so farre from
giuing bounds and limits vnto other things, that it selfe is the most streightly
bounded and limited of all things. And that (as before I noted) not onely in
his <hi>working,</hi> but also in his <hi>moouing.</hi> In his <hi>working:</hi> because (as <hi>Zacharias

as God, the prescriber of order, hath appointed him.</hi> In his <hi>moouing:</hi> because (as
in the same place he affirmeth) <hi>Continuum faciens motum &amp; modulatum, non
excedit terminos, ab Opifice sibi impositos. Though hee bee in a continuall and
perpetuall motion; yet doth he not exceede those bounds, that are praescribed him
by that workeman that made him.</hi> So that God alone is the limiter of the Sun:
and consequently of euery other thing:<note place="margin">Act. 17. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Giuing vnto all, both life, and breath,

more properly be called the Sunne, for doing those things as the principall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
then the Sunne can be called God, for doing them none otherwise,
but onely as Gods instrument. For, those things, though instrumentally they
be wrought by the Sun; yet are they originally wrought, onely by God. And

all artificiall faculties. There is no man, adorned and indowed with al of them.

but dispenseth them by degrees, as he himselfe pleaseth. Which may as eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
be seene, in his dispensing of Knowledges, of Arts, and of Sciences; as
as in any of the fore-named naturall faculties. For, though all the seuerall Arts
and Sciences in the world (which are in number infinite) haue beene deuised,
and inuented by the wit of man: yet had neuer any man so infinite a wit, as
to know and vnderstand the depth of all of them. Nay, no man of many of
them. Nay, no man of any of them. No, not of that one Art, which by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
is professed, and wherein he desireth to bee accounted excellent. All
which notwithstanding, are so limited by God, that they are not, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
or coincident: yet is our capacity so much straitlier limited, that it
cannot reach to any of their limits. Let me insist a while vpon the seuerall
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:22084:99"/>
steppes of this <hi>gradation:</hi> and giue some light, by instances, in euery one of
them.</p>
               <p>That no man hath the knowledge of all Arts and Sciences, but is still

some few of them: we may euidently see, if we will take a suruey, either of
<hi>the Mechanicall,</hi> or of <hi>the liberall Arts.</hi> First for the <hi>Mechanicall,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarie
Arts: wee see by experience, that the Plowman knoweth not, what
belongeth vnto the Ship; nor the Shipman, vnto the Plow. But, as it is in
the <hi>Poet.</hi>

                  </q>
Nay, euen in those inferior and ministeriall Arts, which are subiected vnto
others, as to their <hi>Architectonicals;</hi> wee see, by like experience, that all of
them are limited, within their owne precincts: and none of them acquainted
with the mysteries of others: No not, though they all depende vpon the
same head and principall. As namely, for example. The Art of the <hi>Sadler,</hi>
although it be ordayned vnto the art of the <hi>Rider;</hi> yet hath not the Sadler
any skill in Riding, but onely in making of Saddles to ride in. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
downward. The Rider hath not the Art of making his owne Saddle,
nor his Bridle, nor his Horse-shooe, nor his Bit: but there be seuerall Arts
belonging to all these; and yet all of them subseruing vnto the Art of Riding:
whereof all they be ignorant: as the Rider, of all these: and each of these
of others. And so it is likewise, in both our former instances. The Ship-wright,
though hee haue the art of making a ship; yet hath hee not the art
of guiding a ship: No more then the Saylor hath the art of the <hi>Ship-maker.</hi>
And the same we may likewise see, in the Plowman; which is our second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.<note place="margin">Plato. l. 2. De Repub. p. 550.</note>

plowing. Now, who is it, that thus distributeth, and limiteth these meaner,
and inferior arts vnto men? It is onely God himselfe, by the Heathens owne
confession. <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> affirmeth, that, though all those men fore-named,

Some, sensible;</hi> and <hi>some intellectuall,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual.</hi> In all which, wee
may see an infinite auiditie: and such, as cannot be satisfied, with any finite
Obiect. Let me giue you, in euery head, some Examples, to illustrate it.</p>

And they be, the <hi>Appetites</hi> of <hi>Eating,</hi> of <hi>Drinking,</hi> and of <hi>Sleeping.</hi> And
yet, none of them all, is able to content the <hi>appetite</hi> of the soule. As King

hee insinuateth, that though the Belly may be filled, both with eating
and drinking; yet the appetite of the Soule, is not filled, with either of
them. And wee see his obseruation to bee verified, euen to sense, in
the daily practice of Gluttons, and Drunkards: who lose not their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
with the filling of their stomacks; but, euen then, when their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
are distended, and full; yet their appetites are ieiune, and emptie; and

it is likewise, in the third of his instances: <hi>the appetite of sleeping:</hi> which is,

also obserueth in it: who, so elegantly characterizeth the drowsie-headed
<hi>Slug gards,</hi> that no Character in <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> is more graphically described.
Which he hath done, in the forme of a short Colloquie or Dialogue, by

in the Sluggard, very earnestly intreating him, that hee would not molest
him, but <hi>yet</hi> a while permit him, to haue <hi>a little further sleepe, a little longer
slumber, a little more folding of the hands together.</hi> And finally, hee plainely
threateneth him, that if hee continued in that Lethargie of his <hi>sleeping, his
pouerty would presently ouertake him, as a Traueller; and seaze vpon him, like
an armed Souldier.</hi> And yet would not all this serue the turne. Hee was so

They cannot be satisfied, no more then the former. But euen, when they haue
what they would, they yet still call for more. And this also, King <hi>Salomon</hi>
illustrateth, by two direct instances; in <hi>Seeing,</hi> and in <hi>Hearing. The eye</hi> (sayth
he) <hi>is not filled with seeing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>nor the eare with hearing.</hi> The Eye, I grant, may
bee wearied with seeing: but filled it cannot bee. As <hi>Musaeus</hi> expreslie
noteth:
<q>
                     <l>Intuens defessus sum; satietatem non inveni aspiciendi.</l>

                  </q>
For,<note place="margin">Pro. 27. 20.</note> as <hi>the Graue and Destruction cannot be filled, so cannot the eyes of a man
be satisfied:</hi> sayth <hi>Salomon</hi> againe, in another place. And so likewise the <hi>Eare.</hi>
It may be wearied with hearing: but yet <hi>it</hi> cannot be filled neither. As <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
likewise expresly obserueth. <hi>Aures suscipiunt voces omnes: nunquam verò

                  <note place="margin">Xenophon, l. 1. de sact. Socrat. p. 166.</note> Our eares do receiue all manner of voices: and yet be there none of
them, that be able to fill them. And the like may bee sayd, of all the rest: as I
partly haue shewed before, in the <hi>Tast:</hi> and that, both in our <hi>eating,</hi> and also in
our <hi>drinking.</hi> Whereof <hi>Tully</hi> hath giuen vs a very notable instance, in the
<hi>Persian</hi> King <hi>Xerxes:</hi> who, hauing tired himselfe out, with all ancient, and

so euidently against their outward profession, but that their Reason was

               <p>And the like may be seene in the ambition of old men: who (contrary to

a very false position: that, <hi>In senecta, lucrari magis delectat, quam honore affici:
That all men, in their age, are rather delighted with gaine, then with fame; with

               <p>And so doth it of duty too: yea, and that in a very high degree. Whereof

so inflamed with the rage of ambition, and carried so violently through all the

this execrable sentence:

                     <l>If Iustice may be violate, for any cause at all,</l>
                     <l>Then surely, for a Kingdomes sake, this violence may fall.</l>

                  </q>
Thereby plainely declaring, that the ambition of <hi>honour</hi> is more violent then
any other: breaking all the bonds of duty, both to iustice and piety. Which
yet in his brother, may be seene much more plainely. For him <hi>Seneca</hi> bringeth
in with another sentence, as impious as his brothers was, and a great deale
worse:

Whereby it plainely appeareth, how immoderate the desire of glory and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
is: contemning all the bonds of all the strictest duties that are betweene
either God, or Man, and vs.</p>
               <p>And, as ambition leadeth men, to transgresse and violate all the bounds of

<hi>Quorum contemplatione, nullus expleri potest animus: With the contemplation
whereof, it is vnpossible that the minde should euer bee satisfied.</hi> So that, no
part of learning (no nor all of it, together) is able to fill the minde. When a
man hath once setled his appetite vpon it.</p>
               <p>Thus all the Appetites of man doe carry him headlong, beyond all the
bound both of vertue and reason. And yet, when he hath followed them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he be tired with them, he can finde no sound contentment in any one of
them. Take King <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe, for an example of examples, in all of them.
For so he seemeth to propose himselfe, in euery one of the fore-named instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For he ingenously confesseth, that one while he set his minde vpon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,<note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 1 2 3 4 5 6</note>
but on pleasure, and to passe his time merrily, in pleasance and iollity.
But he found himselfe quickly to be wearied with that, and to grow into so
great a dislike of all mirth, that he sayd vnto <hi>Laughter, Thou art madnesse.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
another while he gaue himselfe wholly vnto <hi>Eating and Drinking.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and <hi>Fishing.</hi> Then to pompe in great <hi>House-keeping:</hi> entertaining
a huge traine of seruants, and followers. Then, another while, to priuatenesse
and heaping vp of <hi>Riches.</hi> Another while, to <hi>the study of learning and Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
And thus was he driuen to shift and change his desire, from one thing
vnto another, finding solid content in neuer a one of them: but (after some
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:22084:110"/>
small experience) great irkesomenesse in them all. So that, his poore soule
(like the Doue, which was sent out of the Arke of <hi>Noe</hi>) could finde no sure
footing vpon any one of them. Whereupon, he pronounceth of them all,
without exception, that there is nothing in them but <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation.</hi>
Thus, all the appetites of man, though they be almost innumerable, yet are all
of them vnsatiable;<note place="margin">Pro. 30. 15.</note> and doe, all, with <hi>Agurs</hi> horseleech, cry nothing but <hi>Giue,

                  <hi>inani labore discurrens, fatigetur; non satietur. It commeth to passe,
that the minde of man, wandring ouer the world, through diuers delightfull and

and wasted out, is surfeted, and yet not satisfied with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8 Now, what is the end of all this long discourse,<note place="margin">God is able to fill all our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.</note> but onely that, which I
noted in the beginning of the Treatise? That seeing God hath made the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
of man, of such an infinite extent in euery branch of it, that none of all
these obiects is able to content it, which are supposed to be the most naturall
vnto it; that therefore there must needes bee some supernaturall Obiect ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for it; which is able in euery corner to fill it: or else it must bee vnfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
which were to bring a <hi>vacuum</hi> and <hi>emptinesse</hi> into the workes of God.
Which is vtterly absurde. For as God in his prouidence did neuer make any
belly so great, but that he prouided sufficient meate to fill it; yea, euen the
great belly of that great beast <hi>Behemoth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 40. 10. 15.</note> which himselfe so greatly magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
so likewise, in his wisedome, would he neuer haue made a mans appetite
so great, but that he hath appointed some obiect that can fill it: yea, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
corner of it. Now, that the whole world is not able to doe. As may
bee well vnderstood, by this Hierogliphicall conceit: That <hi>the world
is of a circular forme:</hi> but the heart of a man is of a <hi>triangular.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as if wee should put a circle into a Triangle, we can neuer so fill it, but
that all the corners will be empty in it: so if we should put the whole world
into a mans heart; yet could it neuer fill it, nor reach into euery corner of it.
And therefore the onely obiect that is able to fill this three cornered heart,
cannot be any thing else,<note place="margin">1. Io. 3. 20.</note> but onely the <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>vndiuided Trinitie.</hi> This is
an all-filling obiect, that is <hi>greater then our heart:</hi> and therefore is easily able
to fill it,<note place="margin">Psal. 23. 5.</note> and to radiate into euery corner of it. Yea, so to fill a mans appetite,
in euery chanell of it, vntill, like <hi>Dauids Cup, it euen runne ouer.</hi> For he is able
to fill all our naturall appetites,<note place="margin">Psal. 145. 16.</note> both of <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> and <hi>sleeping,</hi> and
such like. For,<note place="margin">Psal. 127. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>He openeth his hand, and filleth with his blessing, euery liuing
thing.</hi> And <hi>He</hi> it is, that <hi>giueth vnto his beloued sleepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And,<note place="margin">Psal. 81. 10.</note> though the mouth of our appetite doe gape neuer so wide; yet hee
openeth his hand wider,<note place="margin">Psal. 17. 14.</note> and filleth both the <hi>mouth,</hi> and the <hi>belly, with his
hidden treasure.</hi> And so likewise, for our sensible appetites, of <hi>Hearing, See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>Tasting,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 9.</note> and the rest: hee can easily fill them too. For, he hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
such excellent things for vs, as <hi>neither Eye hath seene, nor Eare hath heard,
nor yet, by the heart of man can be conceiued.</hi> He can fill all our intellectuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 4.</note>
both of <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Treasure,</hi> and <hi>Pleasure.</hi> For he hath

prouided for vs,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 4.</note>

fulnesse of ioy;<note place="margin">Ps. 16. 11.</note> and, at his right hand, are pleasures for euer more.</hi> Thus (as the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> noteth) God can,<note place="margin">Ps. 36. 7. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Replere in bonis, de siderium nostrum: He can, euen

                  <hi>There is nothing in heauen that he desireth, but him; nor any thing
on earth, in comparison of him.</hi> He fixed his whole desire vpon God: because
he alone could fill the whole of it, without any diminution. As the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
againe, in another place, confesseth: <hi>I will behold thy face, in righteousnesse:

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 17 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I shall be satisfied with thine image.</hi> God is a fantasme, that
can fill the fantasie; and an Obiect, that can still the appetite. Which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the world can doe, without him; no, not the whole world, nor

<hi>The first cause of all thing;</hi> I will fashion the argument into the forme of a
<hi>Sorites;</hi> wherein we may ascend, by foure steppes, and degrees, vnto the very
presence, and intuitiue vision of God. The first of them is this, <hi>That there is

<hi>Non enìm est, vel cogitari potest, vt sit aliquid, non per aliquid:</hi> sayth
<hi>Anselmus: It cannot be imagined, that there should be any thing, which hath

And so likewise <hi>Tully. Nullius rei, Causa remota, reperiri potest origo. Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

And therefore, in another place, hee peremptorily pronounceth, <hi>That nothing
can be made, without his Cause: Illud exploratum habeto, Nihil fieri posse, sine

And thereupon, <hi>Tully</hi> derideth it for a grosse and a palpable absurdity, and a

is made without a Cause, is to say, it hath a being, and yet no power of being.

                  <hi>Causa</hi> is defined to be, <hi>cuius vi, res est: A Cause is a power, whereby euery

               <p>So that, for the truth of this first position, that <hi>euery thing in Nature hath a
Cause of his being:</hi> you see it, to be cleerly put out of al question, by the consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
testimonies of many learned men. Yea, &amp; the most of them, no way inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

               <p>2 And therefore, let vs now proceede vnto the second; <hi>That nothing in
nature can be the Cause of it selfe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nothing can be the Cause of it selfe.</note> Which is a position, as euidently true, as
that <hi>Nothing can be the Maker of it selfe.</hi> For (as a Christian Philosopher

which maketh any thing, must needes be actually in being: that which is but in

thing to make it selfe, as it is at the same time, to haue both being, and no being.</hi>

The Reasons, wherefore nothing can be the cause of it selfe, be principally two.
The first, because, euery cause is a seuerall thing, in nature from his owne effect.
The <hi>Cause,</hi> and his <hi>Effect,</hi> are so by nature seuered, that they cannot bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.

Yea, and <hi>Plato</hi> likewise expressely confirmeth it: not resting in the bare po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:<note place="margin">Plato in Hippia maiore. p. 115.</note>

one nature, and that, which is of the cause, is of another. For, the cause is not the

a thing different from his efficient. Therefore, a cause is not a cause

why nothing can be the cause of it selfe: because then, it should differ from
it selfe, and should not be the same thing with it selfe.</p>

the Cause of his being, without it selfe: sauing onely God himselfe, who
hath no cause of his being: but is himselfe all one with his owne being:<note place="margin">Iohn 5 26.</note> as

liuing, but the very same <hi>identity</hi> with its liuing: so God is not the Cause of
his owne being, but one and the same thing with his being.</p>
               <p>3 Now,<note place="margin">There is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Causes but one first cause.</note> if nothing can be the Cause of it selfe; then must euery thing
needes haue a cause without it selfe, which is another thing from it selfe. For,
we see by experience, that there dayly be produced, many strange and notable
effects in the world: which all of them proceed not from one and the same
cause: and yet none of them is brought forth without his cause. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it commeth, in this place, to be discussed; <hi>Whether, among those Causes,
there be no first Cause at all, but an endlesse proceeding and going on, in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum?</hi>
or, <hi>whether, among them, there be many first Causes?</hi> or, <hi>whether, there be
but one which is Causa causarum,</hi> that is, <hi>The true Cause of all the rest, and
whereof all other Causes are but mere Effects?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first of which three problemes, were may dayly see by sense, how
one Cause produceth, and begetteth another; and that, another; and that,
another: and, that euery one of these, though it bee a cause of some inferior
effect; yet is it an effect of his owne superior Cause. As for example: the
beating of the Sunne vpon the Earth, worketh in it an <hi>heate;</hi> that heate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth

both in men and beasts; that nourishment begetteth that <hi>Semen genitale,</hi>
whereby yong ones are begotten, in all their seuerall kindes: and so from
generation, to generation, continued. Now, in this connexion and <hi>series</hi> of

The whole summe of whose reason, is, in effect, thus much: <hi>Whatsoeuer thing
hath being, must needs haue it, by Something. And that thing, which giueth it
being, must needs be, either some one speciall thing asunder, or else many things
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:22084:115"/>
together. If many things concurre, to giue being vnto any thing; then must
they needs be such, as that either all of them haue their being, from some one
other thing; or, that all of them haue their being, euery one of himselfe; or
that all of them haue their being, euery one from another, by a kind of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
and mutuall power. Now, if all those many-things do themselues
receiue their being from any other One-thing; then are not all things made by
those many-things; but rather by that one-thing, which made all those many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Now againe, If all those many-things, haue euery one of them his being
of it selfe;</hi>

                  <hi>then must there needs be one certaine power or Nature of Selfe-being;
by participation whereof, they all haue their being of themselues. And
then, they must needs be, all of them, only by that One-thing, by which they do all
receiue their selfe-being. Therefore, all things haue their being more truely
from that one-thing, then from those supposed many-things, which themselues do
receiue all their being from that One-thing. As for that other opinion; that
many things should mutually giue, each to other, his being; that is cleane against
all reason. For it is a senselesse imagination, that any thing should from that
receiue his owne being, vnto which it selfe hath giuen a being.</hi> A very good,
and a sound reason; though somewhat, perhaps, perplexed vnto the vulgar

Cause: which can be nothing else, but God: which is the summe and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the fourth, and last paragraph.</p>
               <p>4 Now,<note place="margin">That first and supreme Cause, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but God.</note> if euery thing that is, must needs haue a Cause: and, if nothing
can be the Cause of it selfe; and, if, among all the Causes, there can bee but
one first, and principall Cause; which is the true Cause of all the rest, and of
all those Effects which proceed from all of them: then must needes that first
Cause be nothing else, but God. For, what can that be, which giueth being
vnto all things,<note place="margin">Damasc. l. 1. de Orthod fid. c. 12. p. 184.</note> but onely God? whom <hi>Damascene</hi> calleth, <hi>Infinitum quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

                  </hi> which
out of his fulnesse, imparteth their being vnto all other things, as the Ocean
doth his waters, vnto fountaines and riuers. For, if this first Cause, which
hath giuen their being vnto all the innumerable things of this world, bee
something else, and not God: then, what hath God done? or, what hath God
to do? to whom hath God giuen any being? or, how can hee possibly be a
God, which hath giuen being vnto nothing? or, how can that bee any other
thing then God, which hath giuen their being vnto all things in the world?
Therefore, whosoeuer yeeldeth, that there is a <hi>first cause,</hi> hee must needes
yeeld, by consequence, that, that <hi>first cause is God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this we may see verified, by a generall <hi>consent,</hi> both of <hi>Christians,</hi> and
<hi>Heathens.</hi> Of whom, some doe call this first Cause, by such titles and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations,
as doe necessarily insinuate, that it must needes be God. Some
collect it, by such reasons, as doe necessarily conclude it. And some, in direct
and expresse termes, affirme it. For the first of which three heads, to wit, the
titles, that are giuen to this first Cause, <hi>Palingenius</hi> (as before I shewed) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

or not of another. If it be mooued by such a thing as is mooued of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we must come, by necessity, vnto a first moouer, which is not mooued by any
other. For it is vnpossible, to goe still on for euer, in those things that are
moued by another. Because, in those things that are infinite, there can none of
them be first.</hi> And therefore, where there is granted to be any first thing,
there cannot be held to be an infinite proceeding.</p>

these examples. <hi>Baculus mouet lapidem, &amp; mouetur a manu, quae ab homine
mouetur. The Staffe moues the stone, the hand moues the staffe, the man moues
the hand:</hi> and the man is moued (in some sort) of himselfe. For (as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

                  <hi>motu mouetur interiore, &amp; suo. Euery
liuing thing is moued, by an internal motion of his owne.</hi> So that the summe of
those two fore-named Reasons, which I haue aboue set downe in their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
owne words, is (in effect) thus much. That, <hi>Whatsoeuer thing is moued
must needs be moued by something: and that thing, must either be moued by
it selfe, or by some other thing. By it selfe can no inferior or second thing
be moued, but alwayes by some former and superior. For, as it subsisteth not by
it selfe, but by another; so moueth it also, not it selfe, but by another. Motum

not vnto his owne power, but to his Author and first Mouer. So that no infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
thing is moued of it selfe, but onely by the power of the supreme and first
Mouer. Now, if all these sensible and inferior things be moued of some other
(as wee plainly see they are,) then may we, by them, ascend, as by steppes and
degrees, from the lower to the higher, vntill we come at last, vnto that first
Mouer. For, in those things that are moued by another, wee cannot proceede in
infinitum; but must, at last, stay in one, which is the Mouer of all the other
and yet it selfe is moued by none other, but hath both his motion, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of himselfe. And therefore must needs be God.</hi> This is the whole summe

<hi>That the contemplation of these secondarie motions, doe leade vs, by necessitie,

                  <note place="margin">Aquin. 1. Quaest. 2. Art. 3. p. 5.</note> Yea (and as <hi>Aquinas</hi> very wittily obserueth, as well in <hi>Motions</hi>
as in <hi>causes) There can be no Second, if there be no First;</hi> no inferior, if there
be no superior; no posterior, if no prior; nay, no last, if no first. And this
holdeth, not onely in these relatiue denominations, but also in the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of the very things themselues. So that, the motions of these inferior
Bodies, which we see, by sense, must leade vs, of necessitie, either to grant
a <hi>first Mouer:</hi> who is the Author of all the motion in the world: and
therefore must needs be God: or else, to yeeld, in motion, an infinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding:

Whom, though we doe not see with the Eyes of the body; yet may we
easily collect by Reason,<note place="margin">Cic. l 2 de. Nat. Deor. p. 215.</note> the Eye of the minde. To illustrate this point, by
that familiar comparison, which the Orator pointeth at, in explication of
this Reason. We see, by experience, in a Clocke (which is, as at were, an
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:22084:120"/>
Artificiall Heauen, measuring out vnto vs the diuisions of time) that euery
Wheele is moued euery one of them by another, vntill at last we be brought
vnto the waight it selfe, which moues them all together. Whither when
we be come, we can proceede no further by sense; and therefore, must col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the rest by reason. Now, Reason plainely teacheth vs, that though the
waight doe moue all the wheeles of it selfe; yet that it could not tie it selfe
vnto the line: but that, that must needs be done, by some other thing. And
that therefore, there must needs haue beene some Author, and contriuer of
that cunning peece of worke: who first conceiued in himselfe, by a mentall
<hi>Idea,</hi> the whole reason and conueiance of all these seuerall motions; and
then accordingly disposed all the wheeles, and waights, into their seuerall
places. So that, the motion of the wheeles, in euery Clock, doth manifestly
tell vs, that there must needs haue beene an Author of that curious worke:
whose artificiall workemanship and contriuing, is that, which hath giuen,
vnto all those wheeles, their motion. And, as it is in a Clocke (which I
called before an Artificiall Heauen, because it measureth vnto vs the diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of time) so is it also in the Heauens themselues: which may as fitly be
called a naturall Clock, for their measuring, by their motions, the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of time. We see, by experience, in them, that all these inferior and elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
Bodies, doe receiue their motions from the Heauens, their superiors:
and so likewise, euen in the Heauens themselues, that the lower is still mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by his next higher, vntill wee come, by degrees, vnto the highest of all,
called <hi>Primum mobile;</hi> that is, <hi>the first moueable body,</hi> which moueth all the
rest. Now, when wee are come thither, sense can leade vs no further. But
yet Reason can. For then, we must collect, that as the wheeles in a Clock
could not set themselues on mouing; but that this must needs be the worke
of their <hi>Maker:</hi> so likewise the Heauens, though they moue without all
ceasing; yet haue not taken vnto themselues their motion, but haue had it
giuen them,<note place="margin">Arist. l. 2. de Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat. c. 10. To. 1. p. 676.</note> by their <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Mouer.</hi> For, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> truely teacheth,
<hi>Si motio cietur, necesse est, praeesse motorem aliquem: Wheresoeuer there is
motion, there must needes haue beene some Mouer before,</hi> and some Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and guider of that motion, from whom, at the first, it receiued his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
So that, <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> doth necessarily imply, that there is a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

all motions, is onely that motion, whereby a thing moueth it selfe. This is both
the most ancient, and the most potent motion.</hi> Now, there is nothing in the
world, that moueth of it selfe, but onely God himselfe. No not, euen the

Thus, that which before hee shadowed, vnder the name of <hi>mens,</hi> hee plainely
now expresseth, vnder the name of God: making him the first <hi>mouer,</hi> and
Creator of the world. And so likewise doth <hi>Plato.</hi> For hee saith, that there
is a certaine <hi>Anima,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato, l. 10. de Leg. p. 875.</note> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> which doth, <hi>in omnibus, quae mouentur, habitare,

hee alter <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> his terme; yet hee meanes the selfe same thing. For,
as <hi>Parmenides</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">Laert, in vita Parmenidis, p. 311.</note> 
                  <hi>Anima &amp; mens idem sunt: Though they differ in

this <hi>Anima,</hi> which is the <hi>mouer</hi> of all things, to be God, and nothing
else. <hi>Deumesse, omnes arbitramur. We all suppose, There is a God.</hi> And so
likewise doth <hi>Theophrastus:</hi> who denieth, euen <hi>Nature</hi> it selfe to bee the first

motion vnto a superior and more diuine power.<note place="margin">Theophra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and a superior power.</hi> Now, what is there either better, or superior to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but onely the God of <hi>Nature?</hi> Yea, and a little before, hee expresly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that this first <hi>mouer,</hi> and <hi>Beginner,</hi> is indeede nothing else, but the very
God of Nature. <hi>Diuinum omnium principium existit, per quod &amp; sunt, &amp;
permanent vniuersa: That first Beginner, from whence all things haue both
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:22084:122"/>
their consisting, and existing, is a diuine power and Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this whole Chapter. All those Arguments, which <hi>Tullie</hi>
bringeth, to proue the <hi>Soule to be immortall,</hi> are much more concludent, to
proue God to be <hi>aeternal,</hi> whose <hi>Motion</hi> is both <hi>of himselfe</hi> and <hi>perpetuall.</hi>
For, there he plainely telleth vs, that there is a certaine thing, which moueth

it neuer deserteth it selfe. it neuer desisteth to be moued:</hi> and consequently must

it selfe (and is mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d of no other) is aeternal:</hi> Now, none of all these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which here hee setteth downe doe agree vnto the soule, but onely in
some comparison. For, the Soule hath neither his motion of it selfe, nor yet
giueth motion vnto all other things, nor is <hi>aeternal</hi> or without all begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
This is proper and peculiar vnto God himselfe alone, whose title is,
<hi>The aeternall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 33.</note> As for the Soule, though it may be called <hi>Immortall;</hi> yet can
it not, <hi>aeternall. Immortall</hi> it is, because it hath no ende: but <hi>aeternall</hi> it is
not, because it had a beginning. But God is truely the mouer of himselfe,
and the giuer of motion vnto all other things. He is truely <hi>aeternall,</hi> both
without all beginning, and without all ending, as one that hath all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

forsake himselfe.

the generall confession of all men, both <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Heathens.</hi> For our

that God, for this cause, hath oftentimes threatened to punish men,

that his <hi>Sinne</hi> was both the cause of his former <hi>Sicknesse,</hi> and would bee also
of his future, if he sinned any more.</p>
               <p>And, that <hi>Sinne</hi> is indeed the true cause of diseases, wee may see it plainely
verified, in all these memorable <hi>Sicknesses,</hi> that are recorded vnto vs, in the
<hi>Holy Scriptures. The Botches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. 10.</note> wherewith the <hi>Egyptians wery smitten,</hi> was, for
their rebellion against God, and their oppression of his People. The <hi>Leprosie</hi>
wherewith the Prophetesse <hi>Miriam</hi> was smitten,<note place="margin">Num. 12. 8. 10.</note> was, for being so enuious
against the Prophet <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 25. 1. 2. 9.</note> The <hi>Pestilence,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Israelites</hi> were

<hi>idolatrie</hi> with their prophane god.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 5. 6 9.</note> The <hi>Emerods,</hi> wherewith <hi>the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>
were smitten, was, for their <hi>Impietie</hi> in detayning the <hi>Arke of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so generally, in all the rest. There is almost, in no place, any mention
of any greiuous and exemplary <hi>Sicknesse,</hi> but there is, in the same place, some
mention of that Sinne, for whose punishment it was sent. In which forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
instances, we may obserue these <hi>two things.</hi> First, that, not onely <hi>the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
and <hi>leprosie,</hi> and such like grieuous and infectious <hi>Sicknesses</hi> (which are
called <hi>Morbi Sontici,</hi> that is, <hi>mischeiuous diseases</hi>) are the scourges,<note place="margin">A. Gellius. l. 20. c. 1. p. 280. b.</note> and strokes
of God: but also all other inferior diseases, as <hi>Emerods,</hi> &amp; <hi>Botches,</hi> and such like
smaller annoyances,<note place="margin">Deut 28. 27.</note> as euen hee himselfe professeth in another place. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:22084:124"/>
that those diseases are sent by God vnto men, to correct and chasten them,
for their sinne.</p>
               <p>Neither is this the testimony of the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> onely, but also of the
<hi>Heathens,</hi> euen in their owne Histories. Wherein, wee may obserue, that
whensoeuer there befell them, the publike calamity of any generall sicknesse,
they still imputed it vnto their sinnes, prouoking the anger of some or other
of their gods. As may be manifestly shewed,<note place="margin">Herod. l. 1. p. 51.</note> by manifold instances. <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
ascribeth that greiuous sicknesse which was sent vpon the <hi>Scythians,</hi> to
their sacrilege,<note place="margin">Pausan. in Achaicis, p. 279.</note> in sacking the Temple of <hi>Venus. Pausanias</hi> ascribeth that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring

was smitten with the leprous infection, hee was surely a profane person; and
had (doubtles) committed some great and grieuous sinne, against their god,
<hi>the Sunne:</hi> though they knew not what it was. And therefore, they banished
them, out of all their Cities: collecting from the sicknesse, the stroke of
Gods Iustice, euen in an vnknowne Cause. And this, which we haue seene in
the Histories of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> wee may see yet more plainely, in the Histories
of the <hi>Romanes.</hi>

                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> ascribeth that destroying plague, which happened among

the condemnation of <hi>Manlius Capitolinus,</hi> vnto that iniustice, which
was vsed in his death. And thus haue, euen the Heathen, bene taught, in the
very Schoole of Nature, without going any further, that the true cause in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
of all sicknesse and diseases, are onely mens sinnes, prouoking Gods
Iustice to take vengeance of their wickednesse.<note place="margin">Psal. 38. 3.</note> As <hi>Dauid</hi> plainely confesseth

punish their disobedience, with diuers greiuous sicknesses. Of which places

God threatned to plague, with an incurable sicknesse, which should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust

sent accordingly vnto him, it dispatcht him not at once (as it did <hi>Herod,</hi>
and <hi>Antiochus</hi>) but,<note place="margin">Acts 12. 23. 2. Mac. 9. 9.</note> held him in greiuous torments, for the space of two
whole yeares. Now, thus many threates of so many sicknesses, God would
neuer haue made, but that he knew his owne power, and could command all
maner of diseases, at his wil &amp; pleasure. For, to threaten, is ridiculous; but euen
among vs men, where, there is not a power, to inflict, what one doth threaten?</p>

that it manifestly appeareth, that God is both mindfull and true of his

him, and that, for very care, his heart fayled within him.</hi> So that, there is none
of all the fore-named sicknesses, which he threatened in word, but he sheweth
that hee had power to inflict the same in deed. By all which memorable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
it euidently appeareth, that there is no sicknesse at all, neither so great
nor so little, but that God can inflict it, both when, and where he will.</p>

the <hi>Philistims</hi> would faine imagine: but (as they found vnto their cost) they

and blasting our fruites,<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 22.</note> with vnwholesome dewes and mildewes, as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

                  <note place="margin">2. Kings, 19. 35.</note> and,

Gods scourge: though some men do impute it vnto the corrupnes of the ayre, or
to the vncleannesse of our meates, or to some one diuesity or other in our bodies.</hi>
But the true, and the first cause, indeed, is onely God. For, as <hi>Stobaeus</hi> hath
noted, out of <hi>Euripides:</hi>

Nay alwayes by Gods iudgment. And then, most of all, when they come by
our fault; whether our fault in feeding, or our fault in liuing; they still come
by Gods sending. For as the Tragicall Poet hath very truly noted:

many Sicknesses, that, beside the disor'red and peccant humors of mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which are the materiall cause of all Sicknesse, there is in it beside, the
speciall stroke of Gods hand. Whereunto they are inforced to reduce it, as
vnto his true and proper Efficient. Because they see it oftentimes to fall out
that many diseases, which they, at the first, thought to be but slight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible;
yet doe proue, in the end, to be mortall, and incurable: doe
they all what they can; the power of their medicines, being manifestly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
from their naturall working, in the body of <hi>this</hi> man, which yet worke
most kindly, in the body of <hi>another</hi> man. For (as <hi>Solon</hi> obserueth, to this

summe of this Chapter, and of euery Branch of it. First, naming the Cause
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:22084:129"/>
of his sicknesse, to be <hi>Sinne</hi> Secondly, the Effect of his sinne, to be Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Thirdly, the fruite of Gods anger, to be his sicknesse. And fourthly, the
forme of his sicknesse, to be (as it were) the stroke of an Arrow. Now (to
forme this whole discourse, vnto our present purpose:) If the true cause of
sicknesse, be onely Sinne against God: If God himselfe doe threaten, for this
cause to send sicknesse: If he truly hath performed, as much as he hath threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
And, if sicknesse be nothing else, but the <hi>Stroke of Gods hand:</hi> Then
must there needs be a God, which worketh all those things. But all the fore-named
points haue sufficiently beene proued, not onely by Scriptures, and
the doctrine of <hi>Christians;</hi> but also by the testimonie, euen of the very <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi>
And therefore, <hi>That there is a God,</hi> doth neede no further proofe. This
first consideration of <hi>Physick,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Sicknesse,</hi> is proofe more then
ynough.</p>

of God,</hi> either to correct men for sinning, or to restruine men
from sinning; I haue already proued in the former Chapter.
Now, that the Remedies of diseases are also sent from God,
and from none other author, I take to proue in this Chapter. A thing, which
followeth, in a manner, vpon the granting of the former. For, if wee grant,
that God is the Author of diseases; we must also grant, that he is the Author
of Remedies. Or else, we shall be forced to yeeld vnto the one, of these two
grosse absurdities: Either, that there be two Gods; or else, that something,
which is not God, yet is better then God. For, if we yeeld, that diseases come
from one Author, and their Remedies from another; then doe wee make two
diuers Authors: <hi>Duo Principia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plut. l. De Iside. To. 2. p. 190.</note> 
                  <hi>Two Principles,</hi> and <hi>two Gods,</hi> as <hi>Zoroastres</hi> did.
And if we hold, that that Author, from whome Remedies doe come, is not
God; then hold we, that something is better then God. For, it is better to
giue Remedies, then it is to giue diseases: as it is better to giue good things,
then it is, to giue euill. So that, except God be the Author of Remedies, as
well as of diseases, he shall not be the Soueraigne fountaine of Goodnesse,
but shall haue a more base and inferior office, then some of his owne crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And so, God shall not be God: But that other, which is the giuer of
good things;<note place="margin">Plato, l. 2 De Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. p 554.</note> shall be God. For, (as <hi>Plato</hi> truly teacheth) <hi>Bonorum, solus

decet. It is onely God, that is the Cause of all good things: but euill things haue
not God, but some other thing, for their cause.</hi> Therefore, for the clearing of
this doubt; that there be not two diuers Authors and Princes in the world;
the one sending diseases; the other, their Remedies; but, that both of these
doe come from one Author, who is God, and none other; it is euidently
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:22084:129"/>
anounched, in the Holy Scripture, as it were of set purpose, for the preuenting

health againe, when he is appeased, which he tooke away when he was displeased.</hi>
So that the very necessity of Reason inferreth, that if God be the sender of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
vnto men (as I haue formerly prooued him) then must hee also bee the
sender of remedies vnto them. Else can he not be God; nay, else can hee not
be Good. For how can he be either God or good, who is willing to hurt vs,
if he know, that he hath not the power againe to helpe vs? But God is truely
and perfectly good, and hath in this point as great a power, as he hath in any
other; and extendeth it as graciously vnto the benefit of all men: being indeed
both the Giuer and the Preseruer, and the Restorer of health vnto them; from
whose onely grace and fauour, all these heauenly blessings come.</p>
               <p>For the first of which three points: <hi>That God is the Giuer of health vnto
men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God is the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of health.</note> the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> expressely affirmeth it,<note place="margin">Psalm. 28. 7.</note> in calling God in one place,<note place="margin">Psalm. 27. 1.</note>
                  <hi>His strength;</hi>

This is mine opinion, That pure and perfect health, which hath not beene attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with any sicknesse, is giuen immediately by onely God himselfe. But a release
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:22084:130"/>

which is the Preseruer, and Maintainer of mans health.</p>
               <p>3 Now, as God is both the Giuer,<note place="margin">God is the Restorer of Health.</note> and Preseruer of health: so is he also,
the Restorer of it. Hee both gaue it vnto vs, when we had it not: and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
it vnto vs, whilst wee haue it: and restoreth it vnto vs, when as wee
haue lost it. And this point may also, as clearely be demonstrated, by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
both of Holy Scriptures, and of Heathen writers, as any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Of which Testimonies, some bee such, as doe onely expresse their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
in words: some such, as declare the strength of it, by deedes: and some
such, as demonstrate the truth of it, by effects. For the first of which three
heads: the Prophet <hi>Moses</hi> assureth the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 15.</note> that, if they will obey Gods
holy Lawes and Ordinances, hee will, not only <hi>take all infirmities from them,</hi>
but also, <hi>will not put any euill disease vpon them.</hi> Thereby plainely declaring,
that God hath a power in him; both to preserue men in their health; and to
bring them vnto sicknesse; and to deliuer them from sicknesse. The Prophet
<hi>Dauid</hi> likewise expresly confesseth, that it is the Lord onely,<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>which both forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
all our iniquities, and healeth all our infirmities.</hi> Taking first away the
Cause of our Sicknesse, which is onely our sinne: and then applying his
owne healing grace, as a soueraigne Medicine. And so likewise <hi>Iehoram</hi> King
of <hi>Israel</hi> confesseth, by insinuation, euen the very same thing. For, when the
King of <hi>Aram</hi> writ vnto him, that he should heale the Leprosie of <hi>Naaman:</hi>
hee asked in great passion;<note place="margin">2. Kin. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether he were a God,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 5. 15.</note> that he should doe this great
thing?</hi> Thereby manifestly insinuating, that the power of healing is the worke
of a God, and not of a man. Yea, and euen <hi>Naaman</hi> himselfe, when the
worke was done, acknowledged, that God was the onely doer of it: <hi>Now I
know, there is no God, in all the world, but in Israel.</hi> And how came hee to
know this? He knew it, by the miraculous healing of his sicknesse. For, as
<hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> directly testifieth: <hi>The power of healing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ecclus. 38. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>commeth onely from the
most High.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and euen the very Heathen do hold the same opinion. <hi>Coelius Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi>
reporteth out of <hi>Plutarchs Symposiachs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coel. Rhodigin. l. 19. c. 11. p. 1354. Plut. l. 4. Sympos. Quaest. 1. To. 3. Mor. p. 239.</note> of a very notable and learned
Phisition, named <hi>Philon;</hi> that hee, hauing confected diuers excellent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
<hi>Regia quaedam, &amp; auxiliaria medicamenta;</hi> called those his Medicines,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>the hands of God.</hi> Which glorious appellation, whether
he doe <hi>irreligiously</hi> apply vnto his owne medicines, as though they were able
to procure a mans health, as well as Gods owne hands; or <hi>religiously,</hi> as not
being able to worke any health, without the helpe of Gods hand: yet both
wayes, he acknowledgeth, the working of health, to bee the power of Gods
owne hand.</p>
               <p>And so doth <hi>Tully</hi> likewise,<note place="margin">Cic. l. 14. Epist. Fam. Ep. 7. 162.</note> when he writeth thus, vnto his wife: <hi>Statim ita
leuatus sum, vt mihi Deus aliquis fecisse medicinam videatur: I was sodainely so
eased, as if a medicine had bene sent vnto me from God.</hi> Thereby plainely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging,
that the hand of God is the most soueraigne Medicine. And
thus, both Christians and Heathens haue deliuered their opinions, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:22084:132"/>
and plaine words: <hi>That it is onely God himselfe, that is the Restorer of
men, vnto their health.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, that this is not, in them, onely a verball profession, or a volant and
fleeting imagination, but a very strong perswasion, both inwardly setled and
deepely grounded in them, as a sprout of naturall Religion; they haue, both
of them, declared, as well by their deedes, as they haue by their words:
which is the second sort of our Testimonies. For, euer, when they haue beene
afflicted with any kind of sicknesse, either publike, or priuate, they haue
still sought, to obtaine their remedy from God, by offering vp vnto him,
both <hi>Supplications,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> as vnto the onely Restorer of their
health. Thus did <hi>Moses;</hi> when,<note place="margin">Num. 11. 1, 2.</note> by the <hi>fire of God,</hi> very many of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
were deuoured and consumed, he sought for the remedie, only at his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
hand: vsing prayer, for his water, to extinguish that fire. Thus likewise
did <hi>Aaron;</hi> when a grieuous <hi>plague was sent by God himselfe, among them,</hi> he
sought onely for the remedie,<note place="margin">Num. 16. 47, 48</note> at that hand which had smitten them, by <hi>offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vp incense, for a sauour of rest, and making an atonement for the people,
with God.</hi> And thus likewise did King <hi>Dauid;</hi> when,<note place="margin">2. Sam, 24. 25.</note> at another time, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like plague happened, he sought for the remedie onely at the hand of
God, by appeasing of his wrath, <hi>with Burnt-Offerings, and Peace-Offerings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and euen the very Heathens themselues, in all their like Calamities,
haue euer held this, for the chiefest of their Medicines, to obtaine release of
God, by their prayers and supplications. Whereof, euen their owne Histories
affoord vs both great plenty, and great variety of Examples. In that great
plague,<note place="margin">Homer, l. 1. Iliad p. 5. B.</note> which hapned in the Campe of the Greekes, at the siege of <hi>Troy;</hi> they
sought onely, for their remedie, at the hand of God, by lenifying his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
with <hi>sacrifice and prayer; precibus &amp; sacrificijs.</hi> In that great plague,
which hapned vnto the <hi>Aeginets;</hi> their King sought for remedie, at the hand
of God onely.

vinciri. There followed, after an heauy winter, a most contagious Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
Whether it grew from the vnwholsomnesse of the Ayre, occasioned by many
sodaine alterations, or from some other cause: but pernicious it was vnto all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
things. Of which incurable euill, whenas they could neither finde out any
cause, nor perceiue any end, the Senators decreed; that the bookes of Sibylla
shold be searched; that two officers should be appointed, to looke to the performance
of their holy seruice: their holy feasting in their Temples (which they call their
Lectisternium) being at that time first ordayned in the Citie of Rome; for eight
whole dayes together, they appeased the anger, both of their God Apollo, and of
his mother Latona, and of his sister Diana; and of Hercules, Mercurius, and
Neptunus: the Feast being held as sumptuously, as in those dayes could be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
in three seuerall places. Yea, and the same Feast was kept holy, as well pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately,
as publikely. All the dores in the Cittie were then set wide open: All
things, for the time, were vsed in common: all men, both knowne and vnknowne,
yea and euen the very Strangers, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were vsed, euen with their very enemies; and an vtter cessation of all
suites, debates, and quarells: Yea the Prison dores were opened, during all those
high feast-dayes. And those, that, by the benefit of their gods, were then relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
were neuer after that (vpon meere Religion) imprisoned. <hi>Thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

proceedeth</hi> Livie. <hi>Out of which his narration we may obserue these two
things. First, that though this great plague might, in part, be attributed vnto
the often and sodaine alteration of the ayre, as vnto an immediate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Cause: yet that they looked higher, vnto the first Cause, and ascribed
it to God, from whom it came indeed. Secondly, that, as they acknowledged
the disease to come from God: so they sought for their remedie, no where
else, but of God. So confessing him directly, to be both the sender of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and the Restorer of health. As we may euidently see, in the very same
Author, by diuers other instances, in diuers other places: as namely.</hi> Lib. 7.
p. 121. 129. Lib. 10. p. 187. Lib. 27. p. 308. Lib. 38. p 482. Lib. 41. p. 528. <hi>In
all which places,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Livi.</note> 
                  <hi>he, reporting of very greiuous plagues, sheweth still, that
they sought for their remedie at God, by appeasing of his wrath, with their
Sacrifices and prayers. This sense hath God ingra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ted both into</hi> Christians,
<hi>and</hi> Heathens.</p>
               <p>Neither doth Religion onely teach them, to seeke their remedie at God,
in such publique calamities, but also euen in their priuate sicknesses. King
<hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 41. 4.</note> being afflicted with a dangerous sicknesse, maketh this request to God,
<hi>Heale me (ô Lord) I haue sinned against thee.</hi> Thereby plainely insinuating
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:22084:133"/>
these three things vnto vs. First, that onely sinne is the cause of all sicknesse.
Secondly, that onely God is the restorer vnto health. And Thirdly, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prayer is the meanes of obtayning that grace. And though it may seeme
a very strange request, to desire God to heale him, because hee had sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: which was the very cause, for which God had smitten him: yet
it is not so indeed, if the words be well resolued. For his meaning is no more
but this: that God, who had stricken him, for committing of his sinne; should
now againe heale him, for confessing of his sinne. As if he should say, as it
is in the Orator,<note place="margin">Cic. Epist. Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viano, p. 223.</note> 
                  <hi>Sit erranti medicina confessio. Let my confession be my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</hi>
Or, as in other words <hi>He</hi> expresseth it, but to the same effect: <hi>Let my
prayer ascend vp before thee, as incense; and the lifting vp of my hands be as
an euening Sacrifice.</hi> Thus,<note place="margin">Psal. 141. 2.</note> in his priuate sicknesse, as well as in the publike,
he sought for all his helpe, at the onely hand of God.</p>
               <p>And the same disposition is also ingrafted into the mindes of the Heathen:
Who (<hi>as Iuuenal</hi> obserueth) <hi>if they chance but to feele the least touch of a
feuer, they straightway interpret it the effect of Gods Anger:</hi> and therefore they
doe presently betake them to their vowes, and seeke to appease him by the
promise of some sacrifice. They doe,<note place="margin">Iuuenal. Satyr. 13. p. 60. B.</note>

                     <l>They vow vnto the Shrine, a bleating sheepe,</l>
                     <l>And to the Gods that doe their Houses keepe,</l>
                     <l>They vow their Cocks heads, &amp;c.</l>
                  </q>
Thus haue they beene taught, euen by the light of Reason, that, if the disease
haue proceeded from God, the ease must also be sought for at his hand. For
(as <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath very well obserued) <hi>The Remedie must alwayes be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
vnto the Meladie: else will it do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

strongly, when he giueth the strongest medicines; but when the medicine, which
he ministreth, is best tempered, and proportioned vnto the qualitie of the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
And therefore, if the sicknesse haue proceeded from God, it is but
<hi>Medicina proportionata,</hi> that is to say, <hi>a Medicine made in his due proportion,</hi>
that the Remedie should also be fetched from him.</p>
               <p>And, that, in thus doing, they haue not beene deceiued, neither in their
practice, nor in their opinion, God himselfe hath declared, by euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration:
by sending a present release from euery sicknesse, whensoeuer
they entreated it by their prayers and supplications,<note place="margin">This Chap. this Sect. prec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Authors, in all the fore-named places, haue left testified vnto vs: which is the
third ranke of our testimonies. For in all the selfe same places, where there is
mention made both of the diseases to be sent from God, and of helpe to haue
beene entreated of him; there is also mention made, that, at their supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it hath beene sent vnto them. As the Reader may plainly see, in all the
fore-alledged places, both of the holy Scriptures, and of the secular writers.

dedicated his new built Temple vnto God,<note place="margin">1. Kings, 8. 37. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> hee made this request for one;

                  <hi>and anoint him with oyle in the name of the Lord. And the
prayer of faith shall saue the sicke, and the Lord will raise him vp: and if hee
haue committed any sinne, it shall be forgiuen him.</hi> In which place is congested,
the whole summe of all those heades which before I haue collected, both in
this present Chapter, and also in the former, namely; First, that Sinne <hi>is the
true cause of sicknesse,</hi> vpon whose forgiuenesse there followeth a release, as
<hi>Mathew,</hi> 9. 2. Secondly,<note place="margin">Mathew, 9. 2.</note> that God for this cause, sendeth sicknesse vnto men.
Thirdly, that God is not onely the sender of sicknesse, but also the restorer
vnto health. And fourthly, that the principall meanes to recouer, is earnest
and hearty prayer; our owne, our Phisitions, and our faithfull Ministers. So
that, in this Case, it is not amisse (though <hi>Tullie</hi> deride it,<note place="margin">Cic. l. 2. Te Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin. p. 263.</note> as a kinde of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)

                  <hi>not a Phisition, but a Prophet.</hi> For so did God himselfe vnto <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah,</hi>
in his sicknesse. He sent vnto him, not <hi>Medicum,</hi> but <hi>Vatem,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Isay</hi> to visite him: by whom notwithstanding hee was both comforted,
and cured. Thus God (as I haue shewed you) is both the <hi>Giuer,</hi> and the
<hi>Restorer of Health;</hi> yea, and that oftentimes immediately of himselfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all externall meanes: sending it downe sometime immediately out of
heauen,<note place="margin">1. Kings, 18. 36. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> by the only power of prayer, as he did <hi>Elias</hi> his fire. Thereby plainely
declaring, that it was both a false &amp; impious opinion, which was held by <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorus:

best meanes: because all the vertue of them is onely giuen by him. He it is,
that hath giuen all medicinall herbes and plants vnto man. He it is, that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:22084:134"/>
hath giuen the Art of the Phisition, and the skill how to vse them. And
hee it is, that onely giueth all the efficacie vnto them, by ioyning his blessing
with them. And all this is confessed, as well by the very heathens, as it is by
vs <hi>Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first of which three points: that <hi>God is the giuer of all medicines vnto
Man;</hi> we see this by experience, that there is a sanatiue and medicinable power
giuen both vnto herbes, and vnto rootes, and vnto stones, and vnto mineralls;
yea and euen vnto diuers kinds of pure &amp; simple earths; called <hi>Terrae sigillatae,</hi>
because they be printed and sealed for diuers seuerall vses in mans sicknesses
and infirmities. With all which seuerall medicines the body of the earth is so
euery where replenished, yea and the sur-face of it so euery where ouer-strew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as if the whole earth were nothing else but a great <hi>bolus,</hi> or masse of soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
medicines, made vp, by God himselfe, for mans seuerall diseases.</p>
               <p>Now the Question is, whence this healing virtue commeth, vnto all the
forenamed Simples? whether, from the qualitie of the earth, <hi>wherein</hi> they
grow? or, from the influence of the starres, <hi>whereby</hi> they grow? or, from
some inward nature in themselues? or, from fate? or, from chance? or, from
diuine prouidence? For, it needes must proceede from some one of these.
But that it cannot come from any one of the fiue first imaginary causes; it is
(by diuine prouidence) most euidently declared, in the <hi>Booke of Genesis:</hi>
Where, it is expresly testified (as it were for the preuenting of this fond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
that <hi>God made euery plant of the field,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>before he put it into the Earth; and
euery h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rbe, before it grew.</hi> A worke of so great carefulnesse, as hee hath not
expressed in any other of his Creatures: man himselfe alone excepted. Now
this place dischargeth all those forenamed causes of doing any worke in
this notable effect. <hi>The Earth,</hi> that hath not giuen this virtue vnto plants: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they all were made before they were put into the Earth. <hi>The Starres,</hi>
they haue it not giuen vnto them: because all the plants were made before
them. For the plants of the Earth were made the third day: but the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
of Heauen were not made before the fourth: no,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 12. 13. 14.</note> nor the sixt Starres
neither, as appeareth in the Scripture. <hi>Their owne power and nature</hi> hath not
giuen it vnto them: because they had not their very being of themselues, but
receiued it of another, euen the Diuine <hi>Creator. Fate,</hi> that hath not giuen it
vnto them: because they alwayes possesse it not, neither worke, by necessity,
vnto their owne effect. <hi>Chance,</hi> that hath not giuen it vnto them: because
then, the remedies could not haue answered so aptly vnto the diseases, nor so
constantly, in all places. Now, if neither <hi>Earth,</hi> nor <hi>Heauen,</hi> nor <hi>Nature,</hi> nor
<hi>Fate,</hi> nor <hi>Fortune,</hi> haue giuen those qualities vnto <hi>Herbes,</hi> and <hi>Plants:</hi> then

That vniuersall Parent and Creator of all things, who first created those Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines

strange and miraculous, if we will confesse the truth.</hi> And, a little before, hee
rendereth a reason, why the knowledge of those things must needs be rather
the teaching of God, then the inuention of man. Because, if God hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giuen those virtues vnto plants; and man, without God, hath found them
out; man hath done the greater worke, and God the lesse: <hi>Superata hoc modo

               <p>6 But yet, neither of both these can doe any good vnto him, if they bee
not assisted with Gods speciall blessing. For first,<note place="margin">Gods blessing is it, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, more then the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</note> for the Phisition: that it is

in his Phisitions, and <hi>too little</hi> in his God, was that which brought him
vnto his end. And the same we may likewise see,<note place="margin">Mar. 5. 25, 26.</note> in the new, in the woman dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased
with the bloody issue: Of whom it is testified, that though shee had
suffered many things from her Phisitions, and continued long with them, and
vsed great change of them, and spent all she had vpon them; yet was she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the better for them, but rather much the worse. And the like is also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of the Emperor <hi>Adrian;</hi> that hee,<note place="margin">Dion Cassius in Hadriano. p. 135.</note> at his death, was forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
that, <hi>Turba Medicorum interfecit Regem: The multitude of Phisitions
had brought the Emperour vnto his death.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that no
Phisition hath power to heale any man, if God do not giue a special blessing
vnto him. As the Philosopher <hi>Taurus</hi> insinuated to that Phisition,<note place="margin">A. Gel. lib. 18. cap. 9. p. 263.</note> that came
to heale <hi>A: Gellius. Cum Dijs bene volentibus, opera tua, sistas hunc nobis
sanum.</hi> Implying, that his labour and Gods blessing must worke both together,
before the sick-man could recouer. For, as <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> expresly testifieth, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Apothecary can finish his owne worke, in making of the Medicine; nor
yet the phisition, his, in applying of the medicine; if they be not assisted, with Gods
speciall blessing. The Apothecarie</hi> (saith he) <hi>doth make a confection: and yet he
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:22084:136"/>
cannot finish his owne worke. For of the Lord commeth prosperitie, and wealth,

the Phisition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ecclus 38. 8. 12. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Lord hath created him. Let him not go from thee: for thou
hast neede of him.</hi> But what? can he heale thee when he list? No. But he addeth:
<hi>The houre may come, that their enterprises may haue good successe.</hi> But how? He
addeth further: <hi>For they shall pray vnto the Lord, that he would prosper that
which is giuen for ease; and their Physick, for the prolonging of life.</hi> So then
the Physition toucheth: but it is God that healeth. There is greater effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
vnto health, in the Physitions prayer, then there is in his power: the
whole prosperitie of the medicine depending vpon Gods blessing. And
therefore saith S. <hi>Hierom:</hi>

doth this happen rather vnto the principals, then it doth vnto others? It
appeareth in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to be an old conceit, to attribute this to <hi>Fate,</hi> and to
a kind of <hi>Destinie</hi> bestowed vpon those Cities, in their genethliacks, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuities,
by the aspects and positure of the Stars.<note place="margin">Plut. in Vita Romuli. p. 52.</note> But this the Psalmist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth,

                  <hi>Promotion</hi> (saith he) <hi>commeth neither

It commeth not from the <hi>East,</hi> from whence the Stars doe come in their
diurnall motion: nor yet from the <hi>West,</hi> from whence they come againe in
their naturall motion: nor yet from <hi>North,</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> from whence they goe
and come in that motion of theirs which is called <hi>Trepidation.</hi> From none

Psalme) <hi>It is God, that is the Iudge; hee putteth downe one, and setteth vp ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And this is true, as well in the fortunes of Cities, and Nations, as of
particular persons. As wee may euidently see in the prophecy of <hi>Isaiah. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
(saith he) <hi>it is the Lord that maketh the earth empty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 24. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and he maketh it waste;
He turneth it vpside downe, and hee scattereth abroad the Inhabitants of it.</hi> And
therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> derideth this opinion of the Stars,<note place="margin">Plut. in Vita Romuli. p. 52.</note> that they should giue
fortune vnto Cities: and reckoneth it among the number of Fables. Yea,
and that very worthily. For, if it were fatall for those Cities to rise, how come
they to their fall? Is there now crept in a mutabilitie into <hi>Fate?</hi> Is it now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
contrarie vnto it selfe; to depresse the same thing, which before it selfe

addeth this Conclusion, <hi>that they all were destroyed, by the iniquitie of Fortune:
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:22084:139"/>
Et haec quidem prorsùs Fortuna abolevit.</hi> So that he ascribeth, as well the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
as falling of Cities, to be the worke, not of <hi>Prouidence,</hi> but of <hi>Chance.</hi>
But, that herein hee is deceiued, it appeareth by this argument: That both
the rising, and falling of many Cities, haue beene truely and certainely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told:
Which they could not haue beene, if it had beene by Fortune. For,
these things which are fortuitous, cannot be foreseene by <hi>Prouidence:</hi> &amp;
therefore not foretold. Who can foretell, that at such a time, such a man shall
haue a fall? No more could any man foretell, that at such a time such a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
should haue his fall, if it were meerely casuall. But wee see, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that both the rising of some Cities, and the falling of others, haue bin
certainly foretold, by diuers of the Prophets.<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 31. &amp;c.</note> The Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
foretelleth, both the rising, and the falling, of the foure grand Monarchies;

<hi>Image;</hi> the other,<note place="margin">Dan. 73 &amp;c.</note> of the foure fearefull <hi>Beasts.</hi> Yea, and in the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and succession of those Monarchies, he plainely describeth the falling of
one of them, and the rising of another, vnder the figure of a <hi>Battell,</hi> betweene
a <hi>Ramme,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 3, &amp;c.</note> and a <hi>Goate:</hi> wherein the <hi>Goate</hi> preuayled. Which <hi>Goate,</hi> he there

<hi>King of the Persians.</hi> Where, if the euent had fallen out contrary vnto his
praediction,<note place="margin">Dan. 8 20. 21.</note> he being so definite, and confident in his asseueration, hee had
beene vtterly shamed,<note place="margin">Deut. 18. 21. 22.</note> and had iustly incurred the note <hi>of a false Prophet.</hi>
But he knew whom <hi>he beleeued,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 12.</note> and that hee could not be deceiued: because
these things were by God himselfe reuealed; by whom they were both fore-knowne,
and fore-appointed. So likewise, the Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> in his foretelling
of the destruction of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> was as definite and peremptorie in appointing
the certaine dayes, as <hi>Daniel</hi> was before, in naming the certaine Nations. <hi>Yet
forty dayes and Niniveh shall be destroyed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ionah. 3. 4.</note> Which finall destruction (though
the meanes be vnknowne) yet had certainely happened, if by their earnest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
it had not beene auerted.</p>
               <p>Another like destruction, there is also foretold, by the Prophet <hi>Balaam;</hi>
to happen from the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 24. 24.</note> or <hi>Romans,</hi> vnto the Kingdome both of the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrians,</hi>
and of the <hi>Hebrewes. The Ships shall come from the Coasts of Chittim
and shall subdue Assur, and shall subdue Heber, &amp; he also shall come to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
A very true prophecie, though vttered by a false Prophet. For, whether we
take <hi>Chittim</hi> for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or the <hi>Romans,</hi> (as it is sometimes for both,) by
those two Nations, were those two Kingdomes subdued; and the latter of
those Kingdomes, by the latter of those Nations, was not onely subdued, but
also subuerted, according to the prophecie in that place deliuered. Now
these things could not haue beene thus certainely foreshewne, if they had not
beene as certainely foreseene. And that they could not haue beene, if they had
fallen out by <hi>Fortune.</hi> So that, as concerning <hi>Fate; Solon</hi> excludeth that,

to so admirable a power and glorie, without the presence &amp; prouidence of
God.</hi> And this hee there reporteth, not as his owne single and particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but as a vulgar and common, receiued and maintained among the most
of them. And,<note place="margin">Plutarch l. de Fortuna Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum, To. 2. p. 409. 411.</note> in another place, hee affirmeth of <hi>Rome,</hi> that, <hi>Fundamenta
Romae iecit Tempus cum Deo: That the Foundation of Rome was layd by God
and Time.</hi> It was layd by God, to continue for a long time, as he wittily there
expresseth, by this fit deuice and fiction: <hi>That Fortune quickly flew ouer both
the Persians, and Assyrians, and Macedonians, and Aegyptians, and Syrians, and
Carthaginians: but, when shee came vnto the Romanes, she then put off her
wings, as purposing to stay with them, and not to fly from them.</hi> So that God
gaue them their beginning, in laying their foundation: and hee vpheld their
continuing; in giuen to them <hi>Time.</hi> This is <hi>Plutarchs</hi> iudgement of them.

Thereby plainely insinuating, that the greatnesse of their Empire was

Which <hi>Caecilius</hi> also expresly confirmeth. For he saith of the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arnob. l. 8. cont. Gent. p. 746.</note> that,

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:22084:140"/>
was that which inlarged the Romane dominion.</hi> For (as he addeth a litle after)
<hi>Dum vniversarum Gentium sacra suscipiunt, etiam Regna meruerunt. While they
receiue the Religions of all Nations, they deserue also their Dominions.</hi> This he
falsly ascribeth vnto their false religion: which yet may truly be ascribed vnto
the true one. And <hi>Camillus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Liv. l. 5. p. 103.</note> in his Oration recorded by <hi>Liuie,</hi> expresly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that <hi>al the calamities of the Romans sprung only from ther offences against
God; as, on the contrary, all their prosperity grew only from their piety.</hi> Which is
true, in very deed, if it be rightly vnderstood, and be referred, as it ought, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<hi>Nostris vitijs, non casu aliquo, Rempub. amisimus; It is not by chance, but it is by

                  <hi>Nihil tam inimicum Ciuitati,

both these. Because hee is the Rewarder of vertues, and the punisher
of vices: who for the transgressions and wickednesse of men, both abateth
and abaseth, and transformeth, and transferreth all their Kingdomes and
Commonwealths, as hee himselfe pleaseth. Of all which, the Holy Scriptures

               <p>He abated the Kingdome of the <hi>Israelites;</hi> when hee tooke from <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boram,</hi>

                  <hi>as it

when hee changed it from their Iudges, vnto their Kings: as hee likewise did
the <hi>Romanes,</hi> from their <hi>Consuls,</hi> vnto their <hi>Emperours.</hi> In which change of
that State, it is worthy obseruation, which is written by <hi>Plutarch: That God,</hi>

<hi>Octauius,</hi> lest hee should bee a meane to ouerthrow that gouernment, which
God then determined to set vp, hee being a knowne Enemie vnto the state of
a Monarchie.</p>
               <p>And finally, he transferred them; the kingdomes of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> vnto
the <hi>Israelites;</hi> of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> vnto the <hi>Caldeans;</hi> of the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> vnto the

to be the workes of none other, but onely of God himselfe: who (as <hi>Iob</hi>

of the Persians vnto my Successors, which from you I receiued by my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors;
that so I may repay vnto Alexander, those great benefits and fauours,
which, in this time of my calamitie, hee hath royally bestowed vpon my dearest
friends. But, if the fatall period of time bee now come, wherein the Persians
Kingdome must needes change, and be vndone; then againe I beseech you, that
the succession of King Cyrus his Throne may fall vnto King Alexander, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
none other.</hi> In which prayer it appeareth, that he verily beleeued, as well the
preseruation, as translation of Kingdomes, to be seated in the power of God.</p>
               <p>So that, for this point, of the rising and falling of Kingdomes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths;
it seemeth vtterly absurd, not onely to the religion of well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing

not to chance. For, can wee thinke, that that prouidence, which is

and slaueries of Kingdomes, and Commonwealths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 And this may further be seene, by an other obseruation: that God hath
incompassed al the Kingdomes of the earth with a threefold restraint; to wit,<note place="margin">God limiteth the power of all Kings and Kingdomes.</note> a
limitation of their powers; a circumscription of their bounds; &amp; a prefinition
of their periods. There was neuer, as yet, any kingdome in the world; which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for his power, was illimitable; or, for his place, vniuersall; or, for his time,
perpetuall. But, God, in his prouidence, hath so incompassed all of them, that
euermore their powers, haue bin reduced vnto measures; their dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, vnto
bounds; &amp; their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance, vnto periods. As we may see, by plaine examples
in the holy Scriptures. And first, as concerning the restraint of their powers:
that may euidently bee shewed, in three Easterne Kings. The first of whom,
is <hi>Saul:</hi> who pursued the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Samuel, 26. 20. 21.</note> with such implacable hatred, that he
hunted him in all places, <hi>as a Partrich in the wildernes.</hi> And yet, when he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himselfe into his hands, hee had no power to hurt him; but (as <hi>Esau</hi> in the
like case pursuing his brother <hi>Iacob</hi>) though he came out against him with a
purpose to kill him;<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 6 7.</note> yet,<note place="margin">Gen. 33. 4.</note> contrary vnto his purpose, he both louingly &amp; humbly
reconciled himselfe vnto him. So that, it might be said, as it is in the Tragicke:

to set vp him to be worshipped for the God of the whole world. And thus
he proiected to extend his owne power, beyond all due measure, and to

But, what was the euent of this his proud conceit? Surely this his exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and vnmeasurable ambition, and impotent desire of inlardging his
power, beyond humane condition, was, by a superior power, restrained, and
himselfe of all vaine purposes defeated. His Captaines were destroyed, his

diuine Nature, that it is not communicable vnto any Creature whatsoeuer.
Much lesse to any man, whose largest dominion cannot reach beyond the

Sand) when they had euen wearied themselues with diuers mutuall slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in the ende (for the ending of all contention) they fell vpon this Conclusion.
That they should both of them send forth at a certaine praefixed time, certaine
Messengers from their borders; and that the place, where they should meete,
should be the Boundes of both Nations. The Carthaginians sent for them two
Brothers called Phileni: by whose speed and diligence, they obtained great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
Which, when the Cyrenians chalenged, as being fraudulently gotten, by
their setting forth before the appointed time; they offered them this condition;
that, either the Phileni should be content to be buried quick, in the place where
they mett, and which they chalenged for other limits; or else they should permit
the setting of their limits vnto those Cyrenians, vnder the same condition
which was propounded vnto them. Which condition (though vnaequall) yet the
Phileni accepted: and so were both of them in the place buried quicke. Vnto
whom, for their valour the Carthaginians there erected, and consecrated an
Altar: as an aeternall monument, both of the limits of their Dominion, and of
the honour of these two noble Brethren, by whom they had obtayned the same.</hi>
Out of which memorable historie, we may draw these three obseruatious, to
our present purpose. First, that where there be no knowne limits betweene
Kingdome and Kingdome, there be alwayes contentions and quarells about
them. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the way to quench those quarells, is, there to set vp
some artificiall limits, where there be no naturall. And thirdly, that euen
those casuall and accidentall limits, yet are in those places fixed by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
decree and appointment of God: which, both this Altar of the <hi>Phileni</hi>
insinuated, and the forenamed Altar of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> expressed:

of their months with him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 14. 5.</note>

and periods being fulfilled (as the dayes of a man when they are expired)

they are by and by dissolued. And this we may see verified as well in the
great and mighty Monarchies; as in the smaller and inferior kingdomes.

And the same may be seene in diuerse other Kingdomes, as <hi>Bartus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifieth

                     <l>As when the Wind the angry Ocean moues,</l>

                  </q>
Thus the greatest Kingdomes for force, yet haue beene of small continuance,
being successiuely cut off by the sword of their enemies. But yet that, not
by chance, but by Gods speciall ordinance: who, when the number of their
dayes were expired (that is,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>when they had fullfilled the measure of their
wickednesse</hi>) then sent vpon them, the sword of other Nations, for the
punishment of their sinnes. For the swords of men are but the Rods of
God, whereby hee scourgeth them that rebell against him: as hee himselfe
affirmeth, both of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and of the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> calling the one
of them, <hi>the rod of his wrath,</hi> and the other <hi>his Hammer and his weapon of
warre, wherewith hee will breake downe nations and destroy Kingdomes.</hi> So<note place="margin">Isa. 10. 5.</note> So
that though they whett the sword,<note place="margin">Jer. 51. 20.</note> yet it is God that strikes the stroke.
It is he that breaketh in sunder those Kingdomes with his hammer. Which
yet he doth not before their appointed time be fulfilled. For (as <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi>
expresly affirmeth) <hi>Vnto all things there is an appointed time. A time to
plant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and a time to pluck vp.</hi> And the appointer of those times is onely God
himselfe as by this one Argument it euidently appeareth; that hee is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorie
and definite in foretelling the certaine times of the continuing and
falling of diuers Kingdomes. Hee foretold of the great and mighty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Babilon</hi> that it should continue but onely vnto the third generation,<note place="margin">Ier. 27. 6. 7.</note>
and that then it should vtterly be vndone. <hi>I haue giuen all these lands into
the hand of Nebuchadnezzer the King of Babel my seruant—And all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
shall serue him and his Sonne and his Sonnes Sonne, vntill the very time
of his Land also come, and then many Nations and great Kings shall serue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of him:</hi> what could be more definite? And that he neither deceiued nor
was deceiued in it, the euent which followed, openly declared. For in the time
of <hi>Belshazzer Nebuchadnezzers Sonnes Sonnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 5. 28 30. 26.</note> the <hi>Babilonian Monarchy</hi> was
dissolued, and that by the written decree of God, who there professeth that

the <hi>number of that Kingdome was fulfilled.</hi> And as definite as hee was in

                  </gap>ution of <hi>Babilon,</hi> so definite was he also
in appointing the set time of the Iewish Captiuitie vnder them.<note place="margin">Ier. 25. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>This whole

yeares. And when the seuenty yeares are accomplished, I will visit the King of</hi>
Babel <hi>and that Nation &amp;c.</hi> Which hee did accordingly performe. For first,
for the deliuerance and manumission of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> it is expresly testified, that
that was fulfilled, as soone as the time, fore-told by <hi>Ieremy,</hi> was finished.<note place="margin">2. Chro. 36. 22. Ezra. 1. 1.</note> And,
for the second part of the Prophecie, concerning the destruction of the
<hi>Babilonian Kingdome;</hi> it followeth by consequent vpon the former.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who, in the first yeare of his raigne, gaue order for the returne
of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> was one of those Princes, who were the ouerthrowers of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonians.</hi>
As concerning which Prince, in giuing his name, almost an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares,<note place="margin">Isay. 44 28</note> before hee was borne;<note place="margin">Isay. 45. 1.</note> there is so great an euidence of Gods
fore-seeing prouidence, that a paralell to that prophecie, cannot bee giuen, in
all the secular Historie. And as God hath bene definite, in foretelling the
very time of the destruction of <hi>Babilon;</hi> so hath hee bene likewise, in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewing
the destruction, both of the <hi>Ephraemites,</hi> and of the <hi>Aegyptians:</hi>
pointing downe precisely, vpon the very number of the yeares: <hi>Within
threescore and fiue yeares, Ephraem shall be destroyed, from being a Nation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isay, 7. 8.</note>
And for <hi>Egypt,</hi> he sayth: <hi>I will make the land of Egypt desolate, for forty yeares
&amp;c. But, at the end of forty yeares, I will gather the Egyptians from the people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 29. 12. 13.</note>
                  <hi>where they were scattered.</hi> Now, this so peremptorie assigning of a definite
time, as well of their captiuitie, as of their libertie, doth euidently shew, not
onely that those times are certainly appointed; but also that this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is onely made by God. Who (as our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> teacheth vs) <hi>hath
in his owne power the seasons of all times:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts, 1. 7.</note> and who (as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi>
teacheth vs) is hee,<note place="margin">Daniel. 2. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>that changeth those times and seasons, and that both taketh
away Kings, and setteth vp Kings.</hi> And this also was not vnknowne, euen to
the very Heathen. For, <hi>Iason,</hi> in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> expresly affirmeth, that it is God

which is agreed vpon, among the very Heathen, that the ende of the <hi>Ethicks,</hi>

<hi>Felicitie</hi> is the ende of all mens actions and desires: but <hi>Vertue</hi> is the way,

He prayeth to God, to withhold him; because hee could not withhold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.

him from it, as <hi>Homer</hi> also testifieth: by that fiction, implying this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayned
truth, that it is God, which withholdeth vs from euill, as well as which
helpeth vs in good. Both which points together, wee may euidently see, in
the prayer of the <hi>Pharisee:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 11. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>O God, I thanke thee, that I am not as other men
are, extortioners, vniust, adulterers.</hi> Here be the vices, from which God
had withheld him, and for which hee thanketh him. Hee proceedeth on, vnto
those vertues, wherewith God had adorned him. <hi>I faste twice in the Weeke,
and I giue tithe of all that euer I possesse.</hi> So that, if a man be not infected
with all kinde of vice, he may thanke God for it. And, if hee be indued with
any kind of vertue, he may thanke God for that too. For it is onely <hi>by the
grace of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>that he is, as he is.</hi> In which action of the Pharisee, we may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
see, a direct confutation of <hi>Tullies</hi> obseruation, that, <hi>Nemo quòd bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
vir esset, gratias Dijs egit vnquàm.</hi> And againe in the same place,<note place="margin">Cic. l. 3. de. Nat. Deor. p. 238.</note> that
<hi>Virtutem, nemo vnquàm acceptam Deo retulit: That no man had euer thanked
God, that he had made him a good man.</hi> For we see the plaine contrarie, in the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:22084:149"/>
prayer of the <hi>Pharisee:</hi> He expresly thanked God, that hee had made him so
good. So that here is a confutation of his first position. His second is this,
<hi>That no man euer acknowledged his vertue to haue descended vnto him from
God.</hi> Which we see againe confuted, by all those seuerall testimonies, that
before I haue recited. For they all haue professed, that <hi>Vertue is Gods gift.</hi>
As for the reason, which in that place hee bringeth, to fortifie his position;
<hi>That men are praysed for their vertues; which they could not iustly be, if it were
the gift of God, and not gotten by themselues:</hi> That is a very false and insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
reason. For, men are praised, both for their <hi>Beautie,</hi> and for their <hi>strength
of bodie.</hi> And yet are both these the good gifts of God, and not purchased
or gotten by our selues. And therefore, as error is alwayes vnconstant, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
true vnto it selfe; so hee, in another place, both renounceth his owne posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and confuteth his owne reason. His position hee renounceth by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
position, directly affirming, that, <hi>Si inest, in hominum genere, Mens,
Fides,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cic. l. 1. de Nat. Deor. p. 212.</note> 
                  <hi>Virtus, Concordia; Vnde haec in terram, nisi a superis, defluere potuerunt?
If there be among men; either Wisdome, or Faith, or Vertue, or Peace; Whence
could any of these come to men vpon earth, but only from the God of heauen?</hi>
Naming <hi>Vertue,</hi> among the rest. And his Reason he confuteth by the instance
of <hi>Metellus, Maximus, Marcellus, Africanus, Cato, Scipio, Laelius,</hi> who were
the most vertuous, and the most prayse-worthy persons of the Romane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.<note place="margin">Cic. l. 2. de Nat. Deor. p. 225.</note>
And yet he affirmeth of them all, that <hi>Horum neminem, nisi iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante
Deo, talem fuisse, credendum est. That none of all these, could euer haue
beene such a man, as he was, if he had not beene helped and assisted by God.</hi> So
that hee ascribeth their <hi>Vertues,</hi> and consequently their prayses, vnto God.
Thereby plainly ouer-throwing, the ground of his position: and shewing,
that vertue may be praysed, although it be of God. Thus you see the great
agreement, which the Heathens Philosophers haue with the Scriptures, in
ascribing vnto God, to be the Author of all Vertues.</p>
               <p>3 Neither is God onely the Author and giuer of growne and perfect
Vertue,<note place="margin">God is the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of all good motions and affections.</note> when it is formed into an habit; but also of all those good motions,
and affections, which are, as it were, the praeparatiues vnto it: or rather indeed
the inchoations of it. Those good inclinations, and vertuous propensions,
which (being adult and growne vp) doe proue the true substance and bodies
of our vertues, are indeed not in vs any naturall dispositions; (as <hi>Tullie</hi> would
haue them:)<note place="margin">Sunt ingenijs nostris semina <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>The Lord thy God wil circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
thy heart, that thou mayst loue him, with all thy heart, &amp; liue.</hi> So that the first
motions of our loue towards God, are onely the motions of his loue towards
vs. Hee moueth vs to loue him, that we may liue with him. Without whose
grace thus mouing vs, we could haue no motion in vs, at the least not vnto
good. For, the Apostle plainely teacheth vs, that, <hi>it is God, that giueth vs both
the will, and the worke.</hi> Hee both giueth vs the vertues, and the feede of them
too, which are good affections. For, as the same Apostle in another place tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs: <hi>We are not able of our selues, so much as to thinke any thing, but all our
sufficiencie is of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 5.</note> So that, with the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> we may truely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse:
<hi>O Lord, thou it is, that hast wrought all our works for vs.</hi> And this
euen the Heathen themselues doe acknowledge:<note place="margin">Isai. 26. 12.</note> running through all the

Thus the Heathens confesse, that not onely <hi>Vertue,</hi> which is the way vnto
felicitie; but also that <hi>Felicitie,</hi> which is the reward of <hi>Vertue,</hi> are both of
them, the gifts of Almighty God. And therefore they must needs confesse,
<hi>There is a God,</hi>

Felicity:</hi> the point now in hand. Which they demonstrate vnto vs, by a <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi>
of three degrees. First, that <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Godliness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> doe so strictly
vnite a man vnto God, that, in some degree, that it maketh him partaker of the
diuine and heauenly nature. Secondly, that this neere coniunction of man
vnto God, doth bring him vnto heauen, which is the place of Gods dwelling.
And thirdly, that there it maketh him partaker of Gods most blessed and
beatificall vision; which is the highest summitie of all true felicity. And
all these three points are so taught by the Heathens, as though they had bene
catechized in the Schoole of <hi>Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first of which three points, it is the constant doctrine of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of the Heathen, that mans felicitie, consisteth especially, in conforming
himselfe vnto the nature of God, and in making himselfe to be like vnto him.

We are now come to the <hi>Mathematicks:</hi> Which, as they are
something more abstracted from sense,<note place="margin">Arist. l. 11. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyl. c. 3. To. 2. p, 1485.</note> and from sensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,

sensible Arguments, to proue this great Conclusion,<note place="margin">Arist. l. 11. Meta. c. 4. p, 1486. &amp; Seminar. Philos. p 797.</note> as the former can. For
the proper subiect of the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> (especially of those two Arts, of
<hi>Geometrie,</hi> and <hi>Arithmeticke;</hi> which I handle in this Chapter, and in the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:22084:154"/>
next after) is onely to consider, of <hi>Quantum, secundùm se: Of Quantities by
themselues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ficin. Argument in. l. 7. Platonis de repub. p. 616.</note> abstracted from their subiects. And therefore we must not looke
from them, for either discourses, or demonstrations, or positions, directly &amp;
categorically to this purpose. But yet wee may draw, <hi>per obliquum ductum,</hi>
similitudes, and resemblances from both those two <hi>Sciences:</hi> whereby we may
ascend in our contemplation, euen vnto diuine and celestiall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges:
as by the shape of the shadow, we may gather assuredly, the shape of
the body, For, as <hi>Ficinus</hi> hath truly obserued, to this purpose; <hi>Mathematica

                  <hi>Mathematicals are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

that, <hi>Mathematicorum consideratio, est praeludium ad diuinorum contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem.

                  <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the contemplation of diuine and heauenly things.</hi> For, the very end of the
Mathematicks (as <hi>Plato</hi> teacheth) is nothing else, but this; <hi>Vt ad diuinam

                  <hi>Quam nunquam sine his artibus assequemur. The end
of the Mathematicks, is, to leade vs men intentiuely to consider of the nature
of God, and to contemplate of it, so farre, as it is lawfull to inquire into it.
Which we can neuer compasse, without the knowledg of Mathematicall Arts.</hi>
And therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> calleth the <hi>Mathematicks, Divinam mathe sin,</hi> that

who hauing found out the truth of a certaine <hi>Geometricall Conclusion</hi>
for which he had a long time before beene studying,<note place="margin">Cic. l. 3. de Nat. Deor. p. 239.</note> he offered vp <hi>a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
vnto the <hi>Muses:</hi> thereby insinuating, that his illumination came from

<hi>Qui dicunt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arist. l. 13. Meta c. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. 2. p. 1513.</note> 
                  <hi>Mathematicas scientias, nihil de bono &amp; pulchro dicere,
falsum dicunt. Dicunt enim, &amp; maximè ostendunt. Nam, etsi non
nominant; cùm tamen opera &amp; rationes ostendunt, nonnè dicunt de ijs? Those
men that affirme, that Mathematicall sciences doe no way intreat of either
Goodnesse, or Beauty, they affirme it very falsely For the Mathematicks doe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of them both. And, though they doe not expresly name them; yet, when they
intreate both of their works, and of their reasons, doe they not then intreate of
the things themselues?</hi> So that, though the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> doe not intreat
directly of God, who is that <hi>Bonum,</hi> and <hi>Pulchrum;</hi> yet, in that they doe
speake &amp; intreate of his works, they doe obliquely speake of him. And though
they conclude not so directly &amp; pere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptorily, in this subiect of diuinity, as they
do in their owne proper subiect of Quantitie; wherein, as the <hi>Orator</hi> obserueth
they doe not <hi>persuadere, sed cogere;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cic. l. 4. Acad. p. 30.</note> yet, euen here, they doe affoord vs such
apt and fit resemblances, as, though they doe not <hi>cogere,</hi> yet may they well
<hi>persuadere: Such as well may induce vs, though they doe not inforce vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 And first for <hi>Geometry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Punctum in Geometrie leadeth men to God.</note> there is one maine position in it: which though
it be proper and naturall vnto that Art; yet leadeth it vs, by consequence,
vnto that aeternall and supernaturall power, which is called <hi>God.</hi> And that
breefly is this:<note place="margin">Arist. l. 1. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phys. c. 7. To. 2. p. 1383.</note> that, <hi>Punctum est principium omnis lineae.</hi> So that, all magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
and continuities are deduced from one originall prick.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Proclus</hi> calleth <hi>Punctum, magnitudinis parentem, &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem:</hi>
hee calleth <hi>a Pricke the parent of all magnitude.</hi> Which position, as
it hath his Mathematicall truth,<note place="margin">Proclus in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid. l. 2. c. 11. Serm. Philos. To. 2. p. 765.</note> in <hi>Geometry;</hi> so hath it his Physicall truth, in
<hi>naturall Philosophy.</hi> From whence it must needes follow, that all those so
largely extended lines, in the greatest bodies of the world, doe lineally des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
from one onely prick; which, in it selfe, is indiuisible. Now, what can
bee this one indiuisible pricke or point, which is the Author of all those
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:22084:155"/>
huge magnitudes, which are euidently seene in those vast, and extended bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the world, the heauens, and the elements, but onely God himselfe?
Can all those huge dimensions of those immense bodies, such heights, such
bredths, such depths, and such thicknesses, bee possibly deduced from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pricke, then onely from God? who, though hee be both higher then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
deeper then hell, broader then the sea, and thicker then the earth; yet is
hee, like a pricke in euery line of all of them; and, as vtterly vncapable of
any diuision, as is the very pricke of the <hi>Mathematician,</hi> which cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
by the ege of very thought. Vnto which <hi>Mathematicall</hi> conceit, of
deducing all magnitudes, and all their dimensions, from God, as from their
true Originall point; the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth seeme to allude, when
hee exciteth vs,<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>to comprehend, what is the bredth, and length, and depth, and
height, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 And indeed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Punctum</hi> in Geometry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth in some sort the nature of God.</note> if wee consider of the nature and power of a point or a
pricke in a line, and in all other continuities whatsoeuer, whether solides or
plaines; wee may easily perceiue, that there is in a pricke, a very great simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and resemblance of God. For first, as a point or pricke is the very first
fountaine of euery line, which is indeede nothing else, but only <hi>fluxus Puncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi>
so this whole <hi>vniuersality</hi> of things, which wee call <hi>the World,</hi> is indeed
nothings else, but a production, and elongation, and dilatation of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
goodnesse of <hi>Almighty God.</hi> The goodnesse of God is the onely true
point, from which all created things doe proceede.<note place="margin">Dionys. l. de coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesti Hierarch. c. 4. p. 29.</note> For, as <hi>Dionysius Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagita</hi>
very truely teacheth: <hi>Deus, bonitate ductus, omnes naturas in lucem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulit.
God, being onely led by his owne naturall goodnesse, was thereby induced
to create and make all things.</hi> This is the true Center of all good things,
which are but as the <hi>radij,</hi> that bee drawne from it. And this is that, which
the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> aymed at,<note place="margin">Arist. l. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phys. c. 5. To. 2. p, 1375.</note> in holding this position, that, <hi>Mathematicorum
principia, sunt omnium rerum principia. That the Principles of the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
are the beginnings of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as in euery line, and in euery part of it, wheresoeuer you cut it,
you shall surely finde a pricke; which was a <hi>communis Terminus</hi> vnto <hi>both</hi>
the diuided parts, being the beginning of the one, and the end of the other,
and which knitted, and vnited them both together: so, in euery part of the
world, which soeuer you contemplate, you shall find the mighty power of
the Spirit of God; which, like a common bond, knitteth all the seuerall
parts of euery thing together, and vniteth them all, in one common
nature. And this is manifestly acknowledged, euen by the Heathen
<hi>Poet:</hi>

               <p>So that, though by the error of his religion, he were led to affirme, that
there were many Gods; yet, by the strength and power of very reason, hee
was forced to yeeld, that there was nothing in God, but <hi>a most pure and simple
vnitie:</hi> which is indeede Gods <hi>Esse, cui totum est, esse vnum: whose onely being

<hi>Xenophanes àd totum coelum respiciens, ipsum vnum ait esse Deum.</hi> Yea, and
diuers of the <hi>Philosophers</hi> haue gone so farre, as not to thinke it inough to

               </p>
               <p>The reason of which their curiositie of speaking, was; because though all

name of <hi>Abstract Vnitie.</hi> For though God be one (as is confessed by them

                  <note place="margin">Bernard. l. 5. De Considerat. p, 1408.</note> 
                  <hi>Est Vnitas, quae collectiua dici potest, vt cùm

cùm multa membra vnum corpus constituunt. Est Vnitas coniugatiua, qua fit, vt

sed vnus sibimet semper nititur inueniri. Est consentanea, cum per

cùm anima votis omnibus adhaerens Deo, vnus spiritus est. Est &amp; dignatiua
vnitas, qua limus noster, à Dei verbo, in vnam assumptus est personam. There
is an Vnitie, which is made by collection; as when many Stones doe make but one
heape. There is an Vnitie, which is made by composition; as when many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
doe make but one body. There is an Vnitie which is made by coniunction; as
when man &amp; wife are now no more two, but become one flesh. There is an Vnitie,
which is made by stabilitie; as when a man is constant in his vertue, whereby he
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:22084:158"/>
is alwayes one, and like vnto himselfe. There is an vnity, which is made by
consent; as when, through Christian charity, there is found but one heart and one
minde in many. There is an vnity, that is made by deuotion; as when the soule
adhaering vnto God by piety and religion, is thereby made but one Spirit with
him. And there is an vnity, which is made by vouchsafing; as when God the
word vouchsafed to assume the nature of man, into the indentity of his owne
person.</hi> These bee the eight kindes of S. <hi>Bernards vnity:</hi> wherein I will not
censure, either any impropriety, or any coincidency: because they all may
well passe for seuerall kindes of Vnity, in the popular capacity. But yet hee
affirmeth of them all, that all these vnities are but to little purpose if they bee
compared to the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> much more then being compared to
the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Deity. Haec omnia</hi> (saith hee) <hi>quid ad illud summum, atque
(vt ita dicam) vnicè vnum, vbi vnitatem consubstantialitas facit? All these
vnities are as good as nothing, in respect of that vnity, which is found in the
Deity, by Consubstantiality. Huic vni, quiduis illorum si assimiles, erit quoquo
modo vnum: si compares, nullo. To this vnity, if you doe but liken any of those
forenamed vnities, they may, in some degree, be sayd to bee vnities: but, if you
compare them, in no degree at all.</hi> Whereupon hee there concludeth: <hi>Igitur,

As <hi>Boetius</hi> well collecteth. <hi>There is in God no diuersitie, and therefore no plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie;
no multitude by accidents, and consequently no number.</hi> And this
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:22084:159"/>
simplicitie of his substance, is the first of those three reasons, for which God
is called One.</p>
               <p>The second is, from his <hi>Singularity;</hi> as the first was from his <hi>Simplicity.</hi>
Because there is no more Gods, but one; God is not onely one, but he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
<hi>The onely One.</hi> He is such an one, as hath no companion. Both which ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
are expresly ascribed vnto God in the Scriptures: both that <hi>He is One,</hi>
and that he is <hi>The onely One.</hi> The first of them, by the Prophet <hi>Moses: Audi
Israël,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Dominus Deus noster, Deus vnus est. The Lord our God is One God.</hi>
The second by the Prophet <hi>Isay:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 43. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Before me there was no God, neither shal there
be any after me.</hi> So that God is so one, that he is <hi>The onely one.</hi> He is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>vnus,</hi> but also <hi>vnicus:</hi> or, to vse S. <hi>Bernards</hi> word,<note place="margin">Bernard, l. 5. de Consid. p, 1047.</note> 
                  <hi>Si dici potest, vnissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

of this his <hi>Singularitie,</hi> because he is <hi>One,</hi> without any companion, is God
called,<note place="margin">Plut. l. 1. de plac. c. 7. To. 1. p, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>One,</hi> euen of the very Heathen. <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> as before I noted,
in their definition of God, ascribe vnto him Vnitie, with particular respect
vnto his Singularitie. For, they define God to be, <hi>Vnum, singularis, &amp; per se
subsistentis naturae: To be one, of a singular and incommunicable nature: To be
by nature one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cic. l. 1. de Nat. Deor. p, 188</note> 
                  <hi>and of himselfe subsisting.</hi> So likewise <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
affirmed, <hi>Populares esse Deos, multos; naturalem, vnum. That, though
there were many Gods, in popular opinion; yet that there is in nature, but onely
one.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plut. l. de E. I. To. 1. mor. p. 695</note> So likewise <hi>Plutarch:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Macrob. l. 1. Saturnal. c. 23. p. 224.</note> 
                  <hi>Non multa sunt Numina,</hi>

                  <hi>sed vnum. There be not
many Gods, but One.</hi> Which one God, he there thinketh to be the <hi>Sunne:</hi> as
<hi>Macrobius</hi> likewise doth: who applyeth all the names of the other Gods,
onely vnto him, as if he onely were all of them. <hi>Deus vnus, &amp; omnes,</hi> as
<hi>Varro</hi> speaketh: and they all, nothing else, but his seuerall names. Yea, and
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> in that place, collecteth the very same, out of two seuerall names
of the <hi>Sunne.</hi> The first, that he is called, <hi>Apollo: Quòd Vnicus sit,</hi> (of <hi>Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue,</hi>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) <hi>Voce multitudinis negationem arguente.</hi> The second, that
he is called <hi>Ieius:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Macrob. l. 1. Satur. c. 7. p, 200 Varro. lib. 4 de Lingua Latina, p. 13.</note> which soundeth as much as <hi>vnicus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Item Cic. l. 3. de Nat. Deor. p, 233.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; solus.</hi> Though
<hi>Macropedius</hi> interpret that name otherwise. So that there is but one <hi>God,</hi> as
there is but one <hi>Sunne:</hi> which therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Solem, quasi so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
that is to say, <hi>The sole One.</hi> And so may God be called; likewise, for the
very same reason: as <hi>Boetius</hi> very wittily obserueth;
<q>
                     <l>Quem, quia respicit omnia, Solus,</l>
                     <l>Verum possis dicere Solem.<note place="margin">Boet. l. 5. de Con. Metro. 2. p, 1100</note>

                     <l>Being solely one,</l>
                     <l>Thou mayst him truely call,</l>
                     <l>The very Sunne.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the second reason, why God is called One: in respect of his
<hi>Singularitie,</hi> because there is no other God, but <hi>He.</hi>
               </p>

omnia: vt quae in Creatore fuerunt omnia, antequàm creasset omnia.</hi> He saith,
<hi>That All things are One, and One is all: because they all were in their Maker,

aut omnia esse eius nomen; aut ipsum, omnium nominibus nuncupari. Either his
name must bee All things; or else, he must be named, by the name of all things.</hi>
So likewise,<note place="margin">Stob. l. Eclog. Phys c. 1. p, 2.</note> both <hi>Zeno,</hi> and <hi>Melissus</hi> defined God to be, <hi>Et Vnum, &amp; omne:
To be One, that is All things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which speeches of the Heathen, in making God <hi>All things,</hi> and in calling
him by all names; lest it should seeme to imply an vtter confusion of the
<hi>Creator</hi> with the <hi>Creature; Dionysius</hi> expresseth them both, in a more quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
manner, bringing a commodious exposition, to mollifie the hardnes of
the position.<note place="margin">Dionys. l. de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin. Nom. cap, 1. p, 201.</note> For he sayth, that God is, <hi>Omnia quae sunt, &amp; nihil eorum quae
sunt: He is, in some sense, all things that be; and yet, in another sense, none of
all the things that be.</hi> Now, in what sense it is, that hee calleth God, <hi>All
things;</hi> hee expoundeth himselfe, in the very same place: because, <hi>God is both
in mundo, circa mundum, &amp; supra mundum: He is, both in the World, about the
World,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. c. 13. p, 130.</note> 
                  <hi>and aboue the World.</hi> And somewhat more fully, in another place:
because, <hi>in divina vnitate, singillatìm collecta &amp; coniuncta sunt omnia, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanti
modo, &amp; antè, eximiè insunt. Because all things had a being in God,
after a speciall, and most excellent manner, before they had any being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</hi>
And in this sense it must bee taken, when they say; <hi>God is, Omnia.</hi>
And so likewise,<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 1. p, 200.</note> for his name: hee sayth, that <hi>God may bee praysed by vs; hoth
vt nomine vacantem, &amp; vt omni nomine: both as hauing no name, and yet as
hauing euery name:</hi> Because euery thing that hath a name, is the worke of
God.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. de vera Relig. c. 1. To. 1. p, 675.</note> So that, to conclude this point with the sentence of S. <hi>Augustine:
Vnitas illa, à qua, omnis vniversitas &amp; inchoatur, &amp; perficitur, &amp; continetur,
est Vnus Deus. That Vnity, from whence the Vniuersality is both begunne, and
prefected, and praeserued, is onely the vnity of the Godhead.</hi> Wherein, though
there be a <hi>Trinity</hi> of persons; yet is there but an vnity of substance: yea and
that an indiuisible Vnity too.<note place="margin">Dionys. l. de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin. Nom. cap. 2. p, 204.</note> For the Vnity of the Trinity, is, not onely,
<hi>Vnitas coniuncta;</hi> but also, <hi>plusquàm coniuncta:</hi> as <hi>Dionysius</hi> truely noteth.
<hi>It is not an vnity conioyned,</hi> of things by nature differing: but <hi>more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned,</hi>
of things in nature consenting.</p>
               <p>4 Thus,<note place="margin">Vnity hath in it a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of God.</note> 
                  <hi>Arithmeticall vnity,</hi> being rightly vnderstood, and fitly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
doth leade vs, by the hand, vnto the knowledge of God. Yea, and as I
shewed before, of <hi>Punctum in Geometry;</hi> that it hath diuers lines, as mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammall
draughts of the image of God: so may the same be shewed in
<hi>Arithmeticall vnity.</hi> First, it hath a resemblance of Gods omnipotent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer:
whereby hee both maketh and destroyeth all things, at his pleasure. For,
as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> affirmeth of God,<note place="margin">Psalme, 104. 198.</note> that, <hi>When hee sendeth forth his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
all things are created; and when hee but turnes his face, they are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:22084:160"/>
destroyed:</hi> so may it bee truely obserued of <hi>vnity;</hi> that it hath the like
power, among his numbers, that God almighty hath, among his Creatures.
For, all numbers haue, not onely their greatnesse and perfection, but also their
essence and being, from <hi>One.</hi> But <hi>it,</hi> from none. As for example. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to make <hi>Two,</hi> or a <hi>Binary,</hi> which is the first number: adde, but <hi>One,</hi> vnto
<hi>One,</hi> and you make <hi>Two.</hi> If <hi>Three,</hi> or a <hi>Ternary;</hi> adde but <hi>One,</hi> vnto <hi>Two;</hi> and
you make <hi>Three.</hi> And so, <hi>in infini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>um.</hi> Nay, the very name of all other
numbers, implieth no more, but so many <hi>Ones. An Hundred, A Thousand,
a Million,</hi> doth signifie no more, but an <hi>Hundred,</hi> a <hi>Thousand,</hi> and a <hi>Million of
Ones.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stob. l. Eclog. Phys. cap. 2 p, 3.</note> For, <hi>Numerus</hi> is defined, by <hi>Moderatus Pythagoricus,</hi> to be nothing else,

So that, the very essence and being of all other numbers whatsoeuer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
odde, or euen, dependeth but on <hi>One.</hi> Yea, and so doth likewise their
destruction, and dissolution. As we may euidently see, if wee will but walke
rerograde, the same way backe againe. For, take but <hi>One,</hi> from <hi>Three;</hi> and
you not onely vtterly destroy the odnesse, but also the essence of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.<note place="margin">Si quis a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro vnitatem ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulerit, alius relinquetur nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And so likewise, from any other. <hi>From</hi> what number soeuer, you shall
take but <hi>one,</hi> you destroy his nature. And <hi>to</hi> what number soeuer, you shall
adde but one, you make it another. Take one from the greatest number, and
you make it lesse. Adde one to the least number, and you make it greater.
<hi>Take one from an odde number, and you make it euen. Adde one to an euen
number, and you make it odde. Vnitas, pari addita, imparem; impari, parem

doth all, among his Creatures: so likewise doth <hi>Vnity,</hi> among all numbers:

Secondly, there is in <hi>Vnity</hi> a representation of Gods abolute perfection.
For, as God hath his whole subsisting of himselfe, so that he cannot be made
either greater, or lesser, by any of his creatures: so likewise hath <hi>Vnity.</hi> It
hath his owne subsistence, absolutely in it selfe. For tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g the essence of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
numbers dependeth vpon One; yet the essence of one dependeth vpon
none. You cannot take any thing from one, to make it lesse: and you cannot
adde any thing to one, to make that one greater. For, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> truly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth:<note place="margin">Arist. l. 13. Met. c. 8 To. 2.</note>
                  <hi>Vnum,</hi> as it is not<note n="a" place="margin">p, 1522.</note>

                  <hi>Combinabile. Vnity can
neither be diuided nor increased.</hi> For, when One is added vnto One, there is
by their coniunction, produced another number; but yet neither of these two
vnities, is in it selfe, made greater, but abideth firme and stedfast, in his owne
stable nature; as God himselfe doth. And therefore, <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> euen in
this respect,<note place="margin">Iust. Mart. lib. Quaest. &amp; R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sp. Quaest. 113. To. 3. p, 137,</note> compareth <hi>Vnitie</hi> vnto God. <hi>Quemadmodùm vnitati, id nihil
confert ad perfectionem, quòd principium sit numeri: (Nam etiamsi principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
numeri non esset, perfecta tamen esset: &amp; cum principium eius facta sit, non
aucta tamen est) sic Deus quoque, ante creationem perfectus erat, &amp; post crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem
auctus non est. As it bringeth no perfection vnto an Vnity, that it is the
fountaine and beginning of numbers: (For though it were not the beginning of
any number, yet is an vnity perfect in its owne proper nature: and beeing the
fountaine and beginning of some number, it is thereby perfected neuer the
more) so God, who was perfect before the creation, yet is not made more perfect
by the creation.</hi> And this is the second degree of their comparison.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is in Vnitie, a draught and resemblance of Gods <hi>Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</hi>
For, as God is alwayes like vnto himselfe, and not subiect to so much
as to <hi>a shadow of Change:</hi> no more is <hi>Vnitie</hi> neither. It is not variable, by <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ia. 1. 17.</note>
or <hi>imparitie;</hi> by multiplicity, or paucity; as all other numbers be: but it
still continueth, in its owne nature, immutably. An Vnity is alwayes at vnitie
with it selfe,<note place="margin">Io. Pic. Mirand. in Heptaplo. l. 3. c. 1. p, 17.</note> and neuer varieth from it selfe. <hi>Est Vnitas</hi> (saith <hi>Mirandula)
omninò semper, à se perfecta, non egreditur se, sed indiuidua simplicitate, &amp;
solitaria sibi cohaeret. Vnity is simple and perfect in it selfe, neuer going out of
it selfe, but sticking vnto it selfe, vnchangeably, only by its owne sole and naturall
simplicity.</hi> So absolute is the nature of One, in it selfe, that it cannot be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
and so omnipotent toward others, that it changeth all numbers. So

               </p>

               <p>First therefore, as concerning the <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Heauens,</hi> it hath troubled

                     </gap>07.</note> That, <hi>Whatsoeuer things are moved, they must needs bee moved, either
by their owne natures; or, by force from others; or by a will in themselues.</hi>
Now, for the <hi>Heauens,</hi> he concludeth, that their motion cannot be natural,
because the Motion of all naturall Bodies, whether <hi>Simple</hi> or, <hi>Compound,</hi> is
either <hi>Vpward,</hi> or <hi>Downward.</hi> For, all Bodies are, either <hi>Light</hi> or, <hi>Heauy.</hi> If
<hi>Light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arist. l. 2. Phys. c. 9. To. 2. p. 440.</note> they moue directly <hi>vpward,</hi> If <hi>Heauy,</hi> they moue perpendicularly
<hi>downward.</hi> And, there is not any naturall Bodie in the world, which is so
aequally compounded of <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Heauie,</hi> that it can hang in the midst,
and propend neither way. And therefore, the <hi>Heauens,</hi> if they were left vnto
the motion of their owne proper natures, they would either moue <hi>vpward,</hi>
or <hi>downward,</hi> as the <hi>Elements</hi> doe; or else they must stand still. For, other
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:22084:162"/>
                  <hi>Motion,</hi> from their matter, they can haue none, as they be naturall Bodies.</p>
               <p>No, nor yet from their Forme neither, as they bee teret and round Bodies.
For, though their <hi>Rotundity</hi> doth giue them an aptitude and disposition to
bee carried about in their circular motion; yet giueth it not the motion it
selfe vnto them. As we may see in a wheele: which (for all his roundnesse)
stands as still as a stone, if it haue not some other means to helpe it vnto mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It may bee obiected; that the weightines of the wheele doth settle it
vpon his <hi>Axis,</hi> as in his proper place, where all things doe stand still. But it
may also bee answered; that the <hi>Heauens</hi> are in their proper place: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should stand still, yea though they had in them the principle of motion:
much more, they hauing none. As indeed they haue not, if they bee of such
a temper, as is neither <hi>Heauy,</hi> nor <hi>Light.</hi> For, if we could imagine, that nature
had made any thing, so equally tempered, and indifferently poised, of <hi>Heauy,</hi>
and <hi>Light,</hi> that neither were predominant; it must needes hang in the midst,
and not mooue it selfe, either <hi>vpward,</hi> or <hi>downewards.</hi> Neither could it
moue about, in a circular motion; vnlesse it were impelled, by some other
thing. For, Nature hath made nothing, which hath, in it selfe, the proper
principle of circular motion. I meane, not as it is a Body. The rotundity of
their forme, that giueth onely, vnto them, an hability to that motion (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I noted) but, the act, it giueth not. Neither can the vacuity of both
<hi>Heauinesse</hi> and <hi>Lightnesse,</hi> giue vnto them that motion: because, that is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the principle of <hi>station,</hi>

were a formall cause of circular motion; then, <hi>Materia prima</hi> (which <hi>Aristotle</hi>
maketh, to bee neither <hi>light,</hi> nor <hi>heauy</hi>) should, from all eternity, haue moued
circularly: and so there should haue bene a motion, before there was any
Heauen. Which hee derideth there, most iustly, as a grosse absurdity.

of the heauens, not proceeding, in them, from any naturall principle, inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in their bodies, it must needes, either be a violent motion, put vpon them
by an externall force, from some others; or else, a voluntary motion, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by an internall will in themselues. For, other principle, can be none, of
this circular motion. But, that it cannot be a motion, inforced vpon them,
hee assumeth from this ground: That there cannot bee any force, without
them, that is strong enough to compell them: there being no force that is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:22084:162"/>
greater then their owne.<note place="margin">Cic. vbi suprà.</note> 
                  <hi>Quae enim vis potest esse maior? What force can bee
greater?</hi> And againe, <hi>Quid potest esse mundo valentius, quod impellat, atque
moueat? What power can be greater, then the power of the world, that should bee
able to mooue it?</hi> Hee supposeth (though falsely) that there can no such
power bee. And therefore hee concludeth, That the motion of the
Heauens, must be, of necessity, a motion meerly voluntary, proceeding from
nothing else, but onely from their owne wills. Whereupon hee there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth,
that, <hi>Haec qui videt, non solùm indoctè, sed etiam impiè faciet, si Deos
esse neget: That, this being admitted, he must not onely be vngodly, but also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
too, if hee deny them to be Gods:</hi> meaning, <hi>The Heauens</hi> and <hi>Starres.</hi>
This is the summe of his reason, from the motions of the Starres. Wherein,
though hee leade vs neuer so farre about; yet, at last, hee bringeth vs home
vnto our Conclusion: <hi>That there needs must be a God:</hi> and, that the Heauens,
by their motion, do plainely proue the same. An Argument largely handled
by the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 19. Psal.<note place="margin">Psalme 19.</note> And though <hi>Tully,</hi> in that place, doe
bring the whole Argument vnto a false issue, building vpon a false ground;
<hi>That the motion of the Heauens is voluntary, and of themselues;</hi> and that <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
They be Gods:</hi> though, I say, it be false, in the particular, <hi>That the Heauens
and Stars, be Gods;</hi> yet it is true in the generall, that it proueth most certainly,
that <hi>There needes must be a God;</hi> and, that this motion of the Heauens, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly be stirred by any other cause, but onely by God himselfe.</p>
               <p>For, if the motion of the Heauens (being admitted to be voluntary) doe
conclude <hi>them</hi> to bee Gods; then must needes the same motion (being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be compulsory) much more conclude, that he, by whose force they
be so violently compelled, must needes be God. As, euen <hi>Plato</hi> himselfe hath

he, rendring a reason, why certaine of the Starres be called Planets: that is to

a concent and agreement in the heauens, to keepe so constantly, their seuerall

which by themselues, cannot possibly be done, no more, then any musicall

is carried so farre, that he, not onely affirmeth, that God hath giuen

that, <hi>The Sunne knoweth his going downe:</hi> yet, that must be taken, not to

in the ayre knoweth, whither it flyeth; or, a ship in the water, whither it say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth;
or, a Chariot on the earth, whither it runneth. And yet, as when we
see an arrow, to fly directly to any marke, whereunto it is aymed; though
we see not the Archer, by whom it was shot; yet must we know, in reason,
that it surely was directed by some skilfull person; because it goeth so direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hauing yet no skill to direct it selfe: so, when we see the heauens to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
vpon the earth, so many good effects, by yeelding vnto it such fruitfull
season.<note place="margin">Gen. 8. 22.</note> and bringing out of it such plenty and variety of excellent fruites,
whereby both men and beasts are nourished: and that they, ayming at this
end, doe neuer faile to hit their marke: wee needes must vnderstand (if wee
haue any vnderstanding) that this course is directed, by some heauenly <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittarius,</hi>
indued with excellent skill, and reason. For, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth,
insisting vpon this very comparison:<note place="margin">Aquin. 1. Quaest. 105. Arct. 1. p. 218.</note>

declareth, that it was shot by one, that well knew, whereunto he had aymed it: so
the certaine mouing of all naturall things, which know not themselues any thing
of their owne motion, declareth, that they are moued, by on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And so likewise, for the other two comparisons. When we behold a ship,
to winde, and to turne, and to fetch about, so diuersly; and yet to come, at
last, into that very hauen, which it intended, at the first: wee must needs
know as certainly, that it is guided by the reason of some skilfull Pilot, as
we certainly know, that it hath no proper reason of it owne, to guide it: as
<hi>Theophilus Antiochenns</hi> obserueth, insisting vpon this second Comparison.

As when a man shall see a Ship, rigged out, with all her tacklings, to saile through
the Sea, and directly to arriue at her desired hauen; he must needs know, she

               </p>
               <p>And so likewise it is, in the mouing of a Chariot. It cannot goe whither
it is purposely intended, if it haue not some skilfull driuer, to direct it. In
like case, the Heauens themselues, they could neuer moue, so orderly, and
directly, in their courses, if God himselfe were not the ruler, &amp; director of their
motions: <hi>quasi Auriga, habenas, &amp; gubernator, clavum tenens</hi> (saith <hi>Philo Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus,</hi>
insisting vpon this third comparison) <hi>holding their raynes, like their
Driuer, and their helme, like their Gouernour.</hi> So that, though we grant, that

yet is it not, by their owne wisdome; but, by the arte and wisdome of that

it.</p>
               <p>And so is it likewise, with the Heauens. Their turning, and returning, so
swiftly, so orderly, so constantly, to so many good effects, as they bring forth

motion: but it is none of their owne. It is the wisdome of God, who both made,
and ruleth euery thing.</hi> So that, it may truely be sayd of the Heauens, as it

When we see anything moued by an artificiall engine, as a Sphere, or a Clocke,
or any other such like thing, wee neuer make any doubt, but that those Workes
were wrought by reason: And, can wee then doubt, when we see the heauens to
mooue, with such incredible celerity, and yet to keepe their yearely courses, with
such admirable constancy, procuring vnto all things, both their health, and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that this must be the worke, not onely of reason, but also of Diuine, and most
excellent Reason?</hi> Ascribing the regularity of their motion, not vnto their
owne, but vnto <hi>Diuine Wisdome.</hi> In which sentence, though it should bee

other, but their owne, as reckoning the Starres themselues, to be Gods: yet,
euen so, it proues the Cause: that the motions of the Heauens being so
constant, and orderly, cannot otherwise bee stirred, but by the wisedome of
God. And consequently, that it sheweth, that there needes must be a God.
Yea, and in another place, hee goeth further, affirming of this so apt and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

               <p>His second Reason,<note place="margin">Arist. l. de Coelo c. 8. To. 1. p. 587.</note> is this; that, <hi>Nature hath not giuen a voluntary or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal-motion

               <p>Now, to recollect the summe of this long Chapter: If this regular, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

But, the three former branches are largely proued, in three Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

when the fire descended, and destroyed their fruite: the water putrified, and
turned into blood: the aire was poisoned, with noysome flyes: and the earth
corrupted, with the stinke of their froggs. Here was a great change, from
that sweete and melodious tune, which God intended in their first Creation,
into an harsh and vnpleasant one. But yet, euen in this change of their tune,
they kept still a good harmony; and harmony concording with Gods seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
though somewhat discording with his mercy. As the <hi>Wiseman</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,

               <p>Let vs now descend, as yet one steppe lower, vnto those compounded Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which are made of their mixtures: and we shall see, that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the like <hi>Harmonies</hi> vnto them. First an <hi>Harmonie</hi> of <hi>Concords;</hi> which
euidently appeareth in that amicable and louing agreement, that is seene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
all the parts of their bodies, in seruing, and cherishing, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one another: which they doe, and performe, with that true sympathy
&amp; compassion,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 26.</note> that, <hi>if one member suffer, all the rest do suffer with it: &amp;, if one
be had in honour, al the rest reioyce with it.</hi> And diuers other notes there be
of a singular symphonie and agreement betweene them.<note place="margin">Hugo. de vict. l. 7. Erudit. didasc c. 4. To. 3. p. 18. N</note> Wherein, as <hi>Hugo de

vt nullum omninò possit inveniri membrum, cuius officum alteri non videa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
afferre adminiculum. Al the members of the body, are ioyned together, in so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
an vnitie, that there is not any of them, but that in discharging his own proper
office, it bringeth also some helpe vnto his other fellow-members.</hi> Whereupon he
there concludeth: <hi>Sic omnis natura se diligit, &amp; miro quodam modo plurium
dissimilium in vnum redactorum concordia, vnam in omnibus Harmoniam
facit. Thus euerything, by nature, is louing to it selfe, and by ioyning things
vnlike in true concord together, after an admirable manner, it maketh, in the
whole body, a most sweete and pleasant Harmonie.</hi> This Harmonie of <hi>Concords</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now, he hath also placed among them, another kinde of <hi>Harmonie,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting

beget in the world, a most sweet &amp; wholesome Concord. I meane, not only of
those <hi>Sympathies,</hi> and <hi>Antipathies,</hi> which God hath planted in diuers of his

giue any reason (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> truly noteth, <hi>Aelianus</hi> confirmeth) but, euen in the
other most common &amp; ordinary workes of God, we shal finde none of them so
free, but that it hath in nature, in some sort, his contrarie. So that, the frame of
the whole world, doth seeme to benothing else, but only a mixture &amp; compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition

they did in the masse of their confused <hi>Chaos:</hi> wherein, as the <hi>Poet</hi> describeth it,

                  </q>
And such is still the fight and conflict of contraries, euen in this well ordered
and beautifull world, though the same hand, which then distinguished them
into their seuerall orders, doth now so moderate and keepe them in order,
that their contraries and repugnancies tende, both vnto the safetie, and beauty
of the world; and not, either to the hurte, or to the blemish of it. In which
respect, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> compareth that <hi>Naturall order,</hi> which God hath taken,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:22084:173"/>
in mingling of <hi>Contraries,</hi> through all the rancks of his Creatures, to that

reddunt; ita, quadam, non verborum, sed rerum, eloquentia, contrariorum appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitione,
seculi pulchritudo componitur. As contraries, opposed vnto contraries, do
yeeld a kind of grace &amp; beautie to the speech, so God, by placing contraries against
their contraries, in a kinde, not of verbal, but of real eloquence, hath giuen a
great grace and beautie to his worke.</hi> Which conceit of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> deliuered
by him,<note place="margin">Tertul. l. 1. cont. Marcion. c. 16. p. 357.</note> but in generall termes, is illustrated by <hi>Tertullian;</hi> by the apposition.
of many very notable particular instances, and those very fit and apposite.
Tota operatio <hi>Dei, ex diversitatibus constat; ex Corporalibus, &amp; incorporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus;
ex animalibus, &amp; inanimalibus; ex vocalibus &amp; mutis; ex mobilibus
&amp; stativis; ex genitalibus &amp; sterilibus; ex aridis, &amp; humidis: ex calidis &amp;
frigidis; &amp;c. The whole workemanship of God is compounded all of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
of things corporeal, and incorporeall; of things liuing, and without life;
of things loquent, and silent; of things moueable, and vnmoueable; of things
fertile, and sterile; of things dry, and moyst; of things hot, and cold; &amp;c.</hi> And
the same that hee hath shewed, by those instances, in the great world, he
proceedeth to declare, in <hi>Man</hi> also, the little world. <hi>Sic, &amp; Hominem ipsum
diversitas temperavit, tam in corpore, quàm insensu. Alia membra fortia,
alia infirma; alia honesta, alia inhonesta; alia gemina, alia vnica; alia compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
alia disparia. Perindè, &amp; in sensu: nunc laetitia, nunc anxietas; nunc a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
nunc odium; nunc ira, nunc lenitas. In like case, Man himselfe is made by God
of meerely Contraries: and that not only in his body, but also in his soule too. Some
parts of Man be strong, &amp; some againe be weake; some comely, some homely;
some double, some single; some aequall, some vnaequall. And so likewise in his mind
there is sometimes mirth, and sometimes greife; sometimes loue, and sometimes
hate; sometimes feircenes, and sometimes mildnesse.</hi> So that, the whole world
is,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 33. 3.</note> in effect, nothing else but only a massie Coagmentation of <hi>Contraries.</hi> As
<hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> also directly obserueth. <hi>Euill is against good, &amp; death against life;
the Godly against the sinner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ecclus. 33. 14</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; the vniust against the faithfull. And so, in all the
workes of the most High, thou mayst see, that there be euer Two: and the one
of them, is against the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is this, the onely Obseruation of religious Christians; but also,
of the irreligious <hi>Heathen.</hi> Wherein, many of the most learned haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
concurred, affirming, that God (like a skilfull Painter to shew the
grace of his worke the better, hath composed the whole world of
opposite parts; as it were, of <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>shadowes.</hi> Which as <hi>Trismegistus</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:22084:173"/>
noteth, is a matter, of so pure and absolute necessity, that, without it, the
world could haue had no beautie. For, if <hi>Contraries</hi> had not bene thus ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together, the curious workes of <hi>Nature</hi> could not haue beene distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
one of them from another.<note place="margin">Trismeg. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Dial. 10. p, 424.</note> And therefore he pronounceth, that, <hi>Ex op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positione

grace or beauty in the worke: so in all the workes of <hi>Nature,</hi> if all were good,
or all bad, there could be no grace or sweetnesse in any of them, because no
distinction.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (as <hi>Varro</hi> obserueth) maintained this opinion:

                  <note place="margin">Arist, l. 1. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phys. cap. 5. To. 2. p, 1376.</note>

expressed more fully: who setteth downe distinctly, ten seuerall combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Contraries, which the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> defended, <hi>to be the first Principles
and Originals of all things:</hi> As namely these following. <hi>Finitum, &amp; infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;

Resting, and Mouing; Straight, and Crooked; Light, and Darkenesse; Good, and

world; but also, to bee the working Principles of all things in the world.
And therefore their Effects must needes be contrary,<note place="margin">Arist. ibid.</note> as well as their Causes.
In which opinion, <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

doubteth, whether hee borrowed his opinion from them, or they theirs from

of all the <hi>Philosophers: That the first Principles of all thing must needes

handleth this point more exactly, then any, &amp; brings it home more properly
vnto our present purpose. That, in this mixing of <hi>Contraries,</hi> in all sorts of

Nature is strangely carried with a strong desire, of ioyning contrary things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;

yet consisteth of persons of contrary conditions; some poore, some rich;

                  <hi>yet make they a sweete concord, in the Ciuill State.</hi> In Artificiall things
hee obserueth, that, <hi>Ars, adimitationem Naturae, se componens, idem praestat.
That Art, as it imitateth Nature, in many other things; so doth it also in this,
that it maketh all her workes of a mixture of contraries.</hi> Whereof hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

mixeth contrary sounds in her Songes: as Sharps, with flats; and briefes, with

which pierceth, and disperseth it selfe, through the whole world, ioyning dry
things, with moyst, and hot things, with cold; light things, with heauy; and
crooked, with straite: and yet, by this contrary composition, very excellently
beautifying, both the earth, and sea, and skie, and Sun, and Moone, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

made choise of it, of set purpose, thereby to expresse, with a greater <hi>Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
the incredible power of Musick, vnto vs. Which, indeed, is very great
yea, and not onely with vs men; but also with euery other liuing thing:
both with <hi>Birds,</hi> and with <hi>Beasts,</hi> and with <hi>Fishes;</hi> yea, and euen with very
<hi>Wormes.</hi> As wee may see, in all of them, if wee will but looke vpon
them.</p>
               <p>First, for <hi>Birds:</hi> there is no man, but may obserue, by his daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
with what a singular delight, they vse to solace, and entertaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
with their naturall Musick; chaunting-out their sweete melodie, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the pleasant branches of euery greene tree. A thing expresly noted by
the holy Prophet <hi>Dauid:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 104. 12. 24.</note> and by him there ascribed, to be the worke of
God. Neither are they onely delighted with their owne naturall Musick;
but also with Mans artificiall Musick. As we may euidently see, in <hi>Thrushes
Linnets,</hi> and <hi>Blackbirds,</hi> and such like, with what attention they will listen,
vnto the pleasant sounds of Musicall Instruments: yea, and how perfectly
they will learne the tunes of those Songs, that be whistled vnto them.
Which artificiall notes, they could neuer possibly either learne so quickly,
or render so exactly, but that the seeds of true Harmonie, be sowne in their
soules, as well as in mens. Yea, and their delight in Musick is so great,
that they often-times forget their very safetie it selfe, in comparison of it.
As it is noted, by the Poet:<note place="margin">Cato. l. 1. p.</note>

vpon earth, but descended downe from Heauen. Yea, and that, in

His Reasons bee these following.<note place="margin">Hesiod. in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. p, 80.</note> First, that <hi>Hesiodus;</hi> who writeth the
generation of their Gods, recording exactly, from whence they first sprang,
calleth one of their <hi>Muses, Vrania;</hi> which signifieth, <hi>Heauenly.</hi> Insinuating
thereby, that there is <hi>Musicke</hi> in Heauen: and, that from heauen it first was
brought, by the <hi>Muses,</hi> vnto men. In whom also wee may obserue, that hee
maketh <hi>Harmonia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid, p, 128.</note> to haue bene the Daughter of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> two of
the Heathen Gods: thereby againe implying, that <hi>Harmony</hi> was first begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Heauen. Another of his Reasons is, that <hi>Hesiodus</hi> calleth another of
the <hi>Muses,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: her name being giuen, for <hi>the sweetensse of her voice;</hi> as
<hi>Vrania's</hi> was, from <hi>the highnesse of the place.</hi> Thereby againe implying; that
<hi>The sweetenesse of voice, hath the highest place in Heauen.</hi> Another: that
the Heathen called <hi>Apollo,</hi> who was one of their greatest gods, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>quasi

that, euen their very <hi>Rusticks,</hi> called the <hi>Muses, Camoenas, quasi Cane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas;
Acanendo dictas,</hi> that is, <hi>Singing Damosels.</hi> Now, the <hi>Muses</hi> (as they
all confesse) descended first from Heauen. Another: that, in all their fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
pompes, and solemne exequies, they still carried-out their dead, with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
instruments:<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 23.</note> which was likewise in practice, euen among the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And
this, he saith, they did, to signifie that their soules were now departed, vnto
the originall house of <hi>Musicke: Ad originem dulcedinis Musicae, idest, ad
Coelum:</hi> in their owne interpretation. And this, againe hee saith, is the true
Cause, why euery mans soule is so much delighted with <hi>Musicke</hi> vpon earth:
<hi>Quia in Corpus defert memoriam Musicae, ciuius in Coelo fuit conscia: Because
it bringeth downe with it, into the Body, a remembrance of that Musicke,
whereof, in Heauen, it had a full fruition.</hi> These, and diuers such like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
hee congesteth, in that place, to proue, that <hi>Musicke</hi> descended first
from Heauen. Of which, though some bee not greatly strong; yet they
strongly shew, that, euen the Heathen held this, as a sacred opinion, that <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
is Gods gift, and not mans inuention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and that which the Heathen haue so ingenuously acknowledged, of

tot Artes, tot vocum varietates, tot sonos, alios, spiritu nostro; alios, externo,

play, vpon rude and homely pipes, fit for rude and Country song's; but that
first hath invented all those Arts, all those varieties of voices, and all those
sounds, whereby, either with our owne breath, or with others, we expresse all

Thus, not onely <hi>Musicke</hi> it selfe, of all kindes; but also all Musicall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of all sorts, are (euen in the iudgment of the very Heathen) confessed
to bee the gifts of God vnto Men. Which, though they bee made by
the hand of man; yet were they directed by the wisdome of God. And
therefore the Heathen haue iustly ascribed them, not vnto him that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:22084:179"/>
wrought them,<note place="margin">The chiefest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> end of Musick is to praise God with it.</note> but vnto him that taught them.</p>
               <p>5 Now, as God hath giuen vnto man, a natural kind of <hi>Musick,</hi> wherewith
his soule is delighted; so hath hee also giuen him a naturall sense, and instinct
to worship God with it, as a tribute, due to him, from whom it was first gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
As may be euidently seene, by the generall practice both of <hi>Christians,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Heathens.</hi> Who, as they doe agree by the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> in worshipping of
God; so doe they likewise agree, by the same light of Nature, to vse Musicke
in his worship. For the practice of <hi>Christians:</hi> the whole Booke of Psalmes
is an euidence of it. Which, as it was dayly sung in the old Church of the
<hi>Iewes;</hi> so is it still dayly sung in all the Churches of <hi>Christians,</hi> through the
whole world of <hi>Christianitie.</hi> In which Booke (being penned by the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi>) we may obserue, three remarkeable things. First, that, as God hath
appointed vnto man, a <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> wherein to praise and serue him: so hath
hee also appointed them to serue him,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16.</note> with <hi>hymnes, and psalmes, and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
songs.</hi> Yea, and, among them, hath selected certaine speciall Psalmes,
from among all the rest, as specially appropriated vnto those <hi>Sabbath Dayes:</hi>
As may be euidently seene, by the title and inscription, of the 92. Psalme; <hi>A
Psalme,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal 92.</note> or <hi>Song, for the Sabbath Day.</hi> Secondly, that hee hath further had a
speciall care, not onely of the Dittie, but also of the Tune too. As it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
appeareth by the Titles and inscriptions of diuers other Psalmes. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistro
Symphoniae ad pneumatica instrumenta.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 4. 5. 6. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Magistro Symphoniae fidium ad
grauem symphoniam. Magistro Symphoniae acutae ad medianam:</hi> and diuers
others such like. Thirdly, that, not contented with the Musick of mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
voices, he hath further added to them (for the quickning of deuotion)
the helpe of all sorts of Musicall instruments.<note place="margin">Psal. 150. 3. 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Praise him, in the sound of the
Trumpet. Praise him, vpon the Lute, and Harpe. Praise him, with Timbrels, and
Flute, with Virginals, and Organs, and with high sounding Cymbals.</hi> Thus,
God himselfe hath required, to haue his Seruice furnished, with all the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sorts of <hi>Musick,</hi>

and diuine, that it seemeth to haue beene giuen by God, vnto men, to this
speciall ende; that by it Men might set out the glorie of God. And therefore

                  <hi>for his goodnesse.</hi> VVhich office the

for all his benefits? I will take vnto me, the Cup of saluation, and will call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Name of the Lord.</hi> Here is the best returne, that by man can be made
to sacrifice the true thankfulnesse of his soule vnto God; as for all his other
inestimable Benefits, so for this among the rest, for giuing vs so Musicall and
tuneable a voice, whereby wee haue a meane to praise him for all the rest.

<hi>Laudes canere Deorum, qui soli ipsis articulatam vocem sunt largiti. It is a

pious and a principall duty of man, to sing prayses vnto God; who onely hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him that articulate voyce, whereby he is able to sing vnto him.</hi> Thus this
learned <hi>Philosopher,</hi> both deriueth the Arte of Musick from God, as from his
originall beginning; and referreth it vnto God, as to his principall ende.</p>
               <p>And this was not his opinion alone, but the very Religion, of all the rest of
the Heathen. As may be euidently seene, not onely in <hi>Hesiodus,</hi> but also in
<hi>Trismegistus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hesiod in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. p 78.</note> two of their cheife <hi>Divines.</hi> For the first of them: <hi>Hesiodus,</hi>
he maketh the Muses (who were the Authors of Musick) the Daughters of
<hi>Iupiter:</hi> and therefore, to drawe their originall from God. And he maketh
them againe, to sing alwayes before him: and therefore to referre all their
Musick vnto God. And <hi>Trismegistus</hi> likewise, expresly deliuereth, both the
very same points.<note place="margin">Trismeg. in Asclap. c. 5. p. 490.</note> For the first of them: he saith that, <hi>Musarum chorus, est a
summa Divinitate demissus, ne terrenus mundus videretur incultior, si modulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
dulcedine caruisset: That the Quire of the Muses, was sent downe from
heauen, from the highest of the Gods; lest this terrene and inferiour world
should be barbarous and rude, if it lacked the delight and sweetenesse of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</hi>
And, for the second of them, he addeth: <hi>Sed potiùs, vt modulatis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum
cantilenis concelebretur laudibus, qui solus dat omnia; vt Pater est
omnium. But yet the higher ende of musick was, that, by mens delightfull mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
hee might be onely praysed, who is the Giuer of all; as being indeed the
very Father of all.</hi> So then Musick was first giuen by God to Men; that
Men might, by it, giue due praises vnto God. For the true vse of Musicke
(as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> obserueth) is principally this,<note place="margin">Athenaeus. l. 14. p. 471.</note> 
                  <hi>Deorum laudes Musicis Canticis

the ancient Musick (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> recordeth) <hi>was only vsed in the Temples, for
the worship of God;</hi>

and Orthography.</hi> In both which parts of it, God hath had a speciall
hand; as, euen by the Heathen themselues, is acknowledged: in the first of
them, <hi>Orthology;</hi> in teaching men the right imposition of names: in the
second of them, <hi>Orthography;</hi> in teaching them the rare inuention of letters.
Two workes of so diuine and heauenly an inuention, that, without them,
humane life were nothing but confusion.</p>
               <p>For the better, and more cleere demonstration whereof, wee are to know
thus much. That the facultie of speaking is not naturall vnto a man, no
more then to a Beast. A man hath no more giuen speech vnto himselfe, then
hee hath giuen himselfe the Tongue, wherewith hee speaketh. But God is
the giuer of them both. And the tongue of a man, would be altogether as
dumbe, as the tongue of a Beast; if God himselfe, at the first, had not taught
it how to speake. Therefore, this gift of speaking, as it was at the first habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
infused into <hi>Adam,</hi> so hath it euer since bene propagated from him, by
onely imitation.</p>
               <p>I know, it is an old receiued opinion, that (notwithstanding this great
varietie of seuerall languages, which wee see entertained in diuers nations)
yet that man hath a naturall speech of his owne, as hee is a man: which lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
hee would speake by nature, if hee were not taught some other. But
this is but a dreame: and hath beene twice refuted, by a double experiment.
The first was,<note place="margin">Herod. l. 2. p.</note> by <hi>Psammeticus,</hi> a King of <hi>Egypt:</hi> who desiring to vnderstand,
which was mans most ancient and naturall language, hee caused two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to bee sequestred from all society of men, and to bee nourished onely
by sucking two shee-goates, forbidding all speech vnto them. VVhich
Children, continuing for a long time dumbe, at last vttered, <hi>Bec, Bec.</hi>
The King being informed, that, in the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Language, <hi>Bec,</hi> signified
<hi>Bread,</hi> imagined that the Children called then for <hi>Bread:</hi> and from thence
collected, that, because they spake that language which no man had taught
them, that therefore the Phrygian language was the naturall speech of man.
A silly proofe,<note place="margin">Plut. l. 1. de Placitis, c. 17. To. 2. p. 15.</note> God knoweth. His conceit of <hi>Bec, Bec,</hi> well deseruing to be
numbered with those <hi>Becceselenae,</hi> those doting old tales, which haue euer
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:22084:181"/>
beene contemned of those that are wise. For the Childrens <hi>Bec, Bec,</hi> (as is
probably collected) was onely that language which they learned of their
Goat-nurses, when they came to suck their teates. Who, receiuing of them
some ease by their sucking, saluted them with <hi>Bec,</hi> the best language which
they had. From whom the children learned it. And so much as they heard,
iust so much againe they vttered, &amp; no more. And if they had not heard
it, they could neuer haue pronounced it. As we may euidently see, by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
experiment tried vpon other Infants,<note place="margin">Purchas, Pilgrim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib. 1. c. 8. p, 40.</note> (which is our second instance)
by <hi>Melabdim Echebar,</hi> whom they call <hi>The great Mogor.</hi> He likewise (vpon
the fore-named error) that Man hath a certaine proper language by <hi>Nature,</hi>
caused thirty Children to be brought vp in dumbe silence, to finde out, by
experience, whether all of them would speake one and the same language? ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
inwardly a purpose, to frame his religion, conformable to that nation,
whose language should be spoken: as being that Religion, which is purely
naturall vnto man. But the Children proued all dumbe: though there were
so many of them. And therefore they could not speake because they were
not taught. Whereby it appeareth, that <hi>Speaking,</hi> which is the first part of
<hi>Grammer,</hi> is not in man by Nature. But the first man had it, by onely diuine
infusion; and all his posteritie, onely by imitation.</p>
               <p>Now the first element and originall of all speech, is the <hi>Imposition of
Names.</hi> Without which, there can be no distinction of things. I meane,
not, <hi>quoad nos;</hi> though, <hi>quoad naturam,</hi> they be sufficiently distinguished, by
those substantiall properties which are their essentiall and specificall differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But yet, they could haue no distinction in <hi>speech,</hi> if they were not diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by their seuerall names. No, nor in <hi>vse</hi> neither. For, if things were not
separated by their proper names,<note place="margin">Luke, 11. 11. 12.</note> then <hi>if a man should aske for Bread, they
might giue him a Stone; if for a Fish, a Serpent; if for an Egg, a Scorpion.</hi> And
so in all other things, there would follow like confusion. As we may see, in the
building of the Tower of <hi>Babilon:</hi> how when the Labourers vnderstood not
the names of those things, for which the Builders called, the worke was
brought vnto a stand, and could not goe forward. So that, the right orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of all humane affaires dependeth chiefely vpon the distinction of names,

of it. For the first of which two points. It is almost a miracle, that a
meane could be invented, whereby <hi>words</hi> and <hi>sounds,</hi> which naturally bee
the Obiects of the Eare, should be made the Obiects of the Eye. As we see
the one is, by <hi>Letters,</hi> in <hi>writing;</hi> the other, by <hi>notes,</hi> in <hi>singing.</hi> This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
an admirable invention, that sounds and voices should, by the power
of certaine <hi>Characters</hi> (as it were by <hi>Charmes</hi>) bee stolne away from their
owne proper sense, and conueyed vnto another, by <hi>Leger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>du Maìn,</hi> and so
made an Obiect of the same. This (I say) is a very wonder: and, among all
the senses, not to be found, in any other. No invention euer yet could
make the Obiect of <hi>Seeing,</hi> the Obiect of <hi>Hearing;</hi> nor the Obiect of <hi>Hearing</hi>
the Obiect of <hi>Smelling;</hi> nor the Obiect of <hi>Smelling,</hi> the Obiect of <hi>Feeling.</hi>
Onely the Obiect of <hi>Hearing,</hi> by this inuention of Letters, is made (in
some sort) the Obiect of <hi>Seeing.</hi> And this, by the goodnesse of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
man, for the increase of his knowledge and vnderstanding. Which is the
second point, that I obserued in it.</p>
               <p>For, by this rare invention of writing, it cannot be numbered, how many
great Benefits be vnto men conueyed. By writing, we may giue direction for
ourforaine Businesses, though we stay at home: and for our domestical, though
we be abroad. By writing, we may conferre with our absent Friend, as freely,
as with our present Neighbor; communicating all our counsells as secretly
and closly, as if we should whisper one in anothers eare: yea though we be

                  <hi>omnes rectè intelligant:</hi> as <hi>Euripides</hi> noteth, euen in this very

               <p>Yea (and that which farre surmounteth all that hitherto hath beene sayd)
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:22084:182"/>
by writing, wee haue the comfort of the holy word of God: which, from

nothing else but, <hi>Writing.</hi> Finally (to come home vnto this our owne

               <p>Beside which, this inuention of writing, and the conueying of the voice
vnto the eye from the eare, which I mentioned before, beguiling one sense of
his Obiect, to furnish another with it, doth (by intermingling the Offices of

which is the Arte of Pleading, much more be so. It is a farre higher
gift, to pleade then to speake. To speake, is euery mans gift; but to plead, the
gift of few. And therefore; as <hi>Plato</hi> collecteth in another like Case; <hi>If God
be the Giuer of the lesser blessings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato in Epinom 913. p.</note>

it, not to be a gift of Nature, but to descend from God, as from the

of that Arte is beleeued to be God.</hi> And though, in the same place, hee be
driuen to confesse,<note place="margin">Cic. l. 1. de. Orat. p. 146.</note> that the benignitie of Nature hath no little sway in it; yet
there he further addeth, that euen, <hi>Idipsum, quod est hominis proprium, non sit

Grammer.</hi> Here againe <hi>disioyned.</hi> And yet, in another respect againe
<hi>conioyned.</hi> For, as in the <hi>Trinitie, the Father doth beget the Sonne, and they two

                  <note place="margin">Arist. l. 1. Rhetor. ad Theodect. c. 1. m.</note> is the very end, for which man was created: as euen <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe

               <p>Yea, and the same resemblances may also bee seene, in all the minor parts
of the fore-named <hi>Philosophies,</hi> as well as in their totals. For first, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Naturall Philosophy:</hi> the parts thereof bee three, <hi>The Metaphysickes,</hi>
the <hi>Mathematickes,</hi> and the <hi>Physickes. The Metaphysickes,</hi> considering the
pure essence of things, doth therein resemble <hi>God the Father;</hi> who is nothing
else but a pure and simple essence, and the very first principle of all other
things. <hi>The Mathmetickes,</hi> considering of formes and figures, doe therein
resemble <hi>God the Sonne;</hi>

                  <hi>who is the character and ingrauen image of God the
Father The Physickes,</hi> considering the motions and operations of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
bodies, doe therein resemble <hi>God the Holy Ghost;</hi> who is that <hi>diuine spirit,
by which all things both liue,</hi>

                  <hi>and moue, and haue their being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now secondly, for Rationall <hi>Philosophy:</hi> that hath three parts too: <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Logicke,</hi> and <hi>Rhetoricke. Grammer,</hi> which teacheth the forming and
expressing of words, resembleth God the Father; who formeth (like a
minde) and expresseth, (like a mouth) the eternall Word, his <hi>Sonne. Logicke,</hi>
which teacheth the power of reasoning, resembleth God the Sonne; who
is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The high Reason, and Wisedome of his Father.</hi> And <hi>Rhetoricke,</hi> which
teacheth the faculty of perswading, resembleth the Holy Ghost; who both
giueth vnto men the power of perswasion, and the motion also to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by speaking.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, for <hi>Morall Philosophie;</hi> that likewise hath three parts: <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastickes,
Oeconomickes,</hi> and <hi>Politickes.</hi> The <hi>Ecclesiastickes,</hi> treating of the
knowledge of God the Creator, represent God the Father, in the authority
of his Creation. The <hi>Oeconomickes,</hi> treating of priuate life, and of those
prouisions which belong vnto it, represent God the Sonne, in the charity of
his Sustentation. And the <hi>Politickes,</hi> treating of Regiment, and well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
represent God the Holy Ghost, in the goodnesse of his Preseruing.
This is <hi>Zeegedin's</hi> comparison, as concerning that resemblance of the Holy
Trinity, which shineth in euery part of <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 Now the Heathen, though they could not goe thus farre, as to see in
<hi>Philosophie</hi> an image of the <hi>Trinity</hi> (because that is a <hi>Mysterie,</hi> farre aboue
their <hi>Capacity</hi>) yet they could goe so farre, as to see, that <hi>Philosophy is the gift
of God, and not the inuention of any mortall man.</hi>

               <p>Whereby it appeareth, that, euen they themselues thought, the inuention
of the meanest Mechanicall Art, to proceed from a more diuine vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
then dwelleth in the heart, or in the head, of any man. And thus farre
they went right. But now, heere againe, they erre; that they ascribed those
Arts, vnto their false gods, which of right do belong vnto the true God.
For, all those Arts, are onely his gifts. He is their true Author, and Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
So that, without sacriledge, they cannot be ascribed, vnto any other.
And therefore God himselfe, <hi>Who will not giue his honour vnto any other,</hi>
