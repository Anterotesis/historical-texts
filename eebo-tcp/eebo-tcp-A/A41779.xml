            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe Complaint is both great and juſt, that Chriſtians are ſo divided amongſt themſelves, that it's hard for an impartial Chriſtian to find where to fix for his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Society. And this Calamity is much aggravated by the backwardneſs of each Party to offer any thing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate theſe Differences, each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting rather that their Oppoſites ſhould wholly conform to their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and relinquiſh their own.</p>
            <p>And what may be thought (in that caſe) of this preſent Overture we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97719:3"/>
certainly <hi>divine,</hi> nor will be too confident that there is nothing of that nature in it. But of this we will be confident, that the things here deſired, do carry much of their reaſonableneſs in the very nature of them, and have their approbation both from the ſacred Word, and the Works of thoſe to whom they now addreſs themſelves for a Chriſtian Compliance.</p>
            <p>But it will be ſaid, <hi>What are the Men that make this Overture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Anſwer is, We are the Servants of the Living God; or, We are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and having ſeen the Diſcords and Ruines which have befallen the Chriſtian Nations, do heartily deſire thoſe Breaches may be made up. And as it is not, ſo 'tis hoped it will not be deemed, any Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God or man for any Chriſtians to ſeek for Peace one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the <note n="*" place="margin">By Truth in this place we intend chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is needful to a true Church-ſtate, and an holy Life.</note> 
               <hi>Truth,</hi> notwithſtanding their differing Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in reſpect of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97719:3"/>
Honours, or the diſparity of their Education; ſeeing they ought all to <hi>be cloathed with humility; the ſtrong to bear the infirmity of the weak, and not to pleaſe themſelves. The Brother of high degree to rejoyce in that he is made low, and the Chief to become Servant to the reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> heard of the Diviſions which happened in the Church at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> how does he blame them for their Carnality as the cauſe, and beſtir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to recover their Unity, in the truth <hi>which at firſt they had received?</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 10. <hi>Now I beſeech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no Diviſions among you, but that ye be perfectly joyned together, in the ſame mind, and in the ſame Judgment.</hi> Referring them to the Foundation, and Rule of all Chriſtian Unity, that only <hi>Christ was Crucified for them;</hi> that <hi>Chriſt is not to be divided;</hi> and that they were <hi>baptized in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> and that therefore they ſhould not follow any Man, <hi>but as he follows Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97719:4"/>
But it ſeems this great Apoſtle did not live to ſee an end of their <hi>Diviſions,</hi> as appears not only from the cloſe of his laſt Epiſtle to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20, 21. but alſo from the Epiſtle of <hi>Clement</hi> (who ſurvived him) which he wrote upon the occaſion of that <hi>ungodly Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (ſo he calls it) which had kindled among them <hi>through pride and ſelf-love,</hi> which he vehemently laboured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh by many Arguments, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by reducing them to the bleſſed Example of Chriſt their Leader, and the practiſe of ſuch as lived after a godly ſort. His words are theſe:
<q>Chriſt Jeſus our Lord the Scepter of the Majeſty of God, came not in vain boaſting of Arrogance and Pride, although he could do all things, but in humility of mind, according as the Holy Spirit had ſpoken concerning him.—See, beloved Friends, what an Example is given unto us: for if the Lord was ſo humble, what ſhall we do, who are come under the yoke of his Grace?—let us ſtick to theſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97719:4"/>
therefore who live godly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and not to them who hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically only ſeem to deſire Peace: for ſomewhere he ſaith, they bleſſed with their Mouth, but with their Heart they curſed;—for their Heart was not right with Him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the Points in Controverſie among the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth,</hi> were of as great moment as ours (as that may be made evident <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor</hi> 3. 3, 4. &amp; 11. 18, 19, 20, 21. &amp; 15. 12, 29. 2 Cor. 12. 20, 21. ſee alſo <hi>Clem. Ep.</hi> at large and it will fully appear.</note>); then 'tis as rational for us to ſeek for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord each with other, as it was for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> to ſeek to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite them. And hence we are the more deſirous to make this preſent Overture for Chriſtian Amity with the pious Proteſtants in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for divers Cauſes: And firſt;</p>
            <p>As it is very evident there hath bin a great departure from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel (both in the Form and Power of it) ſince the plantation of it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97719:5"/>
in the World by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; ſo alſo it is certain that many good Men in Ages paſt, as well as in this preſent Age, have ſtill bin la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring (and that often-times under great tryals) for the Reſtoration of the Truth to its Purity, ſome in one point, and ſome in another more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
            <p>And here the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant hath bin as active as others, ſome in reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers things in Doctrine and Practice; others in keeping the ground they have gained, againſt the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Reformation.</p>
            <p>Now this Work (as it is of God,) ought to be carried on in the Nations of the World to its perfection. Namely, till the Truths of the Goſpel be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from all humane Innovations which have incumbred it, to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the peace of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all ages ſince they found opportunity to croud themſelves into the Service of God.</p>
            <p>But the great obſtruction of this work of Reformation, has bin the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97719:5"/>
out of the Reformers among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And this is the caſe of the ſober Proteſtant, and the Baptiſed Believer, in this Age and Nation: the latter not ſo honouring the firſt as he ought, with reſpect to what God hath done by him; and the former deſpiſing the latter, by whom God is pleaſed (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) to bring to light ſome antient Truths which the former over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlip'd, or took not due notice of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And by this impatience and diſreſpect in each towards other, they prove inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the very Work, which in the main they both deſign to promote.</p>
            <p>It is the way of ingenuous Men in reviving decayed Arts, to honour their Predeceſſors, though inferior to themſelves, and to encourage thoſe that ſucceed to attempt things more excellent. Why are not Chriſtians as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous in their endeavours to reſtore decayed Religion? There is nothing in the Authour of our Profeſſion, or the Profeſſion it felf, but candor and ingenuity. Wherefore if we intend the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97719:6"/>
furtherance of the Work of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hitherto carried on through mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Afflictions, let us timely conſider our common Intereſt, which is to make one Shoulder to defend what our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors have worthily atcheived; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to joyn our induſtry for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of every Truth which they omitted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our ſecond Motive ſhall reſpect the 39 Articles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in which if a few things (which are not of the ſubſtance of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion) were explained or amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it were a very eaſie thing for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Baptiſed Believers in this Nation, to compoſe their differences in point of Doctrine and Faith, as touching the <hi>Baſis,</hi> or foundation of the Chriſtian Religion. And to the intent that Unity may be herein attained between us, we ſhall humbly beg leave with plainneſs to ſhew (when we offer our Propoſals) the Particulars whereof we are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſome of the ſaid Articles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97719:6"/>
Our third Motive to ſeek for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the pious Proteſtant, is the contents of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <note n="*" place="margin">This Letter has been printed about 24 years, and never yet contradicted by Dr. <hi>Barlow.</hi> See Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his Praeface to the Reader in the third part of his full Review of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm. p. 8, 9.</note> Letter, long ſince ſent to Mr. <hi>J.

            <p>For ſeeing it is a rational preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there hath bin ſaid what well can be ſaid, on both ſides; what then remains but that we bend our minds to ceaſe our ſtrife by ſuch a Chriſtian Compliance, as may juſtly render us willing to be overcome by Truth on both parts, where the matter ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>

            <p>O Moſt Mighty, moſt Holy, and moſt Gracious God! What are we that we ſhould ſpeak unto Thee, the God of Heaven and Earth? We beſeech thee pardon our unworthineſs, and for the ſake of Chriſt our Saviour, hear this Prayer, which in his Name we do with our whole Heart pour out before thy Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</p>
            <p>O Lord, in thy Fatherly Compaſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſad Diviſions which have befallen the Chriſtian People throughout the whole World. And ſeeing nothing is too hard for Thee, Graciouſly be pleaſed to move upon the Hearts of all ſober and Heavenly-minded Chriſtians (however differing in

ſome Points concerning the Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) and ſo work by thy Spirit of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Love and Wiſdom, that they may be ſo united in Brotherly Affection, as ſpeedily to conſider one another in Love: And to have compaſſion one of another under their unhappy differences in Opinion. O deſtroy the <hi>Spirit of Pride</hi> and <hi>BLOOD-THIRSTINESS</hi> from amongſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People. And let all that are called by that Name be aſhamed that ever ſuch wrath hath bin found amongst them, and let them be humbled before thy Majeſty in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it, O Lord, we beſeech thee.</p>
            <p>Moſt Gracious God, we confeſs unto Thee, we are not worthy to undertake any thing in behalf of the Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of divided Chriſtians: But thou (O God) that deſpiſeſt not the baſe and weak things of this World, be intreated to bleſs our preſent Enterpriſe, as it is conſiſtent with thy pleaſure, to the good of thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple univerſally; That they may be one in Truth and Peace, according to thy Word, which is Truth.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Good Lord, be intreated for thy Names ſake, in behalf of all thoſe that are of pious meaning, in theſe Nations eſpecially, that their Hearts being intirely knit together in the great and more neceſſary parts of thy Worſhip, they may Glorifie thy Name with one conſent, by a charitable forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in things which are not ſinful in thy ſight.</p>

            <head>A Friendly Epiſtle TO All the <hi>Biſhops</hi> &amp; <hi>Miniſters</hi> OF THE Church of <hi>England.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sirs,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MAy it pleaſe you in the meekneſs and gentleneſs of Chriſt, to lay aſide (a little) thoſe exterior Honours which are conferred upon you, and to condeſcend to Men of low degree, and in that Condeſcention ſeriouſly to ponder, what is herein with Humility and Sincerity ſubmitted to your Conſideration.</p>
            <p>We do ſeriouſly account it a part of our Infelicity, to ſee the Diſtractions and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which are in our Land, about things
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97719:12"/>
relating to the Worſhip of God, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt; and therewithal it is too e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the Power of Godlineſs is much neglected, and the Ways of Chriſtianity greatly depraved, whereupon many that love the Lord Jeſus, are ſo eſtranged among themſelves, as to become Adverſaries to their own Peace, and the Comfort of each other.</p>
            <p>May it then pleaſe God, to lead us all to the Conſideration of theſe ill Effects, and to remove the Cauſes of them. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we may perhaps be under worſe Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions concerning one another, than there is real cauſe for, let it be calmly conſidered on both parts, that our greateſt differences are about <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> And thoſe alſo of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane device</hi> (as we conceive) the beſt of which are not worth the loſs of one Soul, and therefore in no wiſe fit to adventure the breach of our Peace and Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, for their ſake, which may be the cauſe of periſhing to many.</p>
            <p>May it therefore ſeem well pleaſing to you, the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with your Brethren of the Miniſtery, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſome friendly and free Debate with the Biſhops and Teachers of the Baptized Churches in this Nation; to try if by any means a way may be found to bring us to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97719:12"/>
Chriſtian Concrd in the Goſpel of God.</p>
            <p>To effect this, is either impoſſible, or difficult only. Not the firſt, ſith our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences lie not in the doctrinal part of any Foundation-Article of the Chriſtian Religion, ſo much as in the application or practick part of them.</p>
            <p>For, to touch a little the grand points a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which we differ, viz. <hi>Sacred Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Diſcipline of the Church,</hi> of theſe we ſpake the ſame thing; for thus you teach, That <hi>in Baptiſm there is an inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace, and an outward and viſible Sign;</hi> And that <hi>Repentance, whereby we forſake Sin, And Faith, whereby we ſtedfaſtly believe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">See your Church Catechiſm.</note> 
               <hi>of God made to us in that Sacrament, are the things required of all Perſons that are to be baptized.</hi> And hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we do moſt heartily ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p>And touching holy Diſcipline, your Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is, That the manner of proceeding <hi>in Excommunication, is firſt by gentle Admonition, and that once or twice given with the Spirit of meekneſs, if the fault be not notoriouſly known: and next by open reprehenſion, afterwards by publick ſentence of the Church to put him from the company of the faithful, to deliver him to Satan, to denounce him an Heathen and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, if no Admonitions will ſerve, and the</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:97719:13"/>
               <hi>crimes be very offenſive.</hi> To this Doctrine like wiſe we do give our full conſent.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs it muſt be granted a very great difficulty (as things now ſtand) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what is really amiſs on your part in the practice relating to thoſe two points of the Chriſtian Religion; eſpecially ſeeing that the worldly intereſt of ſo many carnal-minded men, ſeems to depend upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the Errors which have befallen you in the practice of theſe holy Inſtitutes.</p>
            <p>Howbeit this Difficulty is not greater than it was to reform, what was as really amiſs in that great Ordinance, the Lord's Table, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider their Error who for many Centuries gave the Communion to Infants; or theirs, who by their <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the very nature of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall we here forget, but thankfully remember the great Travel and Sufferings of your Martyrs, and the pious Zeal which appeared in many of them, when called to reduce that holy Ordinance of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> from many corruptions, by which it had been prophaned.</p>
            <p>But yet we muſt needs condole their ſhortneſs, in not looking with like diligence into the priſtine purity of the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By which overſight, we which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive them, are expoſed the more to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97719:13"/>
Difficulties. And hence we may bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that paſſage in 1 Chron. 15. 13. <hi>Becauſe ye did it not at the firſt, therefore the Lord our God made a breach upon us, for that we ſought him not after the due order.</hi> And here we ought to learn, that ſeeing God would not indulge his Servant <hi>David</hi> in ſuch an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight (when yet his intention was very pious) will have his own Methods duly obſerved in things pertaining to his Service.</p>
            <p>Your Wiſdoms know very well who hath ſaid, <hi>A little Leaven leaveneth the whole lump;</hi> and that <hi>every Plant which the heavenly Father hath not planted, muſt be rooted up;</hi> and how <hi>vain the Worſhip (even of the true God) is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, which is taught by the Precepts of Men?</hi> All which crys aloud that Religion be reſtored to its primitive Purity, that ſo Men may give unto God the things that are God's, and ceaſe to ſerve him with their own inventions.</p>
            <p>What we ſhall here propoſe to theſe holy Ends, is no more than what at preſent we conceive to be very needful; Howbeit, we may not preſcribe to you, but only offer an occaſion to your Wiſdoms to conſider us as Chriſtians, not as Enemies. For it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that thoſe Coercive ways which ſome encline to, and under which we have bin, and ſtill are exerciſed, are not like to effect
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97719:14"/>
Chriſtian Amity and Unity, but rather to make the Breach much wider.</p>
            <p>That then it may pleaſe God (even the God of Peace) to direct your Wiſdoms to thoſe wholſome Methods, which may be natural to procure and continue a laſting Peace between us in the Truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhall be our Prayer to him for you, and in whoſe fear we humbly make theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Propoſals.

               <p>As we have already hinted, that (in our judgment) ſome things in the 39 Articles of the Church do admit of ſome amendment, We ſhall therefore humbly propoſe our Doubts in that caſe, that the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals being ſecur'd, other things may the more eaſily be reconciled.</p>

Now this Paſſage is ſo dubious, as that even <hi>Mr. Rogers,</hi> who wrote a Book in defence of the 39 Articles, doth confeſs, that the native and undoubted Sence of this Article is not known, ſo that we conceive it ought not to be required as an Article
