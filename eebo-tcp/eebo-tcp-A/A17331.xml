            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE words be part
of an exhortation be gun
in the 12 ve. of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which was made to
the children of Israel, beeing captiues
in <hi>Assiria</hi> in the yeare of <hi>Hoshea</hi> king of
the ten tribes, as appeareth in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of the kings, the 17. chapter, the
6 verse. And it did grow vpon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
against <hi>Iuda</hi> because that <hi>Iuda</hi>
did not profite by the iudgementes of
God vpon Israel: which being ended,
God here comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth him to exhort
the 10. tribes in captiuitie to profite
better by those afflictions which wer
vppon them, &amp; to returne to God by
true and timely repentance. Which if
they did, then God doth also promise
(for his part) to forget all their sinnes
past, and to place them in their former
estate againe. In this exhortation we
are to consider of two circumstances.
<pb facs="tcp:14552:6"/>
The first is of the persons: the second
is of the matter subiect. The persons
be twoo fold. First, exhorted: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
exhorting. The persons exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
are the captiue Iewes, described
in the two first wordes: the first is, <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient,</hi>
the second is, <hi>children.</hi> The
persons exhorting, are two fold. The
Lord by <hi>Ieremie:</hi> and <hi>Ieremie</hi> in the
name of the Lord, &amp; that appereth in
these words: <hi>sayth the Lord.</hi> The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
subiect, is two fold. First, what they
are exhorted vnto, in these wordes:
<hi>turne againe.</hi> Secondly, a reason why,
in these wordes: <hi>for I am your Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the names giuen to the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
exhorted, appeare first, the wisedome
of God. Secondly his mercie. His wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
appereth in ripping vp of their
sins before hee exhorteth them to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Hee saith not simply, <hi>O</hi> my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>turne againe:</hi> least they shoulde
plead, not guiltie, &amp; take an action of
the case against <hi>Ieremy</hi> for impeaching
their credit. But he saith, <hi>O ye disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
children,</hi> that so he might conuince
<pb facs="tcp:14552:6"/>
persons, with whom he hath to deale,
and according to the quality &amp; quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
of the sinne against which he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth:
examples hereof wee haue not a
few in the scriptures.</p>
            <p>Christ will not breake the bruised
reede,<note place="margin">Matt. 12. 20.</note> nor quench the smoking flaxe,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 9.</note>
but the rebelles wil he batter in pieces
like a potters vessel. <hi>Moses</hi> was the
mekest man vpon the earth,<note place="margin">Num. 12. 3.</note> yet none
more angrie with <hi>Aaron</hi> then he,<note place="margin">Deur 32. 6.</note> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more seuere against Idolaters
then he. <hi>Paul</hi> will perswade <hi>Foelix</hi> to
become a christian,<note place="margin">Actes. 2. 6 28. 29.</note> and will conuey
himselfe into the bowels of the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note>
to winne them vnto Christ,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 11. 14.</note> but
hee meaneth to take vp <hi>Peter</hi> for hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,<note place="margin">Actes 13. 10.</note>
and to pronounce <hi>Elimas</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
child of the deuill.</p>
            <p>As this doctrine was alwaies profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
so neuer more needefull then in
these our times: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there be <hi>quot ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
tot opiniones.</hi> Hovv many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so
many mindes. Some would haue the
preacher to speak alwaies alike, &amp; that
of nothing but of mercy &amp; saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
<pb facs="tcp:14552:7"/>
Christ, to speak <hi>placentia,</hi> &amp; to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of new wine &amp; strong drinke, but in
no case to avvaken them out of their
dead sleep of sinne and transgression.
Some would haue the preacher neuer
to alter his tune, but alwaies to be
thundring out the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God,
&amp; to minister nothing but bitter pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
as though all men were sicke
at once, of one disease &amp; of one cause.
Some again, can abide neither piping
nor mourning, but wil take exceptions
against the charmer, charme hee neuer
so wisely. If the minister reproue their
sinnes, they call hym a busie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller:
If hee shall apply the scripture
to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, then vvho made him
a iudge: If the preacher shal tel them
of Gods iudgementes, then hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
as though he would fraie his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
If hee standeth neuer so little
aboue his houre, then he doth not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
but tedifie: If hee intreateth them
friendly and priuately, then they say
hee is glad to currie fauour, and they
will aske him for his commission: If
<pb facs="tcp:14552:7"/>
he be sparing in his speach, then he is
afraide to displease: If he speake lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly,
then he is proude: If plainly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he is no scholler: If often, then they are
glutted: But if he wil sooth them vp in
their sins with an <hi>omne bene,</hi> or a <hi>nihil
dicit,</hi> he is the best preacher that euer
they heard.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the prophet telleth them
of their disobedience, that so he might
make them more fit to returne vnto
God: vvherein we learne this lesson,
that in all our reprehensions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
we must seeke the good of
our brother, and the glorie of God:
and therefore sharpe sentences in the
scripture are verie profitable, not to
driue men from God, but from their
sinnes.<note place="margin">Mat. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hope
of doing good by sharpe censures,
when men may see that vvee doe not
censure them of malice, or to make
<pb facs="tcp:14552:8"/>
them odious, or to get our solues a
name, or for some other sinister re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
but of conscience and of loue,
seeking thereby the good amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our brother, and that vve are
no vvhit glad for their faultes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grieued at their falles. And if this
rule vvere obserued among those, to
vvhome the censures of the church be
committed, I doe not doubt but that
more good should be done, then now
is done. But when men shall perceiue
that all their citations, admonitions,
suspensions, excommunications, and
other censures whatsoeuer doe not
proceede from a hatred of sinne, nor
a conscience and care to amend their
brethren, but either of a stomack to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
their ovvne quarrels, or else
from a couetous affection, to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their ovvne gaines: alas, vvho
vvill greatly care for them? And vvhen
al men shal perceiue that they are no

but the more presentmentes, the
more their gaines, and the gladder

vvoolfe to man. If a mans foot hath
slipped neuer so little, especially, if he
be a good man (as vvho can say hys
heart is clean) prophane men are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to exclaime of him, but neuer la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

<pb facs="tcp:14552:9"/>
should become of vs?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this gratious example of
our heauenly father, dealing so mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
cifully vvith his disobedient childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemneth
the vncharitable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of three sortes of men. First, of the
Papistes, Whose fingers are dyed of a
sanguine colour in the bloude of those
men, which haue but transgressed the
dyrtie decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of an Italian Priest and
deuilish ordinances of hel itselfe: and
yet these Gnat-strainers and Camel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvallowers
bevvaile the vvant of loue
among vs. Secondly, it meeteth vvith
an abuse in our Church-gouernours,
who vse (for the most parte) to make
excommunication <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acken about the
country for fees, for trifles &amp; matters
of no mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, asthough that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
censure of the Churche, and the
greatest iudgement next to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
iudgement may be plaied vvithall
and so farre abused as thereby to cut
off, and cast out members of the
Churche to the deuill at our pleasure.
What seruant vvill care for that mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb facs="tcp:14552:9"/>
vvhich vvill be fighting for euerie
trifle? And vvho vvill not abhorre that
chirurgion that for euery litle vvheale
or bone ache, vvill cut of a member, and
yet take money for his painfull paines?
Our good God doeth not caste off his
people, no, not for disobedience, but stil
admonisheth them, and taketh them
for his children, so long as there is any
hope of returning. Thirdly, of our Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
who cast of the whole Church of
Englande for no apparant Church of
God, which is more then they ought to
doe for two causes: first, though disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
be (as it is in deede) as the sinne
of witchcraft, and who is not disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in many things? yet so long as they
cannot chalenge vs for apostacie, as wee
may some of them, and so long as there
is any life at all in her, shee is not to be
layd out vpon the colde ground. But
soft a while: though she hath not all her
ornaments according to the worde of
God, yet she doeth not refuse them, if
she might lawfully come by them, but is
ready to receiue them when so euer they
<pb facs="tcp:14552:10"/>
shalbe offered vnto her. In the meane
time she mourneth for her wants, and
seeketh a redresse as she may,<note place="margin">Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch. 9. 4.</note> and sueth
as she ought, and therefore no doubt is
marked on the forhead for the deare
spouse of Iesus Christ, so long as shee
doeth hold the foundation in him. But
let it be granted that the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
were proued as the church of
Rome, a very harlot, and were iudged
for her contumacie worthy to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the black booke of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(which God forbid) yet for them to
be their owne caruers and bailiffes, is
more then they ought to doe, for they
be but priuate men: and this is certaine,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 4.</note>
that no particular congregation, much
lesse a priuate person may excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
a whole church.</p>
            <p>Lastly, in ioyning these two wordes
together, we learne to censure sinne in
all, but to iudge and hope charitably of
all, to spare sinne in none, so to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
none,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 1.</note> for that is Gods office. And on
the other side, to hope the best, and to
loue thy brother, but so as we winke not
<pb facs="tcp:14552:10"/>
at sinne in any,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 17.</note> for that were indeede to
hate our brother. And this are we taught
here, while God calleth them disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
yet still children: children, but yet
disobedient. Many thinke that we hate
them if we tell them of their sinnes, and
many take those me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their best fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
which doe alwaies sooth them vp in
their sinnes, and neuer reprooue them:
but both these sorts of men are greatlie
deceiued. The first must know that the
reproofe of a friend is better then the
kisse of a flatterer.<note place="margin">Pro. 27. 6.</note> Yea,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 11. 12</note> if <hi>Shimei</hi> an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
shall rayle vpon <hi>Dau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d,</hi> though it
be <hi>Shimei</hi> his sinne, yet it may &amp; ought
to be <hi>Dauids</hi> benefite. The second sort
must also vnderstand, that the sweetest
doctrine to the eare is not alwayes the
vvholsomest to the heart: but the bitter
pill is better to purge then the sweete
perfume. The winde is boysterous, but
it will make a man holde his garment
fast about him, when the gleaming Sun
wil make him put of al to his shirt. And
though the thunder be terrible to the
eare, and the lightning a dazzler of the
<pb facs="tcp:14552:11"/>
eye, and both an astonishment to the
heart, yet doe they more purifie th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ayre then the calmest day in summer.
And are the golden mouthed flatterers
alwaies the best frends? No, no beloued,
<hi>Latet anguis sub herba,</hi> the greenest
herbe doeth often couer the fowlest
toade, where the water is stillest, there is
it deepest, the fayrest garment doeth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
couer the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thiest carkas, when the
baite is most in sight the hooke is least
suspected, the friendliest kisse in shewe,
is sometimes but treason in trueth. The
Bee hath her honie, so hath she a sting, &amp;
the one vvil wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more then the other
will heale. When <hi>Herodes</hi> Courtiers
crie,<note place="margin">Act. 12. 21. 22.</note> 
               <hi>O vox non hominis, sed dei.</hi> O the
voice not of a man but of a God, then
must <hi>Herod</hi> come downe vvith a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe:
vvhen the foure hundred false
Prophets shall say to <hi>Achab,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 22. 12. 28.</note> goe and

                  </gap>
               </hi> looke least to
thriue, neither shall be return in peace.
And yet beholde, vnvvise men content
themselues vvith the names of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Protestants, and the children of
<pb facs="tcp:14552:11"/>
God, when disobedience to God hath
robbed them of the nature of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Oh vnwise indeed, that care more
for the shels then for the kernell, which
set more by the badge on the sleue, then
by the wages in the purse, which take
more delight in the name then in the
nature of a true Christian man. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt
baberi quam esse.</hi> They had rather be
so accounted, then be so indeed: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
howsoeuer God in mercie calles
them children, yet is it not because they
are disobedient, but in hope of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
and as he calleth them chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that he might encourage them to
returne, so also doeth he call them diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
children, to put them in minde
wherin they degenerated from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of children indeede. And so much
for the persons exhorted, in these words
<hi>O ye disobedient children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The persons exhorting are, God by
Ieremie, and the Prophet in the name
of the Lord. And this is of force to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the exhortation: as if he shoulde
say, I doe not of my selfe thus reproue
<pb facs="tcp:14552:12"/>
you, for then you might thinke me too
busie, but the Lord set me a work, whose
will I must obey, and therfore you must
heare me with patience. Thus Ieremie
pleadeth his commission, partly for his
owne discharge, and partly to make his
message of more credite and force vnto
them. And thus might Ieremie reason:
He that is but a seruant, must do his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
message: I am but a seruant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I must doe my masters message. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
he that doeth but his masters mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
is not therfore to be blamed: I doe
that and no more, and therfore I am not
to be blamed. Againe, whatsoeuer the
Lord saith, that must be beleeued: but
the Lord saith you are disobedient, and
if you will obey him hee will bee your
Lord, therfore you must beleeue it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
whatsoeuer the Lord by his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
doth command, that must be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed:
but the Lord by me doeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
you to turne againe, therfore see
that you doe obey as you wil answere at
your vttermost perill.</p>
            <p>Here we haue three things to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:14552:12"/>

vve vvil make them do as vve vvil haue
them to doe, or els they shal knovv the
price of it. And why so? because (as they
say) vve be idle, &amp; crie, let vs go offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
that is (say they) they neuer leaue
calling to church &amp; to the sermon euery
morning, and there vve must be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for euery fault, and this diet is not
for our humors, &amp; they had as good bee
idle as thus occupied, yet seeing as they
wil needes be so holy, let them: but vve
vvil set them to their task, and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that wil wearie them or no. And as
<hi>Pharao</hi> vrged those thinges at Israels
hands, which he vvould not touch with
his least finger: so these our <hi>Pharaos</hi> lay
heauier burthens vpon our backs, then
either prince, or lavv, or conscience vvil
<pb facs="tcp:14552:20"/>
vvarrant. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vrge that which
lavv it selfe doeth iustly require, it is not
of any conscience (for then vvoulde they
come themselues and see it done) but of
malice, &amp; therfore very seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shall wee see some of them at ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
But vvhat say they? Let the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
goe to church and pray for vs, vvee
vvil be at home and vvorke for him: or
els let the minister go to church &amp; pray,
and we wil goe to the alehouse &amp; play.
Againe, because the Egyptian task was
not done, Israel and their officers were
beaten. Euen so, because their taske (I
meane not the taske of the law, for that
haue we borne, and most willingly vvil
vve vndergoe it) but the vnstinted task
of mens affections, whose behauiour sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth

or to tell the faultes of Bishoppes in the

not this be denied, that the Lord, whose

be feared, that the same God in his ius<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(say they) there is righteousnes inherent
