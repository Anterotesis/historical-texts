            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He fauourable and gracious Reader, I salute, with a submisse <hi>Conge</hi> both of heart and knee: To the scornefull, I owe not so much as an hypocriticall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, or a dissembled curtesie. I am not so vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the enuy of this Age, but that I knowe I shall encounter most sharpe and seucre Censurers, such as continually carpe at other mens labours, and superficially pervsing them, with a kind of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and skorne, quote them by the way, Thus: This is an Error, that was too much streacht, this too slightly neglected, heere many things might haue been added, there it might haue beene better followed: this superfluous, that radiculous. These indeed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other meanes to haue them selues opinioned in the ranke of vnderstanders, but by calumniating other mens industries. These <hi>Satyrists</hi> I meet thus: It were (in my opinion) more honor and honesty for them, to betake them seriously to the like studies, and the time they wast in detracting others, rather spend in instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselues, and by some more excellent worke (moulded out of their owne braines) giue the foyle to others of lesse Fame and consequence: This were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and worthy detraction, sauouring of desert; the other, a meere ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous folly, grounded on nothing but malicious ignorance. For who more apt to call <hi>coward</hi> then the most tymerous, but he only merits a name among the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt, that hath actually and personally wonne his reputation by some deed of same and Honour. But since these <hi>Criticks</hi> are a generall Subiect in the front of subiect booke, I am content to neglect them, as those Ireguard not, and to the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and best iudging Reader, thus turne my <hi>Apologie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue aduentured (right Courteous) to publish this <hi>Poem,</hi> and present it to thy generall acceptance; If it be gently receiued, and fauour ably ceusured, it may incourage me to proceed in some future labour; if any way distasted, I am so farre from troubling the world with more, that I shall hold this little, much too much. Yet if you vnderstandingly consider this proiect, you shall finde included herein a

briefe memory or Epitome of Chronicle, euen from the first man, vnto vs, this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time created <hi>Britons,</hi> with a faithfull Register, not onely of memorable thinges done in <hi>Troy</hi> and this Island, but of many, and the most famous accidents happening through the World, In who se raigne and what yeare of the world they chanced (with which we haue conferred the Histories of the Sacred Byble) &amp; the truth of the times so eeuen, that who so euer will daigne the perv sall of these, shall not onely perceiue such thinges were doone, but bee also-satisfied in whose Raigne (then successiuely gouerning in the kingdome of <hi>Britaine</hi>) they happened. In all which, I haue taskt my selfe to such succinctnesse and breuity, that in the iudisiall perusall of these few <hi>Cantons</hi> (with the <hi>Scolies</hi> Annexed) as little time shall bee hazzarded, as profite from them be any way expected.</p>
            <p>Accept then (I entreat you) this mingled Subject (as well home-borne as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine) and Censure it as fauourably, as I haue offred it freely. Though something may perhaps distast, something againe I presume will please the most curious Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: Let that which pleaseth, mittig at the harshnes of the other. He that speaks much, may (excusably) speake somewhat Idely, and he that in vnknown Climats trauayles farre, may (by misaduenture) wander out of the way: but where the mayne intent and purpose is honest and good, it is pardonable to expect the best. And in that hope, I prostrate these my barraine industries to your kindest and gentle Constructions.</p>
