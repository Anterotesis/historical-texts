         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This exact Walking is here partly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and partly commended by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Expreſſions <hi>[Not as Fools; but as Wiſe,]</hi> i. e. Not as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but as thoſe who are enlightned by the heavenly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Saviour; not as Infidels, but as Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The other Expreſſion, which I take to be a particular under, or a means of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral walking exactly, is <hi>redeeming the Time,</hi> i. e. Seaſon or Opportunity, which is time of acting, the beſt of time.</p>
            <p>This is the literal rendring of the Original Words; but probably it does not altogether reach the Sence of that form of Speech in the <hi>Greek,</hi> and other Languages.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Dars. Chap. 6. Verſ. 8. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> blaming the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> that they did not tell him his Dream, which he had forgot, as well as the Interpretation, which, they ſaid, was not to be expected from any Man, but only the Gods that dwell not in Fleſh: He would not admit of the Excuſe, but tells them, <hi>I know that ye gain time,</hi>

            <p>Thus then; He that by care and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſo accommodates himſelf to the Times, ſo manages himſelf that he may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the danger and avoid the evils of the Times; and not only ſo, but ſerves himſelf of them, and turns them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>According to this, It is a form of Words: that may ſignify either good or bad, as the matter is which is joyned with it. He that baſely and cowardly declines dangers which he is obliged to encounters Or, He who dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly ſtrikes in with the Times, to do any ill things, or to neglect his Duty, may be ſaid <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as was ſaid of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate. When a Man does unhandſomly comply with the Times, and diſhoneſtly catch at, and lay hold of every advantage to ſave himſelf, tho it be to the betcaying of his Countrey, or the renouncing of his Religion, he may be ſaid to redeem the time.</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle does not uſe the Phraſe in this Senſe. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for by it he intends no more than that in all prudent and honeſt ways, they ſhould decline all the Inconveniences, and ſhun the Dangers of which thoſe Times were ſo full; whereby they ſhould be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or taken off from doing the good which they ought: And that they ſhould uſe all honeſt Care, and prudent Circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in cloſing with thoſe fit ſeaſons they might meet with, of doing that which by their Religion they were obliged unto.</p>
            <p>The following Reaſon which the Apoſtle uſes, confirms this to be his Senſe. <hi>For the Days are Evil. Evil,</hi> i. e. in the largeſt Notion of that Word, as it denotes Sin, as well as the Miſery that is conſequent upon it: difficult, perilous times. Therefore be

wiſe and careful to avoid the Danger, to decline the Temptations, to ſhun the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, to lay hold on the few Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities which ſuch <hi>Evil Days</hi> afford.</p>
            <p>To this he ſubjoins the laſt Clauſe, which contains the Direction to, and implies the neceſſary Cauſe of all that he had required before. And this is propounded in form of an Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively and Generally. <hi>Be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe or Fools</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Firſt, To walk Exactly,</hi> is to uſe due Care and Caution, Circumſpection and Diligence, that we live according to the beſt and moſt perfect Idea of good Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſeems to ſignify this. It may refer to to the thing done, and then it denotes the perfection of that work: Or to the Doing, or Doer; and then it means his Care and Diligence. It often bears a reſpect to both, and ſignifies the care that is taken in order to the doing any thing as well as it can be done. So that by this we are at once directed to the End, and to the Way or Means by which it is to be attain'd. The End is a perfectly good Life: The Way to it is by a diligent Care.</p>
               <p>Now, as 'tis commonly ſaid that to live, ſignifies more than doing ſome ſingle Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo I muſt ſay that 'tis more than all our Actions. For, as it is requiſite to make the whole, not only that all the parts be there, but they muſt be united too: So 'tis
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96861:8"/>
in the matter before us. To make up a good Life, the Actions muſt not only be good ſingly and by themſelves, but in that Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Proportion and Order, which they have unto each other.</p>
               <p>So that in ſhort, <hi>To walk,</hi> or live exactly, is to take care that the whole courſe of our Life be ſuch as it cannot be better, omitting nothing that is Good, doing nothing that is Evil; that we do thus univerſally, at all times, in all places, whatever we do that reſpects God, or our Selves, or our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. That our Actions be in nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, neither as to Matter or Manner, as to the Principles, the Reaſons and E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds of them. That in all theſe reſpects they be exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to human Nature in general; to our Condition and Circumſtances in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; that is, that they be as good as ſuch Men as we are can do.</p>
               <p>If any enquire yet more particularly what a perfectly good Life is? I may anſwer, that as the Apoſtle here ſuppoſes it, ſo may I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that all Men know it. All Men have an Idea of Goodneſs, which upon ſeveral Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they take notice of, and refer to; as when they approve and commend, or blame and condemn ſeveral Practices. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they hear ſuch a deſcription of good Life as they underſtand, they give an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate aſſent to it. But becauſe in too many this Idea is not ſo actually obſerved, as it would be well if it were; that I may raiſe thoſe Thoughts, and help to make them more explicit, I will propound this general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcription
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96861:8"/>
of it, <hi>viz.</hi> When a Man's Will and Affections, and all his Actions, are ſo guided by a true, and clear, and large know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, and himſelf, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d the reſt of the World, that he loves God with all his Heart and bears good, will to other Men, as he does to himſelf; that he glorifies God, and promotes his own and his Brethrens beſt ſtate in all he does, and the moſt he can; And does all this knowingly and intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, or with the deſign of doing it. This in general every one will think a good Life: I muſt not go on to Particulars. Theſe are ſome of the moſt eſſential parts of that Life which the Apoſtle requires an exactn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſs in, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Men ſhould aim at the perfec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion of it; and in order to this, that they ſhould take great care and pains, that they ſhould mind it, and give good heed unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I proceed to ſhew, why Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould take ſuch care to live ſo very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act lives. There are many things which ſhew this to be good, and fit, and neceſſary for Chriſtians; which I ſhall briefly; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pround.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have an excellent Rule of Life made known to us; ſo that if we will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with it, we muſt live Exactly. We have the knowledg of thoſe Laws, which direct and oblige us to the moſt perfect Life, which reach to our inward Motions, as well as outward Actions: Some of which are Univerſal, and to be obſerv'd by us in all we do. Such are the Love of God, and of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96861:9"/>
our Neighbour, and of our Selves, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the Love of God. Others are our Directions in particular Caſe; and Relations, if we be Superiors or Inferiors, Maſters or Servants, Parents or Children, or Friends; or if we meet with Enemies, and ſuffer from the hands of Men unjuſtly.</p>
               <p>We have all this plainly declared to us in expreſs words. We are not then to live as thoſe who are left to meer Probabilities, and uncertain Conjectures, or obſcure Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of what is good and fit to do in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Particulars. God has indeed, in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways, ſhew'd to all Men in the World what is good; but none of them have ſo clear, certain, full a diſcovery of it as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. And becauſe we know our Duty bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than others, is it not to be expected that we ſhould do it better and more exactly than they?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have alſo an Example of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection; and this challenges our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The Heathens have had very good Copies ſet them by vertuous Men which God raiſed up amongſt them. The Jews had their firſt Founder <hi>Abraham,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who walked in the ſteps of his Faith, to conduct them in the Ways of Holineſs: But, alas! how ſhort are all theſe of the Son of God, who is our Example? What a Pattern of Life has he ſet us?</p>
               <p>And when we have ſuch a one going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, by his Practice directing, and by his Authority conſirming and engaging us, How incongruous is it, that we ſhould be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96861:9"/>
ſhort and defective, that we ſhould write ill after ſo fair a Copy, and wander out of the Way when we have ſo good a Guide?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It appears not only fit, but juſt and neceſſary, when we conſider that every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian has obliged himſelf to live by this exact Rule, to follow this moſt perfect Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>We have all, by our Baptiſmal Vow, bound out ſelves to live exactly. We have declared, That we will forſake the Devil and all his Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now then, if we will be true to our Promiſe, not break our Vow which we have ſo ſolemnly made unto God, in the Congregation of his People, we muſt live exactly. By Baptiſm we have entred our ſelves into the Inſtitution of the greateſt Perfection; the Deſign of which is, to make us perfect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſtians know that they muſt give a ſtrict account of their Lives before an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judg, that they muſt render a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all their Actions to one that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibly juſt. And ſurely they that know this, ought to be very exact in their Lives, that they may be ſo in their Accounts of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Chriſtian has ſuch extraordinary aſſiſtances above others, that it is a ſhame for him not to live better than they. The whole Goſpel-Revelation is far beyond what the reſt of Mankind have. The ſecret, but moſt powerful Aſſiſtances of the Divine Spirit, which are conveyed to our Minds by being converſant in the Chriſtian Doctrine, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96861:10"/>
us to live far better than other Men: And if we do not, we are greatly wanting to God's Grace, and to our ſelves, we receive his Grace in vain.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is the ſure and only way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. If we would ever in God's eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Methods arrive at that, we muſt ſtrive to be exact, to do as well as we can, ſo as we cannot mend it. For Man by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his beſt, enlarges his Power, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances ſtill higher, till he has attain'd to his utmoſt pitch.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with us in other Matters; by Actions we acquire Habits. The more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate our Performances are, the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and diligent we are; and the more we exerciſe our ſelves, the farther do we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our perfection. This then is the uſual, the ſure, and I may add, the only way to it. Thus in matters of Trade, Apprentices and Learners are firſt inſtructed what it is they are to aim at, and then perſwaded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and diligence; and that whoever fully comprehends that which is to be done, and diligently intends and purſues it, he will not fail of arriving at great maſtery. So 'tis in the Buſineſs of Learning: He that has a clear and adequate <hi>Idea</hi> of what it is, and is diligent in the Exerciſes that he is to do towards the attaining it, ſo as to do his beſt, and continues ſo, he will not fail to be a good Scholar. In like manner, he that well underſtands the good, the perfect Way in which he ſhould walk, and uſes his utmoſt endeavour to act and live according to that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96861:10"/>
knowledg, he will in due time attain to as great perfection of goodneſs as is poſſible for him.</p>
               <p>Thus, as many <hi>as would be perfect,</hi> muſt walk in this perfect Way, the Way that leads to Perfection. And let as many as would be happy, <hi>be thus minded.</hi> For, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is the greateſt and the moſt eſſential part of Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For a farther inducement to this, I may add, That as no Man can be perfect, who is not thus affected; ſo 'tis queſtionable whether he can be truly good or not, and aſſure himſelf of his own ſincerity, who is not thus minded, For how does he love Goodneſs truly, and as he ought, who does not prefer the greater Good before the leſs, who does not ſtrive after more of it, and go on towards perfection, who does not aim at the beſt?

               <p>The ſum of vvhat I vvould ſay is, That there are in the Goſpel ſuch, ſo great and plain diſcoveries of God, of our ſelves, of the ſtate and condition of Men, vvhat it is, vvas, vvill be; of the true happineſs and greateſt miſery of Man, of the vvay to both: that to be in the natural and beſt uſe of a Man's ſelf; to be moſt affected vvith, and to have a principal regard to God; to be juſt and charitable to all Men, this ſeems
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96861:11"/>
the natural reſult, and genuine iſſue and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of ſuch Knovvledg: and to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe, vvould be to act againſt it, that is, it vvould be an unnatural violence to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>From all that our Chriſtianity informs us in, and directs us unto, vve come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that a good Life ought to be every Man's principal Care and Buſineſs; and that both becauſe nothing is ſo conſiderable, and of ſuch importance; ſo profitable, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as it is to live vvell: As alſo becauſe this cannot be done vvithout great care and diligence.</p>
               <p>There is, firſt, great care to be taken, and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He that vvill do all this, muſt be very vvatchful over himſelf, obſerve all his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, curb and reſtrain his Appetites, and call all thoſe Motions to account, vvhich vvill not ſtay for the direction of his Reaſon.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96861:11"/>
He muſt guard himſelf from all Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from abroad. In ſum, He muſt be on continual Exerciſe, and in the conſtant uſe of Underſtanding, and very intent, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves himſelf in that due compoſure of Mind, and temper of Body, which makes him capable to do good univerſally. If he be either ignorant, or miſtaken, or doubtful, or unreſolved; if he be forgetful, or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate; if he be but inadvertent, and inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitant for a Time, or be averſe, and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined; which may happen through a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Temper, an inveterate Cuſtom, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diverſion, or many ſuch Cauſes, he will omit the doing good. And how hard is it to prevent all theſe things?</p>
               <p>How diligent then muſt he be, who at all times, in all caſes, knows what is good and fit for him to do, and who wills what he knows, and does what he wills? He muſt not only conſider himſelf, but others, nor only Men, but God alſo, if he will fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and wiſely judg what is good; and that not only in general, but in every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Nor muſt he only barely ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to do what he knows to be good, but alſo actively determine himſelf from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward approbation of what is good. And the Will muſt be ſo effectual as to ſet the inferior Powers to work. And will all this be done without great Care, without great Attention and Intention of Mind?</p>
               <p>And as this Care and Diligence is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo it is alſo effectual. As Men cannot live well without it notwithſtanding all the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96861:12"/>
other helps they have; ſo if they be indeed watchful and careful how they live, they will not fail to come to great exactneſs in Well-doing. Which I thus make out.</p>
               <p>All Men in the World are endowed with the knowledg of ſome Good, ſome Virtue or other: And if a Man well and carefully attend to that, it will by that Cognation which is between all Virtues, by good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, by Parity of Reaſon, ſome way or other lead him to the knowledg of more, and by degrees of all the great and more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Goods. And the practice of any one Vertue will afford him ſuch Delight and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that it will naturally diſpoſe him to repeat the ſame, and to ſeek after other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein he may have the ſame Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and he will be greatly inclined to keep his Mind in the ſame State and Exerciſe, whereby he will be excellently diſpoſed and enabled for the ſearch after all other things that are good, both to judg truly of them, and to will and do all that he thinks Good.</p>
               <p>I need not ſay how great the advantage of the Chriſtian is in this matter above what all other Men can pretend to. For he has thoſe ſure Oracles which inſtruct him, where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and unaſſiſted Reaſon would have left him ignorant, or miſtaken, or doubtful.</p>
               <p>He that lives in the Chriſtian Church, and joyns himſelf to the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, and will but open, his Ears to hear, he can't but underſtand in ſome ſort that it's good for him <hi>to do juſtly, to love Mercy, &amp;c.</hi> He can't but think it reaſonable he ſhould do ſo alway.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:96861:12"/>
And that good Spirit of Truth and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which moves upon our Minds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires with Wiſdom, and always ſtrikes in with good and hearty Endeavours, is ever ready to give his aſſiſtance to lead us into Truth, <hi>To work in us both to will and to do what is good.</hi> This he does certainly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to them who ſet themſelves ſeriouſly on the ſearch after Knowledg, and who are in good earneſt careful <hi>to work out their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Inſomuch that no Man who has uſed care and diligence in this, has ever been left deſtitute of the divine Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>He who is no where wanting to hearty Deſires, and careful Endeavours after Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will not abſent himſelf from his own Inſtitutions; but will make them effectual for the Ends to which they are ordained.</p>
               <p>When we ſee the great Attainments of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and other Heathens, and what Heights of Goodneſs they roſe to by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the divine Spirit, when yet they had not our inſpired Writings, and Records of exemplary Lives, and brave Deaths; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of that holy and wonderful one of the Son of God: Can we imagine that this good Spirit will not convey ſtrength into our Souls, when we have thoſe helps, and are in the uſe of his own Methods?</p>
               <p>I conclude this with that which ſeems a moſt convincing Argument, both of the wonderful Efficacy, as well as Neceſſity of great Care and Caution, Watchfulneſs and Diligence to be uſed by thoſe that would live very well: 'tis this, That this without
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96861:13"/>
the great advantages which we Chriſtians have, has raiſed Men to an higher pitch of Holineſs and Goodneſs, than our moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Inſtitution without that can ever bring us to. There is no Man, who conſiders, but will allow the Chriſtian way leads to far greater Perfection than any method which the Heathens ever had, and that we have abundance of Advantages under our Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which they never enjoyed: And yet we can't but with ſhame confeſs, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them have out-ſtript moſt of us in the Race of Vertue. Of which, if we examine the Reaſon, we ſhall be able to diſcover none but what may be reſolved into this, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were careful how they lived, and we are not. <hi>Socrates</hi> and others of them made living well their great Study, their own Buſineſs, whereas we account it our <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, our Diverſion. We beſtow little care and pains on that, and this is the true reaſon why they were better without the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than we are with it.</p>
               <p>We may be ſomewhat more aſſured of the truth of this Obſervation, if we will but take notice of our ſelves or others: For, we ſhall always find, that according as we are more or leſs intent on, and diligent in the buſineſs of living well, we do make greater or leſſer advances in Vertue. And in all our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, have we met with a Man, who has been ſet upon it to live well, that in time has not done ſo? Or have we known one that has made it a by-buſineſs, that ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to any conſiderable perfection of Goodneſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:96861:13"/>
For theſe Reaſons, we may ſuppoſe holy <hi>David</hi> did ſo <hi>conſider his Ways,</hi> and reſolved that he would <hi>take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to them,</hi> and was ſo fully ſet on <hi>walking in the perfect way,</hi> and gives this advice to <hi>young Man</hi> that would <hi>cleanſe their way,</hi> that <hi>they ſhould take heed to it according to the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may ſuffice concerning the Reaſons why Chriſtians ſhould live exactly, <hi>i. e.</hi> why they ſhould aim at the beſt and moſt excellent Life; and in order to that, why they ſhould uſe care and diligence; both which, I think, are implyed in the word, which we render circumſpectly.</p>
               <p>It is but agreeable to the Religion we profeſs, to be ſo circumſpect and careful that we may live well. And this is neceſſary and ſerviceable to our Happineſs, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the utmoſt Ends for which we were made, which we can never accompliſh, till we arrive at the greateſt perfection of which we are capable; and this we can never reach otherwiſe than by always doing the beſt we can do: Which we ſhall never do unleſs we uſe our utmoſt care and diligence ſo to do. Likewiſe if we be careful to live as well as can be, we ſhall be ſo aſſiſted by the divine Grace, that we ſhall advance to greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than vve have at preſent, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given.</hi> And if vve continue thus doing, vve ſhall go forvvard from doing ſomething vvell, to do all ſo; and from lovver degrees of Vertue to higher, till vve have attained to an univerſal goodneſs in the higheſt degrees;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96861:14"/>
that is, to all that Perfection to which our Natures can be raiſed; and conſequently to all that Happineſs of which we are capable, and to the attaining of all the Ends for which our good Creator made us.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how both neceſſary and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable a means living exactly is to all the Ends for which we were made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Suppoſing now that we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to live thus; for advice what we are to do in order to it, I offer theſe four Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let it be your ſerious and conſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to get a true, certain, clear, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, adequate <hi>Idea</hi> of the Perfection or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Goodneſs, 1. Of an Action conſidered both ſingly and in it ſelf, and alſo in the Reference it has, and the Order in which it ſtands to others; 2. Of a Life, or the whole Complex and Series of Actions which can be done by you, all the time you live on Earth. Underſtand what is that Good, what is the beſt you can do all the days of your Life. In which you have the wiſe Man going before you, <hi>Eccleſ. 2. 3. I ſought in mine Heart to give my ſelf unto Wine (yet acquainting mine Heart with Wiſdom) and to lay hold on Folly, till I might ſee what was that Good for the Sons of Men, which they ſhould do under the Heaven, all the days of their life.</hi> And not only <hi>Solomon,</hi> but as many as have been wife Men, as far as they have been ſo, have ſeriouſly conſidered this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:96861:14"/>
And indeed this is abſolutely neceſſary to an exact Life, that we ſhould have an exact knowledg of what it is; and 'tis the firſt thing that is to be done; <hi>If ye know theſe things,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> Men's Practice can riſe no higher than their Underſtandings, which are the firſt Springs, the beginnings of all other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We muſt firſt know, before we can will and do. And if the Knowledg be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, the Action that proceeds from it cannot be perfect. We muſt follow our Guide; and the perfection of all our other Actions is limited by our Underſtanding: Therefore the Apoſtle prayed, <hi>their Love might abound more and more in Knowledg,</hi> &amp;c. This may ſerve to ſhew the Reaſon of this Direction.</p>
               <p>Let me alſo add, That I ſuppoſe every Man has ſome Notion of Perfection, but 'tis too often mixed with falſhood, 'tis uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, obſcure, confuſed, defective and ſhort. My advice is, that we be more explicit, and rid our Minds from theſe Defects as much as may be. And for our help; that we begin with an Action, and conſider what is the Goodneſs, the Perfection of a ſingle Action abſolutely and by it ſelf, and then in relation to others; which when we have once found, then we may proceed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, What is the good and exact Life?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Endeavour that this Knowledg may be ever preſent with you; let the <hi>Idea</hi> be always before you. The Reaſon of this is, that dormant Knowledg, ſuch as is not ready
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96861:15"/>
for uſe upon every Occaſion, will be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle efficacy, indeed it can do nothing. It is all one, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the conduct of our Lives, to be wholly ignorant, as not to have an actual preſent Knowledg; 'tis the ſame thing to have no Guide, as not to have him with us.</p>
               <p>That your Knowledg may be thus ready alway; think of it frequently, and take every occaſion to be in the exerciſe of it; both before you proceed to Action, and in the very time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thinking what is the beſt you can do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſet before your ſelves the greateſt perfection of ſuch an Action as you are doing, or about to do. After you have done, reflect on it, and compare your Action with its <hi>Idea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Be fully perſwaded of the ſurpaſſing Excellency, the greateſt Utility, the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity of living ſo Exactly.</p>
               <p>By a full perſwaſion, I do not mean only a conviction in the Underſtanding, ſo as it cannot with-hold its aſſent, but alſo a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conqueſt of the Will, ſo as it approves and chuſes. When a Man's Soul is ſo fully ſatisfied that there is no better Life it can live, that it can do no better than that which the <hi>Idea</hi> it has preſents it with; ſo as it has not the leaſt doubt, nor any deſire or inclination to do, to live otherwiſe; then is he fully perſwaded.</p>
               <p>Let the Scripture, nay, let our own Senſe and Reaſon inform us, how abſolutely neceſſary it is not only to do ſome Actions exactly, but to live ſo, that we may be perfect, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96861:15"/>
attain to a compleat happineſs: And that we cannot be ſafe from Hell, and a miſerable State, if we be not continually aiming at, and reaching after the beſt Life.</p>
               <p>That you may be thus perſwaded, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this was the great Deſign of the coming of the Son of God among us, and of all he did and ſuffered. <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he gave himſelf for his Church, that he might ſanctify it, waſhing it with the Laver of Regeneration, that he might preſent it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us be very careful to will and do all that which we at preſent think and know beſt to be done. By this means,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Minds will be kept in their truly natural State, and our Faculties will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted and united with, and in a fit ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to one another. Whereas if what our Souls think beſt is not will'd by us, or if we do approve and like, yet we do not do it, there is an unnatural diſtraction and diviſion among the Powers of our Natures, there is a diſorder in the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our whole Man will be in Exerciſe; the Underſtanding directing, the Will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and following the Guidance, and the executive Powers moving in obedience to the Will as they ought. This maintains an integrity or wholeneſs in us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This has a manifeſt tendency to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For, this is the way to free the Soul from Miſtakes, if it chance to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any concerning this Action. Practice is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96861:16"/>
the ſureſt way to confirm us in the Truth, or to convince us of an Error.</p>
               <p>Again; Whilſt the Soul is kept in this State, it is in the beſt diſpoſition for farther information. Beſides, Experience, as well as Reaſon, ſhews, That the beſt we know, or can do at preſent, carries us on to clearer Knowledg, and greater Power, and more Perfection. It does thus in all other Caſes, and muſt do ſo in this.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>INFERENCES.</head>
               <p n="1">1. If Chriſtians ought to live thus exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then this convinces two ſorts of Men.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Them who cenſure and vilify others, becauſe they endeavour ſo to do, looking upon it as needleſs, fruitleſs, fooliſh, evil for Men to trouble themſelves, to be ſo ſtrict and exact in their Lives. Such perhaps may mean vvell, but they expreſs themſelves ill: they may intend no more but this, That Men are over-cautious and fearful in ſome Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when there is no ſuch danger as they ſeem to apprehend; and that they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exact in ſome little indifferent Matters, as the Phariſees might be, <hi>tithing Mint and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe,</hi> &amp;c. which makes it ſuſpicious that they do not take care proportionably about the greater Matters. But theſe Men ſhould expreſs themſelves more warily: For when they cry out againſt living ſo exactly and ſtrictly, they condemn a Man for doing his Duty. We ought to be exact; we cannot live too well.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:96861:16"/>
(2.) They alſo ſeem to be in a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, who, tho they meddle not with others, yet, do excuſe and acquit themſelves from going on to perfection; <hi>i. e.</hi> they ſatisfy themſelves that they do that which is good, but never concern themſelves to do better. They think there is no Duty incumbent on them to do the beſt they can, to go on to Perfection, <hi>to be holy as God is holy, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence it appears, that it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and required of all Men, that they be good, anſwerably to the Advantages they have of being ſo. Whoſoever is better born, that is, has a better natural Temper, and Parts, and Education, is more free from Temptations and Hinderances, has more knowledg, and greater opportunities of doing well, more will be required at his hands, than at anothers who has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo much from God. The Righteous Lord of all will call us to account, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he has given us. <hi>To whom he has given much, of him he will require more.</hi> And hence it follows, that all we Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have a great Account to make. We pity the poor Heathens; we may do well to conſider, whether they will not give a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account of themſelves than we can of ours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A very exactly good Life is agreeable to the Chriſtian Inſtitution: And they who live beſt, do moſt anſwer the ends of, and live as becomes the Goſpel of Chrſt. Some pretend to be better, and more true and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96861:17"/>
orthodox Chriſtians than others; let them ſhew that they are ſo by their better and more Chriſtian Lives. Thou ſay'ſt that thou art a Chriſtian. Does thy Life ſhew it? What doſt thou more than Heathens or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels? And thou, who wouldſt be thought of the higheſt form of Chriſtianity, make it appear that thou art ſo by the ſurpaſſing goodneſs of thy life. To live Exactly, is a fitting Compliance with, a ſuitable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel under which we are.</p>
               <p>To what I have already ſaid upon this Argument, I think fit to add ſomewhat more. Thus then: When the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to walk exactly or circumſpectly, he enjoins us to give good heed, that in our whole life, 1. We do nothing we ſhould not do; Nor, 2. omit what we ſhould, that is, that we do nothing that's evil, that we neglect nothing that's good, whether we reſpect the Matter of our Account, the Thing done, or the Principles, the Reaſons and Ends from and for which we do them, when, and where, and how we do them, that there be no Fault, no Defect, but in every reſpect, and on every account, that our Actions be good, that is, both ſuitable to, and becoming us that do them, and alſo beneficial to us and to all. That our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be thus ſingly and in themſelves, as alſo in the order and reference they have to each other, and to the whole Series of them, the courſe of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:96861:17"/>
For the making of this plain and eaſy to every Underſtanding, and fit for uſe; I will give one ſingle Inſtance in a particular Action, <hi>viz.</hi> Giving an Alms to ſome poor Perſon. The Action in the matter of it is unqueſtionably good in general; but then, that which I give muſt be mine own, if it be not, I muſt firſt reſtore before I can give. Again, I muſt give according to my Ability, that is, I muſt not by this Gift diſable and hinder my ſelf from doing any thing that's better and more neceſſary, than my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution towards the relief of one poor Man is; ſuch I account to be the convenient Proviſion for Wife and Children. A Man muſt not make himſelf or Children Beggars, by relieving Beggars. Again, all Dues to the publick Service, to all publick Officers, muſt be diſcharged, before we can ſet apart any thing for the relief of the Poor; that is, Juſtice muſt take place of Alms-giving. This being ſuppoſed, that I have ſomething of mine own, which I cannot diſpoſe to any better or more neceſſary uſe: I muſt then, if I would be exact, conſider the Party to whom, the Quantity which, and the Seaſon when I give. And if all this conſider'd, the Contribution be good, that is, if it bear a proportion to my Abilities, to his Neceſſity, if it be done in a fit Seaſon, and proceed from a knowledg of all this, and with a willing Heart, and for a good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, I am then exact in this particular.

Uſes; if, by attending this, I be taken off from ſome greater Charity, ſome better Work; if I do it unſeaſonably, that is, ſooner or later than is behoveful; If I min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle my Charity with Anger and Scorn, and beſtow mine Alms with Contempt or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; or if I do this to be ſeen or talked of, or meerly to ſave my Credit, or only to rid my ſelf of the trouble of an importunate Beggar; or do it without knowledg, or never conſidering, meerly out of cuſtom, or from a natural tenderneſs and compaſſion, I do not in this caſe walk exactly.</p>
               <p>I add no more under this Particular, having already ſaid ſo much, as perhaps may diſcourage ſome that are looking towards Vertue. They will be ready to ſay, Why ſuch Exactneſs? this is more than needs, nay more than can be uſed: for if we ſhould be thus nice in all our Actions, we ſhould be hindred from doing them; as he that will not do a thing unleſs he do it well, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not do it at all. We ſhould miſerably perplex our Minds, and fill our Souls with endleſs anxiety and ſcrupuloſity, and all this to no purpoſe; for we ſhould never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in what we do. No more than a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician, who has an exact <hi>Idea</hi> of a Triangle, or a Circle, can draw ſuch Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
               <p>To this I reply:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we may, by the Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, attain to ſuch exactneſs, as to do that which is really Good. Tho it will not be perfectly, yet it is truly ſo; nay, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96861:18"/>
by degrees, we ſhall be going on towards the greateſt Perfection, as both your ſelves and every one's Experience teſtify.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is great neceſſity of our taking heed to be exact, leſt if we be not, we ſhould do ill. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Vice does ſo border upon Vertue, that it's not very eaſy to diſcern the Boundaries. And the Paſſage from good to bad, is ſo ſhort and facil, that without good care and caution it will not be prevented. It is a Matter of ſome difficulty to ſet the Limits to each, in ſpeculation, and in general. And 'tis ſtill harder to do this in particular, and a farther work yet to keep within the bounds we underſtand, eſpecially when theſe are variable, and cannot be ſet without a reſpect to very alterable Accidents, and ſuch Circumſtances as are hardly diſcernible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E. G.</hi> In the Caſe of Temperance. Who can ſay, Thus far it goes, and no farther; thus much a Man may eat or drink, but not a jot more? All will grant, this is not to be defined in general, nor that the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is to be allowed to every one; for one will be ſtarved, another drunk. So then, every one muſt determine his own proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which to do truly and wiſely, he muſt be able to diſtinguiſh betwixt the deſires of Nature, and thoſe that ariſe from Diſeaſe. And he muſt always underſtand what is the good ſtate or plight of his Body in general; and that is, when it is moſt ſerviceable to the Soul in all its Capacities, and in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Work in which that ſhall imploy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96861:19"/>
it; when it will not only be fit to ſerve the Soul in ſome few, but in all the Buſineſſes which ſhall be required of it; and is not more helpful in one or ſome of the lower, whilſt it proves an Incumbrance and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in the higher and greater Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this not only with reſpect to the preſent, but to the longeſt time.</p>
               <p>Now all this requires both a good preſence of Mind, and great exactneſs of Thoughts. It ſuppoſes obſervation and remembrance of what is paſt, and a diligent calculating and exact weighing, both of the ſtate of his own Body, and alſo of his condition in the World. Nor muſt he only conſider him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but others, his Wife, and Children, and the Poor. For he that allows himſelf all that may conduce to the good plight of his own Body, without conſideration of his Family and Kindred, without regard to the urging neceſſities of poor Strangers, he is exceſſive in his ſelf-gratification.</p>
               <p>Indeed, whoſoever conſiders how many things are to be thought of, and compared, before a Man can wiſely determine himſelf to that which is good and fit for him to do, not only in this, but in many other Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, even all that he is to do in his whole Life, will eaſily grant that there is need of great care and exactneſs, of great caution and circumſpection.</p>
               <p>On theſe and ſuch like Accounts, how eaſy is it for a Man to go beyond the bounds of any Vertue? nay, how hard is it not to do this? When he intends Temperance,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96861:19"/>
not to fall into an unreaſonable unnatural denial of himſelf in thoſe Gratifications, which are not only allowable, but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. And leſt he ſhould indulge himſelf in ſenſual Exceſſes, he will obſtain from thoſe Entertainments which are natural and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and if not neceſſary, yet very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and uſeful.</p>
               <p>Again; How hard is it not to ſlip out of a juſt indignation and diſpleaſure at ſome miſcarriage and offence, into an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate over vehement anger, and an unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fury and rage? How difficult is it to ſay, Thus far I may, and ſhall he angry, and beyond this I will not go; and to keep to this Reſolution? On the other hands whilſt a Man is but laying fit reſtraints on this Paſſion, how apt is he to fall into ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and an unactive dulneſs, which has a ſemblance of mildneſs; and neither be moved in himſelf, nor yet uſe that diſcipline to others, which Nature and Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires?</p>
               <p>I might obſerve the ſame in all other. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, there is a great vicinity and nearneſs betwixt them and Vice. The Heathen Moraliſts have placed almoſt all Vertues in the midſt between two Vices. And the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference they have made betwixt them is, That one is an Exceſs the others Defect; the one is more, the other leſs than ſhould be. So that according to this Explication of it, Vertue does but differ gradually from Viciocity. And how exact muſt he be, that will neither exceed nor be deficient? do
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96861:20"/>
more, nor leſs than what is fit?</p>
               <p>He that looks but careleſly, and with a wandring eye on them, will not be able to diſtinguiſh betwixt Vertue and Vice, they are ſometimes dreſſed up ſo like each other. So an abjectneſs of Mind may paſs for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; And he that does not narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, may be eaſily deceived, and think himſelf, or another, vertuouſly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when indeed he thinks untruly. So Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality and Magnificence, and a vain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs, may be miſtaken for each other. And whilſt a Man is ſacrificing to Vanity, and throwing away his Mony out of oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and a laviſh humor, he may think himſelf liberal, and magnificent, if he do not exactly obſerve.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I may alſo perſwade the ſame from the tendency there is in ſome good Action to that which is very evil. Inſomuch, that if we do not ſet a very ſtrict watch over our ſelves, we ſhall begin in a very good and commendable Work, but end in a very ill one: We ſhall ſlip from that which is good and fit, to that which is vicious and deformed.</p>
               <p>To give an inſtance or two. This Man ſets out in defence of ſome important Truth, (that which either is, or appears ſuch to him). Now this is a very good and neceſſary thing in general, and it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo fit for him to undertake in particular; that is, he is qualified to defend it, for elſe he had much better let it alone. But if he be not careful, this his love of, and Zeal for Truth, may endanger his falling into abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96861:20"/>
of miſcarriages. For, whilſt he is engaged in a zealous defence of one Truth, he may heedleſly give up many others as important as that, or he may ſuffer himſelf to be put out of temper, and the good ſtate or uſe, of his Mind; he may hereby render himſelf unfit for, and in a manner uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſome other Works, which are not leſs conſiderable than this. He may by too great earneſtneſs, if diſpoſe himſelf, ſo as that he ſhall not be in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, nor to think of, and go out after God. He may be ſo far tranſported, as to leap ouerall the Bounds, not only of Charity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And if ſo be he can hope, this will be ſerviceable to the upholding that which he thinks Truth, he will not ſtick to blacken and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> as vindicating Truth is if he be not aware, and careful to prevent and obviate the Evile, to which this very good thing has ſome tendency.</p>
               <p>Again, What tendency is there, and how eaſily do Man paſs from true and real Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the pure and ſpiritual Worſhip of God, to formality and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The ſame may be obſerved concerning the Tendencies of all the Natural and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and of the very beſt and perfecteſt Actions we do: which, if we do not take good heed to our ſelves, will lead us into foul Miſcarriages, and ſinful Practices. For, they have ſome tendency to make us proud, and think too well and highly of our ſelves. A good performance makes other Men ſpeak, and us think well of our ſelves: and if we at that time forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t God, and acknowledg not our dependance on him, we take too much to our ſelves. Or, if we over-look our own many Defects and Shortneſſes, and are affected to our ſelves, as if we had no fault, then the good we have done has led us into a great miſchief.</p>
               <p>This then is another Reaſon, why we ſhould be tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> caucious and circumſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the evil Tendencies which the very beſt Actions and Things have.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Unleſs we be very careful and exact, we ſhall not be able to ſet the proper Limits to ſeveral vertuous and good Actions. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we ſhall not, in caſe of competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, give a true preference to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ſhall we allot to each its proper time. And where we are defective in theſe, we ſhall run into great Faults and grand Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. I before ſaid, that there is great need of ſome exactneſe, to ſet and keep the bounds betwixt Vertue and Vice. I now ſay, there is need of great care, to know and obſerve the difference betwixt one Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96861:21"/>
and another; the want of which is of moſt pernicious Conſequence in the Life of Man.</p>
               <p>I make account, the comparative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Good and Evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what's better or worſe than other, is intrinfecal and eſſential to that Wiſdom that guides our Practice. And according as any Man has more or leſs of this Knowledg, he is thus far more or leſs wiſe. He is wiſe that does all his Actions it ſuch ſubordination to each other, that they are all ſubſervient to the beſt and higheſt we can exert. But this ſubordination can never be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great care and exactneſs.</p>
               <p>The truth of this, and the force of the Argument, will be better diſcern'd by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtances.</p>
               <p>Obedience to Governors is a great Duty; but he that knows not in what order this ſtands to others, may by this neglect and violate ſome greater. He who thinks he is to be abſolutely and univerſally determined in his practice by the decrees of his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, if they enact that which is im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and eternally evil into a Law, will look on himſelf as obliged to obey: And tho they forbid what God has expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or command what God has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, he will think himſelf bound to an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Obedience to their Edicts. If a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> ſhould ſet up an Idol, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him to bow down to it, this Man, who has ſet no Limits to his Obedience to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96861:22"/>
will fall down and worſhip the Image; that is, he will obey his earthly Governors in ſuch Inſtances as are expreſly contrary to the immutable indiſpenſible Laws of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And on the other hand, he that has not learn'd to make difference betwixt his Prince, and his Father, or Maſter, or any other Secular Power, and to pay a greater regard to him, than to any other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, will be apt to fall into Snares and Sin. For, as often as their Commands claſh, he will be in danger to diſobey the Supream.</p>
               <p>Again; The Man that makes no diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation betwixt the greater and the other Commands, the more and leſs weighty Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law, will be in danger to ſpend his Zeal and Time in <hi>tithing Mint, and Aniſs; and Cummin,</hi> whilſt he neglects <hi>Truth and Juſtice, and the Love of God.</hi> He will not omit an hour, by his own appointment ſet apart for private or publick Devotion, to do the greateſt act of Charity that can be done. He will not prophane the Sabbath to ſave a Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſufficient to ſhew the neceſſity of limiting and diſtinguiſhing thoſe which are confeſſedly our Duties; that ſo we may do the greater, and not culpably leave the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer undone; that they may not juſtle out each other. And what critical exactneſs is neceſſary to the thus weighing and ballancing one good Action with another, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them ſo together, that we may ſee
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96861:22"/>
the order and relation they have to each other, and to all the reſt!</p>
               <p n="4">4. He had need live very exactly, who keeps himſelf in a diſpoſition to know and chuſe well, and to do that which is good; that is, that he may be in the beſt capacity to underſtand, to apprehend and judg what's Good and Evil; inclined and forward to will and chuſe the one and to refuſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and have all his executive Powers ready to obey his Will, guided by Underſtanding. How careful and exact muſt he be in his Actions, who would keep himſelf in this fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to do all the good that offers it ſelf to him? Eſpecially if we conſider theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That every falſe Reaſoning, diſorderly Paſſion, irregular Appetite, ill Action in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſes, unfits him and makes him averſe to doing good. For the truth of this, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to experience.</p>
               <p>And, 2. If he be unprepared, indiſpoſed for the preſent, whatever Knowledg he may have acquired, or whatever Habit of doing well he may have, yet all this will be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no uſe to him, if he be under a preſent indiſpoſition. It is requiſit that he keep his many-ſtringed Inſtrument always in good tune; for elſe, tho it ſelf, the Inſtrument, the Strings, and all be very good, yet it will not make muſick till it be tuned, till all the Strings ſound concordantly to each other, and together make an agreeing Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And whoſoever conſiders the many
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96861:23"/>
Faculties and Appetites which are in him, and that they muſt all be tuned to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they muſt anſwer and ſerve each other, conſpire and harmonize into one end, that is, terminate in the greateſt good; He will be ſatisfied, that this is not to be done without great care and exactneſs.</p>
               <p>And thus I hope I have anſwered the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That it is needleſs; and ſhewn, that there is great neceſſity of Exactneſs, that is, if we would live well.</p>
               <p>If any think this an infinite toil, I would ask him, Whether it would not turn to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at laſt, and whether any thing ſo much deſerves his care as this, <hi>To live well?</hi> Thou that art ſo extreamly cautious and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, wary and accurate in petty Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, in ſome of the moſt inconſiderable things thou doſt, How canſt thou be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and heedleſs how thou liveſt, whether thou doſt well or ill, when nothing can poſſibly be ſo important to Man as this?</p>
               <p>But perhaps ſome, to excuſe themſelves from this Exactneſs, will ſay, They have never obſerv'd much to come of it; but rather that they who have been ſo very exact, have lived worſe than they who have lived care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly.</p>
               <p>To ſuch I reply;</p>
               <p n="1">1. All who ſeem careful, or negligent, are not really ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men have been careful only of ſome particular Actions, and neglected all the reſt. Now it may perhaps make better mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96861:23"/>
if none of the Strings be wound up, than only one of them. I am ſure there is greater diſcord and deformity in our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; when a Man ſhall be devout, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, or uncharitable, or intemperate, than if he had no Religion, as well as no Juſtice; and it is, I think, more ungrateful to the beholder.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be their care has been wrong directed, and they have ſtriven to be exact, but have all the while had a falſe Notion of what Exactneſs is. As a Ship that plays up and down the Seas, as the Wind and Tide carries it, will not (tho no care be taken) be ſo far from the Port whither it ſhould go; as that Ship whoſe Pilot ſteers a quite contrary Courſe: So I count, that he who ſuffers himſelf to be driven by every Inclination and Appetite, will not be ſo far off his Perfection, as he that aims and ſtrives at the ſtate which is oppoſite to it. And alas! How many are thoſe who call Good Evil, and Evil Good? How many who think that to be their Perfection, which is moſt oppoſite to it? So the Monkiſh Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioniſts have eſteemed it an high attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be without all ſenſe of this Body, and to be wholly unaffected by it: which is certainly a moſt unnatural ſtate, and very unſuitable to humane Condition in this World, and a great hindrance to a Man from attaining Perfection, and will make him uncapable of doing that good which God intended he ſhould do in this Life, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96861:24"/>
by this Body. Others again think it their Perfection, to be in a paſſionate emotion of Mind, having no regard to the good uſe of their Underſtanding, or their other Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which yet are far more neceſſary to them, and beneficial to others, than that Paſſion is.</p>
               <p>Now whilſt Men have been thus miſtaken in their Notion of Perfection, or what it is to be exact; no wonder if their care and endeavour to be ſo, have done them little good: Nay, it may be more harm than good.</p>
               <p>After all this; if any imagine that this exactneſs will be a matter of infinite Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity and Anxiety, and fill his Mind with perpetual Diſquiet and Trouble, of Pains and Toyl: Let him know, that when he is perſuaded that it is good, and uſeful, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and when he has accuſtomed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it, it will be no longer hard and troubleſom, but a pleaſant and delightful Work. And the harder it ſeems at firſt, the greater reaſon has he to think it is ſo much the more neceſſary and excellent.</p>
               <p>The Sum of what I have exhorted, and which I take to be the true and full Senſe of the Apoſtle's Words, is, That we ſhould take care, give good heed, uſe great caution and diligence, that we never do any ill, nor omit any good we ſhould not: And that we conſtantly do all we ſhould. And whatever we do, that we endeavour to do it as well as is poſſible, as it can be done. That we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96861:24"/>
through Negligence and Heedleſsneſs, through Ignorance, or Miſtake, or Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency omit, nor knowingly prevaricate in, nor willingly violate, nor careleſly and laſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform our Duty; nor do it by halves, lamely and imperfectly. And that we thus behave our ſelves, not in ſome ſingle actions only, but in the tenour and courſe of them, and in our whole Life.</p>
               <p>The Arguments I have uſed to perſuade to this, have been ſuch as theſe; 1. That it's very agreeable to the Chriſtian Diſpenſation under which we are, that we ſhould be thus exact in our Lives. 2. That the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and univerſal perfection of Life and Action is intrinſecally and eſſentially neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to our compleat Happineſs: And as 'tis neceſſary, ſo 'twill moſt certainly procure and effect it. And ſuch care and caution, endeavour and diligence is no leſs neceſſary, nor will have leſs Efficacy to make us live perfectly well and virtuouſly, than that has to make us happy: Which I have ſhewed, as from ſeveral other Arguments, ſo from a Conſideration of the likeneſs and nearneſs of Vice to Vertue; of the great tendency there is in many good Actions and Things to that which is ill; of the great difficulty there is in ſetting bounds to ſeveral Vertues, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each its due place and order: And laſtly, of the many things which muſt be done to keep our ſelves in a diſpoſition and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to know, and will, and do the will of God.</p>

I might alſo have pleaded this from the honour that will come to God and Religion; and the great benefit and advantage that will accrue to other Men, that ſhall behold and converſe with us if we live thus exactly. But I think what has been ſaid is ſufficient to perſuade any one who will conſider.

I proceed to ſuggeſt ſome few of thoſe many uſeful and excellent things, which are contained in theſe words and to which they lead us naturally and eaſily, in this plain method.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We will conſider what Time, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Opportunity, is in general; and what in particular was that Seaſon which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here means. And alſo what is the import of Redeeming the Seaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will offer ſome Reaſons why we ſhould redeem the Seaſon, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſider that which is here expreſſed, <hi>the Days are Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will mention ſome of thoſe things which rob us of our Time, and deprive us of the Seaſon, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here exhorts us to make our own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I will exhibit ſome of thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Directions, whereby we may be aſſiſted in Redeeming this Time or or Seaſon.</p>
               <p>Of the Firſt;</p>
               <p>Seaſon or Opportunity, which is the Engliſh of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifies Time of Action, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch a concurrence of all the Cauſes, as makes the doing of any Work eaſy, and gives hope of Succeſs: When there is ſuch a confluence of Cauſes without, that if we will do what is in us, and cooperate with them, we ſhall probably not fail to bring what we deſign to effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:96861:26"/>
Thus a good Veſſel and Pilot, Wind and Tide, make an Opportunity for us to be conveyed to ſuch a place: And if we be but willing to uſe them to this purpoſe, they are likely to bring us thither. Whereas, if we would go, when we are not favoured and help'd by ſuch Cauſes, we ſhall either not at all, or very hardly, and with much more pains and difficulty come to our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end.</p>
               <p>To this it will not be amiſs to add, that Opportunity does not only ſignify the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thoſe things without us, which contribute towards the producing an Effect, but alſo the diſpoſition and fitneſs of our own Faculties to cooperate with them: For if they be in an incapacity; all External Cauſes will not make an Opportunity. As if a Man be ſick, that he cannot ſafely go by Water, all the Tide and Wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not make it a Seaſon for him to go.</p>
               <p>And if we take in all this into our Notion of Opportunity, in common Speech we do not ſay that a Man has an opportunity of doing an ill thing. Tho 'tis true, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Things may ſo far concur with an ill Mind, that they may make it eaſy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſome bad Work; as we ſay, <hi>Occaſion makes a Thief.</hi> That if we underſtand (as generally we do) by Opportunity, a concurrence of the Cauſes without us, with our own Faculties, ther we never ſay that a Man has opportunity of doing that which is Evil. It either is, or is thought good, either by us, or by him that does it. Which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96861:27"/>
ſhews that even the Community of Men, who make words ſignify as they pleaſe, do ſuppoſe, that our Faculties were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd or framed to do evil Things; nor are ever properly and truly fit to do any thing but good; and therefore we can do nothing which we do not think ſo. This Obſervation I think to be true.</p>
               <p>If any be of another mind, and that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity or Seaſon is applicable indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to good or bad Purpoſes and Practices; yet I ſuppoſe it will be granted, that the Apoſtle in this place, intends the Time or Seaſon of doing good Actions, ſuch as are fit and becoming, profitable and beneficial; ſuch as will be honourable to God, and give a reputation to Chriſtian Religion, helping forward our own and others Happineſs. So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us here, <hi>to redeem the Time</hi> of doing all that good which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel requires, of living that excellent Life, and practiſing all thoſe Vertues which are agreeable to the Diſpenſation of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; of doing all thoſe good Works here on Earth, which by our perfect Inſtitution we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> aſſiſted and obliged to do.</p>
               <p>And if this be the Action that St. <hi>Paul</hi> means, it will not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Now a conſtant firm Health, a competent proviſion of the Neceſſaries and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Life, freedom from Slavery and long Reſtraints, for the moſt part to live in Society, a ſtate of Peace and Quiet, of good Will and Amity with Men, and an abode here on Earth, till Age has made us uſeleſs; theſe are the things which we commonly and truly think do all conduce to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But yet I dare not ſay, that ſuch a Condition would be beſt for all Men. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proves to us undeniably, that a mixture of Good and Evil is beſt for the generality of Men in this State: to have a daſh of Adverſity, nay, to be in a more depreſſed Condition, may, I believe, be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally better for us.</p>
               <p>Some Men are good in Sickneſs, or in Want; who, if they enjoy'd their Health, or lived in Abundance, would not be ſo. Nay, I doubt not but this is true of the Community of Mankind! And that the wiſe and good Providence that rules all things, has ſo ordered it, that the far greateſt part are poor, or ſick, or under reſtraint, or have Enemies, or do not live long; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſees it neceſſary to keep them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this ſharp Diſcipline; and for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that hereby they may be trained up to be and to do Good, and kept out of thoſe Temptations which would be irreſiſtible to them, and ſo preſerved from doing thoſe Wickedneſſes which would make them liable to the unalterable Juſtice, and beget ſuch a diſpoſition in them, as might endanger
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96861:28"/>
their being irrecoverably bad and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>I cannot but think that theſe Evils are Medicinal, and good Antidotes, which the wiſe and good Phyſician makes uſe of, for curing the worſt of Diſeaſes in ſome, and preventing them in others. Nay, that even very good Men have found it good for them to <hi>be thus afflicted;</hi> ſo <hi>David</hi> tells us: So <hi>Job,</hi> and other the beſt of Men in former Ages. Yea, the Son of God himſelf, and his firſt and beſt Followers were perſecuted by Men, and afflicted by God in the worſt of theſe Inſtances.</p>
               <p>By all this I am convinced, That even Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Diſgrace, and ſuch other Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, do not only contribute to bad Mens becoming good, but to good Mens being better, by giving them an opportunity for the exerciſe of ſome Vertues, which would have had no place in a proſperous State, and are neceſſary to our Perfection.</p>
               <p>But tho I grant all this, yet conſidering the imperfection of the beſt of Men, and the neceſſity of Health, and Liberty, and Plenty, and Peace, to enable them for thoſe Works which are proper and uſeful in this State, and to compleat their Vertue, (which can never be, unleſs they paſs through varieties of Conditions) I can't but look on theſe things as conducing to the good Life of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>However theſe things may not facilitate the practice of Vertue to all Men, yet they will to ſuch as know how to uſe their time;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96861:28"/>
'tis beſt ſuch ſhould be at liberty, and that they who know how to employ an Eſtate, ſhould have one; and if they be diſpoſed to do ſomething better than drudg for the Body, that they ſhould not be taken up with providing for that; and ſuch real Chriſtians are, and if they who pretend to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were, I do not doubt but it would be thus with the generality.</p>
               <p>Thus much I thought fit to ſay, leſt from my Explication of this Phraſe, any ſhould raiſe an Objection againſt that Providence, which orders all things according to greateſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, and undoubtedly makes that the Condition of every Man which is beſt for him, either to help him to live well, or to keep him from living ill; to promote his Vertue, or to reſtrain his Wickedneſs: Or where he would not do well, to make him ſuffer, that ſo he may hereby become capable of receiving good from the hands of him who will recompence us, not only for the good we do, but for the ills we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
               <p>After all then it remains, that a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, free, peaceable, plentiful Condition, and a long Life may paſs for Opportunity, or ſuch a confluence of things as make it more eaſy for us to live well.</p>
               <p>Which may be farther evinced by this Reaſon, that by being in this Condition, we are freed from the importunate cravings of divers natural Appetites, which are hereby gratified and ſatisfied; and if they were not, would by their importunity diſturb
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96861:29"/>
and hinder us in our purſuit and practice of Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>This then that I have ſaid, or part of this, or what ever it is, that in concurrence with the Goodneſs of Chriſtians, would contribute to their doing that Good to which their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion obliged them, was that Seaſon or Time of Action which the Apoſtle here commands them to redeem.</p>
               <p>There are particular Seaſons or Times of good Actions, when there is ſuch a confluence of things as help to and in the exerciſe of particular Vertues; which, according as there is need or reaſon for them, we are to endeavour to procure.</p>
               <p>Let us in the next place ſee what it is to redeem or buy this Opportunity.</p>
               <p>This Metaphor ſignifies, That we muſt do ſomething to make it our own, to bring it within our Power; ſo that if we will, we may uſe it, and ſerve our ſelves of it; that we may employ it to the purpoſe for which it ſerves, as, and how we will; and it is ſuppoſed by the Apoſtle, That they whom he exhorted to redeem, buy, purchaſe, or gain the Seaſon, would improve it to the Purpoſes of Chriſtian Life.</p>
               <p>So that this Phraſe intimates, not only that we are to lay hold on Opportunity when offered, but alſo that we muſt endeavour, and be at coſt to procure it; and that not ſo much to have, as to uſe it; for if we do not uſe, we loſe it. It is no where more true than of Time, and Seaſon, which is the beſt of Time; not to uſe it, is the ſame as not to have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:96861:29"/>
Thus then in general. To purchaſe this beſt part of Time, when there is ſuch a confluence of things, that may be helpful to us in doing ſome good Work; as it ſuppoſes that we will uſe it, ſo it ſignifies that we ſhould lay out our Labour, our Mony, and be at the Expence, or ſuffer the loſs of any Gratification that is of leſs worth than that Good, which by the help of this Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we hope to do.</p>
               <p>And by this I have told you, what is the Price we muſt pay for ſuch a Seaſon, when things concur to make Vertue feaſible. And the more feaſible they make any good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or courſe of Vertue, the more valuable is that Opportunity which they give us. And its Rate will be always more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greater or leſs goodneſs of that Action or Life which it helps to. Nay, which may ſeem ſtrange, yet ſo it is, That even Life it ſelf is not too much to give for an opportunity to do ſome one Action, which may be ſo hugely beneficial, that it is really of greater value, than our ſtay here an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, and than all the good we could do in that ſpace (if we left this one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done) could amount unto. Such, I take to be the laying down my Life for the Sake of Religion, or the Service of our King and Country, or of any one excellently good, and publickly uſeful Man. And it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably better to part with Life, much more any thing leſs valuable, than to do violence to, and forgo a good Conſcience in any one Particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:96861:30"/>
I need to add no more to this general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of what it is to redeem the Time or Seaſon, but put you in mind that the Phraſe implies,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are not to neglect, to part from, to loſe, and forgo it: but, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſays of Truth, <hi>Buy the Truth, and ſell it not;</hi> ſo I may ſay of Opportunity, Buy it almoſt at any price, ſell it at none; let it not go, whatever you may have in lieu of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we are by all means to avoid the doing good Actions unſeaſonably, that is, where a Seaſon may be had; for otherwiſe they muſt be done, if it be poſſible, in or out of Seaſon; but when it may be had, it ſhould not be neglected.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice for the general. But if it be enquired what in particular the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle moant the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſhould do, vvhen he bids them to <hi>Redeem the Time?</hi> To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; That I ſuppoſe he intended hereby to excite their Care and Diligence; to put them upon the uſe of Prudence and Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to employ all honeſt and innocent Arts, to take all pains to eſcape thoſe Wiles and Traps, thoſe Snares and Temptations to Sin, vvhich vvere laid for them; and thoſe other impendent Calamities of vvhich they vvere in danger, if they continued ſtedfaſt in their Profeſſion of Chriſtianity. That they ſhould be very vvatchful to obſerve, and in all lawful and harmleſs vvays, avoid all that might endanger their loſing their Religion, or their Lives, or Liberties for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96861:30"/>
it; vvhich vvould in part be a dammage or detriment to Religion (for they would hereby be taken off, if not wholly, yet in great meaſure from the practice of it) and conſequently to themſelves: however, many others would ſuffer by this, and the Intereſt of Religion would be weakned.</p>
               <p>And they were not only to avoid the Evils, the Obſtructions and Impediments that attended them, the Miſchiefs and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that were impendent, and whatever it was that might diſcourage them in, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them from the Chriſtian Life; But alſo they were to be watchful and diligent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of the Times; and with a prudent dexterity to ſtrike in with, and ſerve their Chriſtian Deſigns of them, ſo far as could be conſiſtent with Innocence and Honeſty. That they ſhould uſe honeſt Endeavours, by the Bleſſing of God, to preſerve and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Eſtates, take all harmleſs ways to procure or keep their Liberty; take care, as much as they may, to remove from their Governors all hatred and ill will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, or but ſuſpition of them; behaving themſelves ſo, as to deſerve the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and good Will of all Men.</p>
               <p>In general; That they uſe their utmoſt care and diligence to conciliate the Times to their Religion, that they might both pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe that, and eſcape the Evils of them. That their being Chriſtians might not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from the good things of this Life and World, nor bring them into any Condition, whereby they ſhould be hindred
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96861:31"/>
from doing good. Nay, that they ſhould endeavour ſo to uſe them, as they might be moſt ſerviceable to a Chriſtian Life; not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any advantages to Vertue which they offer; not needleſly and fooliſhly caſting themſelves into any ſuch Condition, as would cut them off from, or hinder them in their main buſineſs, but wiſely accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating their Condition to their Vertue, ſo as to make it a Seaſon, and ſerviceable to their purpoſe: That tho the <hi>Days were Evil,</hi> and very contrary to the Chriſtian Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, yet they ſhould take care and pains to gain all Advantages which could be had from them, to ſerve and promote it, and to make them befriend it; that the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Profeſſors of Chriſtianity might ſuffer as little Prejudice, and receive as much Advantage from that as was poſſible.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given, not only a general but particular account of what Seaſon and Opportunity is, and of what it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it.</p>
               <p>The ſum of all is, That we ought wiſely to obſerve, and diligently to improve every Seaſon, which the times wherein we are afford us, to do good. I ſay, to do good, for 'tis in order to this, that we are required to redeem the time. 'Tis not for the ſake of time: for, Time lying on our Hands is a Burden, a Torment; 'tis not that we may have it to throw away, that we may be idle and unactive; for, as good not be, as not act; as good have no time, as not employ it. Nor yet is it to be laid out on Vanity,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96861:31"/>
and ſpent in trifling and fooliſh Exerciſes, in being buſy to no purpoſe. Much leſs are we to redeem Time for doing Evil, for working Miſchief and Wickedneſs; this is the worſt loſs of time that can be: And if none of theſe be admitted, then it muſt be in order to doing good. And this, which is the end of all that we are and have, and indeed of all things, may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be that which the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>What I have thus variouſly expreſſed, may be reduced to theſe three Particulars, which I think contain the full ſenſe of the Apoſtle's Exhortation; <hi>Redeem,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they ſhould not neglect any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which the Times offered them, but ſtrike in with every Advantage, every Seaſon, and take every occaſion of Good that ſhould be miniſtred to them; go with Tide, and ſail with every Wind, that would carry them towards the Port whither every Chriſtian is bound, <hi>i. e.</hi> his own greateſt Perfection, and thereby his doing greateſt Honour to God, and promoting the beſt ſtate of his Brethren and fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatever Evils they meet with, they ſhould endeavour wiſely to turn them into Good, and of Diſadvantages and Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, they ſhould ſtrive to make them Helps and Furtherances to theſe good Purpoſes, and thus ſerve themſelves, and the Intereſt of their Chriſtian Religion of them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:96861:32"/>
3. Thoſe Evils which were unalterable, and indexible, and could not by any means be accommodated to comply with theſe good Purpoſes, they ſhould in all prudent, honeſt, harmleſs ways, avoid them.</p>
               <p>This I apprehend to be the meaning of the Apoſtles Exhortation to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> This I look upon as the Duty of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. I proceed now to the Reaſons of it, and ſmall ſum up all in theſe two: 1. We ought <hi>to Redeem the Time,</hi> that we may do moſt good: 2. Becauſe <hi>the Days are Evil.</hi> Theſe are both the Apoſtles Reaſons, only the firſt is implied, the ſecond expreſſed. And indeed, unleſs the firſt be ſuppoſed, the latter will be of no force.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we may do good, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the Seaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) I ſuppoſe none will deny, but that doing good is the Work and Buſineſs, the End and Deſign, the very Life of his Life: And that all in Man refers to this one thing; He is nothing, he is in vain without he attain it. Nor;</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Will it be doubted, but that we act very dependently on things without us: that there are abundance of Actions, which are Good or Evil, according to varieties of external Accidents, as they are ſeaſonable and unſeaſonable; and that we need the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of other things without, for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe that are unalterably good. How can I relieve my poor Brother with an Alms, if I my ſelf be poor, and have it not? Or how can I ſet apart Time for the

Service of my own Soul, or of my Friend, or for my Devotions, as I think beſt, if I be a Slave, and not at mine own diſpoſal; if I be under Reſtraint or Confinement?</p>
               <p>The force of this Argument is this: If our very Actions, many of them, be therefore good, becauſe they are ſeaſonable; if the Seaſon encreaſe their Goodneſs, and make thoſe that would be good out of ſeaſon, much better in it; (for, whereas in that caſe there is only an agreeableneſs betwixt our Actions and our ſelves, in this there is alſo an harmony betwixt us and the World): If this be true; And if we alſo in our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons depend on favourable Circumſtances, and muſt be befriended by things without us: then we ought to uſe all honeſt Art to gain the Seaſon, and to make things on our ſide, that we may ſtill hold on our courſe of well-doing, tho we have but one Point of the Wind to ſail by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Days are Evil,</hi> therefore redeem the Time.</p>
               <p>The former Reaſon was taken from the End, this from the difficulty of obtaining, and the danger of miſſing it, unleſs we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Counſel.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Times</hi> are not alike <hi>Evil.</hi> But yet, as our Saviour ſaid, <hi>ſufficient unto the day,</hi> i. e. every day, <hi>is the Evil thereof;</hi> ſo there are no <hi>Times,</hi> wherein there is not <hi>Evil</hi> enough to excite the Cares, and to exerciſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Diligence of every good Man.</p>
               <p>There are Temptations to Sin, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Suffering in all Ages. Since Man was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96861:33"/>
firſt made, the old Serpent, and all thoſe degenerate Men, whom that wicked one has gain'd to his Party, have been in all Times oppoſing and perſecuting the Good; tho ſometimes the Divine Providence has reſtrain'd their Fury, and they have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do leſs harm; yet the All-wiſe God has thought fit thus to exerciſe and try us. And becauſe we are to live under ſuch Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, it behoves us to take care, that we do not needleſly run into the Evils with which we are beſet; that we prudently decline the Traps and Gins that are laid for us; that when a freſh Gale blows, we neglect not to ſail with it; that we dexterouſly ſtrike in with Opportunity when it invites: And not only ſo, but that we uſe our beſt skill to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure one, to make things ſerve our honeſt purpoſe; becauſe if we do not thus, we ſhall be able to do very little good in our Lives, ſince we are like to meet with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Difficulties and Hindrances in it.</p>
               <p>Having thus argued in General for our <hi>Redeeming the Time,</hi> I ſhall now conſider thoſe three Particulars diſtinctly, in which I ſumm'd up the meaning of that Phraſe. And ſhall give Reaſons for every of them ſeverally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reaſons why we ſhould take every Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that offers it ſelf, and be careful wiſely to employ it, neglecting none.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we do not thus, we do not comply with the Divine Providence, we do not ſuit
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96861:33"/>
our ſelves to things, nor are uniform with the World. God offers me help, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it; He works before, and would work with me when he gives an Opportunity, but <hi>I regard not the Works of the Lord;</hi> I reject his aſſiſtance. And what a thing is this to be ſaid by God to Man, I would have helped thee, and thou wouldſt not be helped? I would have reliev'd thee, but thou regardedſt not the Succours which I ſent? And yet thus it may be truly ſaid to every one that neglects Opportunity. And as there is a prophane neglect of God's providential Diſpenſations, in letting Seaſons of Actions ſlip by; ſo there is an unnatural jarring with things about us, a difformity and diſcord with the World. For, they invite us to Action, but we will not act; they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared our way, but we will not walk: All things elſe are in a readineſs to aſſiſt us in ſome good enterprize, only we our ſelves are backward.</p>
               <p>What a thing is this, that the World, the things about us, ſhould be more forward than Man to bring forth a good Work? that things below us ſhould ſo readily give their attendance, offer their Service, and invite us to it, while we, the beſt of God's Creation here, ſhall be behind-hand? When they meet together, and, as it were, cry out to us, Lend us your hand, do you our Maſter join with us, and this Good, or that great Work will be done; What ſtrange perverſeneſs is it in us to refuſe? When things ſay, Come, let us go to the Houſe of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96861:34"/>
God, or to the Houſe of the Poor, or to viſit the Sick, or our Friends; or to our Cloſet, Study, or Shop, and yet we will not go, what a ſchiſmatical contumacious Humour is this, when we thus divide and cut our ſelves off from the World, as every one does that neglects thoſe Opportunities, which things conſpire to make him? That's the Firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The uſing of Opportunities proceeds from a good Principle, the loſing them from an ill one; and this argues the one to be good, the other bad. For ſuch as the Cauſes are, the Effects will be; the ſweet and the bitter Fountains will ſend forth Streams of the ſame Nature with their Sources</p>
               <p>Now if we trace them upto their Springs, we ſhall diſcover that all non-uſe of good Occaſions ariſes from ſuch Cauſes as theſe: Either Men are ignorant what makes a fit Seaſon, or inobſervant, or careleſs whether they do well or not; or ſlothful, that tho they be jogg'd, will not waken; or over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and buſy on other Matters: As <hi>Martha</hi> was, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. when our Saviour told her ſhe was troubled, and careful about many things, which took her off from the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſhe then had of hearing his Doctrine, which her Siſter gave heed to: Or, they are froward, and will not comply when things invite and call them.</p>
               <p>On the other Hand; he that makes uſe of the Seaſons that are offered him, muſt needs be a prudent and careful Obſerver of things without him, diligent and intent upon doing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96861:34"/>
good, ſenſible of his own inſufficiency, and of the need he has of help from abroad. He muſt be a Man of great Vertue, and good Government of himſelf; a Man of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirit, whoſe <hi>Heart</hi> is alway thus <hi>fixed,</hi> ſo as to give no ſtop, no check to things, but ſuffers them to have their free Courſe, ſtays not behind, but follows them to all that Good to which they lead him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider the Effects, which are or may be conſequent on our uſing, or not uſing the Seaſons that are before us. Great Good comes of the one, and as great Evils of the other: Indeed, no Man knows how great either may be. <hi>Exempli Gratiâ,</hi> The Bells call thee to Church, and no more neceſſary buſineſs keeps thee from it: thou goeſt, whither not only the Thing it ſelf, but the Seaſon invites; thou joineſt with the Congregation in Prayer, how knoweſt thou but God is prevailed with by the hearty Prayers with which thou art joined, and will beſtow upon thee the greateſt of Bleſſings, the pardon of thy Sin, the healing thy Diſtempers; or may ſupply thee in what thou wanteſt at preſent? Nay, and theſe Prayers ſhall be a ſtock laid up for thee in Heaven, and be remembred a great while hence, and on this ſcore thou ſhalt find opportune help in the day of trouble. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; thou heareſt the good Word of God read, or explained; and thou attendeſt to it, and art enlightned in ſome Truth that will direct thee in thy way to Heaven: Thou haſt had ſome good Seed ſown in thy Heart, which will grow up to Eternal Life: Thou
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96861:35"/>
haſt been perſuaded of ſome good propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which afterward becomes a principle of Wiſdom, and Vertue; and is indeed the Foundation of thy Happineſs.</p>
               <p>On the other hand; Thou regardeſt not the Summons to Church; but either ſleepeſt, or drinkeſt, or talkeſt on, or followeſt thy Game, or that which thou calleſt thy Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if thou hadſt no other; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, not only neglecteſt to honour God in the Aſſembly, but depriveſt thy ſelf of the great, thou knoweſt not how great Good thou mighteſt have received. Beſides, who can tell how many Temptations, and Snares, and Miſchiefs he has brought himſelf into, by refuſing to comply with ſo fair an Offer? Thou wouldſt not worſhip God in Publick, and it may be thou art ſerving the Devil in Private: Thou wouldſt not aſſociate with them that call upon God, and perhaps in the mean time thou art got into a rout of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane debauch'd Revellers; and art fallen into Temptations from which thou canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get free; but wilt grow worſe and worſe, till thou beeſt irrecoverably bad? Thus, the loſs of one Seaſon may be the loſs of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thy ruine for ever. Take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtance.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt a ſit Seaſon of Reproof admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to thee, <hi>i. e.</hi> Thou by thy Office, or by the Rank in which thou art, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thou haſt over, or the Intereſt thou haſt in ſome Man, art fit to adviſe, rebuke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him; and at this time thou art fit to ſpeak, and he to hear. All things conſpire
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96861:35"/>
to make thy Reproof acceptable, and to give probability of Succeſs; at leaſt, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to diſcourage thee from attempting the amendment of thy Brother: If thou doſt now ſtrike in with the Opportunity, who knows what good may come of this? It may prove the recovery of a Sinner out of the Snare of the Devil, and not only be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his Soul from Death, but the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits will probably flow over to many others, his Wife and Children, his Friends and Neighbours, and as many as have to do with him who has hearkened to thy Counſel, ſhall be the better for it. Thou haſt by thy advice helped to reform him, and will not he take the ſame courſe with others that has been uſed with himſelf? And they likewiſe will propagate the Good to others, and who knows where it will end? Thus thou mayeſt have done a kind of infinite good, by laying hold of an opportunity of Reproof, and none knows but all this may be true of every one. Whereas if he neglects any one, he can't be ſure but that then he might have ſaid that to his offending Brother, which might have been his Reformation and Recovery; and the Omiſſion of which may prove his utter Undoing: For ought any Man knows by his neglect of ſome, of any one Opportunity, he has loſt not only one, but many Souls. Thus we ſee how great Good may come of uſing, and as great Evil by non-uſe of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. That's the third.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:96861:36"/>
4. We muſt give an account to God of our Opportunities, and anſwer before the great Judg, how we have employed theſe Talents, and be doomed not only according to the Good we have done, but the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities we have had. He that has done no more under more and fairer Opportunities, than he that has had fewer, will not then be able to acquit himſelf ſo well. Can he that has a thouſand pound a Year, but gives no more Alms than he who has a hundred, hope for the ſame favourable Sentence from the righteous Judg? Undoubtedly the more and better Opportunities any Man has had of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doing Good, the more he has to anſwer for; and according to his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Non-improvement of them, will be his Sentence. To whom much is given, of him will much be required. One by his Learning, and Prudence, and Eloquence, and Riches, and Honour, and Friends, and Intereſt has great Opportunities of doing abundance of Good, which the ignorant and poor Man, who has no Friends, wants: And if the other does not improve his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of doing the Good which he may, much more than this unlearned, poor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted Man of no Intereſt, he will not be acquitted by the Judgment of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our Opportunities are but few, and thoſe that are, are very uncertain; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neglect none. How ſeldom is it that things do ſo happily conſpire into a Seaſon? Therefore we ſhould make the beſt of thoſe few we have, and welcom that which comes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96861:36"/>
but ſeldom to us. If there be but one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Wind that comes at ſuch a time of the Year, the Seaman watches for it, he'll be ſure not to ſtay behind: But beſides, as the Winds and Tides of Action do not come at ſet-Times, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o they have no fixed Periods, but are to us very contingent and uncertain. Now this ſhould make us ſtill more careful not to neglect them. For, when they are once paſt, we know not whether ever they will return to us again. The Wind goes and returns again into the ſame Coaſt; the Tides ebb and flow again after ſo many Hours: But if an Opportunity be gone, we cannot promiſe our ſelves that we ſhall ever have another.</p>
               <p>I may add, that as Opportunities are but few and uncertain; ſo when they are, they are very ſhort and haſting away. All things are in motion, and no one ſtate of them is laſting, they are perpetually flowing, alway on the Wing; therefore make haſte to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them: Think not only what we ſhall do, but be as quick to do what we think; not only reſolve, but perform what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve preſently; put it not off till to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, not knowing what a Day, what an Hour may bring forth; a few Minutes may make a great alteration in either us, or the things that make it opportune for us to act: And if either they, or we alter, our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity is gone. Life it ſelf is but a ſhort and frail thing, and yet it is not one half of that, that is a time of action.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:96861:37"/>
6. Some Opportunities once loſt, are loſt for ever, are irrecoverably gone. Indeed, in ſome ſenſe, all that are loſt are irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, for no power can make that which is paſt, not to be paſt: The Guilt I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by ſuch a Neglect does, continue; and nothing can now hinder that I ſhould not have ſinned. But this is that which I mean, that ſome Opportunities are ſo loſt, that not only the ſame (which can never be) but none of the ſame kind, none like them ſhall ever be again. <hi>Exempli Gratiâ,</hi> I part with a Friend, he dies, or he falls diſtracted, or he is gone out of my reach; I had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſaying that to him, which would have been of great uſe to him to have been told him. But now the time is paſt, and I muſt never more ſee him to acquaint him with it. Some ſuch there are, of which we can ſay, that they never will return again; and (which amounts much to the ſame) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay of any that they will. I ſaw my Friend yeſterday, and had ſomewhat of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſay to him, but I put it off till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, yet am not ſure that I ſhall ever have another. I might this day have done a Kindneſs to ſuch an one, a good Office to another, but did it not, and it may be I ſhall not have another day to do, nor they ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receive it. Thus ſome Opportunities are loſt, irrecoverably loſt, and for ought we know all are ſo.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We have already loſt much Time, and many excellent Opportunities, wherein we might have done much good. Let this be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96861:37"/>
an Argument to us why we ſhould loſe no more, but readily catch hold on them, as they offer themſelves.</p>
               <p>Who is he that reviews the actions of one day, who may not tax himſelf either for his total neglect, or but half-improvement of the Seaſons he has had? But alas! when we look over our Lives, how ought we to be abaſh'd for the many fair Opportunities we have had of benefiting our ſelves, and our Brethren; which we have moſt ſhamefully let ſlip? Nay, have we not abuſed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them? have we not only not done the Good to which they invited, and aſſiſted, but done the Evil which they hindred? Have we not hurt and miſchief'd, both our ſelves, and our Brethren, when we might ſo eaſily have done good?</p>
               <p>If the caſe be thus for the time paſt, let us by this be perſuaded to be more careful for the future. Let the remembrance of the many good Hours ill ſpent, make us watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſt we fall into the ſame Guilt again. If the good Providence of God ſhall give us new Opportunities, let us not again fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and careleſly ſquander, or idlely ſleep them away, or frowardly waſte them; leſt we juſtly provoke God to deny us any more: Which would be a moſt terrible Judgment, and yet very righteous. We have loſt much time, never to be recovered; do therefore what may be done, to redeem what is paſt, by double diligence in improving the future.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:96861:38"/>
Let me add, that the time is coming that we ſhall wiſh for one of thoſe many good Opportunities which we trifled away, when we come to our Death-Beds we ſhall in vain call back thoſe Seaſons. Let this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration make us very careful not to neglect the leaſt occaſion of doing any good, becauſe we ſhall wiſh we had not.</p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſons may be ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us not to neglect any, but to uſe every Seaſon of Action, that offers it ſelf to us. I now proceed to</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reaſons, Why we ſhould not only take Opportunity when 'tis offered, but endeavour to make it; and to change the things that are contrary to us, to be on our ſide, and ſerviceable to our good Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Now that I may evince the reaſonableneſs of this; Firſt, I will declare what is here ſuppoſed. Here are two things ſuppoſed, which if they be not true, then neither is this good Counſel, which is built on, and implys them; but if they be both true, then is it neceſſary: They are theſe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That Opportunities are few.</item>
                  <item>2. We do very much, in our acting, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on them.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt of theſe I have already ſaid ſomething of, and I believe there is none who is not fully perſuaded of it. For what Man is he, who ſees not how ſhort his Life is? And of that little time, how much is taken for the maintenance of it? And
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96861:38"/>
when we are ſit for Action, vacant for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good, how are our Hands held by things falling croſs to us?</p>
               <p>We fall into Company by accident, or are conſtrained by ſome occaſions, to be with ſuch Perſons where we ſpend much time, but can do little to promote either their welfare, or our own. Whoſoever watches for, and is obſervant of Opportunities and Seaſons, he knows they fall out but ſeldom; he often finds things to be wind-bound, and tho he fain would, yet he canriot ſtir.</p>
               <p>I do not mean by this, to juſtify the lazy and careleſs in their Complaints, who lay their own Neglects on want of Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for tho we have not ſo many, yet we are not quite deſtitute; we have ſome, tho not ſo many as the diligent Man could wiſh for; yet we have more than the idle will own, or care to uſe; and ſufficient for the doing that Good, which we are capable of doing, if we do but obſerve and make uſe of them: However, if the Sum total of them be computed, they may well paſs for few. If all our Life were a continued ſucceſſion of Opportunities, yet that being ſo ſhort, and ſo interrupted, they are but few at moſt. This is the firſt thing ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We do very much in our Actions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Opportunity, this will appear if we conſider theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some Actions are not good if they be not done in Seaſon, and unleſs they comply with, and be ſuited to external Cauſes and Circumſtances. There muſt not only be an
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96861:39"/>
agreement betwixt the Action, and him that, does it; but it muſt alſo be ſuited to its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and accommodated to things without. <hi>Exempli Gratiâ,</hi> Reproof to an Equal, or Inferiour, that is not by Paſſion or Prejudice ſo poſſeſſed, as that what I ſhall ſay can make no Impreſſion, is good: But when it is of a Superiour, or an Equal indiſpoſed to receive it, 'tis not good; 'tis unfit and fooliſh, 'tis importune and unſeaſonable. And it is the ſame in moſt of the Actions of our Lives; if they are not opportune, they are not good. And this I may ſay of all, that the more ſeaſonable, the better they are. This is one thing which ſhews our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on a fit Seaſon. In this caſe, tho we could do Actions without it, yet we ſhould not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Other Actions, tho we may and would do them, we cannot. We muſt be helped from abroad, or of and by our ſelves we can do nothing. There is no Man ſuch a Stranger to himſelf, and ſo ignorant of his own Inſufficiency, but knows he has need of the concurrence of many Cauſes with him, to bring forth a good Action, beſides the aſſiſtance of God's Grace, and all thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that fore-pare a Man for Action, and make him big with it; there are more ſtill that muſt help to elicit and bring it forth. <hi>Exempli Gratiâ,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho a Man be never ſo wiſe, and full of knowledg, and tho he have never ſo great a liſt to communicate it; yet unleſs he meet with others, and thoſe that are capable of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96861:39"/>
it, he cannot do what he deſires, and is ſo well qualified to do. We cannot do the Good we would without the Help, the Midwifery of External Cauſes and Things, <hi>i. e.</hi> if we want Opportunity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Tho we could, and ſhould act without Opportunity; yet our Action would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often without effect: For, in moſt caſes, Succeſs depends on the concurrence of thoſe things that make Opportunity. A Man would not have good Deſigns and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances prove Abortive, yet if they do not, he muſt be beholden to this: 'Tis this muſt bring what he does to good Iſſue.</p>
               <p>As ſoon may a Man make a Voyage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Ship, or Boat, or when he has one, againſt Wind and Tide arrive at his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Port; as in moſt undertakings, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Succeſs without the concurrence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cauſes. <hi>Exempli Gratiâ,</hi> Tho a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher uſe his utmoſt Skill and Care, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Diſcourſe for the benefit of thoſe whom he expects to be his Hearers; yet if it ſo fall out, that they either cannot, or will not come to hear; or if they do come, yet fall aſleep, or talk, or their Thoughts are taken up with other matters, that they do not attend; or if they preſently forget what they heard, or never once conſider it: that is, unleſs things conſpire ſo as not to hinder from hearing, or attending to what they hear; from remembring and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at leaſt, the drift and ſcope of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: He labours without Succeſs, that made and preached it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:96861:40"/>
Thus it appears, that we act in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on ſuch a happy confluence of things, as make a Seaſon or Opportunity. And if this be true, and that alſo, that the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities are few which offer themſelves to us; then it will follow, that unleſs we will do nothing at all, or labour in vain, we muſt endeavour by our skill and diligence to make Opportunities, to make things as pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to our Purpoſes, as ſerviceable to our Deſigns, as is poſſible. If the Mariner would never put out of the Harbour, nor weigh Anchor but when the Wind blows full in the Poop, he muſt lye ſtill for the moſt part: And if we will never act, but when Opportunity favours us with a fair and full Gale; I doubt we ſhall be moſt commonly idle. No, but we muſt, when the Wind is not with us, make it ſerve us, by gathering it into our yielding Sails; and when it is full againſt us, yet we muſt then take the advantage of a Tide.</p>
               <p>The ſum of this is, That we muſt have help from things without us, both to act, and to bring our Action to ſome Iſſue. And things without us will not favour our Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, unleſs we uſe our beſt skill and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make them ſerve our honeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. But when times are ill, and things go croſs to us, then eſpecially are we to labour to ſerve our ſelves of them, and make them helpful to us.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> This is Wiſdom to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date things, to make them comply with

thoſe good Purpoſes, which of themſelves they thwart and oppoſe.</p>
               <p>It is Wiſdom to take the Occaſions that offer themſelves, but it's far greater to make Occaſion, and to work things out of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or unprofitableneſs, into a ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency and uſefulneſs to our Undertakings. It's great skill in the Mariner to ſail with a Wind that's within one Point full againſt him.</p>
               <p>I am apt to think there is nothing we meet with, but may be ſerviceable to a good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and if we prudently and dexterouſly make application, it will be ſo; if not to one, yet to another: Nay, poſſibly to that which it may ſeem to oppoſe. <hi>Exempli Gratiâ,</hi> A Man is very impatient of any check, or cenſure in himſelf; but yet forward enough to blame and controul other Men (which often go together); In this caſe, to deal with this Man, as <hi>Nathan</hi> did with <hi>David,</hi> to lay the Scene in another place, and to caſt the Fault on another Perſon. For he will not fail to aggravate that Crime in another, which he would ſpare in himſelf. But when he has condemned another, Natural Juſtice will not ſuffer him to be ſo partial, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf. And thus, by a ſide-Wind, he comes to the Place whither he was bound, and makes uſe of that which was in it ſelf Evil, and a Hindrance, to help him to attain his End. He makes an evil Thing promote a good Deſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:96861:41"/>
I have ſaid enough for my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſhew, that it is Wiſdom to bring things that are croſs to us, to ſerve us; to make Enemies Friends, and of our Party; to make that which was a Neuter, and of no uſe, to be profitable. This is great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It is both the Effect, and Cauſe of great Wiſdom: It is the Exerciſe, and will be the Improvement of it. It is one of the greateſt and ſureſt inſtances of Wiſdom that can be given. No Man can give a better proof, that he is a prudent wiſe Man, than by making ill things ſerve good Purpoſes. Therefore if we would be, and ſhew our ſelves to be wiſe Men; let us, when things are not to our Minds, nor will fall in with our Deſigns, by our dexterous application, make them pliant and ſerviceable: That others may ſee, and admire this our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, and that both we, and they may receive the benefits of ſuch excellent Wiſdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To this I add, that to do thus is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and God-like. This is the Glory of God, that he can bring Light out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Order out of Confuſion; Good out of Evil; nay, the greateſt Good out of the worſt of Evils: So that nothing, how bad ſoever, has fallen out, which the over-ruling Providence will not make to promote ſome moſt excellent Deſign. He ordinarily brings about not only the greateſt Ends by the leaſt, and unlikelieſt, but by the moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite contrary means that are: And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times delights to walk in difficult ways. Of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96861:41"/>
all which, I need but name that one inſtance of the <hi>Salvation of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, if this be the Glory of God, ſhall we not eſteem it ours? Is it our perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be like God? Let us eſteem it ſo, and endeavour to be like him in this; create Opportunities to our ſelves, make them to be, where there was none before. Let your contrivance bring them out of nothing, or that which is worſe than nothing; That is, when all things conſpire to oppoſe, and to hinder you from doing the good you deſire, and intend to do; out of this very oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on make your ſelves a Seaſon, and try to turn it into an Occaſion and Advantage. Which if we do, we ſhall imitate that moſt adorable Providence, that accompliſhes the Ends of infinite Goodneſs, by the ſervices of things that are adverſe and contrary to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we meet with things that are unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably evil, and by no prudence or care of ours, can be made for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or to miniſter to any good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we muſt then decline and ſhun them: Remove our ſelves from them, if we can't remove them from us.</p>
               <p>The Particulars, when this may, and how it ſhould be done, will fall under the Advices: I am only now to ſhew Reaſon why it ought to be done. And it will be ſufficient here to mention the Principal, and indeed the Reaſon of all that can be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That we may be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96861:42"/>
in the beſt Capacity to do moſt good. For this cauſe we ought to walk accurately. For this we are to redeem the Seaſon in thoſe two foregoing Particulars, as well as in this.</p>
               <p>And it is a very ſufficient and ſatisfactory Reaſon, why I ſhould by all prudent Care, and honeſt Diligence avoid thoſe unhappy Circumſtances, which will not only help, but hinder me in doing the good which I might in another Condition do. For this cauſe I muſt not fooliſhly throw my ſelf into, no, nor ſtay in ſuch a Condition as that, if I can by fair means keep, or get out. If I ſhould do otherwiſe, I ſhould do a vain, fruitleſs thing; I ſhould not put my ſelf to thoſe good Uſes, for which I may ſerve: I ſhould violate the Precept, and do directly contrary to the Reaſon of the Apoſtle's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, of <hi>redeeming the time, becauſe the days are evil.</hi> Which certainly ſignifies this in part, that we are to decline Dangers and Evils, not univerſally all Dangers in any ways, but only thoſe that cannot be improved into an Opportunity, either by our acting with, or ſuffering under them. If one way or other, they may be ſo managed, as to give us an occaſion of doing good: I do not think they are to be declined, unleſs it may be done honeſtly, to reſcue our ſelves into better Circumſtances that will aſſiſt us to do more and greater good.</p>
               <p>This then is the reaſon why we ſhould ſhun thoſe Evils which we can't make pliant to our Chriſtian Purpoſes, becauſe we are to imploy our ſelves to the beſt Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:96861:42"/>
I might add alſo, That to do thus, is but a compliance with a natural Inclination, which makes us averſe from (ſuppoſe) Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Diſgrace, Sickneſs, Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the Deſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and Reaſon of this natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is, that we ſhould keep our ſelves in the beſt Condition in which we can be to do moſt good. For, all things are good, and therefore deſirable, ſo far as they give us an opportunity, or help us to do good: And whatever it is that is no way condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, much more that is an hinderance to it, is evil. And it is on this account, and thus far, that we are to avoid Poverty, Sickneſs, Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whatever are incompliant with, unſerviceable to, and Hinderances of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, or living the Chriſtian Life, and practiſing the Vertues which our Religion requires, we are to withdraw from and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void.</p>
               <p>I have done with the Reaſons, why we ſhould redeem the Seaſon, which all reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as their Baſis, <hi>viz.</hi> the great Utility and Neceſſity of our doing good, our exerciſing the Chriſtian Vertues, and the great ſeryice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Opportunity or Seaſon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the abſolute neceſſity of it to our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good. Unleſs we do well, and live the Chriſtian Life, we cannot be happy, nor attain the End for which we were made; unleſs we have Opportunity, we cannot do well.</p>
               <p>I proceed, in the third place, to ſhew what ſome of thoſe things are that deprive us of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96861:43"/>
our Time, that hinder us from uſing it as we ſhould. But I will bring that under the fourth Particular, the Directions and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe are general and preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, others more particular and immediate. Again; ſome do more eſpecially reſpect our ſelves and our Actions; others do pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily refer to the things without us, which make Opportunity. I begin with thoſe that moſt expreſly relate to our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we would loſe no opportunity of good Actions, and make to our ſelves as many good Seaſons as is poſſible, for the practice of Vertue; Let us endeavour after a clear and large Knowledg of all that is good for us to do; and ſtrive to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend fully all that, which in our ſeveral Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Circumſtances and Conditions we are in capacity of doing. Whatever good it is which comes within our compaſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of God, it be honourable to him; or in relation to our ſelves, it be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſective of our Natures; or in reference to others, it be beneficial to them; let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to underſtand this fully.</p>
               <p>The Uſefulneſs, and indeed the Neceſſity of allowing this Direction, appears at ſight, For, whoſoever is ignorant in, or miſtaken about the Good he ſhould do; how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he ſhould lay hold on every occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of doing it? We may as well ſuppoſe one who knows not what Port to make, to hoiſt up his Sails, and make uſe of the Wind when it blows: Why? He knows not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96861:43"/>
which way to ſteer, and the other under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not what is the Good he ſhould do. He alſo is in the ſame caſe, who is miſtaken, and thinks that to be Good which is Evil. He will ſteer a quite contrary Courſe to what he ſhould. He will watch for the Seaſons of doing that Evil which he thinks to be Good; and will force things to ſerve him in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Miſtake: and this is ſo far from making uſe of Opportunity to do well, that he abuſes and perverts it to do ill.</p>
               <p>But this is not all I intend by this Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: another Reaſon of it is this, leſt for want of it, we let ſlip the occaſion of doing ſome good or other. For he that underſtands not (or, which is the ſame, conſiders not) his Duty to God, how he ought to go out after him in Affection, and humbly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly acknowledg him; he will neglect the many fair occaſions of Devotion, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually offer themſelves to him. But he that comprehends fully not only that good which has Man, but that alſo which has God for its Object, will be out of this Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let's not only underſtand, But alſo be willing and deſirous of doing every good Work; without this our Knowledg will not ſuffice to engage us to let ſlip no Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing it. If there be any that we have no mind to, we ſhall be regardleſs of the Seaſons of them; we ſhall rather ſhut our Eyes againſt them, than look for them: rather run and hide our ſelves away from, than ſeek after them. Let us therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96861:44"/>
keep a willing Mind to do every good Work. What ſignifies Wind and Tide to him that is unwilling to take a Voyage? If I have no Mind to my Devotions, what will Health, and Leiſure, and a Cloſet, and all the things that invite me to that great Duty, ſignify? And tho I have every day the ſame Summons from things without me, yet 'tis all to no purpoſe; that Seaſon is loſt upon us, 'tis <hi>a Prize put into the Hands of ſuch,</hi> who have no Hearts to uſe it. Let us then be willing and deſirous, and that in no low degree, but let it be our chief Deſire, or main End and Deſign, to do all the Good we can. For, if it ſhall once obtain this place in our Hearts, we ſhall then both take and make all poſſible occaſions of accompliſhing this our End; we ſhall loſe no Advantage that can be had.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor muſt we only be willing and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of, but ready and prepared throughly for every good Work. We muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to furniſh our ſelves ſo, as we may be in a fitneſs of doing all that good, to which any occaſion ſhall invite us, <hi>E. G.</hi> To defend the Truth of my Religion, and to give any one that asks me a Reaſon of the hope that is in me; it is neceſſary that I ſhould not only underſtand that this is good and fit, and be willing to do it; but I ſhould qualify my ſelf for it, by a through Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Arguments for, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it; and I muſt, if I would not miſs an occaſion of doing ſo good a thing, endeavour to furniſh my ſelf through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96861:44"/>
with all thoſe Abilities, and if I would perform it well alſo to keep that Temper which will fit me for ſuch an undertaking, and give a Probability of Succeſs.</p>
               <p>Again; If I would improve every Seaſon of doing good, I muſt, if I be poor, and not able to relieve my neceſſitous Brother, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that I may have ſomewhat to give to him that wants, as the Apoſtle adviſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> I muſt take ſuch honeſt ways as I can, and uſe ſuch Diligence, that I may, when a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Occaſion offers it ſelf, comply with it, and do that good to my Neighbour, to which Opportunity invites.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this Advice alſo is very plain: For, tho we underſtand, and have a Deſire to do ſome good, yet if we be unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, not fit for it, the Opportunity will be loſt notwithſtanding. Tho a skilful Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian have never ſo good an Inſtrument in his Hand, yet it will make no Muſick unleſs it be well ſtrung and tuned; nor can we do any good, to which the faireſt Occaſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us, unleſs we be ſtrung and tuned, throughly furniſhed for ſuch Performances: therefore our Care muſt be to qualify and fit our ſelves with Abilities, and to be always ready for every <hi>good Word and Work,</hi> that none may come amiſs to us, whether it be to convince, exhort, rebuke, perſwade, or by innocent humour to divert and gratify thoſe with whom we converſe; or to hear and receive Inſtruction from, and be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:96861:45"/>
When therefore we have a Comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the good we can do, and have a good mind to do it; we ſhould likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be duly prepared for the doing of it; that when ever our great Lord ſhall, by giving us an Opportunity, call us forth to the undertaking, we may not, by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs, diſobey his Summons. For, (to keep to our old Metaphor) if the Veſſel be not rigg'd, tho Wind and Tide ſerve never ſo much, they ſerve to no purpoſe: And if we be not ready trim'd, and our Sails up, in vain will Opportunity blow upon us; we ſhall ſtill lie in the Harbour, and make no Voyage.</p>
               <p>Beſides; By being fitted for every good Work, if an Occaſion favours, we may readily ſtrike in with it: As, if things conſpire to make it both fit and eaſy for me to be alone, that I may imploy my ſelf in thinking, reading, writing, performing my Devotions to God, examining my ſelf, or the like. If I muſt be in Company, that I ſo behave my ſelf, ſo hearken to them, ſo diſcourſe with them, that, in one kind or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I advantage both my ſelf and them; that where I cannot ſpeak to any good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in one Argument, yet if there be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I do in another; and where nothing that's proper, and of uſe can be ſaid by me, that I be ſilent, and as ready to receive Inſtruction from others, as I would be to give it to them.</p>
               <p>There is no Condition we can be in, but preſents us with various Occaſions of ſeveral
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96861:45"/>
good Actions. There are ſome Vertues that are proper for a poor and low, others for a rich and exalted State: Some for Diſgrace and Diſreſpect; others for Honour, and being well-ſpoken of; ſome for Sickneſs, others for Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If then we would loſe no Seaſon that ſhall happen, we muſt be furniſh'd and diſpoſed for every good Action: Our Furniture muſt be ready, we muſt have it <hi>in promptu,</hi> within call, for elſe time paſſes ſo faſt, that it may be gone from us before we be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it for it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we would be ſure to loſe no Seaſon of well-doing, we muſt be ſedulous and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and in one kind or other, be always doing well. And that we may be ſo,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let no Time find us idle, and doing nothing, but ever be at work: Let no Day, no Hour, no Moment paſs by thee unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. If thou ſhalt at any time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that thou art doing nothing, know thou haſt loſt an Opportunity: for there is no part of time which may not be a Seaſon for ſome Action.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be not ill imployed. Let not thy Tongue be in motion to utter ill, to ſpeak wickedly, to tell Lies, to talk profanely or filthily. Let not thy Hands be haſty to work Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, nor thy Feet ſwift in the ways of Wickedneſs. Idleneſs is a loſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, but to do ill (is not only that, but) a loſs of the future too; for ſome of that muſt be taken up in undoing that which I have ill done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:96861:46"/>
This is implied in this Direction, that we ſhould neither be idle, nor yet evilly buſy at any time; but ever be doing, and doing good in one kind or other: which if we be careful to obſerve, we ſhall be glad of all the help we can get, and ſo ſhall ſtrike in with every Opportunity that offers it ſelf: And when we have employ'd all ſuch, we ſhall ſeek for more, and endeavour to find out ſuch, as are not ſo open, and in ſome ſenſe, to make them where they are not. This Influence will Diligence in well-doing have on us, to make us redeem the Seaſon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. On the other hand; We muſt take care that we be not at any time immoderately, or confuſedly buſy, eſpecially in the leſſer matters. 1. By being immoderately buſy, I mean, that we ſhould not ſo wholly lay our ſelves out on one thing, as to make our ſelves unfit for any other good Work; that we can neither obſerve, nor comply with any Seaſon that would aſſiſt us in that other, tho it be better. For this I take to be the State that is beſt and moſt ſuitable to our Natures, that we be ever in a readineſs to do good, as we have Opportunity. And, if we ſo buſy our ſelves in ſome one particular, that either by being too intent on it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing too long in it, we are diſabled from, or hindred in doing other good things, we are over-buſy. And of this we are to be careful in reference to Seaſon, that we be not ſo imploy'd as to render our ſelves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inobſervant of, or incompliant with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:96861:46"/>
There are varieties of good Works, which we have to do, and there are Seaſons for every of them. Now, if we be too earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or too long taken up with one, or with ſome few of them; we muſt neceſſarily neglect the Opportunities which we might have for doing the reſt. 2. As we muſt not be more buſy about any thing than it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and deſerves: ſo we muſt take heed that we be not diſorderly, and prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly buſy; but do thoſe things firſt, which are in order to, and make way for the other. Let thoſe Works be firſt done, which are either neceſſary, or at leaſt do very much contribute to the doing of others.</p>
               <p>Were theſe two things well obſerved, we ſhould ſave abundance of Time, and have many good Opportunities, which by our being buſy either beyond the proportions which things require, or without any order, we throw away.</p>
               <p>Labour therefore to bring thine Actions into Method, that is, give Preference to the greateſt and beſt, and do thoſe firſt, which make way for, and on which others depend; and ſo do every day, begin with thoſe which will make way for the reſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Often conſider, and be fully perſwaded of the great Advantage, and indeed Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there is of our taking Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Whoſoever obſerves how much we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on it in our Actions, will be aſſured of it; and he that is, will not only lay hold on it, when it waits on him; but will with Care and Pains ſeek it, and endeavour by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96861:47"/>
all prudent Management to make an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Remember therefore, that it is Seaſon which makes ſome Actions good, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it would be evil; and thoſe that would be good without it, it makes better. It helps us to do ſome Works, which without ſuch Aſſiſtance would not be done: And thoſe that might be done without its Aids, are more eaſily done with them. It alſo is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give Succeſs to ſome of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; and it gives ſurer and greater Succeſs to them all. And if we are ſenſible that it is of this Conſequence, ſurely we ſhall not be careleſs of it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Endeavour to underſtand clearly and diſtinctly the good or ill Influences that things without may have on our Actions; and of the ſeveral ways in which they may be ſerviceable, or oppoſite, help or hinder our doing well: That is, underſtand parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly what Advantages a Man receives from Riches in order to the Practice of Vertue: And what ways Poverty does of it ſelf, or may be made to miniſter to it. Wherein Liberty is profitable to a good Life: and how Reſtraint and Confinement may be-friend it. Alſo of what uſe the Eſteem, and good Will, and good Word of Men is to our doing well: And how their Contempt and Hatred, and Reproach may be turned to its Advantage.</p>
               <p>Thus let us acquaint our ſelves with the Advantages and Diſadvantages to Vertue, which are in every Condition; and which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96861:47"/>
are in all things, which make or ſpoil Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. This will be a ſure Direction, and a great help to us to make the beſt uſe of all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To every thing there is a Seaſon,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and a time to every purpoſe under Heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which was planted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And God has made every thing beautiful in its time.</hi> That is, at vvhatever moment there is ſuch a Conflux of things, as makes an Action good, becoming, benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, feaſible; that is the proper Seaſon, or time of it. And how wiſe, and good, and happy is he that underſtands the Seaſon of every thing, and neglects it not? Now the vvay to this Wiſdom is to obſerve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences which things vvithout us, and all Circumſtances have on our Actions; and vvhat Effects they vvill have in Conjunction vvith them.</p>
               <p>That vvhat I have ſaid hitherto, and ſhall further ſay on this matter, may be more clear, and ſo find a readier Entertainment. I vvill here lay dovvn the follovving Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions concerning Time, and concerning the redeeming it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By Time, (as I ſhevv'd in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Diſcourſe) vve are here to underſtand Seaſon, or Opportunity, as, both by the uſual Signification of the vvord <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and by the Senſe of it in this Text, is plain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seaſon is Time vvith reference to Action, <hi>i. e.</hi> as it does not hinder and oppoſe,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96861:48"/>
as it doth further and promote Action. Novv becauſe Time it ſelf has no Influence, does nothing one vvay or other; therefore Time is by an uſual Figure of Speech, taken for its Adjuncts, for the things that are in, and vvith Time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are to underſtand the Action, to vvhich the Apoſtle here refers, not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for any kind but only for good Actions, that Practice to vvhich our good Religion obliges us.</p>
               <p>This Time or Seaſon may be diſtinguiſhed thus in reſpect of its Influence on our Actions.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It is then vvhenſoever it is poſſible for us to do Good, tho it be difficult, vvhen things do not neceſſarily hinder us from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Good, vvhich, of our ſelves, and in another Condition, vve are in a Capacity of doing, this is the leaſt that vve call Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) When the Times, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Things that meet together in them, do, not only not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but in ſome meaſure, help on a good Action, contributing ſomevvhat to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it. This is a better Seaſon than the former. But,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That is the beſt Opportunity, vvhen things do ſo conſpire, and favour well-doing, that they make it eaſy to every good Mind: When not only Impediments are removed, and ſome things do co-operate vvith us; but the Oppoſites and Difficulties vvithout us are ſo wholly taken away, and things do ſo univerſally conſpire and joyn with us,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96861:48"/>
that if our ſelves be not, nothing elſe is wanting to our doing all the good, to which our Religion engages us.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the three Differences of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in reſpect of the Influences they have on our Performances. We ſhould alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them in reſpect of their good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which they refer, <hi>i. e.</hi> they may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be Opportunities; 1. Of doing all Good indifferently. Or, 2. Of this or that Good in particular. Or, 3. They may be general Seaſons, which yet do particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly favour and help on ſuch or ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good Actions: They do not oppoſe any, but further ſome.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, we may diſtinguiſh Seaſons from their ſhorter or longer ſtay: from their being more or fewer.</p>
               <p>All theſe may, and ſhould be conſidered by us, if we would know exactly how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves in reference to the Seaſon; if we would, as we are here required, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, I may fairly deduce theſe two Corollaries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe are good Times or Seaſons which do not hinder, but further us in doing good, living well and vertuouſly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe are evil Times, which hinder us from doing the good which we are otherwiſe capable of doing; much more are thoſe ſuch, which do facilitate the doing wickedly.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning Time or Seaſon. I proceed next to the redeeming or gaining it. Which ſignifies the making it our own:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96861:49"/>
And alſo the making advantage of it. And that implies and refers to the uſing it to all thoſe good Purpoſes to which it ſerves. For having and uſing are all one in Scripture-Dialect. This in General.</p>
               <p>More particularly, and as 'tis to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To do that good in any Time or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which it either aſſiſts us in, or does not hinder us from doing, is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle aims at, when he bids us redeem the Time: And 'tis to be our deſign, when we do endeavour to redeem it. There can be nothing elſe but this intended: For if there were, it muſt be either, that we ſhould have Time, and put it to no uſe, which can't be ſuppoſed; or that we ſhould put it to ill uſe, and this none will imagine was meant by the Apoſtle. And then there only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains our putting it to good uſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But that's not all, that doing good is the only end of getting, of having, and of keeping time; but it is the only way and means to get, and ſave, and improve it. As ſome things periſh in the uſing, ſo Time or Seaſon is preſerved, and improved in this uſe of it. Indeed every thing is then kept, when it is put to the uſe for which it ſerves. And 'tis the only way to preſerve it, when we carry it on to its Perfection: that is, uſe it for thoſe Ends for which it was made, and was fit.</p>
               <p>Now, that this is that which we are to do, if we would redeem or gain the Time: To do the good which we then can, or can beſt do;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96861:49"/>
which is moſt proper, and feaſible, or which is not impoſſible to be done by us. And that there is no other way to redeem it, will be evident, if we conſider, that whoſoever does not do thus, he loſes his Time. For, ſo he does, 1. Who ſpends it idly in doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 2. Who vainly attempts; who does much, but 'tis ineffectual, and comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; he brings nothing to paſs; he that's buſy to no purpoſe. 3. He that labours but for no good End, 'tis not Good that he deſigns. 4. Much more does he loſe the Seaſon, who imploys it in evil Works. Nay, 5. That Time is in part loſt, and not husbanded, as every one thinks it ſhould be, in which leſs good is done than might have been done in it. Tho a Man has been doing well, yet if he might have done much better, he is commonly thought, and ſaid not to have employed, and improved his time as he might, and is ſuppoſed ſhould have done.</p>
               <p>According to this diſcourſe, doing well is not only the End and Reaſon why, but alſo the Way and Means, how we ſhould redeem the Time. And it is a plain Corollary dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from hence, that the more and greater Good any Man does in Time, the more he redeems it. And he that does all that Good in it, which by Man can be done in ſuch a Time, he performs what the Apoſtle here requires moſt perfectly: He does his Duty fully, On the other hand, he who does leſs than the Times will ſuffer, or it may be help him to do, either doing ſome leſſer
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96861:50"/>
Good, where he neglects a greater, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a part of a much greater Sum, which he might do, he does fail in his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this Exhortation of redeeming the Time, in Proportion to his falling ſhort of doing the good he might.</p>
               <p>The Sum of all this is, That he who ſo complies with Things and Times, and as far as they are in his Power, ſo accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates them to himſelf, as to do the moſt Good which they enable, or aſſiſt, or but ſuffer him to do: He does redeem the Time in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's Senſe. And thus far the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſhews the reaſons of thoſe Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the doing it, which I have already given; and will make the entertainment of the few I ſhall add more eaſy.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing then that we underſtand what is good for us to do, and that we are alway willing and ready to do this Good we know; and ever moderately, and orderly buſy; that we are ſenſible of our dependance on Time, and Things without us; and that we have got a good knowledg what influences they have on our doing good, to oppoſe, and hinder, or to farther and promote it, which is all that I have directed hitherto: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to another general Advice, which is this.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Take a view of all the Good, which Men in General, or your ſelf in Particular have a capacity of doing, in reſpect of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature and Faculties. Set before you, all in any kind, which one endowed with the Faculties of human Nature can poſſibly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96861:50"/>
do; which is fit and becoming one in ſuch Relations and Conditions, as every Man is, to do in reſpect of God, of Himſelf, and of all other Men and Things, all that is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the great Creator and Lord of all; that is perfective of human Nature in a Man's ſelf, and in other Men; and conduces alſo to the welfare and beſt ſtate of all other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Things. Take a ſurvey of Man, and of all of this ſort that he is capable of doing; ſurvey your ſelves alſo, what Good it is in particular that you can do: whether it be more or leſs than others in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Now this is all ſumm'd up in thoſe general Heads, of doing <hi>juſtly, loving Mercy, and walking humbly with God,</hi> as the Prophet has expreſt them: Or, as the Apoſtle more fully, <hi>living ſoberly, righteouſly and godly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not all I mean, that we ſhould know all the Good that can be done by us; but that we alſo ſet before us all the Actions we can do, which are capable of being, and doing thus much good. And they are our Thoughts, and all thoſe which are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by, and in the Mind it ſelf; our Words which convey our Thoughts to others: And all our other mechanical Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vvhich directly, or indirectly fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Liberty, and to vvhich vve may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by our Wills. Conſider vvell, hovv fit and good all theſe may be; What is the Goodneſs of each of them ſingly, and of all of them together. And that you may know this, conſider what reſpects they bear, and in what order they are to one another; how
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96861:51"/>
one does prepare and make Way for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and conſequently, vvhen they do croſs and oppoſe each other.</p>
               <p>Conſider alſo more diſtinctly, what Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the beſt, which are of leſs Goodneſs, which are of moſt, and which of leaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. This will very much direct us in what order to do them, and in caſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, which to prefer. This will huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduce to our gaining and improvement of Time, that is, to our doing the moſt Good, as I have ſhewn.</p>
               <p>The Sum of this Direction is, that we conſider (and that not ſlightly, and ſeldom, but often, and ſeriouſly) of all the Good we can do, and of all the Actions whereby we may do it. Let us hang a kind of Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, wherein the good Actions of our Lives (the Heads of them, I mean) may be fully enumerated and delineated in an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Series: And let this be in our Eye very often, every day look on it. Think of it ſo long, and ſo often, till you be perfect in it, and have no need of recourſe to it; when your Memory ſhall preſently and eaſily ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it to you on every occaſion: And when we conſider what we can do, we muſt not only think what we can do by our ſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, but by other Men and Things. For tho we can't by our ſelves (ſuppoſe) perſuade another, yet we may by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is abler, and has greater Authority with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:96861:51"/>
There is none but may ſee the uſefulneſs of this Advice, in order to our doing Good, in which Men ſo frequently and groſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, for no other cauſe but want of this Conſideration. Tho they know all the Good they can do, and are willing and ready to do it, yet they do it not; they often do the contray Evil, becauſe they conſider it not: they act prepoſterouſly, and ſo hinder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They do a leſs Good, when they might do a greater; they ſet upon the End before the Means. They do not the Good they might, if they would but take a full and diſtinct view of all they are capable of doing. <hi>Seneca,</hi> I remember, gives this Reaſon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, why Men do ſo grievouſly miſcarry: <hi>Quamvis ſepiſſimè de partibus vitae conſulitur, nunguam de toto.</hi> They ſeldom or never take all their Actions they can do into Conſideration: They do not take a full view of their whole Courſe and Way, as they muſt, if they conſult about it.</p>
               <p>If this be ſo neceſſary in order to our liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertuouſly; 'tis on the ſame account ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our redeeming Time, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done but by well-doing: This being not only the only End why, but the only Means alſo whereby we can get and keep Time or Seaſon.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Take alſo a general view of the whole Time you have, for all Good; as well as of thoſe parts of Time, which will moſt be-friend you in doing this, or that good in particular. If we obſerve this, it will be a great help. For when we conſider in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96861:52"/>
what time we have for doing good, we ſhall ſee the moſt we can reckon to be ſo very ſhort, and that little ſo very uncertain, that we ſhall not be able to put it under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, than of poſſible, or not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable: We can be ſure of none, but what is preſent. This will make us very careful to enquire, what is the beſt and moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of all the good Works we can do. And when we have found that, we ſhall be as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to do it with <hi>all our might,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay. Whatſoever <hi>our Hand finds to do,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſes it, we ſhall do with our whole Strength.</p>
               <p>He that is well reſolved that he can make no certain account of any Time, but of that vvhich is, vvill certainly be careful to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy that to the beſt and moſt neceſſary Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. And he that does this, has learnt one moſt excellent Rule for the redeeming his Time.</p>
               <p>Let him alſo think before-hand, vvhat parts of Time do moſt befriend one good Action, ſuppoſe <hi>Thinking;</hi> vvhen it may be the fitteſt ſeaſon for <hi>Speaking,</hi> and vvhen for other <hi>Actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you have thus conſidered your Time, think hovv you have ſpent it. And if you be ſenſible of miſpence; for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſolve on retrenching all your unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable expences of your Time: Such as you cannot juſtify to God, and your ovvn Conſcience; nor to any one that thinks eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ſhould be put to a good uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:96861:52"/>
Having thus uſed frequent Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both of the good Actions you can do, and alſo of the Time you have to do them, and prepared your ſelves;</p>
               <p n="10">10. Let your next care be to make, and keep a ſerious reſolution of filling up every little ſpace of Time, vvith doing ſome Good or other. Let it be your conſtaint care and ſtudy to be alvvay doing Good of ſome kind; that no Minutes be laid out on evil Works; no Time leak from you in Idleneſs; no Hours be ſpent on that vvhich has ſo very little Goodneſs, that it's doubtful, or undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable. Many of our Buſineſſes afford us abundance of ſpare Time, vvhich a good Mind knovvs hovv to ſpend in divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or the like.</p>
               <p>The Naturaliſts obſerve that the ſame Veſſel, vvhen 'tis fill'd vvith Water, vvill yet receive Bodies of another Nature: And nothing more common than for one Body to incorporate and unite vvith another. I am ſure there is no Time but may be more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed than it is. And very fevv of our good Actions, the Goodneſs of vvhich may not be condenſated; and vvill admit of others of other kinds, and more of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Be ever inclin'd and reſolv'd to do as much good as you can; be not content to do a little, but deſign the moſt; do not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy your ſelves to do good only, but ſtill aim at doing the beſt. By this means we ſhall crowd more of Good into out Time. The ſame Ground, well husbanded,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96861:53"/>
will yield twice as much Corn, as if it were in the Hands of a Sluggard. And the ſame Time may bring forth twice as many good Actions, if it be well look'd to, as otherwiſe it would. Do as many good Actions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as thou canſt: put as much Good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as little room as is poſſible: Do every Action as well as thou canſt; make it as good as 'tis capable of being.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Allot the greateſt and beſt, and firſt Portions, the moſt of your Time, to the beſt and moſt neceſſary Works, thoſe which moſt tend to Man's greateſt Perfection: Such are thoſe that are requiſite to the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and keeping a good Mind and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſuch a Plight of Body, as renders it moſt uſeful to the Soul, in all wiſe and vertuous Actions, <hi>viz.</hi> Conſideration; being converſant in the Scriptures, in Prayer, in Chriſtian Conference: All Acts of Juſtice and Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Where there is an Equality on other accounts, that one Action is not apparently better than the other: Do that to which Seaſon does moſt invite, Things will moſt aſſiſt in the doing it, and give Probability of beſt Succeſs when 'tis done. The Reaſon of this Advice is plain, becauſe by doing thus we are likely to do moſt good, and in a ſhorter time, than if we ſet our ſelves to do that which Opportunity does not ſo much favour.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Take the firſt Time or Seaſon of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Work; do not ſtay in hopes of a better, when, it may be, you may never have
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96861:53"/>
another. This is wiſe Counſel in any good Work, not to be dilatory, to procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate. But 'tis neceſſary in thoſe that are inwardly and immutably good, and eternally obligatory. Let no Conceit of preſent Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty put thee off. Do not neglect a good Seaſon, in an uncertain Expectation of one more convenient. Say not to good Works, as <hi>Felix</hi> ſaid to St. <hi>Paul, Go away for this time, when I have a convenient Seaſon,</hi> Acts 24. 25.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Avoid thoſe things which are certain, and ſome of them double miſpence of Time: Such are theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Intemperance. Whoſoever exceed the Bounds which Nature and Vertue has ſet to their Appetites of bodily Pleaſures, they for a ſpace utterly diſable themſelves from uſing their Time to any good purpoſe. And ſo they continue, till by Sleep or Abſtinence they are recovered to their natural State: During which time, how many fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of doing brave Actions have they loſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Immoderate Paſſion: This does ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Soul in the Thoughts of ſome one Object, that it is wholly inobſervant of any thing elſe that comes before it. Whilſt I am over vehemently angry with one, I take no notice of another, whoſe Wants would otherwiſe move my Compaſſion. They do loudly call for my Charity, but I am ſo deaf with the noiſe of mine own Paſſion, that I cannot hear.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:96861:54"/>
3. Wicked Company. Such will be ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or doing ill things: There is ſome Danger that the Infection catch hold on me; and by ſorting with them, I become one of them. Or, if by God's Grace, I be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from running into the ſame Exceſs with them; yet I may through Cowardiſe or Imprudence not rebuke them. By ſuffering Sin on them, I may bring it on my ſelf. If I do rebuke them, it may be to no purpoſe, it is not likely to have any Effect. Thus if I be not Company-proof, I ſhall be ſnared. And if I be kept from falling into their Sins, yet I have loſt ſome hours which might have been better ſpent in good Company, or in my Cloſet.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Courtſhip and Complement; great portions of Time are ſpent in theſe Trifles; by which I do not mean thoſe Expreſſes of Civility, which become us to uſe in many caſes: but, when we employ our Minds in ſtudying to ſpeak Words, or uſe Geſtures, that are wholly inſignificant, that do not correſpond with the Senſe of our Souls, that have no Truth on which they are bottom'd; that are uſed with a vain, with no good, perhaps with an ill Deſign. How idly, how unprofitably do they laviſh away their time, who converſe together in this vain, trifling, falſe, hypocritical manner, who as they are conſcious, that no Credit is to be given to what they ſay, ſo neither do they believe each other? And to how little purpoſe do I converſe with that Man, whom I cannot think he means as he ſpeaks?</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:96861:54"/>
16. Be very watchful of our ſelves in ſuch Particulars, which if they be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, do very much endanger the loſs of Time. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be careful we be not too prodigal of it in the Gratifications of our Senſes, and the Services of the Body. Whilſt thou art eating and drinking, take heed of devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Time alſo: And ſpend not thoſe hours in Sleep, or in dreſſing thy Body, which ſhould have been laid out on thy better Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</p>
               <p>I do not by this put eating and drinking, ſleeping, and dreſſing, into the vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of Time. No, they are all very allowable things: But, this I ſay, that we have need to ſet a Watch over our ſelves, leſt we ſpend more time in theſe things, than we can account for, than is requiſite for them; ſo long as they are good and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: Let us be doing other things, while we are doing theſe. While we are ſatisfying our Hunger and Thirſt, let us diſcourſe; While we are dreſſing our Bodies, let us be cloathing, and adorning, and ſprucing up our Souls, by wiſe and good Thoughts and Affections. But do not do this profuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and by the by; for that's hateful, and a perverſe piece of Folly, to let thy Soul have thy Bodies leavings: To do the Work of thy Soul when thou haſt nothing elſe to do; to caſt off thy refuſe Minutes to it, and to allow it none other; to afford it only the few Minutes, which can be ſpared from the Services of the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:96861:55"/>
This may be an Inſtance, how the ſame Action may be very good and very bad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mind with, and the Principle from which it is done. He that lays his Bible before him, and fills up thoſe Minutes with reading, and imploys thoſe Thoughts about God's Revelation, which need not be laid out wholly in dreſſing: And does this out of the great Senſe he has of the far greater Excellency and Neceſſity of one Work than of the other, he does well in this. But if theſe little Intervals of Time be all that are given to the Soul; and if he only caſt off the Shreds of Time for the Soul, out of a Preference of the Body, this is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beware of all diverting Exerciſes. Thoſe Games which were invented on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to take off our Minds a while from more ſerious Employments, on which they could not be continually fixed, they after prove an infinite Expence of Time; and by a kind of Witchery do ſo inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and excite our Paſſions, and cauſe a tickling Pleaſure, that they detain us much longer time than we can ſpare from impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>It is Wiſdom in this caſe, to reſolve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be engaged in it, how long we will ſtay at ſuch a Sport: And to be ſure not to break our Purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Compliance with general Cuſtoms. Some of theſe are great Devourers of Time. We ſpend many hours, and 'tis but very little good we do in them. I do not bid you
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96861:55"/>
be ſingular, and break ſuch Cuſtoms; no, I ſuppoſe them innocent in themſelves, and by my Care they may be ſo to me. All I adviſe is, that ſince they may not require a great, or conſtant Intention of Mind to uſe them, we let out our Thoughts after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, and lay hold on ſuch Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of doing any kind of good as are offer'd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Civil Viſits: Such as are made by thoſe who are not quite Strangers to each other, nor yet ſo well known, as to be Friends and Confidents. I do not ſuppoſe theſe to end in meer Tattle, much leſs in a ſaucy Diſcourſe againſt their Governours, nor in ſlandering, or uncharitable detracting from their Neighbours, nor any ſuch ill things as theſe, which is the worſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Time that can be. But if theſe Viſits ſtay in general and innocent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, yet we muſt be careful, that too much of our little Time, which more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things call for, be not laid out on theſe leſſer matters. Let us alſo endeavour to improve theſe Occaſions to the beſt Uſes, of which they are capable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Curioſities. They are things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much Pains, and are of no great uſe. Now, if whilſt we are in purſuit of theſe, we neglect ſomething that is more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; if things of far greater moment call for that Time and Pains which we lay out on theſe Prettineſſes, they prove the loſs of our Time: and there is great Danger leſt our Curioſity ſhould engage us ſo far in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96861:56"/>
queſt of theſe <hi>diſſiciles Nugae,</hi> theſe things that pleaſe, meerly becauſe they are rare, and odd, and hard to come at; that we ſhould not mind the Seaſons of doing far better and greater things: Which if we do, we loſe the Advantage in part, for we do not do the beſt we might.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Converſation with Friends. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, <hi>Amici fures temporis;</hi> and there is ſome danger of it, as there is of every thing that hugely pleaſes us, leſt it ſhould ſo fix and chain our Souls to it, that they be not ready to fly away with the firſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that calls to the doing ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and more neceſſary Good.</p>
               <p>This that I ſay, is no Diſparagement to Friends; and which of all the things, this World affords that are without us, is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt value. And there is nothing ſo pleaſant, ſo profitable; nothing ſo truly honourable; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that carries with it a Signification of greater Wiſdom, and Vertue, and good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than to live in Friendſhip: And the more there is of this, the larger, the more univerſal, ſtill it deſerves a greater Praiſe. It is that, which, tho I am occaſionally fallen into the mention of, yet, I can hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to perſwade all Men to enter into, and to preſerve this moſt ſacred League.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, I muſt intimate, that amongſt the other Miſcarriages you may by occaſion of it fall into, this is not the leaſt, That the moſt pleaſant Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Friend may ſo take you up, that you may be by this bereft of the Seaſon of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96861:56"/>
doing ſome more needful Good, which, it may be, whilſt you are in thoſe delightful Tranſports you have in the Enjoyment of him you love and truſt, as you do your own Soul, paſſes away, and will return no more.</p>
               <p>This Caution ſhould be no more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to Friendſhip, or bring us into any ill Thoughts of that, than if it were (as it might be) applied to a greater thing than Friendſhip, that is, Devotion, or converſe with God himſelf, which is the higheſt Act we can put forth; yet we may be too long in the Mount. There are other Services to be done beſides, though none ſo great as this.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Do not thy Actions by halves, nor ſo as thou ſhalt need to do them again. Strive to do every thing as well, as exactly as thou canſt. And tho it may happen ſo, as that thou muſt do it again, however thou mayſt be better able to do it than now thou art, yet this is all can be done to prevent it.</p>
               <p>If we have conſidered the Reaſons why we ſhould thus take every Opportunity, and be perſwaded by them; we ſhall not only do thus our ſelves, but alſo endeavour that others, that all with whom we have to do, eſpecially Children and Servants, may do ſo. And for that end, I can't give a better Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than that we ſhould bring up our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſome honeſt Imployment or other, not ſuffer them to live at large, to do this or that, any thing or nothing, what and when themſelves have a Mind to it.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96861:57"/>
And for our Servants, who are at our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we ſhould take care that they be neither idle, nor ill imployed. Let me alſo add concerning Friends, when we are with them, that as we ought to be careful, that they do not ſteal Time from us; ſo ſhould we charge our ſelves, that we do not rob them of it, and by their Civility and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us, engage them to neglect their more neceſſary and important Affairs.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have gone in general Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how we may not neglect any, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy every Opportunity of well-doing that offers it ſelf. The Sum is, Let us redeem as much Time from the leſs neceſſary Works, as is ſufficient for our doing all thoſe that are of greater Importance.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to offer ſome Advice, by what means and ways we ſhould make Times that are adverſe and oppoſite, to become favourable and ſerviceable to us, as we are Chriſtians, that is, to the Chriſtian Life, and to all that Happineſs which we natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and innocently deſire.</p>
               <p>And alſo where we cannot make them thus pliant to our Deſires and Purpoſes, how we ſhould avoid thoſe Evils with which they threaten us.</p>
               <p>That we may proceed more clearly, we we will conſider what <hi>Days</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>evil,</hi> and what makes them ſo. And by this our way will be more plain, which we are to take, either to alter, or to decline the <hi>Evils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:96861:57"/>
1. Thoſe <hi>Days</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>evil,</hi> which hinder us from doing, or enjoying that Good, which otherwiſe we might.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Evil</hi> of them is in ſuch things as theſe: Poverty, Reproach, and a bad Name, Slavery, Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inement, want and loſs of Friends, Sickneſs, and Death, the Ignorance and Miſtakes of many; but above all, Sin, of which there is greateſt Danger. For, all the reſt take Men off from doing Good, but Sin makes them alſo do Evil.</p>
               <p>If we be made poor, we ſhall not be able to feed the Hungry, or cloath the Naked, or relieve thoſe that are ready to periſh, which the Rich Man can. And if we die, we are cut off from doing, or enjoying any more the Good of this Life: but if we commit Sin, and practiſe Wickedneſs, we not only do no Good, but we do that which is contrary to it, Evil. We not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our ſelves of the Enjoyments that are innocent and natural, but we, by this, bring our ſelves under great Sufferings and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and ſuch like, are the Evils of any Days. And the Divine Providence brings about all the reſt, except Sin, either by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and unſeen Cauſes, which we do not know, or cannot reſiſt: Or, by other Men, who either maſter us by their Power, or out-reach us by their Wit, or prevail with us by their Authority: Or laſtly, by our ſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> our own Folly, and Negligence, and Wickedneſs. Indeed the greateſt Evils of any Times come from our ſelves. And
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96861:58"/>
tho Men generally complain of the Times, the Times; yet in many Caſes, if they would ſpeak truly and properly, they muſt blame themſelves. For, they can't but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that other Men are, and they might be very good in thoſe very bad Times, which they ſo much accuſe. Our greateſt Danger is from our Selves, more than from Times and Things without us. For, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our own Conſents, nothing can make us ſin: And if we eſcape Sin and Wickedneſs; nothing can do us much harm. If we keep our ſelves from doing Evil, we ſhall not fall into the worſt of all thoſe Miſchiefs, of which we are in Danger from the Times.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let this then be our firſt Care, that we do not make the Days evil; that by our own Ignorance and Folly, our Careleſsneſs, and Vicioſity, we do not bring thoſe Evils upon our ſelves for which we complain of the Times.</p>
               <p>Perhaps by your bad Example you have infected others; or by your ill, or for want of your good Counſel, ſome publick Perſons are vicious, and their Vices have had Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the Generality, and the Age has been corrupted by this. And now you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain againſt the Times, when as your ſelf are a great cauſe why they are ſo bad.</p>
               <p>How many are there, who ſhould turn their Accuſation of the Times againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? They have, and do help to make good Times bad, and bad Times worſe. They neglect their own Duty, and do not do the good of their Place; they are fooliſh
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96861:58"/>
and idle, and careleſs, and vicious; and whilſt they are ſo, no Times will be good to them. They will never find a Seaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient enough wherein to do well: Such a Temper as this, will turn the beſt into very bad Times.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore, in the firſt place, take Care, that by our Wickedneſs and Folly, we do not change good Days into bad; nor increaſe the Evil of any Time. Under this general Advice we ſhall find moſt of, or all thoſe particular Directions, which I ſhall preſently give.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing that the Times are bad, and we have no hand in it: Suppoſe them worſe than (God be thanked) they are, as bad as in any Age they have been, as we can well conceive them to be: Let the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality be given up to all Wickedneſs, not only debauch'd and ſottiſh in themſelves, but profane and irreligious towards God; and both uncharitable and and unjuſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt and inhuman towards Men: But let us imagine the Wiſe, and the Learned, the Rich, and the Honourable to be hearty Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of, and Enemies to the Chriſtian Life and Spirit, and that they uſe their Wit, and employ their Knowledg, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in obſtructing the progreſs of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Vertue, as much as is poſſible. Nay, not only ſo, but they who hold the Scepter, by whoſe Counſel publick Affairs are managed, are violent Perſecutors of the Cauſe and People of God, and of all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and their Rage is bent againſt every
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96861:59"/>
one that is like to, and a Follower of the Son of God. Suppoſe you be in a Family where not only thy Fellow-Servants, or thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Siſters, but thy Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or thy Maſter and Miſtris be not only wicked themſelves, but Abetters of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in others. Let thy Caſe alſo be ſuch, that thou, by being good, wilt not only be in danger to loſe the Good-will of thy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, thy Friends, but of thy Superiours; nay, thy Governours will be ready to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thee with Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſcation of Goods, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, perhaps Death it ſelf: Thy Name is caſt out from amongſt Men, thou art reckon'd as an Evil-doer, and art thought worthy to ſuffer all manner of Evils, which Men can inflict on thee. Let this be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be our Caſe, which was the Primitive Chriſtians; (but God be praiſed it is not ours, for we enjoy Peace and Liberty, we may be as good as we will; nay, and have many great Advantages and Helps to be good; yet ſince we have ſo very long neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and miſimproved, and abuſed them, we know not what calamitous Times the Divine Providence may bring us into.) Now that we may be better prepared for the making ſuch Times ſerviceable to our good Purpoſes, and making the beſt of all theſe Evils which may at any time befal us, ſo as to loſe no Opportunity of doing well, which they may be conceived by any Care and Prudence of ours, to afford us, I will lay down ſome general Advices. The Sum of which is, that,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:96861:59"/>
We muſt endeavour as much as is poſſible, <hi>i. e.</hi> as much as is conſiſtent with Religion and Vertue, to conciliate the good will of all Men; to bring them into a good opinion both of our Religion, and of our ſelves: To make not only our Inferiours and Equals, the generality, the multitude, to think well of both; but alſo to ſtrive to approve our ſelves, and to commend our Religion to the Rich and the Great, to the Learned and Wiſe, to Princes and Nobles, to Men of all Employments and Ways, in all Offices, and Relations, and Conditions. And that will be by doing thoſe things, which all commend and eſteem Good; by abſtaining from thoſe which every one accounts Evil, and blames; by being of ſuch a behaviour as all approve and like.</p>
               <p>This I am ſure was the Counſel which was given to the firſt Profeſſors of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to teach them how to carry themſelves in thoſe difficult Times in which they lived.</p>
               <p>This is the Senſe of my Text, and that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems particularly to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when he bid them <hi>walk circumſpectly, redeeming the Time;</hi> and that they ſhould ſtrive after an excellent knowledg of the Will of God: All which ſeems to have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reference to the <hi>Evil Days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a parallel place (which we mentioned in the beginning) the Apoſtle calls upon them to <hi>walk in Wiſdom towards them that are without, redeeming the Time;</hi> which plainly imports, that they ſhould have ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96861:60"/>
of the <hi>Extranei,</hi> the Infidels, that by their Carriage towards them, they might gain from them thoſe Advantages and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which were requiſite for their doing the Good which their Religion enjoyned them.</p>
               <p>This is the general Advice. Strive to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn your Profeſſion, to commend your ſelves by that which every Man approves. Commend your Religion, which you will do, if you can but make it appear. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give a true clear repreſentation of it in your Diſcourſes, and then it will carry its own defence with it; every Man will be convinced of its Goodneſs. But eſpecially, ſhew in your Converſation the excellency of this Wiſdom. Let it appear by the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Effects which it has on your Spirit and Behaviour, that it is a moſt divine thing, in that it keeps you from doing that which is Evil, and engages you to do that which is Good and Honeſt in the ſight of all Men, But</p>
               <p>What is that <hi>honeſt Converſation</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the Chriſtians to have <hi>among the Gentiles, that whereas they ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them as Evil-doers, they might be aſhamed,</hi> who did falſly accuſe the Chriſtian Life? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Tho, it may be, ſome Men are ſo greatly corrupted, and become ſo much either Brutes, or Devils, that there is very little of that which is truly Good that they will account ſo: Yet, I hope, there are not many of theſe Monſters, and that there will very few be found, who do not entertain a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Men,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:96861:60"/>
1. Who are Innocent. Which therefore our Saviour thought fit particularly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to his Diſciples that were to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Wolves. Be harmleſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as Doves.</hi> Innocence has a certain Charm in it which compoſes Rage and Fierceneſs, and caſts a Damp on the fury of a Perſecutor. Hurt no Body in Word, or Deed; This is the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt way to procure ſuch ſafety to your ſelves, that none will hurt you. For who will be an Enemy to him, that is an Enemy to no Man?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would eſcape the ill-Thoughts, and Oppoſitions of Men, be humble and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. Do not aim at things too high for you. Do not undertake what you are not fit for, keep within your own Compaſs. Do not ambitiouſly contend with more worthy Men, thoſe that are more fit for a place than your ſelves. Do not graſp at every thing, whilſt you can do little or nothing; for ſuch a Carriage as this makes every one your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Whereas if your Deportment be ſuch, that it ſhews you think of your ſelf as you ought, it will conciliate every ones. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To be mild and patient, is not only in the ſight of God, but of Men alſo, very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable. <hi>Soft Words,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon, will turn away Wrath.</hi> And common Obſervation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that nothing does ſo blunt the edg of a ſharp Anger, as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eek Behaviour. If the Man of Fury will begin to afflict ſuch a one, yet he can hardly continue; the edge will be ſoon taken off, and his Malice grow
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96861:61"/>
weary, when it is not animated, and enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by an angry Oppoſition. The firſt Chriſtians wearied the Rage of their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors by their Patience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I adviſe to hearty and univerſal Good-Will. He that would be hated by none, muſt himſelf hate none. And he that would be loved by all, muſt love all.</p>
               <p>Nor is good Wiſhes, and a good Will, and good Words all that I mean by Love: But all ſuch good Deeds as thou canſt do. Where thou art fit to give it, and others capable to receive it, counſel, admoniſh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. Where thou haſt an Eſtate, and ſeeſt thy Brother in want, relieve him. And by the way, Is not this the likelieſt courſe to ſecure thy Eſtate? For when every one knows that thou uſeſt it to the beſt Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that thou neither oppreſſeſt thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nor yet hoardeſt up thy Treaſure, but putteſt it to the beſt uſes, feedeſt the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, cloatheſt the Naked, ſupplieſt the nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Poor, layeſt it out on ſome publick Works: Who will go about to wrong thee of that Eſtate with which thou doſt ſo much good? Or if there be any ſuch Monſters, yet the Generality will be on thy ſide. He muſt be a great and covetous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who will take away an Eſtate that does ſo much Good. And what Man is he who will abridge thoſe of their Liberty, who make it appear that they do not uſe it as a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, but as an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Beneficence. In ſhort, the Man of univerſal Good-Will obliges all. And he
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96861:61"/>
muſt be very unnatural that can be an Enemy to him, who is a Friend to every one.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And when I have ſaid thou ſhouldſt be loving and kind, merciful and liberal; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thee to be juſt and honeſt, true and faithful: That thou wilt wrong no Man of his Right, withhold from no Man his Due; but give every one that to which Law, and Cuſtom, and Equity has given him a Title. That thou wilt keep thy Word, and ſtand to thy Bargain, make good thy Promiſe, and be faithful to thy Truſt. If thou wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not other Men, they will not lightly wrong thee. And by being juſt and honeſt to all, thou takeſt the likelieſt way to make them ſo to thee. Give every Man his, and this will induce all others to give thee thine: To do to thee, as thou doſt to him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Be quiet and peaceable, not quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and contentious with your Neighbours. Be united, and as far as is poſſible, live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with all Men, be of one Heart, and Mind, and Way; do not diſagree with them without neceſſity. And where there is diſagreement in ſome, either Opinions, or Practices; yet let it be managed amicably, ſo as not to cauſe a Breach, a Diſtance; but converſe together, as thoſe that agree in the moſt and greateſt matters, tho you differ in ſome. Make it appear that your ſtudy is to be quiet, and your deſign to live in Peace.</p>
               <p>Let all the Vertues which fit Men for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which are neceſſary to its Being, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96861:62"/>
contribute to its Proſperity, ſhine forth in your Converſation.</p>
               <p>In Particular; <hi>Obey thoſe that have the rule over you,</hi> obey them univerſally, where their Commands do not interfere with God's; and where they do, and your Allegiance to the Sovereign of all the World challenges your Obedience to his Law, yet even there, where you deny ſubjection to your Earthly Governours, let this be done with that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Quietneſs, and with that becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reverence to them, that they may ſee it is not from a perverſe, peeviſh, froward, humour ſome, untractable Spirit; nor from the ſcrupuloſities of an anxious, and unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable Mind, that you do not comply with their Injunctions: But that it proceeds from the clear and fixed Reſolutions of a well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Mind, a Conſcience that is inſtructed to give God that which is his, and to Man that which God has given him. Which when it ſhall be evident to them, if your Governours have any thing of Humanity left; they will be inclined to favour you.</p>
               <p>By theſe, and ſuch like things, it came to paſs that the twelve Fiſhermen vanquiſh'd the World, and overcame all thoſe ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſuperable Difficulties: That the plain ſimple Religion of our Saviour, took place both of the Jewiſh, and the Pagan.</p>
               <p>The excellent Spirits, and Lives of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, did more to the Converſion of the World, than all the Miracles which they wrought. It was their Vertue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that made their Enemies become their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96861:62"/>
Friends, and that put an end to their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. It was their Innocence and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Humility and Love, Juſtice and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and Obedience, which got them favour with their Governours, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them eaſe and reſt, and all thoſe things which an Opportunity of doing Good does imply.</p>
               <p>Thus we have a verification of theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. We have ſeen an illuſtrious proof of their Truth. They who have done thus, have redeemed the Seaſon, by theſe ways they gained Opportunity, not only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but for us alſo. And that we enjoy ſo much Freedom and Wealth, and are not perſecuted to Death for our Religion, we muſt aſcribe to the innocent, holy and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lives of the firſt Chriſtians. This ſhews the ſufficiency of the Advices I have given, when they were obſerved, they proved effectual. To theſe let me add ſome others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us endeavour to be uſeful, and ſerviceable to the Publick; that the place where we live may not know how to be without us. This many times has ſaved the Life of a Malefactor; How much more will it expiate a ſmall Offence? Nay, not only ſo, but this is the way to obtain Liberty, to raiſe an Eſtate, to gain an Intereſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> to redeem a Seaſon of doing more Good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do your own Buſineſs, meddle not with other MensMatters, be not buſy-Bodies; be diligent to do your own Work, that which your Place and Station requires of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96861:63"/>
you; but be not forward to thruſt your ſelves into other Mens Affairs, leſt you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in that which you do not underſtand, nor are able to perform.</p>
               <p>This medling where we are not concern'd, is a great loſs of Time; not only, as it takes us off from that which we can beſt do, our own Work, and puts us on what we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not ſo well, nor are ſit for: But alſo, as it brings us into diſeſteem with Men (who generally think ill of a buſy-Body) and thereby makes us loſe that Opportunity, which their no ill Opinion of us would have afforded.</p>
               <p>But if we take upon us to be Governors, nay, to be Superior to, and to judg and cenſure them; we by thus invading the Throne, and offering to wreſt the Scepter out of the Princes Hand, make it neceſſary for them to curb our Inſolence. Whereas he that keeps himſelf within his own Bounds, and is diligent in his own Affairs; he is eaſy and profitable to the Government, under which he lives, and no Man can be angry with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be not over-Talkative. <hi>A Man full of Words ſhall not proſper: And there is a Time when the prudent Man will hold his peace.</hi> But, if Men in their Diſcounſes, ſpeak evil of their Neighbours; much more, if they blaſpheme Dignities, and revile the Rulers; they many ways offend againſt this Precept of <hi>redeeming the Time.</hi> For, 1. They are doing Evil themſelves. 2. They, by this, hinder others from doing the Good they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96861:63"/>
would have done, if they had not been ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, or reproached. 3. They provoke thoſe againſt whom they ſpeak, and make themſelves obnoxious to their Governours: They have made it neceſſary that they ſhould be puniſhed, in one kind or other, for Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do not affect Singularity in Humour, Garb, Carriage, or any little things: But be like to, and converſe with others, and comply with all the old innocent Cuſtoms of the Places where you are. Where Men do thus, they are not ſupected of Innovation, as the affecters of Singularities are by the Government. This we know was the way of our Saviour, and of his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Be Civil, and Courteous, and Affable to all Men. And where they either do not want, or you cannot do any thing that's grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better, yet be not wanting in theſe ſmaller Offices. Theſe little things, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, lay no little Obligation on Men, and they will hereby be brought to a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of you.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe Counſels which I would give, that we may gain Seaſons of doing well in evil Days.</p>
               <p>But if things will not yield, or become pliant to our Purpoſe, if we cannot by all the honeſt Arts we uſe, gain the good Will, nor yet free our ſelves from the worſt Evils that the Malice of Men may bring upon us: We have then but two things to do,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To withdraw our ſelves from the Dangers that threaten us, if this may be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96861:64"/>
done handſomely, and creditably: Or if we cannot,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To encounter the Dangers, which we cannot eſcape, with that Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Mind, that becomes the Followers of the Bleſſed Jeſus; thoſe who have Faith in God, and believe them to be Bleſſed, who ſuffer in, and for well-doing. By this means, we may make our Deaths an Opportunity of doing more Good, than if we had lived many Years, we ſhould have done. And ſo ſhall <hi>redeem the Time, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What I have ſaid of the Wickedneſs of the Times, refers to the Wickedneſs of other Men which may endanger our falling into Sin, and will make us leſs ſucceſsful in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, than otherwiſe we ſhould be.</p>
               <p>The Directions which I have given are not ſufficiently particular. It will be uſeful to conſider very particularly, how I ſhould behave my ſelf in this, or that, or the other Difficulty. To follow the Examples in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how my Saviour, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and others behaved themſelves before Magiſtrates, with Hypocrites, and with open Sinners; and in the Extremities of Dangers. It is not for me to give many particular Advices: Your own Prudence in preſent Straits will ſuggeſt them. Only let me put you in mind of this,</p>
               <p>That you uſe no Arts, for your delivery from any Evils, which do not agree with the Faith, and Truth, and Honeſty that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all Men; which are not fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with, and well-becoming the Religion of a Chriſtian, the Affection and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96861:64"/>
of a Friend, the Duty and Loyalty of a Subject; and whatever Relation, or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you are in.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reſolve never unneceſſarily to expoſe our Selves, our Lives, Fortunes, Names to the Malice, and Rapine, and Cenſure of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons, who are uncharitable: Or of publick Perſons, who are notoriouſly unjuſt, or rigorouſly juſt. That is, avoid all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, fooliſh, hazardous Buſineſſes, Quarrels, and Oppoſitions by acting, or ſpeaking about other Men's Matters, where we have nothing to do; much more doing or ſaying any thing openly and directly againſt their Perſons, Intereſts, Ways, or Opinions: When a more tacit, and conſequential way will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably do what you intend, more effectually. Not always railing at the (ſuppoſe) Idols, and falſe ways of Worſhip, which other Men uſe: But taking fit Seaſons to ſignify our diſapproval of them. <hi>Neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of the Jews, neither againſt the Temple, have I offended any thing at all,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, Acts 25. 8. He that would ſee good Days, let him refrain his Tongue from Evil,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Make it appear that there is no ſuch great difference betwixt you as is thought. That you agree in many, and thoſe the moſt material Things. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhew'd, that the Heathen Poets conſented to, and bore wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>For we are his Off-ſpring, Acts</hi> 17. 28.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where you can't make this appear concerning the whole number of your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96861:65"/>
yet if you can, do it of a part of them; do this, and you will divide them: So St. <hi>Paul, concerning the Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>But thus much may ſuffice for the ſecond Propoſition, which I propounded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſtians ought to make the beſt of bad Times, when they fall into them.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>CHriſtians ought to uſe their beſt Endeavours to underſtand what the Will of God is: This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Apoſtle's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation in thoſe Words, <hi>Wherefore he ye not unwiſe, but underſtanding what the Will
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96861:66"/>
of the Lord is.</hi> The Relation which theſe Words have with the foregoing, is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by the word <hi>Wherefore</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>); it is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, That you may <hi>walk circumſpectly,</hi> or accurately, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Chriſtians; and that you may <hi>redeem the Seaſon,</hi> not needleſly expoſing your ſelves to Dangers, but uſing all prudent, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ways to ſecure your ſelves, and gain Opportunity of doing the Good, your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion obliges you to; Be not imprudent, as thoſe are that are either ignorant of, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in <hi>the Will of the Lord.</hi> But on the other hand, endeavour after a very perfect underſtanding of it: that ſo you may not think your ſelves under Obligations to do that, which he does not require of you; nor yet be careleſs of doing that which he does require: and by both ways be betray'd into the Dangers which threaten you, but that your Practice being directed by this exact Knowledge of the Divine Will, you may, as much as is poſſible, eſcape the <hi>Evils,</hi> of which the times are full; and gain to your ſelves the beſt Advantages for good living that you can have.</p>
               <p>Our well-doing and well-being does very much depend upon our Knowledge: It is indeed a very principal Ingredient of our Goodneſs and Happineſs. Without it, ſays Solomon, <hi>the Heart cannot be good,</hi> that is, neither vertuous nor quiet.</p>
               <p>Now, there is no Knowledge of greater importance to Man than the Knowledge of the <hi>Will of God.</hi> For, this is the Rule of all
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96861:66"/>
our Actions, the limits of our Deſires, the direction of all our Counſels.</p>
               <p>God's Will is the guide of ours. And as we cannot reaſonably will any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what God will's: ſo it is our Safety, and our Wiſdom and Perfection to will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe.</p>
               <p>This Knowledg has the greateſt influence upon the good government of our Lives. And whoſoever is without it, he cannot expreſs that regard to the great Governour of the World which he ſhould.</p>
               <p>To be ignorant, or to be miſtaken, in a matter of this moment, is of fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And yet I doubt we are not, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, ſo careful in this as we ought, as it is our intereſt to be. There are few that cry ſo earneſtly, and ſo often as <hi>David, Lord, teach me thy Law,—thy Judgments, make me to underſtand thy Teſtimonies.</hi> And where is he to be found that has made this his Enquiry, What is <hi>the Will of God?</hi> Tho we daily pray that <hi>God's Will may be done,</hi> yet we conſider nor what that Will is: We pretend to be doers of it, tho we know it not.</p>
               <p>But, ſome may be diſcouraged from ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this Knowledge, as if it were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible. For, what Man is he that can pretend to know the Will of another Man? And how then ſhall he underſtand the Will of God?</p>
               <p>It may be ſufficient to remove this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if I ſay, That by <hi>the Will of God,</hi> in this place, we are to underſtand only that, which he declares he would have Man to do, or ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:96861:67"/>
Now though it cannot be conceiv'd, that Man's Mind ſhould comprehend all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Determinations of the Will of God, and his whole Counſel: innumerable of which, are above our comprehenſion, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to us, and on one account or other, are, and for ever will be hid from us: Yet as far as we are concern'd, and it may be of advantage to us to know it, God has revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Will to us. And that is, eſpecially, what it is that he would have us to do; and what will be the iſſue of ſuch a behaviour, or of the contrary to it.</p>
               <p>Before I give an account, how and in what ways this is made known to us; I will take notice of this Expreſſion, <hi>the Will of God,</hi> which the Scripture ſo often uſes for his Law. I infer from this, That it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that which God wills, that we ſhould conform to his Law, do what he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, abſtain from what he has forbid.</p>
               <p>It is really the Will of God, that Man ſhould live as God has declared he would have him. This is God's Pleaſure, that which he deſires and delights in. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever does not thus, he, in the uſe of his Liberty, of and from himſelf, that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving power with which he is endow'd, oppoſes and contradicts the Will of God.</p>
               <p>I mention this the rather, becauſe of ſome ill Expreſſions, which have been in great uſe, that may lead ſuch as are unwary, into great and dangerous Miſtakes. As when Men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the <hi>bene-placitum,</hi> or good pleaſure of God, from his <hi>preceptive</hi> or commanding
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96861:67"/>
Will, and call this only an expreſſion, or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification and a ſhew of his Will: as if this were not his real Will and Good-pleaſure.</p>
               <p>For the clearing up of ſuch difficulties as theſe, let us conſider, that tho we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Will of God from its Objects, and the various matters about which it is, yet in it ſelf it is but one ſimple thing. God has not a Will and a Will, two Wills, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we call the willing two Things two Wills. Much leſs are we to imagine the leaſt ſhadow of Contradiction among the ſeveral acts of the divine Will: This were an Imperfection not eaſily to be faſtened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wiſe Man.</p>
               <p>But neither this, nor any other thing that is inconſiſtent with the acknowledged Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the God-head, ought to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of the Divine Will. God cannot will that which is contrary to his own glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nature.</p>
               <p>If we be perſuaded of theſe two things (which I think are clear in their own Light.) 1. That God cannot will inconſiſtently with the perfections of his moſt excellent Nature, that Wiſdom and Knowledg, that Juſtice and Goodneſs that are eſſential to him. And 2. That one act of his Will can never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, nor is in the leaſt repugnant to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This may be of good uſe to preſerve us from ſome dangerous Opinions, which have been held in theſe latter Ages: We ſhall never attribute to God unjuſt Decrees, nor impoſſible Commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:96861:68"/>
I do not enter into the main Controverſy, but yet thought fit on this occaſion to ſay thus much, leſt any one ſhould think that God does not will what he commands; that it is but a ſhew he makes, when he gives his Law, as if he really will'd that Man ſhould not obſerve it: A Thought moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of God.</p>
               <p>I muſt not go on in this Argument now. I hope enough has been ſaid to my Purpoſe, and that no Man will queſtion whether that be indeed the Will of God, which he has ſo often, and ſo plainly told us is his Will: I mean his Law.</p>
               <p>I therefore proceed to ſhew, by what means, and in what way Man may come to as perfect a knowledg of this Will of God, concerning his Actions, as can be: That he may know it with as much clearneſs and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, diſtinction and particularity, as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and adequately, as is poſſible. Alſo that he may not only have a poſitive and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but a comparative and relative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God's Commands, which are the greater, and which the leſs weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law: What reference the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precepts bear; and in what order they are unto each other.</p>
               <p>We are commonly told of two general ways, wherein this Knowledg is attained, which are thus expreſſed; the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of Grace, or Reaſon, and Faith. Neither of which exclude, but indeed imply Senſe, both inward and outward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:96861:68"/>
I ſhall not conſider theſe diſtinctly, but ſhall ſhew at leaſt ſome of thoſe ways, wherein God diſcovers his Will to us Men. As,</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Manifeſtation he has made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the adorable Perfections of his own Nature. When we underſtand a Man's Temper and Humours, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Way, we are better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated to know what it is that he wills.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By the Works which he has wrought, he has made farther diſcoveries of his Will; but eſpecially by Man himſelf: the Nature and Faculties which God has given us, are a certain Indication to every one that will conſider them, what our Creator would have us to do.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The conſent of the generality of Men, and of the wiſeſt and beſt, univerſally, that ſuch or ſuch things are the Will of God, is a farther publication of it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Declarations of Men divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired. God has in ſundry Ways and divers Manners revealed his Will to ſome Men, and by them to others; the Records of which we have in the Books of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="5">V. God does by ſecret Suggeſtions, and Teachings of his good Spirit, convey into Mens Minds the notice of his Will; by theſe he brings to remembrance, or ſhows us in particular, which is the way he would have us to go, and which to avoid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:96861:69"/>
Theſe are five Ways wherein God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, and whereby we come to know his Will, and our Duty.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Then we may learn what the Will of God concerning us muſt be, by what he is in himſelf. For ſuch as he is, ſuch is his Will; it being altogether unconceivable that he ſhould will that which is repugnant to his Nature, or do any thing unnaturally.</p>
               <p>Now God has ſo far manifeſted his own moſt glorious Nature, that all Men (who conſider) know him to be eſſentially and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably wiſe and good, holy, and juſt, and true. God is not conceivable without theſe Excellencies, they are the Properties which every one aſcribes unto him. And if theſe be intrinſical to, and as it were conſtitutive of the divine Nature it ſelf; then they will have influence on, and be derived upon his Will, and all his Works. And conſequently, his Law muſt neceſſarily be holy, and wiſe, juſt, and true, and good. Yea, not only that, but all whatſoever he wills and does, will certainly be thus qualified.</p>
               <p>Again; If theſe be the eſſential Properties of God, as by his Power and Goodneſs he is communicative and willing to impart, ſo he muſt impart of that which is his, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He will uſe the Methods that are proper to make his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures partakers of this divine Nature, ſo far as they are capable. And then (as we ſhall ſee under the next particular) he will give to Man a holy and righteous Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:96861:69"/>
From this Conſideration of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, I infer two things to our preſent Purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God can will or require nothing of us, which is not wiſe and good, holy, juſt, and true. So that if any thing pretend to be of God, which is not thus qualified, it wants ſufficient Credentials. If it make ſhew of divine Authority but is manifeſtly fooliſh, unqueſtionably evil, impure and filthy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and falſe, it is not required of us by God, all whoſe Ways are Holy, and his Works Righteous, all that he does himſelf, or commands us to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he does will all that is wiſe and good to be done. As he can will nothing that is not, ſo he does certainly will all that is. As he knows it all, ſo he muſt be allowed to will it all. For elſe we impute defect and imperfection to God, by ſuppoſing him to know that Good which he does not will: We ſhould by this make his Goodneſs leſs than his Knowledg; and his Will not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but to fall ſhort of his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>So that this Conſideration does not only afford us a Character, whereby we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt the true Will of God, and that which pretends to be it, but is not: But we have alſo direction to find out what that is which God does will and command. In general,</p>
               <p>If there be any action that is wiſe, that is good, that is holy and juſt, and if there be any Truth; we may from hence be aſſured
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96861:70"/>
what is the Will of God. For as he can't will the contrary to theſe, ſo he cannot but by a kind of neceſſity of his own moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Nature, will all theſe.</p>
               <p>From this Knowledg which the Heathens had of God, the wiſe among them have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all Impurity and Impiety, all Folly and Injuſtice from Religion.</p>
               <p>If then we have an aſſured knowledg of what is wiſe and good, holy, and juſt, and true (as we all have) we underſtand withal what it is that God wills we ſhould do: So certain as thou art that any thing is ſit and becoming, beneficial and profitable; ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mayſt thou be of the divine Will and Law. For <hi>It is Good,</hi> and <hi>It is the Will of God,</hi> are two Forms of Speech of the ſame import. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of thee? &amp;c.</hi> Mic. 6. 8.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt way whereby we come to the Knowledg of what God's Will concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Man, or his Law to us is, by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of what is wiſe and good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Purity, Juſtice, Truth, Wiſdom and Goodneſs are moſt certainly concluded by us to be things which God wills ſhould be in us, becauſe they are all Perfections of his own moſt excellent Nature. And he loving thoſe Perfections, and himſelf becauſe of them, infinitely; he cannot but will that they ſhould be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated; and that every thing which he makes ſhould, according to its Capacity, partake of them. God's Will is the Spring, as of his creating the World, ſo of all his other
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96861:70"/>
after-Works, they are all but the exerting of this teeming overflowing Goodneſs: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but will and deſire that Man ſhould be as he is; that we ſhould be holy, and merciful, and righteous, and faithful, and wiſe in our Meaſure and Degree, as he himſelf is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely.</p>
               <p>So then we have a moſt certain way to diſcover what the Will of God is, and muſt be, by a Conſideration of the Divine Nature, and thoſe Perfections which are eſſential to the Deity. And Man is not to ſeek in this matter: this is ſo obvious, and eaſy, and common a piece of Knowledg, that no Man's Mind is quite deſtitute of it. All Men agree in their Notion of God, and it can't be otherwiſe: For either they have the Knowledg impreſſed on their Minds, when firſt they came into Being; or elſe they are led into it by this plain and facil reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> Whatſoever Good there is in the World, is in God, who is the Original, eminently and perfectly. From hence we may conclude, that ſince all, who believe God to be, think him to be wiſe and good, holy, and juſt, and true; therefore nothing that's fooliſh or evil, impure or unrighteous, nor no Falſhood can be required by him. And on the other hand, all Goodneſs, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Sanctity, Juſtice, Fidelity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the Law of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By a Conſideration of God's Works we come to a diſcovery of his Will. As Man's Mind is diſcerned by what he does,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96861:71"/>
ſo is God's: When God has made Beings with ſuch Inclinations, and Faculties, and Capacities; if we ſuppoſe him (which we can't doubt he is) wiſe and good, we ſhall certainly know a great deal of his Will.</p>
               <p>Let us take a view of God's Works in general, and conſider thoſe Beings which partake of Life, eſpecially our ſelves, and we may obſerve ſuch things as theſe, which will lead us to a Knowledg of the Will of our common Creator.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may diſcern in them a ſort of Self-love, whereby they have a Deſire of, or Inclination to their own Preſervation and Continuance in that Being and Life which they have.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Averſation from all Pain, and a Love of Pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Tendency to, and kind of aſpiring after greater Perfection, and the utmoſt of which they are capable: To this we may refer the former.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Diſpoſition and Faculties to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and impart to others, none of them to be by and for themſelves alone, but for others; that they are communicative and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, and endeavour to propagate, and make others like themſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. An exact Order. Among all Beings which God has made, one is plainly ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to another: And of all theſe in this lower World, Man is ſupream: There are alſo higher than he; and all theſe things are ſubject to God's Will and Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:96861:71"/>
Now from theſe Obſervations, how all living things are made with ſuch Affections, and in ſuch Condition, we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in general, that it is the Will of our great Creator, that every one ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour both his own and other Beings Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Pleaſure, and Perfection; that we ſhould be communicative, and live in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; that the Inferiour be ſubject to the Superiour, and the worſe ſerve the better.</p>
               <p>Does not Nature teach theſe Leſſons plainly to every one that diligently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? May not any Man that looks into himſelf, and abroad, find that both Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and all the kinds of Animals in the World, have theſe deſires of their own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Perfection? that they do not ſtay in themſelves, but go out to others in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications and Services? may he not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, that one kind is advanced above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as well as of the ſame kind that ſome one is above the reſt? and that Man is above all kinds?</p>
               <p>And he that ſees all this, how well is he inſtructed in the Principles of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> how may he learn the very Fundamental Laws, whereby God governs the World? which are ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That every Man ſhould endeavour both his own and others Preſervation and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: That he keep not only himſelf, but others in that place and order, which the great and wiſe Creator has appointed them: That thus doing he carries on the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which the Maker and Lord of all does
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96861:72"/>
moſt evidently intend, and proſecute, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Inclinations and Appetites, which he has given all his Creatures, and by the Rank and Order in which he has ſet them to and with each other.</p>
               <p>He that knows, that not only himſelf, but all living things have theſe Inclinations, and do naturally deſire their own Pleaſure and Perfection, and that they are all fitted for the Service of each other: He will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this is the Will of him that made us all, and is our common Lord; that we ſhould follow theſe Inclinations in our ſelves, and comply with them in others, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to preſerve every Being, and the loweſt Life; and not only ſo, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and perfect it as much as is conſiſtent with the Service and Advancement of the higher and beſt Life, which is the Divine Life of the Mind, which in this State de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the Life of the Animal in us.</p>
               <p>If it be thought the Will of God, that we ſhould preſerve our ſelves, becauſe of that Self-Love that is natural to us; for the ſame reaſon it muſt be thought his Will, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers preſerve themſelves: And if we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or hinder them that they cannot, we reſiſt God's Will. If we do not what in us lies help them to do thus, we do not his Will univerſally.</p>
               <p>He then that obſerves theſe things, will read the Will of the World's Maker in moſt legible Characters, ſuch as have no Obſcurity, but the moſt unlearned Man in the World may run and read.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:96861:72"/>
If it be here excepted, That ſometimes theſe Inclinations claſh, they cannot all be gratified: And that Nature's Scholar has no Direction in this caſe; here are ſeveral things which God wills, but what ſhall be done, where there is a Competition?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That which every Man's Reaſon will direct him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be ſure there be a Contrariety betwixt an Inconſiſtency of theſe natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with each other; that the ſame living Creature, Man himſelf, cannot be preſerved, and continue, as it is, if he become ſerviceable to the publick: If theſe can both be, let them: If they cannot,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be in this, as in all other caſes it is, let the Superiour diſpoſe of the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, as may beſt promote the moſt publick, laſting, greateſt Good.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee a Grain of Corn, which in a cloſe Granary might be kept entire, for which State one would think it was made, being ſo whole and one in it ſelf. But yet it is by the skilful Husbandman thrown into the Ground, where it rots and dies (as the Apoſtle ſaith) in a little time, and ſo the Grain ſeems loſt; but yet afterwards it ſprouts and multiplies it ſelf into abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, perhaps ſixty, or a hundred.</p>
               <p>This may teach us not to be ſo careful of our own particular Beings, when by the giving them up we may do a far greater good.</p>
               <p>Again; By Nature (as I have ſaid) we are inclined to ſeek after Pleaſure; but yet
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96861:73"/>
by Nature alſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Brute Animals, that ſeem to regard only what is preſent, we are inſtructed to lay aſide our Pleaſure, when, by that, we may pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure ſome better, or more laſting; or publick-Good, than that our Pleaſure would be. So do the old Birds ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from abundance of particular Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, to hatch and feed their young; that is, they are more pleaſed with a publick, than a particular Good. And how common is it with us, to cut off a part, to ſave the whole?</p>
               <p>But, if natural Reaſon, unaſſiſted by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, be not ſufficient to direct us in this; yet by the help of that, we ſhall be fully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the knowledge of what God would have us to do, where there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of one natural deſire with another.</p>
               <p>More particularly: Whoſoever conſiders the Humane Nature (which is the top of God's Workmanſhip in this lower World) beſides theſe Affections, which we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto taken notice of, common to all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, he will diſcover ſome things, which are more particularly found in Man, which will ſhew him what the Will of God is. Some of which are theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Man is a compounded Being, made up of very many Parts and Faculties, and thoſe of very different Natures, and for divers Uſes. The two, to which all the other are reduceable, are his Body, and his Mind: That has very various Parts and Members; this contains two illuſtrious Faculties, the Underſtanding, and the Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:96861:73"/>
Now whoſoever takes notice of this, he cannot but conclude, if he ſuppoſe the Creator wiſe, that he did deſign, and does will, that all theſe Faculties and Parts ſhould be put to the Uſes for which they are fit: That they ſhould neither be unimploy'd, nor yet diverted from their proper Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and uſed otherwiſe than by their Natures they are fitted to be.</p>
               <p>Thus then, by what God has wrought in us we infer, That it is his Will, that we ſhould be imploy'd, and in various Works; that we ſhould neither be idle, nor yet do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only one thing; that we ſhould be in the Exerciſe not only of ſome Faculty, but of all; and that we ſhould not be in any unnatural uſe of our ſelves, or of any part of us, but ever be doing thoſe Works, for which our Parts and Faculties were plainly deſigned by their Maker, and by their Frame are fitted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul and Body do in this State very much depend on each other, they ſo ſympathize, that if one be well or ill, the other partakes of its proſperous or adverſe Condition.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay, that they are ſo totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on each other, that the one cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt or act without the other, that they began and will end together. For, natural Reaſon gives us good probable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, and the Religion of Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us of the contrary. St. <hi>Paul's,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other good Mens Experience proves to us, that the more the outward Man decays,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96861:74"/>
the inward may grow more vivacious, and be daily renew'd and increaſe in Strength and Vigor.</p>
               <p>This, by the aſſiſtance of the Divine Grace, and our co-operation, has often come to paſs. But yet, every one is ſenſible of ſuch a mutual Dependance of the Soul and Body, that the good or bad State of the one, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily has Influence on the other. And this ſhews plainly, that he who made us ſo, intended and wills, that not one, but both of them ſhould be regarded; that when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Welfare of one, we ſhould not look on that, as divided from, but as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the other: that we ſhould not ſo gratify the Body, as if there were no Soul, nor ſhould the Soul forget, that it is in the Body: that we ſhould not look on our ſelves as more brute Animals, nor as unbodied Spirits; that we ſhould endeavour the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare both of the Mind and of the Animal together, of neither abſtractedly and ſingly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul or Mind is confeſſed to be more excellent than the Body: And every one who thinks a Man has Pre-eminence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Beaſt, will not deny but that it is, and ought to be ſuperiour. For, tho the Spirit uſes the Miniſtrations of the Body, yet in abundance of Inſtances it governs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of it as it pleaſes. And it is manifeſt, that the Mind was not made to be ſubject to the Body, but the Body to it; the Soul of Man is ſupream. There is none who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Man's Frame, but muſt conclude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is the Will of his Creator, that his Mind
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96861:74"/>
ſhould rule, and his Body be in Subjection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Soul has a ſenſe or underſtanding of Good and Evil, and an Inclination or Love to all that appears good, and an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from all that to it ſeems evil. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as any thing is apprehended by the Mind to be good, or evil: ſo it determines it ſelf, and all within its Power, to or from it, for or againſt it.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Cardo,</hi> or Hinge, on which all our Frame turns, the firſt Spring of all our Motions, the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> in Man; as all Men acknowledg by their Practice: For, when they would engage themſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to any Undertaking, they ſhew its Goodneſs; or when they would take them off from it, they make it appear evil. Which Practice plainly ſuppoſes, that we all believe Man determines himſelf according as he apprehends a thing to be good or bad.</p>
               <p>If this be true, then we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God intended, when he made Man after ſuch a manner, that his Will ſhould be conformable to, and guided by his Underſtanding; and in particular, that he ſhould will and do good; that all he did, ſhould be good: for elſe, why ſhould he frame him ſo, as that he can will nothing, but what appears to him under that colour? and why did he ſo form the Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that ſome Things and Actions are by all thought Good and Evil?</p>
               <p>But we ſhall be more fully aſſured of this, that God, who made us, vvills that vve ſhould love and do all Good, and hate and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96861:75"/>
ſhun all Evil, if vve make a nearer Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Souls of Men: for vve may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, not only an unalterable Inclination to do that vvhich vve think to be on one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or other Good; But,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Alſo a very earneſt deſire and care to knovv more perfectly vvhat is, and all that is Good or Evil. No Man is vvilling to be ignorant, or miſtaken; and he is no-vvhere more careful of true Underſtanding, than in the matters of Good and Evil. That natural Deſire of Perfection, vvhich is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all things, does exert it ſelf in the Mind of Man in this Particular.</p>
               <p>And if this be the condition of Man, that he does naturally and neceſſarily perceive ſome things that are Good and Evil; and by an eaſy and natural Ratiocination, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover others; And if he go on to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which all deſire and tend to, he will attain to a clear and certain knowledge of all that is Good: And if it be unnatural for him to will without, or againſt all underſtanding; Then we muſt conclude, that his Wiſe Lord wills that he ſhould do all that is Good.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This will further appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Account to which Men call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their Actions, wherein they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and acquit themſelves, if they have done well; but diſallow and condemn all evil Actions. Nay, if they did ill, tho they intended well, they blame themſelves for their Miſcarriage: which ſuppoſes that they think they might, and ſhould have prevented this, by being better informed in the matter
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96861:75"/>
they undertook. But if they know, or thought it was Evil, and yet choſe to do it, they then rebuke themſelves ſharply, and their Conſciences arraign them for a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crime, and they are without Excuſe to themſelves.</p>
               <p>All this ſhews, that he who made Man thus to review his Performances, to excuſe and approve the Good, to cenſure and condemn the Evil; will'd that all he does ſhould be good.</p>
               <p>Love of Good ſeems to be the ſupream of all our Paſſions, that to which all the reſt of our Affections lead, and in which all our Faculties terminate, from which all our other Paſſions iſſue, and by which the Mind governs the Body, and is governed it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And the greater and better the Good is, the more naturally it is loved. Therefore, as we have ſhewed, that, according to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Order, this Good of the Mind ought to be preferr'd before the Good of the Body; ſo, that which is right, and fit, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before any other Good of the Mind, that is, the Moral before the Natural, for the one is in order to the other.</p>
               <p>This Subordination and Subſerviency, which is ſo conſpicuous among our ſeveral Faculties, ſhews us that it is God's Will, that we ſhould thus reduce our ſelves out of that Ataxy and Conftſſion, into which Sin has brought us, into that excellent Harmony and Serviceableneſs of one Faculty to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of all to the ſupream; that we
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96861:76"/>
ſhould aſſert the Minds Superiority over the Body; and as to what is principal in the Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> the love of what is fit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, that all the reſt ſhould be brought under ſubjection to it.</p>
               <p>I might now proceed to abundance of Particulars, but that they would detain me too long on this Argument. It may be ſufficient to my purpoſe in general, that whoſoever conſiders the various Faculties of Man, and the Order and Reference they have to each other, the many Inclinations, and Appetites, and Capacities of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Operations which do neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily flow from them; and will allow, that the Exerciſe and Perfection of, and keeping due order amongſt theſe natural Faculties, the following theſe Inclinations, and the Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of theſe Appetites, the filling up theſe Capacities, the doing theſe Actions, which neceſſarily follow Nature, are the Will of our Creator, (as they muſt be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he has made things in vain, that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he knew not, or car'd not what he did) From thence he will moſt certainly collect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the Divine Laws, and attain to a moſt clear Knowledg of what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of him.</p>
               <p>If we further conſider the Reference Man has, 1. To God: 2. To other Men. 3. The Order, and Rank, and Relation he is in to Inferiour Animals, and other Beings; we ſhould preſently diſcover what kind of Behaviour becomes him on all theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, <hi>i. e.</hi> what is beſt, and therefore fitteſt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96861:76"/>
for ſuch a one in ſuch Circumſtances to do; and conſequently, what is the Will of the wiſe and good Maker and Governour.</p>
               <p>Thus we have diſcovered God's Will, that we ſhould do good not only from a Conſideration of the Divine Nature, to which Goodneſs is eſſential: But likewiſe from a view of the Nature which he has given us, which is ſo formed, that we can will nothing but what ſeems good. And if we follow our natural Inclinations, and ſeek after the greateſt Perfection of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that will ſeem ſo to us, which indeed is ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A third way whereby the Will of God is notified to us, is the Conſent of Mankind, at leaſt of the generality, and of all the wiſe and good; when they ſhall agree that this ought, and that ought not to be done; we ſhould look on that, about which they are ſo agreed, to be commanded or forbid us by God himſelf.</p>
               <p>It is certain they think ſo, for elſe they could not look on Mankind under Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there being none that has Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to lay Commands on all Men, but God himſelf. But they do look on all Men, as obliged to certain things, as appears by their ſaying, they ought to do ſo or ſo: For this denotes an Obligation, and that a Superiority.</p>
               <p>Now there is none but God who is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to all Men, to Kings as well as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; to Societies as well as to ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96861:77"/>
And yet of all theſe it is agreed, that they ought, or ought not to do ſeveral things.</p>
               <p>Two things ſhould here be ſpoken to: 1. That this Conſent of the Community is and may be looked on, as a Declaration of the Divine Will. 2. An Enumeration of ſome of thoſe things, in which they thus agree.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not likely that Men of ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Capacities, Tempers, Intereſts, Times and Places, ſhould agree in this, if it were not certainly true, and ſomewhat evident. There muſt be ſome one cauſe of this ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Effect, and I know none to which it may ſo probably be imputed as this; that the Wiſdom which formed us, has inſpired us with this Knowledg, which was either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on us at firſt, or elſe our Minds did with an undiſcernable quickneſs infer it.</p>
               <p>That the Wiſe and the Vertuous agree, that every Man ought, that is, in other Words, that it is the Will of God that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man ſhould do this, or not do it; that is a ſufficient Declaration to the reſt of the World, that it is indeed the Will of God. For we may well ſuppoſe Men, ſo qualified, to have this Knowledg vouchſafed to them; and that they are the Perſons to whom God will, eſpecially, make known his Laws.</p>
               <p>But where not only they, but all, or the far greateſt part of Mankind agree with them; this makes the Teſtimony yet ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſhews the Notoriety of the Thing. And that there is a concurrence of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, will appear by the Inſtances which I ſhall produce.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:96861:77"/>
This Conſent will, at leaſt, amount to a high Probability; and thoſe who make leaſt of it, yet muſt think it to outweigh the ſenſe of one, or ſome few: But where it is in concurrence with the other way, it ought to be looked on as a farther publication of the Divine Law, and a confirmation to us that this is it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Community of Men, tho they have never ſeen nor diſcourſed with each other, tho they live at the remoteſt diſtance, and underſtand not one anothers Language, nor ever maintained any Converſe, yet agree in abundance of Particulars: Which I muſt not now enumerate. Take theſe few.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we ſhould all live ſoberly, that is, in ſuch a government of our Appetites, and Paſſions, as to be in the beſt uſe of our Underſtandings, and of all our Faculties; that Men ſhould not indulge their brutiſh life ſo much, at any time, as to loſe the uſe of themſelves; and to have the ſenſe of what is good and evil, fit and unfit, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, or the care of doing what becomes us laid aſide: That what we do in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with our bodily Appetites, be rather a relief than a gratification, that it be not a thing, in which we take a full and final ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, but that it be ſubſervient to ſome greater and better work.</p>
               <p>Tho all Men may not thus expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet theſe are their Thoughts; and tho many practiſe otherwiſe, yet it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the allowance, and againſt the ſenſe of their Minds. Or if any have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96861:78"/>
to ſuch a Reprobacy of Mind, as to call Good Evil, and Evil Good; they are by the reſt looked on as Monſters, and their Judgment is of no value; nay, in their ſober intervals they condemn themſelves. Thus then, not only the Wiſe and the Good, but the reſt of Mankind are of the Mind that Men ſhould live ſoberly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we ſhould be juſt and honeſt, true and faithful in our dealings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation one with other: And that we ſhould do to all Men, as we would have them do to us. Even thoſe Men that are unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, will yet blame that in others, which they practiſe themſelves. And thoſe very Societies, which are Factions, bandying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common Society of Men, are yet upheld by Truth and Juſtice among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

Beſides theſe, I might mention Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to Benefactors, Honour to Parents, Veneration of the Deity, Pity of the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and many more ſuch things: In which all Mankind agree, excepting a very few Monſters, that are uſing all the Arts they can deviſe to un-man and un-make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now, whence can ſo univerſal an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ariſe, but from Nature it ſelf?

IV. God has inſpired ſome holy Men with the knowledg of his Will, which by them has been delivered to others, and it has been made credible to all, that this was indeed the Will of God, and by him in a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner revealed to the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Perſons. And this partly from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity and excellency of the matter contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; partly, from the fitneſs, the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the neceſſary importance, the great goodneſs of it to Men; both which argue it to come from him, who only knows ſuch things, and is the great lover of Mankind. The Phraſe and Stile alſo are ſuch, as do not misbecome ſo wiſe and great an Author. And then the Miracles wrought in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by ſome of the Pen-men, and by others who owned them to be divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired: Particularly the Prophecies and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, which are punctually fulfilled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Such a revelation of the Divine Will we have in the Bible, that part eſpecially which is in the Goſpel, where we have a clear and full declaration, of all that which by Nature, and Reaſon, and the Senſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, we were taught was the Will of God. That which the Wiſe and the Good came to underſtand in thoſe ways; the Unlearned and Inconſidering, and all to whom theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Oracles come, are inſtructed and ſatisfied in by them.</p>
               <p>Thus God has dealt with Men, in the ſame manner that our Earthly Lawgivers have done, that is, he has cauſed his Laws to be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96861:79"/>
Printed, and Publiſhed. And the Bible is the Divine Pandects and Code: 'Tis Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's Statute-Book: 'Tis both the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and Civil, and Canon-Law, whereby God governs his Subjects.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould imagine that becauſe a great part of, or all the Bible was directed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, of ſuch Times and Places, that therefore they were intended for no more; Or, becauſe they were writ in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick and ſtrange Tongue, with which moſt of the World are unacquainted, therefore they muſt not be looked on as a Revelation of the Divine Will to all Men: I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſuch to conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in whatever Language they were writ, the ſame Objection would lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is work for Induſtry, and that which may engage Men in Study, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Learning; and may occaſion Men of one Nation's acquainting themſelves with others, and with the Wiſdom and Cuſtoms of all Places and Times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That what is contained in our Bible, was directed to ſome particular Perſons, this was no more than was fit to procure its Entertainment amongſt them. If it had been ſpoke to all, perhaps none might have minded it, at leaſt not ſo much, as they (probably) would to whom it was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly addreſſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That however ſome few might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concerned in it, and it might have eſpecial reſpect to the Men of one Age and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96861:79"/>
Place, yet this hinders not, but that it might have a farther reference to all that were them, or ſhould be afterwards, in all Nations to whom it ſhould come.</p>
               <p>And tho there might be, and were ſome of the Laws founded on particular Reaſons, which afterwards might ceaſe; yet this takes not off the Obligations of thoſe Laws, which are founded on univerſal and immutable Reaſons, ſuch as belong to all Mankind in all Ages. Where the very ſame reaſon does not continue, yet there is often a Parity, which is ſufficient to lay an Obligation on us. <hi>Exempli Gratiâ,</hi> Tho we may not look on our ſelves as obliged to offer Sacrifices on an Altar to God, by the Hands of a Prieſt, yet we may and ſhould offer up to God of our Subſtance by the Hands of the Poor. And ſo the Law of Sacrifices may ſtill direct, and in ſome ſort bind us. And thus we may make uſe of the abrogated Laws, which were temporary, to direct our ſelves in the Knowledg of what the Will of God is to us, by conſidering Parity of Reaſon, which is the way we take in all Humane Laws.</p>
               <p>This Exception being thus removed, we need not queſtion but the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament contain a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God's Will to us, and all Men.</p>
               <p n="5">V. God teaches Men what his Will is, by ſecret Suggeſtions of his Spirit. 'Tis this, which often ſhews us <hi>the way in which we ſhould go,</hi> which directs us, ſaying, <hi>This is the way, walk in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:96861:80"/>
I believe there is no Man, but one time or other feels himſelf moſt powerfully inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do ſuch or ſuch an Action, which at that time he clearly apprehends to be good: And at other times, he is as forcibly with-held from what by a clear light, he ſees to be evil. And this he cannot reaſonably impute to any other cauſe beſides the Spirit of God. He is not conſcious of any Power within himſelf that can do thus, and there is no other viſible Cauſe of this powerful Influence: So that it may well be aſcribed to the <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This brings to mind ſome of the Divine Precepts which we had forgot, or did not then think of: This diſcovers to us in ſome particular Inſtances, what God would have us do, which in other ways we could not have known.</p>
               <p>Now, this being ſo diſtinguiſhable from the other ways as to the manner, and yet ſo conſiſtent with, and agreeable to them in the matter of the Revelation; we may well conclude, that it's another way in which God diſcovers his Will unto Mankind.</p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly conſidered the five ways in which God makes his Will known unto us: Concerning which ways I will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no Law of God, which is not, in one or more of them, publiſh'd unto us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſome of them, and indeed many, are in all theſe ways to be known by us.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:96861:80"/>
3. Thoſe that are thus many ways decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, are hereby ſignified to be of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to be known and done by us: Therefore was it that the Divine Providence took ſuch care, that they ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe which are notiſied to us, in ſome one way only, <hi>e. g.</hi> the Scriptures, are not contradictory to, nor contradicted by any other that are revealed to us in the other ways. There is no Repugnancy, no Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency betwixt them, but they all exactly harmonize and agree with each other. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thinks otherwiſe, he takes that to be a Command of God, which is not.</p>
               <p>There may be, and is ſomething more revealed in one way than in another; but there is nothing in one, that is repugnant to, that is inconſiſtent with, indeed, that is not agreeable to what is in another.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if we at any time ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Scripture-Revelation in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the unqueſtionable Principles of the Reaſon and Mind of Man, we miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. Theſe are both God's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Will to us, and he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever will do that which is every Man's neceſſary Duty, and greateſt Intereſt to do, that is, ſeek after a perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Will of God concerning Man; he may, by a diligent Exerciſe of himſelf in theſe ways, attain unto it. And whatever Pains he takes in it, I can aſſure him, he will find himſelf well appaid in the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96861:81"/>
Effect of his Labour: For that muſt be great Holineſs of Life, and abundant Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Quiet of Mind.</p>
               <p>If I were to give a Compendium of that which all theſe ways appears to be the Will of God, (and more than a Compendium I muſt not offer at) it ſhould be this, <hi>viz.</hi> the Perfection and good State of all Men.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever either conſiders the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wiſdom of God, or the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Faculties which he has given to all Men, or the Senſe of the wiſeſt and beſt, nay, of all Men, who are in a reſtleſs Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of ſomewhat they often miſtake for their Happineſs; or the holy Scriptures, or the ſecret Motions of the Divine Spirit: He will ſay, that all theſe do centre in, and aim at this; And conſequently ſhew that this is certainly the Will of God.</p>
               <p>And if we be once aſſured in our Minds, that the Goodneſs and Perfection, or beſt State of Man is the Divine Will; we have got a Clue that will direct us through all the Labyrinths of Particulars. And if we have but once form'd true and diſtinct Notion of what our Perfection is, we ſhall then ſee clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what are the Particulars of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, what are the means that are in order to it, and what are the things that oppoſe and hinder it. And in effect, we ſhall be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a right underſtanding of all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Precepts which God has any ways publiſhed to the World, and to a proper uſe of all thoſe Helps which the Divine Wiſdom has afforded us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:96861:81"/>
This is one way, but there are divers others: Every one may take that which beſt ſuits him.</p>
               <p>There is no Man who conſiders, but will confeſs, that the Knowledg of the Will of God, is the moſt excellent and uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg we can have; and that it is a principal Ingredient in, and eſſential to all true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and whoſoever is deſtitute of it, he muſt live like a Fool: For he wants that ſure Direction of his whole Life, which he can only have from the underſtanding of the Divine Will: he wants that Principle, which is powerful enough to determine him.</p>
               <p>He that is ignorant, or miſtaken in this matter, muſt in proportion want Wiſdom and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>And this I think ſufficient to raiſe the price of this Knowledg in every Man's eſteem, to aſſure him that without it he can neither be wiſe, nor live well.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould be particular, I ſhould enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate abundance of Miſchiefs, into which Ignorance or Miſtake of the Will of God, and his Law, betrays us.</p>
               <p>I will only ſay this, That as Ignorance of it pulls up the Floodgates, takes away all Reſtraints, and gives free Paſſage to every vicious Inclination, and unreaſonable Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, ſetting them all looſe: So Error and Miſtake about it lays a kind of Obligation on, and makes it in a ſort neceſſary for us to do ill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:96861:82"/>
For, if any wicked Practice, how mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and miſchievous ſoever it be, come vvith a Commiſſion from Heaven, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Authority of a Divine Law; vve ſhall look on our ſelves as bound to obey: Nay, and the better we are diſpoſed, <hi>i. e.</hi> the more inclined to be obedient to God, the more zealous and carneſt we ſhall be to do this, vvhich vve, by a miſtake, think to be his Will. And if it do, as it certainly vvill, oppoſe ſomething that's in our Nature, and be never ſo contrary to our Inclinations; we ſhall break through all this oppoſition, and do Violence to our Nature, I mean to our Mind, which is the beſt and higheſt thing in us, to do it.</p>
               <p>Nay, tho it ſhould be never ſo prejudicial to the Society in which we live, confound the Order, and diſturb the Peace of it; tho it ſhould be attended with Tumult, and War, and Bloodſhed: yet a falſe Conceit, that it is <hi>the Will of God,</hi> will make us break all Bonds, and nothing will hold us, but we ſhall, like the <hi>Daemoniac</hi> among the Tombs, be hurting our ſelves, and diſturbing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>This is that, which under the Pretence of Religion, to vvhich it is moſt contrary, has wrought ſo much Miſchief in the World. I am ſure the worſt things that have ever been done by Men, have proceeded from their thinking that to be the Divine Will, which vvas not, vvhich vvas moſt oppoſite to it.</p>
               <p>It may be, ſome vvill infer from this kind of Diſcourſe, that God has not made a clear
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96861:82"/>
Diſcovery of his Will to us, becauſe if he had, hovv ſhould Mankind be ſo void of the true Knowledg of it, how could they ſo groſly err about it?</p>
               <p>To this I reply, That God has made it ſo plain what he would have us do, that no Men in the World can be wholly ignorant of it. And there is ſuch a Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Divine Laws, they are ſo uniform, that the Knowledg of one will lead us to the underſtanding of more; and if we will obey thoſe we know, 'tis the ſure way to underſtand more, and by degrees all.</p>
               <p>I ſay all this on Suppoſition, That Men will uſe their Underſtandings, and conſider what is before them: For, if they will not do this, they muſt continue in Ignorance and Error in all Caſes. But as it is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the Sun does not ſhine, becauſe he that winks does not ſee it; no more is it that our Creator has not diſcovered his Mind to us, becauſe they who will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, do not diſcern it, or are deceived about it.</p>
               <p>But, that God has made a clear Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Mind to us is, I hope, out of doubt with us, by what has been ſaid concerning the ways in which he has done it.</p>
               <p>For, whoſoever believes God to be what his own Mind tells him He is, what his Works declare He is, what the common Senſe of Mankind in all Ages report Him to be, <hi>i. e.</hi> Wiſe, and Good, Holy, and Juſt, and True; he cannot be ignorant what it is that God wills him to be: For God cannot but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96861:83"/>
will, that Man ſhould according to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, be like unto Himſelf.</p>
               <p>He that is not wholly ignorant of, or miſtaken in himſelf, cannot but have ſome certain underſtanding of God's Law: For, if he know the Faculties with which he was made, the Order in which they are ſet to each other, the Inclinations and Appetites that are natural to him: he is aſſur'd that the Exerciſe and Perfection of theſe Faculties, the Preſervation of this Order, the purſuit of theſe Inclinations, is the Will of his wiſe and good Creator.</p>
               <p>He that underſtands what it is, that the wiſe and good, nay the generality of Men agree ought to be done; what in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, unprejudic'd, unbiaſs'd Senſe, which is not hard to know: he does hereby diſcover the Will of the Lord of all.</p>
               <p>And this Law is in the Bible writ in moſt legible Characters: All the weighty matters are there ſet down in ſo plain Words, that they are underſtood by all that underſtand the Languages: And by help of that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which God has given Men, are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into their own Native Language.</p>
               <p>As many as have and can underſtand the Language of the Bible, cannot poſſibly be ignorant of, or miſunderſtand the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of Heaven: And the reſt are to be underſtood with relation to them.</p>
               <p>And then over and above all theſe ways, God teaches Man by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>In theſe ſeveral ways I have ſhewn how God diſcovers, and we may come to the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96861:83"/>
Knowledg of his Will. But becauſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all, many continue ignorant, and not a few are miſtaken, thinking that not to be the Will of God which is, and that to be, which is not; and becauſe of the great Miſchiefs that come upon themelves and others through theſe their Errors: Before I diſmiſs this Argument, I will lay down ſome Directions and Cautions, that ſo we may be preſerv'd from ſo baleful an Ignorance, and ſo fatal Errors.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general, as I have intimated, we muſt uſe our Minds, diligently attend to, and carefully conſider, whatever it is that pretends to be the Will of God, and Law of Heaven: Think whether it be agreeable to the Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and the other acknowledged Perfections of God: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſuitable to the Nature he has given you; whether it be matter that falls under common Obſervation, and not only the Wiſe and the Vertuous, but the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mankind think themſelves and all obliged? <hi>To the Law and the Teſtimony; ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> and ſee if they ſay ſo: Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alſo to the Voice within you, whether the ſame be ecchoed to you from that Wind, which you know not <hi>whence it comes, nor whither it goes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor ought you only to examine what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be God's Law, but enquire after his Will in all theſe, and if there be any other ways wherein he manifeſts it to Mankind.</p>
               <p>Let us uſe all Diligence that we may come to a perfect underſtanding of all Divine
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96861:84"/>
Precepts. For, if we be careleſs, liſtleſs, and will not conſider, we can never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. If we could ſuppoſe God ſhould diſcover his Mind much more clearly than he has, yet he that will not regard, that will not attend, nor conſider, can't know.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever therefore would attain to the Knowledg of God's Law, let me intreat him to beware of all things that tend to make him inconſiderate in general; or in particular, regardleſs of God's Will. Two things I would caution you againſt on this account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Senſualities, which depreſs the Mind, and ſink us into Beaſts, inſomuch that by long uſe of our felves in this manner, we ſhall have no more regard to the Law than Brutes have, and ſhall live as they, without Senſe of God, and our Obligation to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All Opinions, and Diſcourſes, and all things that weaken, or any way undermine our Faith of God. Avoid every thing which we obſerve to extinguiſh our Senſe, or but to leſſen our Eſteem and Veneration of the Divine Majeſty. For whatever makes us regardleſs of God, does neceſſarily make us leſs careful to know his Will.</p>
               <p>This leads me to ſome particular Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all which do reſpect the five ways which I have diſcourſed of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of falſe and fooliſh Thoughts of God: For ſuch as we think God to be, ſuch we ſhall think his Laws.</p>
               <p>If we look upon God as a meer Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Humourſome Being, that does now this,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96861:84"/>
now that, as the Humour takes him: that does nothing from a ſteady Principle of Reaſon, nothing that is accountable to and by Wiſdom and Goodneſs; we ſhall think his Laws to be the Determinations of a Will unguided by Underſtanding; a Will that does not determine it ſelf from unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Goodneſs. And this Thought will not only diſcredit his Laws, but make them unknowable by us: For who can find out the Determinations of an arbitrary unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Will, a Will ſeparate from Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And ſuppoſe we could know them, yet it would be very hard to value and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem them.</p>
               <p>Again; If we think God to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like our ſelves, as unwiſe, impure, and unholy, unjuſt, evil, as careleſs of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as we are; what dangerous Miſtakes ſhall we fall into concerning his Laws? For we ſhall then think, that what we will, he wills alſo: And therefore, if we have a Mind to deceive, to injure, and oppreſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or to drown our ſelves in Senſuality and Sottiſhneſs, that God approves of our Injuſtice and Beaſtiality. And indeed what-ever our Heart, our Inclination carries us to, we ſhall conclude that God wills we ſhould do it: For we think him like our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Again; If we think God not to be true, that he deals not ſincerely with us, that that is not his real Will, which he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared is; that however he tells us he vvould have us do ſo, or ſo, yet he indeed wills that vve ſhould do the contrary: This vvill dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96861:85"/>
from our eſteem both of God, and of his Law; It vvill ſeem an Illuſion and Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery.</p>
               <p>Theſe few Inſtances, amongſt many more vvhich might be given, ſhew us how great Reaſon vve have, in order to our knowing his Law, to endeavour after a true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the eſſential immutable Perfections of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>As the true Knowledge of God is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means for our diſcovery of his Will, ſo a falſe Notion of him muſt neceſſarily lead Men into moſt dangerous Miſtakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. And if we make God altogether unknowable by us (as we do, if we ſuppoſe him to act from a Will unguided by Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, ſeparable from Juſtice and Sincerity) we likewiſe make his Will unknowable; for vve deprive our ſelves of not only one, but I think, all the ways vvhereby vve can knovv it. For then neither can vve argue any thing from the Natures he has given us, nor from the Senſe of other Men, no, nor from the Scripture it ſelf: For, if vve ſhould not think that God means as he ſays, the Scripture can aſſure us of nothing: And vvhat heed can in this caſe be given to thoſe Motions vvhich vve aſcribe to God's Spirit?</p>
               <p>Thus one falſe Thought of God makes it impoſſible for us to be certain of vvhat his Will is.</p>
               <p>I might here give abundance of Examples, Modern and Ancient, vvhat ill Effects falſe Conceits of the Divine Nature have had on
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96861:85"/>
the Minds of Men; and hovv by theſe they have been miſled into moſt pernicous Errors concerning their Duty.</p>
               <p>Was not this the Original Cauſe of all the Idolatries and Superſtitions, Impurities; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of all the abominable unnatural Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Heathens; the Phariſees among the Jevvs; and thoſe nominal Chriſtians vvhich are a mixture of both? Did they not all ſpring from hence, that they had unvvorthy, untrue Imaginations of God: But this is obvious to every Obſervation.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Particular: Let every Man that vvould knovv God's Will, take care vvhat Thoughts he entertains of God: For as our Apprehenſions of his Nature are true or falſe, ſuch vvill be our Knovvledg of his Will.

3. Take heed of falſe, inadequate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, Thoughts of your ſelves. The right and true underſtanding of Human Nature, I have ſhew'd, contributes much to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Will of our Creator; becauſe by a Knowledg of our Faculties, of their Perfections ſimply, and of their Order among themſelves, we diſcern what is our end for which we were made, and conſequently what is to be done by us. But then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt beware, that we do not take that to be our Nature, which is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, which is the corruption of it. We muſt not call that a natural, which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Appetite, or Inclination, as every one is, that is immoderate, inordinate, that is deſtructive, or but hurtful to the whole Man, or to the Society, the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of which he is a Member: That is not to be counted natural to Man which is corruptive of Men, this is a falſe Notion. We muſt not look on our ſelves as meerly paſſive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt not take up with inadequate Thoughts of our ſelves, ſo as to take a part for the whole; to think that we are nothing but Body, leads us into Senſuality, and a Study to pleaſe and ſerve the Fleſh. Or on the other hand, to imagine that we are in this State nothing but Soul, will diſpoſe us to neglect the Body; and ſo we ſhall be prone to turn either Brutiſh or Monkiſh.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:96861:86"/>
3. It is not enough that we know our whole ſelves, but we muſt rid our Minds of confuſed Imaginations: For whilſt theſe remain, we do, if not prefer the Body before the Mind, yet equal them, and either ſet the lower Faculties above the higher, or in the ſame Rank: And this, as all Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are, is very pernicious, and therefore not the Will of the Good One.</p>
               <p>For the making all this clear, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a particular Inſtance. Suppoſe a Man perſwaded that it is the Will of his Maker, that he ſhould endeavour his own Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Perfection; So long as he eſteems the Depravation of his Nature, (as, a very vehement Deſire of bodily Pleaſure) to be natural, he will then ſtudy to procure ſuch Delights, he will earneſtly intend them, tho they be indeed the bane of his Pleaſure, and of his very Being.</p>
               <p>This Man, ſo long as he has theſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Thoughts of himſelf, will not look on himſelf as obliged to mind that part, which he conſiders not as part of himſelf: He will not intend the preſervation and perfection of his Mind, whilſt he looks only on his Body as himſelf.</p>
               <p>And if he has confuſed Thoughts of his Nature, not diſtinguiſhing betwixt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine and his Life, nor preferring one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other; as he cannot poſſibly think himſelf bound to preſerve that Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two, which he underſtands not? So whenever the Body is in danger to be deſtroyed, he will apprehend that the Soul
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96861:87"/>
is in the ſame Hazard. And ſo can never willingly ſacrifice his bodily Life, whilſt he thinks it the ſame with the higher Life of the Mind. Nay, 'tis much if the Law of Self-Preſervation does not prevail againſt any other. And how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

3. As I would not in this caſe lean on the Underſtanding of the Wiſe and Vertnous, when they think contrarily to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſo neither would I be concluded from the Opinions of one, or of ſome few, againſt the generality of the Righteous.</p>
               <p n="4">4. See that it be the unfeigned Senſe of their moſt impartial uncorrupted Judgments, which is beſt known by propoſing a matter generally, ſo as that they be not actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it; when no Appetite, nor Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor Cuſtom, does corrupt and bribe them: I mean by this, that we ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Men that are, and when they are moſt free from thoſe things, which too often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate and extinguiſh the Senſe which their Souls have of what is fit, and what is not.</p>
               <p>To this let me add, That we ſhould do well to take notice of the firſt thoughts which Men have of theſe matters; which as they are freeſt and trueſt, ſo commonly they are the moſt inward, and the very ſenſe of their Minds.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons of theſe Cautions will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any one that conſiders them. I need ſay no more but this, to ſhew their neceſſity. That Men have often thought that to be the Senſe of Mankind, which was not, and have been frequently impoſed on under an appearance of Goodneſs, ſo as to think that to be their Duty which they judged was, and were ready to take up every Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which they laid on them, the they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not only more than, but contrary to what God required.</p>

               <p>I would adviſe them to look well, that the pretended Revelation of the Divine Law be in every reſpect worthy of that God, whoſe Authority it boaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="1">1. That the things therein revealed be ſuch as may beſeen the great Author, in the Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, and Holineſs of them, they bear theſe Characters of Divinity; and every one that ſees them, may ſay, theſe are the Laws of the good Creator.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the manner of the Publication may not be unbecoming him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they receive ſome ſuper-human Atteſtation; that ſomething be done, which may convince all conſidering Perſons that they have a Divine Author.</p>
               <p>By theſe things I ſhould detect the Frauds and Forgeries of abundance of Men, who have pretended Inſpiration, and to give us the Laws of Heaven. But to us who have examined the Scripture by theſe Marks, and are perſwaded of their Divinity, I need not inſiſt on theſe matters.</p>
               <p>My Buſineſs is to prevent our miſtaking the ſence of theſe Divine Writings: That
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96861:88"/>
they are abuſed and miſerably wreſted by ſome that receive and rely upon them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted by us. St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, one of the inſpired Writers, complains of ſome that <hi>wreſted St.</hi> Paul'<hi>s Epiſtles to their own deſtruction.</hi> It concerns us therefore to ſee that we have the true ſence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Books. As to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will of God concerning us, let me offer a few Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is nothing in the Bible, to which God obliges us, that is repugnant to the Law of Nature, and the Reaſon of our Mind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He has enjoin'd us nothing, but what is purſuant of the End for which he made us, that is, our Perfection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture does not contradict it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where there are any ſeeming Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies, that Sence is to be taken; 1. Which is moſt plain in it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Moſt agreeable to the Deſign of the Whole, 3. To other plain Places; and, 4. Moſt conſiſtent with the eternal Reaſon of Man's Mind.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As you have Ability and Opportunity, acquaint your ſelves,</p>
               <p n="1">1. With the Scripture-Dialect and Phraſe, the knowledg of which would have kept an ancient Author of Credit, from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting that Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy Heart,</hi> ſo as to infer that we ſhould love nothing elſe. It would alſo have hindred others from arguing, that God does more than permit Sin, becauſe he
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96861:89"/>
is ſaid <hi>to do</hi> thoſe things which are done by Mens Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. With the Cuſtoms to which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures refer, and with thoſe Reaſons on which any of the written Laws are founded: And obſerve the ſame Rules in underſtanding and interpreting theſe, which you uſe in any other humane Writings and Laws: As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Where any of the Precepts aro ſhortly, obſcurely, or figuratively expreſs'd in one place, and in others more largely, properly, and plainly; interpret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the firſt by the latter.</p>
               <p>And take heed of preſſing and ſqueezing Metaphors: As here in this Chapter, <hi>Awake, thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the Dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Light;</hi> no Sence can be made of this, if we ſtrain the Metaphor, <hi>from the Dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Do not make Precepts given to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, general and obligatory to all, where there is not the ſame nor a like Reaſon: But where there is that, reckon that what God by his holy Prophets has ſaid to one, or to a few, he intended it to all.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take heed of imputing thoſe Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions to the Holy Spirit, which are only the Effects of an over-heated Brain, an extravagant Fancy, a deep Melancholy, or ſome ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>I am not of their number, who laugh at all the Illuminations of the <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation;</hi> I cannot reſtrain all that the Scripture ſays of theſe ſecret Teachings,

to the miraculous. Effuſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Man, will aſſure him of the heavenly Irradiations.</p>
               <p>But yet I doubt not that the Enemy of God and Goodneſs, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ppoſes all God's merciful Deſigns to Man and endeavours to defeat them, is hard at work here. And as he has been obſerved to imitate the reſt of the Divine Methods, ſo he is not wanting to reſemble this alſo; and therefore does inject Thoughts, does cauſe unnatural Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the Blond and i Humours, does make uſe of a Melancholy Temper, a wild Imagination, a Time of Paſſion, etc.</p>
               <p>Great Care is to be uſed, that we impute not our own wild Ravings, in the Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the wicked One, to the good and holy Spirit of God: For ſo we ſhall be in danger to think that to be the Will of God, which is moſt contrary to it; as we know many of old, and too many of late have done. I will here very briefly lay down ſome Marks, whereby we may diſcern the one from the other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ordinarily and after the firſt beginning, the Holy Spirit works in us in a manner that is agreeable to our Natures and Tempers, ſuited to our Faculties, and to the Order in which they are ſet. Let us only here diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, as I ſaid before, betwixt Nature, and the Depravation of it: And I doubt not but by Obſervation we may eaſily difference theſe two, for we ſhall diſcover ſomething
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96861:90"/>
violent and unnatural in all the Diabolical: And particularly I would obſerve, whether theiriſe of ſuch thoughts was from the Mind it ſelf, or from the Body, and ſome Motions in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Holy Spirit does co-operate with us, his Teachings are commonly the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of earneſt Prayer, and diligent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. I do not ſay but he alſo prevents our earlieſt Endeavours but as our Saviour has taught us to ask, and ſeek, and knock, and has promiſed that the Spirit ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us; ſoul take this Method to be a good ſign that it is that Holy Spirit, when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I conſider the Opportunity, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his teaching us, and look on it as no improbable Argument that it is he indeed, when there is an apparent need of his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. To help our Infirmities, to lead us when we are in the dark, to farther us when we are at work; and when we are ſeeking the knowledg of his Laws, then to enlighten us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I will obſerue not only the general Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but the preſent Diſpoſition of my Soul, when I ſuppoſe the Spirit teaches me. Holineſs, Purity, Humility, Meekneſs, a calm, an obedient, a loving Spirit, are ſuch Difpoſitions as invite, the Divine Spirit, he loves to viſit, to dwell in ſuch Souls, they are Temples for him! If that be my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Frame, my preſent Diſpoſition, I may reaſonably preſume it is the good Spirit that acts me. But if I be impure and proud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:96861:90"/>
I have reaſon to fear the contrary.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Above all, conſider the thing it ſelf which is ſuggeſted: If that be conſiſtent with what we are by Scripture and other ways taught to be the Divine Will; if it be purſuant of the Deſigns of Goodneſs; if in order to our Perfection, and the good State of God's other Creatures: In ſhort, Is it good? does it become us? will it be benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to us and them? If not, aſſuredly it is not of God, of whom comes all, and only that which is good; who wills all that is, and nothing but what is good.</p>
               <p>To conclude; Endeavour therefore after a true, clear, and full knowledg of what is good for you to do; and then have you got the moſt certain undoubted Mark of what is the Will and Law of Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you. If you once know this, you will not be unwiſe, but <hi>underſtanding what the Will of the Lord is.</hi>

Thus it was in this particular before us, <hi>That the Gentiles ſhould be Fellow-heirs, and of the ſame Body, and Partakers of his Promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſpel.</hi>

But we will not rely upon them, who were ſo highly conceited of themſelves, and their own Privileges, and who treated all other Men with ſo much

            <p>I need not give any further account from the Scriptures of the Condition of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles before Chriſtianity. The Sum of what we have found concerning it, is, that they by long ill uſe of themſelves, had as it were ſo ſeared their Hearts, and made them ſo ſenſleſs, that they were ignorant and <hi>vain in their Imaginations,</hi> and obſcure, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and frequently miſtaken in their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings in general; and more particularly, they were without the Knowledg of the true God, Worſhippers of Idols, and of vicious and wicked Practices, to which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by the Examples of moſt Men. And that they were under the Power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96861:96"/>
and liable to that Puniſhment, which the Divine Juſtice would inflict on them. Very great was the Miſery they lay order at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and they were ſtill liable to, and in danger of more and greater afterwards, and very little were the Probabilities of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from them.</p>
            <p>They were as miſerable as Ignorance and Folly, as Wickedneſs and Vice, as Idolatry and Atheiſm, as the Malice and the Power of the Devil could make them; and then their Miſery muſt be very great. They were Men of vicious Lives, and when this is ſaid, enough is ſaid to ſhew their Miſery; for they that are without Vertue, want the greateſt Good of which Humane Nature is capable: and they that are wicked, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the worſt Evil that can befal a Man in this State; and they are in great danger of all that Miſery to which Man is liable; they are obnoxious to theſe terrible Puniſhments, which the Divine Vengeance will certainly inflict on all wicked Doers: the very Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of which (tho uncertain) did ſo aſtoniſh and amaze them, that it was alone a great Puniſhment, as the Poet excellently deſcribes it.</p>

If the Preſenſions of that Miſery were ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmenting, what will the Miſery it ſelf be? For thoſe are not the Effects of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Imagination, which many times make things greater than we find them, but they are the very Reſults of our Natures, the Diſcoveries which natural Sagacity makes; and Nature doth not deceive us.</p>
            <p>This was the Condition of the Heathen World, and no Poſſibility of eſcaping, but by living well: which how hard was it for them to do, who muſt ſtruggle with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Difficulties, vanquiſh ſo mighty Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before they could forſake their evil Ways, and learn to do well!</p>
            <p>It is true, it was not impoſſible; for God has implanted in Man a Power of <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is inſeparable from his Nature, and to which he has ingaged and inclined him by a <hi>love of Truth,</hi> and <hi>deſire of Good;</hi> which are alſo inſeparable from the Nature of Man.</p>
            <p>Now in whatſoever Condition any Man on Earth is, if he come to conſider impartially and univerſally, he will (through the Grace of God, which is never wanting to him that diligently uſes God's means) in time be recovered out of the worſt State. But alas! how hard is it for him to conſider, who has been long accuſtomed to Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? How eaſily is he diverted from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning this Work? How frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in it? How apt is he to give it over?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:96861:97"/>
Nay, and tho Men did with ſome Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence conſider themſelves and the World; yet how eaſily might they ſlip into Error, and miſtake Good and Evil in divers Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And ſo notwithſtanding that it was not utterly impoſſible for them, through God's Grace aſſiſting, to get out of that woful Condition, in which the Gentiles were; yet it was extreamly difficult: and tho they might get out of Danger, yet they could not be quite out of Fear; for they had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation that God would accept of their Repentance, they had no aſſurance of a future Life; and therefore they muſt <hi>through fear of Death, be all their Life-time ſubject to Bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then we have no Reaſon to queſtion that Account of their Condition, which the Scripture hath given; as that the whole World of Gentiles did <hi>lie in Wickedneſs;</hi> 1 John 5. 19. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate before the wicked One: or was prone to, and ſet upon Miſchief or Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>For a further Confirmation of this, I might appeal to their own Hiſtories, which give an abundant Teſtimony to this ſad Truth. Thoſe that have been converſant in their Writings, cannot but call to Mind two things eſpecially, which are but too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing a Proof, that it was ſo with them as the Scripture hath ſaid. That is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Folly and Wickedneſs of the Gentile Religion, and the abominable Evils which were committed by them in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their Gods.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:96861:97"/>
2. The abſurd Miſtakes and enormous Practices of many of their Philoſophers, who were the wiſeſt and moſt conſidering Men among them.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to give Inſtances of either: and theſe are a great Confirmation of our Belief of what the Scripture hath ſaid. For if their Religion, their very Worſhip be wicked, what can we expect of their other Works, vvhich muſt either be influenced by their Religion or not; if they be, they muſt be wicked, as that vvas: Or, if they be not, yet then they did not live good Lives, becauſe they vvere not religious.</p>
            <p>Again; If the Philoſophers ſo groſly miſcarried, as too many did, what ſhall we think of the ignorant and unconſidering Multitude: <hi>Rom. 1. 20, 21. When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not now ſtand to ſhew the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which the Jews had over the Gentiles, expreſt in theſe following places, <hi>Rom. 9. 4, 5. Who are Iſraelites, to whom pertain the Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the Promiſes, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 2. 17, 18, 19, 20. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. But for our more diſtinct underſtanding of the Condition of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles before they became Chriſtians, we may conſider it in theſe Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> We will take a view of them <hi>ſingly and in themſelves:</hi> and here both their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and their Vertue, their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Practice will be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:96861:98"/>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> We'll alſo ſhew how they ſtood in reference to God. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> How in reference to the Devil. From all which will appear, in what Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were, both as to this preſent, and as to the future Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> With reference to <hi>themſelves,</hi> their <hi>Knowledg</hi> was upon many accounts ſhort and defective. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was not ſo large and extenſive in reſpect of its Object: They were ignorant in very many Particulars, both of God and Themſelves: They underſtood not the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Providence, or the determinate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God concerning the future State of Men: They knew not by what means them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all Men became ſo very bad and miſerable, nor the Terms on which God would deal with them, nor the Way and Method in which they ſhould be recovered. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where their Underſtanding did reach any of theſe things, their Knowledg was very obſcure and inevident, and alſo very wavering and uncertain: They had but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfect Glimmerings and Dawnings of Knowledg: They rather conjectur'd and gueſt, than knew theſe things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They had alſo many groſs Miſtakes, and abſurd Opinions, both concerning God, as to his Nature and Works, as well as concerning the Number of Gods.</p>

It did not reach to many uſeful things: It fell ſhort of ſome that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt neceſſary to be known, in order to Mens living well and vertuouſly: at leaſt they wanted ſome Knowledg which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to the greateſt Perfection of Vertue.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Where it did extend to ſeveral things, yet for want of greater Clearneſs and Certainty, it could not be ſo uſeful to the Guidance of their Practice, as otherwiſe it might. And,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Their Errors and falſe Opinions muſt needs lead them into the ways of Vice and Wickedneſs, at leaſt of Folly and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As their defect of <hi>Knowledg</hi> muſt make them leſs <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>vertuous:</hi> So their <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> would alſo betray them to <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> Actions; That I am next to conſider, their want of <hi>Vertue,</hi> their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in Viciouſneſs.</p>
            <p>We may take the Apoſtles Words in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. in which he gives an account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others, before they became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: <hi>Fooliſh, diſobedient,</hi> (to Governours I ſuppoſe) <hi>deceived, ſerving divers Luſts and Pleaſures, hateful and hating one another, living in Malice and Envy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee another Catalogue of Vices which were too too rife amongſt the unconverted Gentiles, in <hi>Rom. 1. 29, 30, 31, 32. Being filled with all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, Fornication, Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Covetouſneſs, Maliciouſneſs, full of Envy, Murder, Debate, Deceit, Malignity, Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:96861:99"/>
For a Confirmation of this, that theſe were the Practices of the Heathens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtianity, be may be aſſured of it from their own Writers; and not only the Satyriſts, but the Hiſtorians will atteſt it, as any may be ſatisfied, who conſult either the Greek or Roman Writers, where we find frequent Relations of groſs Idolatry, of fenſleſs Superſtition, of moſt ſalvage In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity, of moſt filthy and unnatural Beſtiality.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like were the enormous Crimes of the Pagan World, before the Light of the glorious Goſpel ſcattered theſe Works of Darkneſs, and made them fly before it, as the Shadows of the Night do before the Riſing Sun.</p>
            <p>This may ſuffice concerning the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and what manner of Perſons they were, conſidered in <hi>themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> Let us next conſider how they ſtood in reference to <hi>God:</hi> And we muſt conclude that they were at Enmity with him; by which we muſt not underſtand that God had no Mercy, no Good-will for them, (for this is to contradict the Scripture, and every Mans Senſe, who retains his natural Notions of God) but that God could take no Delight nor <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in them, that they acted in Contrariety and Oppoſition to him, and by this means had eſtranged and ſet themſelves at the fartheſt diſtance from the Emanations of Divine Goodneſs, and out of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96861:99"/>
the way of his Mercy, and had put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in almoſt an Incapacity of receiving Good from him. Nay, as long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the ſame State, they were in an utter Incapacity of thoſe Influences from God, whereby he makes Men happy.</p>
            <p>I muſt add, that they had made themſelves obnoxious to Juſtice, and liable to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which the Holy God had denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the Tranſgreſſors of his Laws. They had offended God, and knew of no Mediator, no Interceſſor, no Sacrifice to make Expiation, no Prieſt to offer it. This was the Condition of the Gentiles with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> If vve alſo add to this, that they were under the Power of the <hi>Devil;</hi> as all that are Rebels againſt God, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their Allegiance to Heaven, muſt be: For, they that are not Subject to God, have Satan for their Governour; for he is the Head of the Apoſtacy from God and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>If we add this to the former Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we may ſeem to have compleated the Miſery of the Gentile State: For, what greater Miſery than to be the Slaves of this Enemy of God and all Goodneſs? This grand Oppoſer of Man's Happineſs? To be <hi>led Captive by him at his Will?</hi> To be dragg'd at the Chariot-Wheels of this inſulting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror? What can be worſe than firſt to execute his malicious Will, and then be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for ſo doing? To be moſt cruelly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96861:100"/>
tormented for obeying thoſe Laws of Sin and Death which he gave them?</p>
            <p>And this was the State of the Pagan World; they worſhipp'd Devils, they received Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles from them, they obey'd them, they were ſubject to their Dominion. This is alſo plainly atteſted by their own Writers. And when the Scripture ſpeaks of their Converſion to Chriſtianity, it expreſſeth it thus; that they were <hi>turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God:</hi> Acts. 26. 18.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid enough, one would think, to ſet forth the miſerable State of us Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-our Converſion: but yet there is one Conſideration more, which exceedingly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates their Wo, and that is, that they are liable to be condemned to the greater and more laſting Miſeries of the future State; thoſe Torments which admit of no Eaſe, and will have no end, which they cannot eſcape except they be <hi>recovered out of this Snare of the Devil,</hi> and become the Servants of God. That is, unleſs they <hi>ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well:</hi> which how hard it was for them to do, we may conclude from the Difficulty that we (who have the many greater Helps, which the Goſpel-Diſpenſation affords us) find in it.</p>
            <p>And beſides, how full of Anxiety and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting Thoughts muſt their Sin and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and their Preſenſions and Boadings of Evil to come, of a deſerved Puniſhment for their Faults, fill them with? Nay, tho they ſhould repent and amend, how uncertain
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96861:100"/>
muſt they be of the Pardon and Favour of God? And therefore how muſt they through <hi>Fear of Death, be all their Life-time ſubject to Bondage?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have very curiouſly given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the firſt Particular, <hi>viz.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Gentiles before Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I now proceed to ſew ſome of the Advantages which the Gentiles have by becoming Chriſtians: And this will appear both in reſpect of <hi>Themſelves,</hi> and in reſpect of <hi>Others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> If we conſider them in themſelves ſingly, their Advantage appears in this, that their Minds are greatly enlightned, their Hearts are throughly purified, their Lives are reformed and amended.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their Minds are enlightned: Their Knowledg is both larger, and clearer, and ſurer than it was; and conſequently far more efficacious and powerful.</p>
            <p>They know the Nature and Condition of Man far better; they are now aſſured of a Spiritual and Immortal Soul which inhabits this Body, which is the far more excellent Part of Man. They have now aſſurance, that they and all Men ſhall live after Death, and that they ſhall be for ever happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, according as they have lived here: If they have lived a Holy and Vertuous Life, they ſhall be brought into a State of endleſs Bliſs: If they have done Evil; if
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96861:101"/>
they have not done Good, that they ſhall fall under unſufferable and perpetual Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>They now underſtand, that the Cauſe of all the Miſeries and Imperfections of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is their <hi>Sin:</hi> That all the Calamities in the World owe their Original to the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of Men.</p>
            <p>They now underſtand the Dangerouſneſs of their Condition, and they are fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their own Impotency and Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; which Acquaintance with themſelves, what a Preparation it is to Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, we ſhall ſee preſently.</p>
            <p>Again; They know now, that God is a Spirit of an Incorporeal Nature, and ſuch as their own Souls are; and that He is but one: The <hi>Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit</hi> being all <hi>one.</hi> That it was <hi>He,</hi> that made the Heavens and the Earth by the Eternal <hi>Word;</hi> and that by his powerful Decree all things are continued, and that his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> doth ſo particularly ſuperintend all things, that not a Sparrow falls to the Ground without his Knowledg and Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And that this <hi>God knows</hi> all things; that he ſearches the Hearts, and ſees the ſecret Works, and the inward Thoughts of all Men: and that he is infinitely <hi>good and kind:</hi> That he is immutably <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Pure:</hi> That he will call Men to <hi>Account for the Deeds they have done in this Body,</hi> and will reward the Good with <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life,</hi> and will adjudg the Wicked to <hi>Everlaſting Woe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:96861:101"/>
They alſo more perfectly underſtand their <hi>Duty,</hi> and the way of Life in which they ſhould walk. They now know that <hi>Spiritual Worſhip</hi> is that which God prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally looks at: and that this is not only to be confined to certain <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> and <hi>Actions;</hi> but that at all Times, and every where God may be worſhipp'd, and that in the whole <hi>Courſe</hi> of our Lives, and in all our Actions, his glorious Perfections may be, and are to be acknowledged: And to him is to be aſcribed his <hi>Excellency</hi> above all, by <hi>Loving,</hi> and <hi>Fearing,</hi> and <hi>Believing,</hi> and <hi>Obeying</hi> Him more than all.</p>
            <p>They know they ought in all their Wants to make their <hi>Supplications</hi> to God; and that they ſhould <hi>praiſe</hi> and be thankful to him, for all the Good they receive.</p>
            <p>They know alſo, that they are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to <hi>God by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that it is by and through him, the Merits of his Life and Death, the Prevailing of his Interceſſion with the Father, that they are accepted.</p>
            <p>They are likewiſe fully inſtructed, that they are to <hi>purify themſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fleſh and Spirit;</hi> that they are to bring into <hi>ſubjection the Body,</hi> and to keep it under: that is, that all the inferior Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Inclinations be kept in a due ſubordination to the Reaſon and <hi>Law of their Minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are now told plainly, That they muſt not only be Juſt, and True, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and Fair in their Dealings with Men;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96861:102"/>
ſo as not to circumvent and cozen; not to deceive and diſappoint, but muſt ſtand to their Word, keep to their Promiſes, make good their Contracts; but that they muſt alſo be compaſſionate and merciful, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and kind, gentle and meek, loving and good to all Men; to Neighbours and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and alſo to Strangers and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; to Enemies as well as Friends: Nor only to the Good, (tho to them prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally) but alſo to the Bad.</p>
            <p>Thus are they inſtructed in their Duty; and they ſee not only what they are to do, but why they ſhould do it. They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand clearly the goodneſs, the fitneſs, the beneficialneſs, the neceſſity of ſuch a Life. They ſee how natural, how reaſonable it is; how juſt it is to live thus, if they reſpect God who requires it, who made and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them, and from whom they receive all Good; who is their undoubted Lord, and perfectly Wiſe and Good, and who will be their Judg.</p>
            <p>They know their dependence on Him, and therefore muſt conclude that they ought to be at His diſpoſe, and be directed and governed by Him. They ſee the manifold Advantages which accrue to them, as well as to others, by ſuch a practice. They feel a preſent Eaſe and Satisfaction, an inward Pleaſure and Delight, ſuch as they take when they do any natural Actions: and they are alſo ſenſible that they are more perfected, that all their Faculties receive now Acceſſions of Strength, and are more
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96861:102"/>
enabled for their ſeveral Functions and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
            <p>Beſides; they perceive, that other Men are the better for their being better; that not only their Families, but the more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Societies of which they are Members, are beneficed by their holy and good Lives.</p>
            <p>And ſince they feel ſo much good in them at preſent, they cannot but earneſtly deſire and hope for that Happineſs which their Minds preſage, and the Goſpel aſſures them, remains for good Men in the future State.</p>
            <p>Furthermore; the Goſpel aſcertains them of the manifeſt danger they run, who do not live thus; they are aſſured that they cannot <hi>inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> that their Doom muſt be, to go away from the Preſence of God into Everlaſting Miſery.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe things in which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are inſtructed when they become Chriſtians, of which they were in their Gentile State either wholly ignorant, or at leaſt very uncertain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And we may well ſuppoſe that where the <hi>Mind</hi> is thus enlightned, the <hi>Heart</hi> will be purified, and the <hi>Life</hi> amended: for Impurity and Wickedneſs, are Works of Darkneſs and Ignorance. And where the Light of a clear and certain Knowledg breaks into the Soul, it muſt needs diſpel all thoſe foggy Miſts, and thoſe Shadows of Darkneſs which had overſpread and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted it: Thoſe Owls and Bats, and thoſe Beaſts of the Forreſt, which went
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96861:103"/>
abroad in the Night of Ignorance, will not ſhew their Heads, now the <hi>Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> hath diſplay'd his Beams in the Soul.</p>
            <p>So that now <hi>the Fleſh is crucified with its Affections and Luſts.</hi> All thoſe wicked Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which rebell'd againſt Reaſon and Conſcience, and rob'd the Soul of its Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and Quiet, are now ſubdued by Chriſt. The Mind does now no longer <hi>ſerve divers Luſts and Pleaſures;</hi> nor is it at the Mercy of thoſe Furies of Revenge, and Malice, and Envy. But in the room of theſe are come Mildneſs and Gentleneſs, Benignity and Mercy, and univerſal Good-Will.</p>
            <p>The Gentile turned Chriſtian, is not now addicted to Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, to Chambering, Wantonneſs, and ſuch-like revelling and riotous Courſes: but he is temperate and chaſte, and keeps theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of bodily Pleaſure within the Bounds which Nature and approved Cuſtom, which Reaſon and Laws, and Religion, have ſet.</p>
            <p>He lives in the conſtant exerciſe of a pure and ſpiritual Religion, and expreſſeth a regard to God in his whole Life, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Divine Perfections, as well as God's Superiority over, and Right to him, by his loving and fearing Him above all, and his conſtant ſtudy to pleaſe Him, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Laws, and imitation of his Works.</p>
            <p>He keeps all his Faculties in that due and natural Order in which God placed them,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96861:103"/>
when Man came firſt out of his hands; that is, the Body is ſubject to the Soul, and the Will is under the conduct of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. He rids himſelf of all irregular Appetites, and diſorderly Paſſions, and ſo walks not in thoſe ways of Senſuality in which brutiſh-Men are found.</p>
            <p>And his Converſation to others is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ſimple, full of Plain-dealing and Honeſty, adorn'd with Mildneſs and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nor hath he any other Deſigns, but thoſe to which he is engaged by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſembled and ſervent Love.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of other Men, the Chriſtian may be ſaid to live a Life of <hi>Love;</hi> for this is that which directs, which ingages him to all he does to them. This is the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Affection, the moſt powerful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Principle of all his Actions.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall not now engage in a particular Diſcourſe of the Goodneſs of a Chriſtian's Life: What hath been ſaid, may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſhew that the Chriſtian's Heart is purified, and his Life reformed; that he is not affected, nor does he <hi>walk as other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> who have not known Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould think that I have ſet his Holineſs too high, (tho I doubt not but many have exemplified all that I have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed) yet ſuppoſe the more common ſort of Chriſtians, who have not yet attained to all this Perfection, only they are earneſtly purſuing and reaching after it, even ſuch do far tranſcend the unchriſtened Heathens. And thoſe of this loweſt Rank of Chriſtians
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96861:104"/>
have great Peace and Qulet of Mind, a thing to which the Ignorant and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Vicious and Wicked amongſt the Heathens muſt be utter Strangers; For the <hi>Wicked,</hi> he is ſo full of guilty Fears, that he <hi>flees when no Man purſues him;</hi> and it is an eternal Truth, that <hi>there is no Peace to the Wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we'll allow ſome of them not to have been wicked, yet we muſt confeſs that their Knowledg was far ſhort of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and all Ignorance and Uncertainty muſt be attended with Fear and Unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the Chriſtian's clear and certain Knowledg of God, and of himſelf, of the Undertaking and Performance of Chriſt, and of his own Duty, and the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath to that, together with his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and honeſt Endeavour to do what is good, muſt lay a ſure Foundation of laſting Peace, and be a Fountain of Pleaſure ever ſpringing up in his Soul.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly conſidered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Gentile in himſelf ſingly: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Man is weak and dependent, and not ſufficient for his own Happineſs, I will now go on to ſhew how it is with him,</p>
            <p>Secondly, In reſpect of other Men: And of,</p>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:96861:104"/>
1. Thoſe that are no Chriſtians, if they have any remainder of Love to Goodneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, will eſteem and reverence that admirable Vertue which they ſee the Chriſtian practiſe: For, his Life being an Exemplification of the Precepts of the Goſpel, muſt needs make every Beholder in love with it. The Chriſtian's univerſal Love, his Good-Will to all Men, muſt conſtrain all Men to love him; and whilſt he is intent on doing good to them, as by his Profeſſion he is obliged, it is not likely that they will do Evil to him.</p>
            <p>I grant, that ſometime this may happen, that Men may <hi>hurt us</hi> whilſt we are <hi>following that which is good;</hi> but this comes to paſs, for the moſt part, through a perſuaſion that ſuch Men are meer Pretenders, and not what they ſeem. And I am ſure it is the likelieſt, and therefore the wiſeſt way we can take to prevent oppoſition and harm from other Men; for no Man will lightly ſet himſelf againſt him who is doing good.</p>
            <p>But if any ſhould think, that this is the way that will lead him into all Sufferings from others; and that if he ceaſe from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, he certainly makes himſelf a Prey; that his Innocence is the white Mark at which the Wicked aim; and that they who are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be wicked themſelves, will be angry at every one that is more righteous than themſelves. Let us ſuppoſe that ſome Men are ſuch Devils as to hate Vertue, and that they are enraged againſt every one that is a Lover of Goodneſs; Yet even in this caſe,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96861:105"/>
Care is taken by the great Governor of his Church, and of the World,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no oppoſition ſhall prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtian Society, but that they ſhall contiuue ſome-where or other in the World, in ſpite of the Malice of Earth and Hell. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That whatſoever any Man ſuffers in and for well-doing, he ſhall receive an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Recompence for it: He ſhall at preſent feel that inward ſatisfaction of Mind, which will make the worſt Condition not only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, but eaſy; and perhaps his very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors will give a teſtimony to his Vertue, and will (at leaſt tacitely) approve that which they puniſh and perſecute. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath ended this Life with Self-ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as well as Honour from all that knew him, and were Lovers of Goodneſs, he ſhall then enter into inconceivable Bliſs, and be filled with <hi>Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This is the Condition of Chriſtians in reſpect of them who are without. Let us now conſider them with reference to thoſe that are within, the Members of the ſame Body, united with them in the ſame Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Men who are of the ſame Inſtitution, and under the ſame Obligations with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Now as there is ſcarce any Society in which Men are, but they receive conſiderable Advantages by it; for they are by this ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from very many Outrages, to which, if they were alone, they muſt neceſſarily be
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96861:105"/>
expoſed; and they, by the mutual Aſſiſtance one of another, have their Wants ſupplied much more conveniently than they could have been, if they had continued by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Inſomuch that it is ſcarce conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that any Society ſhould be ſo bad as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. They are a wretched Company of Men indeed, from whom a Man will fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Wilderneſs, and rather chuſe to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the wild Beaſts, than to aſſociate with them.</p>
            <p>But grant, that a Solitude, a Deſert, may be more deſirable than ſome Societies; yet this cannot be imagined of that which is the beſt Society of the whole World: And ſuch is the Chriſtian Church, to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which, and live in Communion with it, is one of the greateſt Bleſſings that can be given to any Man, becauſe of the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Benefits he is entitled to, and receives by this.</p>
            <p>For, by being one of this Corporation, he is both more obliged and engaged, as well as more aſſiſted and helped to do well, and conſequently to be happy, than he could be if he was alone, or of any other Society. This will be very evident, if we conſider theſe following Particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Profeſſion which every one makes when he becomes a Chriſtian; the Terms on which, and the Rite with which all are firſt admitted to this holy Corporation; and alſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Continuance in it, by
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96861:106"/>
which we underſtand the Quality of the Members of this Body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The large Bounds and vaſt Extent of this Society; the great Numbers of them that have been, and are of it; and the Length of its Duration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Excellency of the Order and Government which is eſtabliſhed in this ſpiritual Polity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The good Laws, that regulate our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Carriage to each other, which are given to all the Members of this Holy Society.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Holy Solemnities, and Sacred Rites, to which every Chriſtian is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the publick Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The proper and wholeſom Diſcipline, which is uſed towards Offenders.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The wiſe and good Counſels, the holy and vertious Examples of the Members of this Society.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like Particulars, if well conſider'd, will make it evident, how much advantage it is likely to be to thoſe who are received into this excellent Society: Let us briefly run over them.</p>
            <p>Firſt; Every Man by his entring into it, profeſſeth he will obſerve the Counſels, obey the Precepts, and follow the Example of Jeſus Chriſt; that is, he engages himſelf to the practice of all Holineſs and Purity, of all Goodneſs and Vertue whatſoever. And whoſoever does not thus, muſt contradict
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96861:106"/>
and bely his Profeſſion, and proclaim him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Hypocrite, which Men are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do.</p>
            <p>The Conditions of Mens being received into the Church, are theſe that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, or which is the ſame in other words, to <hi>repent and believe,</hi> or <hi>obey the Goſpel.</hi> Theſe are the Terms upon which every one is admitted at firſt; and thoſe upon which he continues, is his Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and not only ſo, but alſo his <hi>bringing forth Fruits meet for Repentance: For every Branch that bears not Fruit, is cut off,</hi> ſaith our Saviour.</p>
            <p>Thus then by the very Terms on which I am received into, and continued in this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, I am mightily engaged to an holy and excellent Life. If I do what I have taken upon me to do, I ſhall be a very good Man; and if I be only a Pretender, but make not good my Engagement, if I only pretend to be a Chriſtian, but am none; I am an Hypocrite here, and my Portion ſhall be with Hypocrites hereafter.</p>
            <p>And if other Men will make good their Profeſſion, and perform the Conditions of Chriſtianity, then will manifold Advantages accrue to me from this: For, they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, both by the Commands and Example of our Saviour, to be not only juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, but merciful, and kind, and bountiful to all, but eſpecially to their Fellow-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>And laſtly; To ratify this Engagement and make it more ſolemn, and ſenſible, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96861:107"/>
ſtrong, that common, and eaſy, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ceremony of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or Waſhing, is uſed: which, as it ſignifies to us that inward Purity to which Chriſtianity obliges us, ſo it brings this to our remembrance; as all corporal and ſenſible things do put us in mind of thoſe more ſpiritual, with which they are joined.</p>
            <p>I will not now inſiſt on thoſe ſecret Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and unſeen Graces, which we may upon good grounds believe God vouchſafes to all that uſe his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>The Sum of what I have ſaid under this Particular is, That it is a very great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to be of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Terms on which, and the Rite by which we are received into it, and becauſe of the Profeſſion we and all Men make at our firſt entrance.</p>
            <p>All which lays a great obligation on us all to live good Lives; which if we do, we ſhall be in capacity of receiving, and they in a diſpoſition of doing great Good to us.</p>
            <p>By this we underſtand the Nature and Quality of the Members of the Chriſtian Society, that they are holy, and vertuous, and good Men; for ſuch muſt they be, who are reſolved to obey the Commands, and imitate the Example of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak of that which indeed is, not that which only ſeems to be, the Church of Chriſt, of real, not nominal Chriſtians. I proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:96861:107"/>
Secondly; To a Conſideration of the vaſt Extent and long Duration of this Holy Society. It is ſpread over the face of the whole Earth: for in all places <hi>where</hi> there are Men of this Character and Quality, Men of the truly Chriſtian Temper and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Men that obey the Law of Chriſt, and live as he did; there are the Members of Chriſt's Body: For Chriſt is not a Name, and a Word; nor is Chriſtianity a Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and a Shew only; nor is the Company of the Faithful, Men of an external Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: but <hi>Chriſt is a ſpiritual Head,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is an <hi>inward Principle of Life</hi> and Power; and Chriſtians are not thoſe who have a Form of Knowledg and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the Power.</p>
            <p>They are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are inwardly ſuch; who have not only waſh'd their Fleſh in the Sacred Font, but who have <hi>purified their Hearts,</hi> who have <hi>cleanſed their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from dead Works, to ſerve the Living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And where-ever in the World ſuch Men are, in what places, how remote ſoever, they are of the ſame Body of which Chriſt is Head; and in whatſoever diſtant times they lived, they were of the ſame Society: For, there were alway two great Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or Bodies of Men in the World, and never more: one who obeyed the Laws of God, of whom the <hi>only begotten of the Father,</hi> the Eternal <hi>Word</hi> is the <hi>Head;</hi> the other, who caſt the Laws of God behind
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96861:108"/>
them, and follow their own Luſts, of theſe the Devil, the Prince of Apoſtate Angels, is the Governour.</p>
            <p>So that the Men of this Chriſtian Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Life, in whatever Ages or Places of the World they have lived, or do, or ſhall live, they are of this Society or Church. Nay, it extends it ſelf further, to thoſe in Heaven alſo, <hi>the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect:</hi> They are indeed the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, but they are ſtill of the Church; ſo that of this there ſhall be no end. When we ſhall put off theſe corruptible Bodies, and leave this Earth, and go to Heaven; yet even then and there we ſhall continue in the ſame Society, and be Members of the Body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>From this Conſideration we may infer, What a grand Privilege it is to be of this <hi>truly Catholick Church,</hi> which hath been in all Ages of the World, and which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever; which is not only in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Earth, but in Heaven alſo: For by our being of the ſame Body, we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and diſpoſed to an univerſal Love to all holy and good Men; as Men of the fame Country or Town, are more inclined to love each other, rather than Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>And this is a great Advantage indeed, to have our Love directed aright, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But beſides this, we communicate with the Saints of all Times and Places, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many Benefits upon the account of their Prayers, and their Holineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:96861:108"/>
How many times hath the infinitely good God tranſmitted down his Bleſſings to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Generations, for the ſakes of his <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> and his <hi>Davids,</hi> and the whole World? but eſpecially Men of the ſame Society with them, have fared the better becauſe of them.</p>
            <p>This alſo is conſiderable, That we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated from this Body by any length of Time, or diſtance of Place; where-ever we live, or where-ever we are, if we be of the Chriſtian Spirit and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and <hi>live the Life of Chriſt,</hi> we are of the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> Nay, tho it ſhould happen that we be deprived of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Ordinances,</hi> (provided this be not through our own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ault, our Neglect, or Contempt of the Divine Inſtitutions) we are not in this Caſe deprived of the Inward and Spiritual Influences which we have by our Union with this <hi>Myſtical Body.</hi> For, the Prayers of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> bring Bleſſings upon us, and the Spirit of Chriſt, which enlivens and animates all his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, quickens us, excites and aſſiſts our Endeavours; and that care which our great and good Lord hath of all his Diſciples, reacheth us, and we partake of his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as well as others that are of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; There is ſuch an excellent <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> eſtabliſhed in this Chriſtian Polity, that there is no claſhing nor interfering of oppoſite intereſts; but on the contrary,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96861:109"/>
each part doth aſſiſt other, and is aſſiſted by it, and they all moſt friendly conſpire together, in the beſt manner to promote the welfare of all and every one. There are no Confuſions and Diſorders, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath his Work, his Buſineſs allotted him; and that is according to every Man's <hi>Gifts</hi> and Qualifications; and every Man is required to attend and do that Work which he is ſitted for.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe <hi>Order,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Peace,</hi> cannot be preſerv'd without Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Chriſt hath inſtituted an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Government in his Church,</hi> a Government that is both gentle, and yet ſufficiently ſtrict, for the attaining its Ends, which is the <hi>Common Good.</hi> And herein our Saviour hath ſhewn, that he hath a care of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and therefore hath appointed Officers, <hi>Deacons,</hi> to ſee to the <hi>neceſſities of the Saints;</hi> Men, whoſe Buſineſs it ſhould be to receive the charitable Gifts of ſome, and beſtow them upon the Indigent. But he hath taken eſpecial care of the Soul, and therefore hath appointed others <hi>Presbyters,</hi> whoſe Work this is, to teach and inſtruct, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and perſuade Men to live well, and to adminiſter his Holy Sacraments.</p>
            <p>And he hath ſet <hi>Biſhops</hi> over them, to ſee that they do their Office; and theſe Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors are to ingage, Men by their own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as well as by their Authority.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral Abuſes, and things which are deſtructive of Government; all which our wiſe and good Governor, the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96861:109"/>
Lord Jeſus, hath (as much as can be) by his Inſtitution prevented. They are ſuch ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> of <hi>Office.</hi> This will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring in the greateſt Diſorder imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into any ſtate, if any Man may thruſt himſelf into what Office he pleaſeth: for, mens Ambition will lead them to deſire thoſe things for which they are no way fitted; and divers will be aiming at the ſame, which would therefore bring in Everlaſting Contentions.</p>
            <p>To prevent this, our Saviour hath ſhewn by his own Example, that Men muſt not <hi>take the honour</hi> of ſuch Offices <hi>to themſelves;</hi> and by his Apoſtles hath ſtraitly charged, that none <hi>run before they be ſent.</hi> And therefore they did, in the firſt times of Chriſtianity (which hath been continued ever ſince) ſolemnly <hi>Ordai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and ſet apart, Men by <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Impoſition of Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But leſt they ſhould authorize Men, that were not fit for that Employment, we have, in ſeveral places of the inſpired Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; the Qualifications and Characters of thoſe Men who ſhould be commiſſioned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they may not affect a boundleſs <hi>Abſoluteneſs;</hi> he hath declared to them and others, that he is Supream, that they are all ſubject to him; and that therefore we are to <hi>call no Man Maſter on Earth:</hi> That is, own none here to be Abſolute and Supream; account none to have <hi>Dominion ever our
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96861:110"/>
Faith.</hi> They are all under <hi>Chriſt,</hi> tho they be above us, and muſt be accountable to him. Nay, they muſt be owned and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, no farther than they act in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Another great Abuſe of Government is, <hi>Arbitrarineſs,</hi> by which I mean a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, unreaſonable, unaccountable impoſing on their Subjects; which if it happen to be of ſuch things as are grievous and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and againſt all natural Equity, it is then Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour hath done much to prevent this alſo: for, himſelf hath given all thoſe Laws which are Fundamental and Eſſential, and hath left them on Record: So that Men can add none, but ſuch as are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial about Time or Place, or ſome ſuch things: and theſe alſo muſt not oppoſe and thwart, but be in ſubordination to thoſe Laws which our Supream Lord himſelf hath enacted. And,</p>
            <p n="5">5. By this he hath alſo prevented thoſe many <hi>Innovations</hi> which probably muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have been; than which, perhaps, there is not a worſe Peſt to any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But in the Chriſtian Inſtitution, how are all probable Pretences of Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cut off? The Laws of Chriſt muſt not be repealed, but continue in force for ever; and they were found ſufficient to direct and regulate the Chriſtians Practice, in thoſe firſt Times when they lived beſt; and the Church was in the moſt flouriſhing, tho in the moſt perſecuted Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:96861:110"/>
I believe, all that have conſulted Hiſtory will atteſt this, That whatever Innovations have been made in the Chriſtian Church, ſince the very firſt eſtabliſhment of it, have been very hurtful and miſchievous.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As this <hi>Spiritual Government</hi> doth not croſs its own Ends, nor is inconſiſtent with it ſelf; ſo neither doth it interfere with the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Secular Government:</hi> but they may and do conſpire together, to promote the welfare and good State, both of the Souls and Bodies of Men; as well in reſpect of this Life, as that to come.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Great care is taken, that the <hi>Officers</hi> diſcharge their <hi>Truſts,</hi> and perform the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Places: for, glorious Rewards are propoſed and promis'd to them, that <hi>ſhall convert Sinners from the Error of their Ways,</hi> Dan. 12. 3. And terrible are the Threats denounced againſt thoſe that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their Duty, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18. So that if reaſonable Hopes and Fears will ingage Men to their Duty, our Saviour hath taken care to do it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A Charge is laid upon the <hi>People,</hi> that they <hi>obey</hi> thoſe that are ſet over them, <hi>Heb. 3. 17, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I proceed to conſider thoſe other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which a Chriſtian receives by being a <hi>Member of the Church of Chriſt,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Society of Chriſtians. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mentioned three; The</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:96861:111"/>
Fourth is, The excellently good <hi>Laws</hi> by which this Polity is to be governed. This will be evinced by conſidering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Perſons</hi> to whom the <hi>Chriſtian Laws</hi> are given; and they are All thoſe to whom they are or may be known: but they who are actually and immediatly obliged by them, are All that have given up their Names to Chriſt; whether they be high or low, rich or poor, learned or ignorant, old or young. In whatſoever condition any Man is, if he call himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he is under the <hi>Law of Chriſt.</hi> None of the Society are exempted, neither St. <hi>Peter</hi> nor his Succeſſors, nor whoever they be that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to themſelves the higheſt place in the Church, can plead they are not under Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the <hi>Laws,</hi> which require all Men to <hi>live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily.</hi> They cannot make themſelves Superiors to the <hi>Laws of Humility</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> of <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> of <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> of <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> of <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> Theſe and the reſt of the <hi>Chriſtian Laws,</hi> lay an Obligation on every Member of the Chriſtian Church to obey them.</p>
            <p>And this is a great Security to Men of the ſame Society, that all the Members of it are ſubject to the ſame Laws with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. None can plead an Exemption from, nor look on themſelves as Superiors to the Laws of the Society. They are not the Makers of thoſe Laws, and therefore can neither diſpenſe with themſelves nor others,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96861:111"/>
for the breach of them: for, none that hath a leſs Power than that by which any Law was made, can controle it; and he that takes this upon him, aſſumes to himſelf a Power which belongs not to him.</p>
            <p>Thus then we that are Chriſtians, are all under the ſame Chriſtian Laws; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth not obey it, is ſelf-convicted, and a confeſs'd Criminal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he muſt own himſelf a Tranſgreſſor of the Laws of that Society of which he is.</p>
            <p>But beſides the Laws which oblige Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in common, there are thoſe which are given to Men, in thoſe different Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Conditions, in which they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther antecedentally to, and independently on their being Chriſtians, or conſequently to this: That is, both Husbands and Wives, Fathers and Children, Maſters and Servants, and all Subjects, as well as ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Governors and Teachers, and thoſe that are under them, and taught by them. All thoſe, nay and in all varieties of Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which Men uſually are, they have Laws peculiar to that Relation or Condition in which they are.</p>
            <p>There is ſcarce any particular Caſe can happen to any Man, in which the <hi>Law of Chriſt</hi> doth not direct him how to behave himſelf. And this leads us to another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which commends the Law of Chriſt, ſo that it is a great privilege to be in that Society which is under it; that is,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:96861:112"/>
2. The <hi>Matter</hi> about which it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, which is no leſs than all the <hi>Faculties</hi> and Powers of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> all the Works and Actions which Man does, not only the outward, but the inward, thoſe of the Soul, as well as thoſe of the Body; his Affections and Deſires, his Diſcourſes and Thoughts are regulated by this <hi>Law,</hi> as well as his Words and external Acts.</p>
            <p>Under the former Particular, I ſaid, All Men to whom this <hi>Law</hi> is publiſh'd, were obliged by it; and in this, I ſay, That all that is in Man, is under its Government. It regulates all our Thoughts of, and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to, and carriage towards God.</p>
            <p>We are all required to love God with all our Heart, to fear him above all; to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to all his Diſpenſations chearfully; and in all we do, to refer to him principally.</p>
            <p>In reference to each other, every Man is bound to be juſt and honeſt to all; nay; to be good and charitable to every; other Man; to hurt, to injure none; neither to ſpeak evil of, nor do evil to any Man; to be kind to Friends, and to forgive Enemies; not to be angry with any raſhly.</p>
            <p>I muſt not deſcend to Particulars but this I may ſay in general, That the Laws of Chriſtianity regulate all our; Affections and Actions toward one another, in ſuch ſort, that they engage us to do no kind of Evil to any one, but all manner of Good to every one in particular; as far as that can conſiſt with the common Good of all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:96861:112"/>
And this the Chriſtian Law doth conſider ſo particularly, and ſo fully and perfectly, that there is no room for, no need of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. Here is no Defect to be ſupplied by Equity. It is not ſo general, that it does not deſcend to Particular Inſtances. There is no Neceſſity of new Laws to be added, or a Diſpenſation from thoſe that are already. As there is the great Juſtice, ſo the greateſt Equity in the Laws of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, I alſo infer theſe two great Commendations of the Laws of Chriſt from what I have ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That care is taken by them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the <hi>ſecret</hi> commiſſion of thoſe Faults whereby one might hurt another. Tho humane Laws and Courts may never take cognizance of ſome Crimes; and if they do, may not condemn them; yet the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Law</hi> obliges in ſuch Caſes to forbear thoſe Practices whereby we might prejudice our Brethren. We muſt not harm another, tho no Man does ſee, or can ever diſcover us. And we are injoined to do thoſe good Offices to others, to which we are not tied by any humane Authority.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The very <hi>Principles</hi> of all Good and Evil, Practices to our Neighbours, are the Matter of the <hi>Chriſtian Law:</hi> For, thoſe Affections, nay, the very firſt Motions and Thoughts, that lead to do them Evil, are reſtrain'd, and (as far as they can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to fall under our Liberty) forbid. And therefore not only Murder, but Hatred, and Malice, and Envy, yea, unjuſt Anger,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96861:113"/>
and even Uncharitableneſs, are forbidden: and whoſoever allows himſelf in ſuch evil Affections as theſe, tranſgreſſes the Law of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>All thoſe immoderate and unreaſonable Appetites and Deſires of Honours, and Riches, and Pleaſures, which are the Springs of all Injuſtice and Injuries to our Brethren, are prohibited, and as much as may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and cut off by the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is not in Humane Laws, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take ſuch an effectual Courſe to prevent the ſecret Practices of Miſchief: and they do not ſo much as pretend to command or forbid Mens inward Thoughts and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us conſider the End at which the <hi>Chriſtian Law</hi> aims: That is in general, ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately the Perfection and Happineſs of all Men; but more eſpecially and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, the Perfection of Vertue and Holineſs in them who obey it. Which will be eaſily underſtood by this, That this <hi>Law</hi> directs and ingages to all vertuous and good Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. As many as are obedient to it, have, by doing well, attained an excellent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and are from this <hi>New Nature</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, conſtantly and ſtrongly inclin'd to do well. So that now they act from an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principle,</hi> from a <hi>Nature,</hi> a <hi>Life;</hi> and by this means they are fill'd with <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi> And being now in a diſpoſition to uſe themſelves, and what they have, to the beſt and the wiſeſt Purpoſes; that is, for the Perfection of all God's Creatures,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96861:113"/>
and thereby for the Service, and Pleaſure, and Honour of God himſelf, they are in the likelieſt way, and have taken the beſt courſe to receive more outward Advantages and Acceſſions of Power from him, who is alway deſigning and doing the greateſt Good; and whoſe uſual Method is, to give to them who improve what they have. And ſo all other Perfections, and what-ever elſe is requiſite to compleat the greateſt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of which Humane Nature is capable, may well be expected to follow Perfection of Holineſs.</p>
            <p>But then beſides, as to other Men; ſee how their good State is alſo conſequent on the Holineſs of them who obey the Goſpel. For, according as they attain to more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, they are by their very Natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, as well as ingaged by particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, to communicate their good things to their Brethren; and when themſelves are become Vertuous, to be diligent and reſtleſs in their Endeavours, to make other Men ſo too: and conſequently to do them all the good Office, in all kinds, which are in their Power.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly ſhewed, That the <hi>End of the Commandment,</hi> or Goſpel-Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is the doing good to one another, and to all Men, by ſhewing how it effects this, and brings it to paſs.</p>
            <p>And is not this an admirable Advantage, to be of a Society;</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Where the Law does not, as the Laws of too many Societies do, intend the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96861:114"/>
and Miſchief, if not to the moſt, yet to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many?</p>
            <p>Nor (2.) where it does not only aim at ſome petty, inconſiderable, inferior Good, which is only good in a Subordination and Subſervienty to ſome higher, which is the Caſe of the Laws of all Civil Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>But (3.) it aims at the greateſt, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and beſt Good; and not only of the Generality, but of all and every one that are Members of this Society, nay, and of every Man in the World: Not only the preſent temporary; but alſo, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, the future and everlaſting Happineſs of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us conſider the <hi>Authority,</hi> which is no leſs than that of the <hi>Soveraign Lord</hi> of Men and Angels. It is no petty and controla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor yet an unjuſt and uſurped Power, by which this Law is enacted. It is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Impotence, or Folly, or Madneſs; nor is it the Effect of the greateſt, wiſeſt, and juſteſt earthly Powers: but it is the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Heaven, the Counſel of the infinite Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, and Power which made, and now upholds the World.</p>
            <p>All which manifeſtly appears from the Harmony of this <hi>Law,</hi> with the <hi>Principles</hi> of our <hi>Nature</hi> and Creation; and alſo from the direct tendency it hath to the Perfection and Happineſs of Mankind. For which Reaſons, we cannot but think it a Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Maker and Preſerver of Man, the infinitely good God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:96861:114"/>
And beſides; this Law was ſo atteſted with mighty Wonders and Miracles, ſuch as by their Goodneſs and Greatneſs proclaimed their Author.</p>
            <p>Now a Law, enacted by ſuch an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, muſt neceſſarily come with a great Force upon the Minds of them that are ſubject: For, if the Command of a King come with Power, How unreſiſtible muſt we think the Commands of God himſelf? How will it engage every one to Obedience? And then, how happy muſt they needs be, who live in a Society where the Laws of God are ſo carefully obſerved?</p>
            <p>There are few Societies in the World ſo ill beſted with Laws, but that if they be obey'd out of reverence to the Authority that made them, the Members of it will be in a good State. How much more muſt it be ſo here, where the Laws have ſuch an immediate and direct tendency, to make thoſe that obſerve them perfect and happy? where they do ſo ſtraitly injoin a mutual care of, and love to one another?</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Sanction</hi> on which our <hi>Chriſtian Law</hi> is eſtabliſhed, is next to be conſidered. By this I underſtand (as all do) thoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> which are promis'd and threatned, whereby the <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> of Men are excited, and they by them engaged to Obedience, and deterr'd from the Tranſgreſſion of the Laws?</p>
            <p>This ſeems to me as a <hi>Reſerue,</hi> which wiſe Law-givers have for fooliſh, and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and degenerate Man. For, whilſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96861:115"/>
Men are Wiſe and Good, they will diſcover the Good at which the Law aims, and that will be ſufficient to move them to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: as well it may, for this contains not only their own, but alſo their Brethrens good State. But when they are grown ſo fooliſh, as not to ſee what the Law intends, or ſo wicked as not to regard it, at leaſt ſo unnatural as to mind none but themſelves, then comes in the Supplement of the <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which propounds and promiſes great Rewards to the Obedient: and if they be ſunk ſo low, as not to deſire to better their Condition, or at leaſt not much to deſire it, then they are preſented and menaced with Evils to awaken and alarm their Fears; which ſeems the laſt hold that can be taken of Man, to bring him to a good State. And it is the Principle which is moſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in the worſt and moſt degenerace of Men.</p>
            <p>Now what greater or better <hi>Promiſes</hi> can be made, than thoſe which in the Goſpel are given us, to encourage our Obedience? For, we are aſſured, that if we <hi>patiently continue in well-doing,</hi> we ſhall receive the <hi>pardon of Sin;</hi> and not only that, but alſo <hi>Eternal Life</hi> and <hi>Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what more terrible <hi>Threats</hi> can be made, than thoſe which are denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all <hi>ungodly and unrighteous</hi> Men, that <hi>obey not the Goſpel of Chriſt?</hi> For it is ſaid, That they <hi>ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his Power,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:96861:115"/>
6. And laſtly; as to the <hi>publication</hi> of thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> (which is alſo neceſſary to make them obligatory) this is ſo plain, and they are ſo knowable and eaſy, that not only the Wiſe and Conſidering, but the Raſh and the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may underſtand, both what the Laws require, and of whom; and what is their End, and who their Author; and what will be conſequent on the obſervance or violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever is capable of the plaineſt <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and will believe the moſt unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Tradition;</hi> whoever obſerves <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and is acquainted with his own <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> and <hi>Inclinations,</hi> or will be concluded by <hi>Experience,</hi> he will be fully reſolved that theſe are the <hi>Laws of the Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and that they intend the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church;</hi> nay, of the whole <hi>World</hi> of Mankind; and that they have <hi>God</hi> for their <hi>Author,</hi> and are eſtabliſhed on ſo firm a <hi>Sanction.</hi> He cannot doubt this; Men of little and low Underſtanding, may be very ſure of all this, it comes with ſo clear an Evidence. And if they have any aſſurance, it will conſtrain them to Obedience: and if it hath this Effect, How happy muſt that Society be, where they all conſpire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make themſelves, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all Men, as happy as they can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly?</p>
            <p>O how pleaſant a ſight is this, to ſee Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren thus united, to ſee every Man loving every one as his Brother, nay, as himſelf? But how bleſſed a thing is it, not only to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96861:116"/>
behold this, but to partake of it, to be one of that loving Corporation, where every Member is touched with a ſenſe of the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the others, and altogether do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to promote each others Good and Welfare?</p>
            <p>This is the State of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> in reſpect of its <hi>Laws.</hi> How much better than either the Gentile or the Jewiſh? Nay, how much better are our <hi>Laws</hi> than our <hi>Lives?</hi> Our Laws are far more excellent than any that have ever been in the World; but our Lives, I doubt, are not better; nay, I wiſh they be not worſe than others. If the Laws be good, we ſhould, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may live well if we will, and it is our fault if we do not.</p>
            <p>Here I might compare the Jewiſh and the Gentile Laws with the Chriſtian, not only thoſe Doctrine, of the Rabbies, and the Laws of the famous Law-makers amongſt the Heathens, but even the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſhew how far ſhort they were of the Law of Chriſt: But I ſhall not enter on this Argument now.</p>
            <p>See our Saviour's Law, in the <hi>5th, 6th,</hi> and <hi>7th</hi> Chapters of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and other places of the Goſpel; and the ends of moſt of the Epiſtles.</p>
            <p>Fifthly; I proceed briefly to the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> which is appointed to be uſed in the <hi>Church</hi> toward Offenders. This we have ſet down <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17, 21, 22. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 3, 4.
<q>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:96861:116"/>
If thy Brother ſin againſt thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We are not to underſtand this of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry petty trivial Offence, (for ſuch as theſe muſt be pardoned of courſe) but of ſome greater and more hainous Fault and Injury perhaps.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor is this to be reſtrained to Sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelves, ſo as to exclude thoſe that are committed againſt other Men, or againſt God. The Sins againſt God, are againſt all Men. This premiſed; 1. Thou art to go to the Offender alone, and privately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thee and him, tell him his Fault: and if he own it, and confeſs, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further. If he do not receive thy Admonition, then, 2. take one or two more. And if he reject their Reproof alſo; then, 3. <hi>tell the Church:</hi> Make it known to the Governor of the Society, and let him in the publick. Aſſembly admoniſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him. But if he ſtill perſiſt obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Crimes, then let him be to thee as an <hi>Heathen,</hi> as one that is ſhut out of the Society.</p>
            <p>And our Saviour hath determin'd, That as often as he repents, he muſt be forgiven, <hi>Mat. 18. 22. Luke</hi> 17. 4.</p>
            <p>We find the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> according to this Rule of our Saviour, giving directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 2 Epiſt. 3. <hi>v. 6, 14. To withdraw from thoſe Brethren that walk diſorderly; i. e.</hi> from thoſe, the courſe of whoſe Life is ſuch. And this may ſuppoſe, that the other former Methods have been
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96861:117"/>
uſed. And <hi>not to converſe with ſuch an one, that he may be aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Cor. 5. 5. <hi>To deliver an inceſtuous Perſon up to Satan.</hi> That is, to caſt him out of the <hi>Church;</hi> and ſo he muſt fall under the Power of the <hi>Devil,</hi> under whoſe Dominion all they were ſuppoſed to be, who were not in the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> and he then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed his Power over them, inflicting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Diſeaſes on them, even <hi>to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>If any that is called a Brother, be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Reviler, or a Drunkard, or an Extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not to keep Company, nor to eat with ſuch an one,</hi> either in Civil or Sacred Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
            <p>From theſe and the like Paſſages of Scripture, we may obſerve, That the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> preſcrib'd to be uſed in the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> is highly commendable, in that it inflicts Puniſhments</p>
            <p n="1">1. That are proper and very naturally conſequent on the Offence: for, ſo it is, to <hi>withdraw from the Company</hi> of one that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to me or others; and to put him out of the <hi>Church,</hi> that <hi>will not hear the Church; to deliver him up to Satan, that will not have Chriſt to rule over him.</hi> Men that thus offend, do, as it were, by their very Offences, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute theſe Puniſhments on themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Penalties are very Humane, ſuch as will chiefly work on Men's Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Modeſty, and do ſuppoſe their
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96861:117"/>
Love to Vertue, and Senſe of Religion, and Value for the Chriſtian Inſtitution: <hi>To admoniſh, to withdraw from, to account him as an Heathen;</hi> to ſhut him out of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed there followed upon this, <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> but theſe were inſtructive, and by ſuch Puniſhments, greater might be, and were prevented.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They were as gentle and eaſy as could be inflicted; no more than Neceſſity, and the Nature of the Crime extorted. They were gradual. And yet,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sufficiently ſevere; that if a Man had any Senſe of Goodneſs, they muſt reclaim him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Yet even the moſt ſevere were very charitable. They were not inflicted to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy Revenge and Malice; but in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Love, and to carry on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igns of Charity.—<hi>That the Spirit may be ſaved; and thou haſt gain'd thy Brother.</hi> No other end.</p>
            <p>Sixthly; The Holy <hi>Solemnities</hi> and Sacred <hi>Rites</hi> (to which every one, as a Chriſtian, is admitted in the publick Aſſemblies) are ſuch as are inſtructive to thoſe that uſe them; as well as full of Argument, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to the practice of Vertue; and they have a manifeſt aim and tendency, to make all that are admitted to them truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious toward God, and to unite them in Love to each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:96861:118"/>
Beſides; we may well ſuppoſe the Divine Bleſſing and Influence on theſe his own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Ordinances;</hi> and that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more good by them, than is naturally conſequent on the uſe of them.</p>
            <p>I may refer them to theſe three Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Praying to God.</item>
               <item>2. Hearing his Word.</item>
               <item>3. The Sacraments.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Prayer</hi> is one of the firſt and moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural of thoſe Acknowledgments we make to God. And there is no holy good Man, that is not frequent in this: For, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his dependance on God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſupplicates; he knows his own Guilt, and therefore confeſſeth; he underſtands his own Inability, and God's Power and Readineſs to help others, and therefore he intercedes; and upon the receipt of any Good, he gives Thanks: and by all he praiſes and glorifies the great Power and Wiſdom, the Goodneſs and Holineſs of God. He owns him to be the Great and Good God, on whom all depend; and who governs the Worlds, and is the Author of all that Good which we or others enjoy; that he hath Right to our Obedience, and may require of, and do with us what he will.</p>
            <p>All this we aſcribe to God by our Prayers and Praiſes, by our Confeſſions of our Faults, and Interceſſions for our Brethren.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96861:118"/>
This is a piece of Worſhip ſo due to God, that we may not alienate it from him; it is an incommunicable Honour, which muſt not be given to any of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>This is ſo juſt, and ſo fit a thing, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one is naturally inclined to, and can hardly be with-held from it: Rather than not do it at all, they will pay this Homage where it is not due, and pray to Stocks and Stones, or to Men, that cannot hear, nor help them.</p>
            <p>All which ſhews that we have a ſecret ſenſe of our Dependance on God, and our Obnoxiouſneſs to him, and of his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This is inherent in us, and we cannot but know it: and if we would carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and trace this Inclination, it would lead us to the knowledg of God, and we ſhould eaſily infer that he muſt be powerful, and wiſe, and good, and holy.</p>
            <p>Now tho no good Man can be with-held from frequently addreſſing himſelf to God in this manner, (for his Mind will ſilently ejaculate his good thoughts of God, and his holy Fervors will aſcend up to Heaven, like the Fumes of ſweet Incenſe; and he hath alſo his conſtant Times of <hi>entring into his Cloſet, and ſhutting his Door,</hi> and there pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out his very Soul before <hi>Him that ſees in ſecret, and will reward openly)</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, his great Humility in himſelf, and Charity to others, and Deſire of God's Glory, make him to ſet a great value on the <hi>Publick Prayers;</hi> and it is, and ought to be a thing of great account, to join with the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96861:119"/>
               <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in Prayer and Thankſgiving to God. When a Man confeſſeth his own and his Brethrens Faults thus publickly, it muſt neceſſarily lay an Engagement on him for the future, to be careful to prevent the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the ſame, or the Commiſſion of any others, by himſelf, or his Brethren who join with him. His Interceſſion for others, and theirs for him, doth both ſuppoſe, and will increaſe their mutual Love and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>But all thoſe Acknowledgements of the Divine Goodneſs, which are made in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>publick</hi> Prayers and Praiſes of the holy <hi>Congregation,</hi> as they proceed from true and right thoughts of God, and becoming Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards him; ſo they tend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and increaſe their Knowledg and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and will have a mighty Influence on their Love and Good-will to each other. For, whilſt they pray and give thanks for one another, they are in the greateſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and higheſt expreſſion of their Love to one another, that can be; and by this they engage themſelves to uſe their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to do all good Offices for, and to make one another as happy as they can: For they that pray to God for the greateſt Bleſſings of Heaven upon their Brethren, will not fail to do all they can toward the procuring of that Happineſs for them, which in their Prayers they have deſired of God.</p>
            <p>And whoſoever he be, that joins with the Publick Aſſemblie in Prayers for all the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96861:119"/>
Congregation, but in private oppoſeth the Welfare and good Eſtate of any, or that doth not conſtantly and heartily endeavour it; he proclaims to the World that he is an Hypocrite, that he goes about to mock God, and to cheat the World, in that he pretends to pray for the Welfare, but acts for the Ruine of his Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Again; the joining together in the ſame Religious Worſhip, the doing the ſame Actions, tends greatly to Love and Unity; eſpecially when by this we diſcover our ſelves to have the ſame De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ires and Deſigns, as Men that pray together do.</p>
            <p>Beſides, a Man may reaſonably expect to receive greater Benefits on the account of the united Prayers of many, than of his own ſingle ones: and therefore our Saviour hath made the Promiſe to <hi>two or three met,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing together to ask any thing.</p>
            <p>It is on this conſideration, that an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chriſtian relies ſo much on the <hi>Prayers of the Church;</hi> and even when he is in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, he is comforted with the thoughts, that the Prayers of the whole <hi>Catholick Church</hi> are made to God on his behalf.</p>
            <p>And this I heartily with they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, who make ſo ſmall account of thoſe good Prayers, which are the <hi>Common-Prayers of our whole Church,</hi> and are uſed by all the Members of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hearing the Word</hi> of God frequently <hi>read;</hi> and ſometimes <hi>expo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ded.</hi> But is this ſuch an Advantage? Yes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urely. Two ſorts of Men will look on it as a great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96861:120"/>
only to have the Word of God read to them: 1. Thoſe that cannot read it themſelves. 2. They who have it not in a known Tongue.</p>
            <p>And hence it was, that in the beginning of the Reformation here in <hi>England,</hi> when it was firſt order'd that the Bible ſhould be read in Engliſh in the Congregation, that the People flock'd ſo very much to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Tho this is a thing now deſpiſed, and Men make no account of coming into Church till after the Chapters, as if it was nothing to have the Word of God read, by one whoſe Office it is to proclaim the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Counſel.</p>
            <p>But if any will pretend, that he can read the Bible as well at home, and it is all one to have it read by one of his own Family, as by Chriſt's Miniſter and Officer: I will only ſay this, That the ſacred Place, and the Time ſet apart for this thing, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of others, may all contribute to his greater attendance to, and better obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. <hi>Mirum Judicium oritur ex aliorum praeſentia.</hi> And when I ſee many others hearkning to the Word read, it will excite my Attention, and thereby help my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>I need not put you in mind, that care hath been taken in ſelecting thoſe Portions of Scripture to be publickly read, which are moſt eaſy to be underſtood, and moſt uſeful and neceſſary to be remembred and practiſed.</p>
            <p>But if a Man ſhould perſuade himſelf, that no Benefit will come to him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96861:120"/>
to the Orders of the Church, in coming to the publick Aſſembly to hear the Word of God read; yet he ought to do this, for the ſake of that <hi>Society</hi> of which he is a Member, and for the ſakes of the Ignorant, who by their attendance on the publick reading of the Word, will proclaim to the World that they are the only igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Perſons, if none elſe will come to hear it: And the Shame of this may make them abſent themſelves too, becauſe they would not be look'd upon as ſo altogether, and only without underſtanding. Therefore to encourage and keep them in countenance, even ſuch as can themſelves read, ſhould come to Church to hear the Scriptures read, tho there are other Reaſons to move them to this.</p>
            <p>But beſides the bare reading, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>Expounding</hi> of the <hi>Word of God</hi> in the Publick Congregations, and it is applied to particular Caſes: For, this is the buſineſs both of all <hi>Catechiſing</hi> and <hi>Preaching.</hi> Where any Text is not at all, or ſo well underſtood, there the Miniſter doth expound it by ſome plainer Text, or by an Interpretation of the Original; and he always ſhews its agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the common Notions and Senſe of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And if any be ſo careleſs or dull, as not to deduce the particular Conſequences they might, nor make uſe of it to direct their own Practices, they are helped by the Sermon in thoſe matters.</p>
            <p>And thus by hearing the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96861:121"/>
and Promiſes, and Threatnings read, and explained, and applied, Mens Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are increaſed, their Memories re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, their Affections quickned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently their Practice is better'd. For the Word of God, where it is underſtood and believed, where it is entertained and kept, it will have this certain Effect, to help Men to live holy and vertuous Lives; for it is a Spirit of Holineſs and Purity that breaths in thoſe Divine Writings, and they have this only deſign to make Men good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt of the Benefits I mentioned, which the Chriſtian hath in the publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, is the <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already ſaid ſomething concerning <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which is the initial Rite that is uſed at our firſt Admiſſion, which ſolemnizes, and as it were confirms and ratifies the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, which the Proſelite to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity then takes upon him.</p>
            <p>I might here add, that it cannot ſeem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable to expect the ſecret and unſeen, tho not unfelt Bleſſing of God to be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Obſervance of his own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Prayers which are made by the Church on the behalf of the Party baptized.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> if we conſider by whom, and at what time it was inſtituted, we ſhall look on it as a mighty Privilege to be admitted to it: For our Saviour ordained it, and he did this at the time of his Death, when he was about to give the greateſt Inſtance of his Love to us, that ever the World had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:96861:121"/>
If we think how frequently it was uſed by the Primitive Chriſtians, and what an Eſteem they had of it, we ſhall by this alſo be perſuaded, that it is a very valuable thing. But on the other hand, if we make an Eſtimate of it according to the Judgment of our own Times, we muſt then look on it, as having either much Evil, or very little Good in it, for elſe ſure Men could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly neglect it as they do.</p>
            <p>But let us not judge of it by any extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal Conſiderations whatſoever. Let us conſider the Nature of the Thing it ſelf, and the excellent Uſes it ſerves, and then we ſhall better diſcern the Advantages it brings.</p>
            <p>The thing we are to do, is to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the great Performances of our <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> which were conſummated in that painful and ignominious <hi>Death</hi> he underwent for our ſakes: This we are commanded to do in eating Bread, and drinking Wine.</p>
            <p>Now whilſt we do an Action which ſo well becomes us, and that is ſo honourable to our deareſt Lord, we receive unto our ſelves unconceivable Benefits: For, when we look on <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> for our Sins, as the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> offered for us, this ſhews us the Heinouſneſs of Sin, and makes us more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, and ſorrowful for the Sins we have committed; as alſo more to deteſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve againſt all Sin for time to come.</p>
            <p>This alſo convinceth us of God's Right to challenge our Obedience, and to puniſh us for our Default. And he doth by this
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96861:122"/>
Inſtance (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ſhew us what we are to expect, if we continue in a ſinful Practice.</p>
            <p>Again; When we look on the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as accepted and eſteemed by God, this will increaſe our value of Obedience to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law,</hi> and we ſhall ſet an higher Price on Holineſs; for it was this which made our Saviour's Oblation ſo acceptable unto God.</p>
            <p>This will alſo encourage our <hi>Faith and Hope in God,</hi> when we conſider that a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> hath been offered, and is accepted on our behalf.</p>
            <p>When we take a view of our dying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as our Example and Patern, we then learn the moſt perfect <hi>Submiſſion</hi> of our <hi>Wills,</hi> the moſt entire <hi>Reſignation</hi> of our <hi>Selves</hi> to the <hi>Will of God,</hi> the moſt unconquerable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, the greateſt Reſolution, and yet the moſt of Mildneſs, and above all, the moſt univerſal and intenſe <hi>Love</hi> that can be expreſt; Love to Enemies, to malicious and wicked Perſecutors, to be deſiring hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and earneſtly endeavouring their Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, whilſt they are eagerly ſeeking our Ruine.</p>
            <p>And when we have had Chriſt ſet before us, as dying for our Brethren, this will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us alſo to do or ſuffer any thing for them. We cannot but draw this eaſy Concluſion, <hi>If he ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:96861:122"/>
I mention only ſome, and thoſe but a few, of the Advantages which we may and do receive by the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, for the increaſe of our Holineſs, and our Peace. And this may ſuffice at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Sixth Particular; I now proceed to the Seventh and laſt.</p>
            <p>Seventhly; The wiſe and good <hi>Counſels,</hi> together with the holy and virtuous <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of the Members of this Society, both thoſe that are on Earth, and thoſe that are in Heaven.</p>
            <p>There is no Member of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> who wants Counſel, or deſerves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, or to whom Exhortation is neceſſary, but lives among thoſe who both can and will (as Occaſion ſerves) adviſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, and perſuade him: for the Chriſtian is fully inſtructed in what is good and fit; and it is his duty not to ſuffer Sin upon his Brother, but we are to <hi>exhort one another daily</hi> to the practice of Holineſs.</p>
            <p>And if we look into the Remains of the good Men, who in former Ages were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church on Earth, we ſhall find a rich Treaſure of moſt wiſe and excellent <hi>Counſels,</hi> that will direct our Behaviour in every Condition we can fall into. Theſe are extant in the Books of the Scripture, and in other Writings of a Chriſtian Spirit and Temper.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Examples,</hi> how many are thoſe that have gone before us in the ways of Holineſs and Vertue, whoſe Practice is
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96861:123"/>
our ſure Guide in the ways that lead to Happineſs. I need not mention thoſe known and celebrated Names of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the Prophets of the Lord, who were all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Church, of which the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Word,</hi> the <hi>only Begotten of the Father, is the Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides theſe ancient Worthies, we have the Lives of thoſe good Men, who were with, and ſince our Saviour, who have ſet us the faireſt Copies of Meekneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, of an undaunted Courage, a firm Patience, an Obedience to Superiors, a Juſtice and Honeſty in all Dealings, an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Charity and Good-will, an exact Temperance, a true and an excellent Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: In ſhort, they have gone before us in all the ways of Holineſs and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>But over and above, and which is more than all theſe, we have upon ſure Record the moſt admirable Patern of Goodneſs that ever the World ſaw, in the moſt <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Life</hi> of our moſt <hi>bleſſed Lord.</hi> There is Holineſs in perfection, and Vertue in its moſt exalted ſtate; there we ſee the utmoſt poſſibilities of Goodneſs, to which Human Nature can be raiſed on this Earth.</p>
            <p>This and the reſt of thoſe great Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſerve to inſtruct our Ignorance, to quicken our Dulneſs, and to encourage our Faintings and Deſpondencies.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, we have Examples of Men now alive, which teach us Religion and Vertue, and engage us to practiſe it. As
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96861:123"/>
bad as the World is, there are thoſe who ſhine as Lights in the midſt of the darkneſs of this Earth. There are many whom the Grace of God hath <hi>taught to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly;</hi> who keep their Appetites and Paſſions under due reſtraint, and good government, ſo that they are harmleſs in their Converſation; and not only ſo, but they live to the good purpoſes of promoting their own and other Mens good Eſtate and Welfare.</p>
            <p>I have now briefly touched upon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges Men do or may receive by being Members of the Chriſtian Church: but I have not in my Diſcourſe obſerved the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which I intended, becauſe I would be ſhorter; I ſhall therefore only mention how it is with them in reſpect of God, and of the Devil.</p>
            <p>And briefly, the Caſe is thus in reſpect of God, That it is a matter of far leſs difficulty for us, who have the Goſpel, and live tho but in the outward Communion with the Church, to repent of our Sins, and become good Men, and to live holy Lives, than it was or is to any others. This is now made ſo practicable, ſo feaſible a matter, that no Man falls ſhort of it, who is not fooliſhly obſtinate, unaccountably ſottiſh, and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally neglectful of himſelf, and careleſs of his own Happineſs: ſo that whoever fails, it muſt be reſolved into his own groſs ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, ſottiſhneſs, and ſelf-neglect; for he is now put into a condition and capacity
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96861:124"/>
of receiving the greateſt Mercies from the Divine Bounty, and is in the way in which God uſually does communicate them.</p>
            <p>But as many as are recovered out of a ſtate of Sin, to a Life of Vertue, their paſt Sins are all pardoned, their frequent Infirmities and Shortneſſes are alſo remitted, ſo as they ſhall not riſe up in Judgment to condemn them: and they have eternal Life aſcertain'd to them, by the immutable <hi>Promiſe of that God who cannot lie.</hi> They are under his Protection and ſpecial Providence, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all things that befall them, ſo as that they turn to their Advantage, and are made ſerviceable to their Vertue, and will increaſe their Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly; As to the Devil, the <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that works in the Children of Diſobedience:</hi> They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd from under his Vaſſalage, he hath now no more Power over them; he cannot domineer over their Souls or Bodies, as he did before the coming of our Saviour: His Oracles are ſilenced; his Power leſſened; the <hi>Light of the glorious Goſpel</hi> hath ſcatter'd the Powers of Darkneſs, ſo that now they creep into the Corners of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Now that Mens Souls are freed from the Ignorance, and thoſe Errors under which they were held, their Bodies are alſo free from the Helliſh Cruelties of Tyrannical Fiends: They are no longer under the Power of Satan, now that they are become Subjects of the Kingdom of Chriſt, who hath conquered and triumphed over the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96861:124"/>
Head of the Apoſtate Spirits, <hi>and hath the Keys of Hell and Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly repreſented the great Benefits which accrue to Men by being <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of Chriſt,</hi> whether we conſider them as ſingle Perſons, or as in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, with reference to <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> For, whether we conſider the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Largeneſs, the vaſt Extent and long Continuance of the <hi>Church,</hi> or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Wiſdom and Goodneſs of many of its Members; whether we look on the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement laid upon them in their firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Church, or the admirable Order and Government of it, or the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably good Laws which are given to all its Members, or the proper and wholeſom Diſcipline which is uſed in it, or the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exerciſes which are uſed in the Publick Aſſemblies, we muſt neceſſarily confeſs, that all theſe will have a mighty Influence on Men, to make them good in themſelves, and good in all their Relations. And if they become good, they are then from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of the Devil, and within the Kingdom, and ſo under the Protection and Care of the Soveraign Lord of Men and Angels: and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to do well, ſhall be Partakers of everlaſting Life and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:96861:125"/>
This is the Condition, theſe are the <hi>Privileges</hi> of every true Chriſtian, of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man, who is not groſsly wanting to himſelf, and careleſs of his own manifeſtly greateſt and beſt Intereſts.</p>
            <p>The Inferences I would make, are theſe two:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Let us then ſet an high value upon the Chriſtian Religion in general; and in particular, on our being Members of that Body of which Chriſt is the Head. Since ſo many, and ſuch ineſtimable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages accrue to us by being parts of this Society; let us take the greateſt care to preſerve our ſelves in Union with it: Let us not, as too many in our Days are, be indifferent whether we be of this Body, or no: Let us not needleſly ſeparate our ſelves from it. Do not make ſlight Account of thoſe Cenſures, which cut us off from the Church: for if they be exerciſed, <hi>non errante Clave,</hi> that is, upon good ground, a juſt Cauſe, and by a juſt Authority; God confirms in Heaven, what his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners do upon Earth: Whoſe Sins they remit or retain, are remitted or retained by him alſo. And if there be a Male Adminiſtration, yet the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Perſon is deprived of ſome Benefits which otherwiſe he might have.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:96861:125"/>
Have a great regard for that Body, of which whoſoever is a Member, hath ſo great Privileges. Be careful not to make any unneceſſary and unnatural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Schiſms in it, or to do any thing that may tend to the diſſolution of that moſt excellent Scociety.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us behave our ſelves as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Members of this excellent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and let our Lives and Tempers, our Devotion towards God, our Juſtice and Charity towards Men, our good Government of our ſelves according to the Rules of Temperance and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let theſe make it manifeſt, what excellent Advantages we have by being Members of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>We have Advantages above others; let us ſhew this by living better Lives than others: If we be not much better than other Men, we muſt needs be far worſe,</p>
            <p>Let us not be ſo fooliſh as to neglect the Advantages we have. <hi>Forſake not the aſſembling of your ſelves together, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſome is,</hi> &amp;c. Neglect not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as too too many do.</p>
            <p>I conclude all, by reminding you, in ſhort, of the Advantages of which I have ſpoken: And deſire you,</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:96861:126"/>
               <item>1. To conſider Men ſingly. And,</item>
               <item>2. In Societies.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And under the Firſt;</p>
            <p>That their Knowledg and Wiſdom, their Vertue and Goodneſs, their Quiet and Peace, their Joy and Pleaſure, their future and everlaſting Happineſs, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd and ſecured by their being Members of this Society.</p>
            <p>Under the ſecond;</p>
            <p>That this ſacred Society is a great Security to, and Eſtabliſhment of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is neceſſary to all Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and doth greatly conduce to that Peace and Proſperity, <hi>i. e.</hi> Wealth and Credit, which is their End. This Society is ſo far from interfering with the Civil, that it is very beneficial to them, for it preſerves and confirms them.</p>
            <p>All this Good is procured by Mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporated into the Body of Chriſt; as appears,</p>
            <p>Firſt; By the firſt Admiſſion and Entrance into the Church, which is done by a publick Profeſſion of the Religion of Chriſt, a being baptized into the <hi>Name of Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt:</hi> All which muſt lay a great Engagement on us to live holy and excellent Lives, that ſo we may live anſwerably to the Profeſſion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96861:126"/>
we have made, and the Engagement we have taken upon us.</p>
            <p>Secondly; This will alſo appear hugely beneficial to that excellent Order and Government, which is ſetled and is to be obſerved in the Church; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe incomparably good Laws, which are given to this Society, thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially which are peculiar to it: Thoſe of Love, and doing good to all; in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial manner, of Love to one another, of forgiving even Enemies, of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And alſo that moſt humane and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Diſcipline, which is preſcribed to be uſed toward Offenders: For, this is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whoſe deſign is the Increaſe of every Man's Vertue and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And this Government is ſo excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived, that the particular and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſts of any do never claſh or interfere with the publick Intereſt of the Society in general.</p>
            <p>And tho many Corruptions and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes have crept into the Government of the Chriſtian Church; yet even in a very Male-Adminiſtration of it, there are ſtill great Helps to Vertue: And thoſe very Formalities, and Shadows, and Names of ſome Offices and Things, which remain, may ſerve to put us in mind what ought to be, and what we ſhould take care to do, or to avoid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:96861:127"/>
It is in this, as in other Governments, better to be under bad ones, than none at all; and more eligible to bear the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Men, who are at preſent in place of Power, than to attempt a Change of the Conſtitution, or to go about to alter the Government it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; The Archives and Records of this Society; which are contained in the Books of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (which indeed it is poſſible a Man may have, that is not of this Society; but by his being of it, he is entitled to this Privilege) he now hath free acceſs to them.</p>
            <p>And how much theſe Divine Records tend to enlighten Mens Minds, and to purify their Hearts, only they know, who have uſed them. <hi>There</hi> we have upon Record the firſt Original of this excellent Society, the gradual Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God to his Church of all Ages; the Examples and Lives of many of the Members of it, but eſpecially the Holy Jeſus; the Acts of Government and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which have been in the firſt Age after Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; The Publick Aſſemblies for the Exerciſe of Religion, to which they are admitted: Where,</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:96861:127"/>
               <item>1. They pray to God publickly for and with each other.</item>
               <item>2. The Scriptures are read.</item>
               <item>3. They receive the Sacrament of the Lord's-Supper, and Infants are baptized.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fifthly; The Converſation, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and Exhortations, and Reproofs, and Examples of their Fellow-Members.</p>
            <p>All theſe tend to make Men vertuous, and that brings with it preſent Peace, and future Happineſs; for God loves, and will reward Vertue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

take off the Scandal of Folly and Evil in the <hi>Command:</hi> For, with many this Text and divers others are contradictory to Reaſon, and oppoſite to the Nature of Man: than which Opinion, I know nothing more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>For, if this be granted, it is then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that our Religion is falſe and evil; that whoſoever believes it, believes in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his Mind; and he that obeys it, doth it to his own Hurt; that he ruines himſelf, and depraves his Nature.</p>
            <p>This Error tends to the utter Subverſion of Chriſtianity: For, it makes it impoſſible to be either believed, or practis'd: For no Man can give Credit to that, which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts what he cannot doubt; and no Man can do that, which he is aſſured tends to his Deſtruction, as all Actions do, which are repugnant to his Nature.</p>
            <p>No Man can believe what he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor can he conceive a Contradiction, not apprehend what is impoſſible; nor can he do that, which he thinks ſo evil, as that is, which is intrinſecally repugnant to his Nature.</p>
            <p>He that hath entertain'd this Conceit, muſt alſo aſſert, that he who will believe the Articles of our Faith, muſt lay aſide his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and he who will obey the Precepts of Chriſt, muſt put off his Nature, and ceaſe to be a Man, if he will be a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But how unworthily doth this reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, by making him thus at odds with himſelf; that what he made at firſt, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96861:129"/>
deſtroys; that his Works of Creation and Redemption claſh? It argues him to have forgot the Capacities of his Creatures, when he makes a Revelation of that, which is unconceivable by them; or hath required them to do what is not poſſible they ſhould do; and doth all this for their Advantage, which will infallibly ruine them.</p>
            <p>Beſides; What a diſparagement is this to Religion? How juſtly is that ſuſpected for a Cheat, where to the belief of its Articles, and practice of its Duties, Men muſt be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and Unnatural? And how doth this open a door to Error and evil Practice, by depoſing Reaſon, and caſting off Nature? For, he that doth this in any Caſe, may for ought I know, do it in every one; and then he muſt believe all that is told, and do all that is bid him; and then he will believe Lies, and practiſe Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>In ſhort; This Opinion takes away from Chriſtians all means of diſtinguiſhing Truth from Falſhood, it ſubverts the Foundations of all Diſcourſe, it leaves no differences of Good and Evil. All this is moſt true, if Man muſt believe what is contrary to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Principles, and the trueſt Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his Reaſon, or do what is repugnant to his Nature.</p>
            <p>He that is thus perſwaded, hath caſt off his ſure and faithful Guide, and now muſt wander after Fancy, and be at the Mercy of every one, who will pretend Inſpiration.</p>

            <p>This will be very evident to them that conſider;

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The true meaning of the Words will be apparent, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The common Acception of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How they were underſtood of old; for they are here brought in, in oppoſition to what was then ſpoke, and ſo the Words muſt have the ſame Senſe they then had.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Relation and Order they have to other Precepts; for without this <hi>Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Knowledg of the Law it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the common Acception of the Words, there can be no Controverſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96861:130"/>
the Philoſophers (who have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken to themſelves a Liberty of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Senſe upon Words, yet) in this agree with the Vulgar, both of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding theſe two things by <hi>Love.</hi> 1. To wiſh and deſire well to any. 2. To do well to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To think well of, and towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to wiſh and deſire their Welfare, that is the Soul; to do them that Good which is wiſhed them, that is the Body of <hi>Love:</hi> both are eſſential and neceſſary to the being of a real <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Love</hi> will expreſs it ſelf variouſly, according to the different Conditions of its Object, and the divers Degrees of its own Power. If the thing loved be very <hi>good,</hi> then <hi>Love</hi> puts on the <hi>Garment of Gladneſs,</hi> and is delighted in it. If it be in very bad State, and deſtitute of <hi>Good,</hi> then <hi>Love</hi> turns into <hi>Pity,</hi> and commiſerates. If it be unable to help, it ſtays in <hi>Deſires,</hi> and good Wiſhes; but if it have any <hi>Power,</hi> it exerts it, and goes forth into <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All agree, that to <hi>love</hi> is (according to St. <hi>James)</hi> not only to ſpeak good Words, but to have good Thoughts and Deſires; not only to wiſh well, but alſo to do well, where we can. To ſpeak well is but the Picture of <hi>Love;</hi> to think well, is <hi>Love</hi> in the Womb; but to do well alſo, is <hi>Love</hi> brought forth, and perfect, now it is finiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Enemies</hi> are thoſe that <hi>hate us,</hi> that is, who both think, and do us <hi>evil,</hi> who both deſire and do us Miſchief: Neither of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96861:131"/>
theſe alone are ſufficient to denominate Men our <hi>Enemies.</hi> All grant our <hi>Friends</hi> may do us ill Offices, and they that heartily wiſh us well, may do that which they deſire to do, who intend to ruin us; and yet we call them not <hi>Enemies.</hi> Nor on the other part, can we juſtly call any Man ſo, who hath Power to hurt us, and doth not: for we have no other way to know his Thoughts but by his Works; and if they do not yet come to theſe, it is an Argument they are not the ſetled Judgment of a Man's Mind; that they are not conſented to; and no Man is to be cenſur'd for that which is a matter of Practice, and is not his practical Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>No Man can be ſaid to be, or to do any thing that merits Praiſe or Blame, where he hath not given his Conſent, and where the Action is within his Power, and follows not, there he doth not conſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe Words were ſo underſtood by them of old, as they generally are: This appears ſufficiently by both the Doctrines and Practices of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who were pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeiz'd, and wholly adhered to the <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Elders,</hi> and the Opinions of their <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Rabbies.</hi> Their Carriage was ſuch, as ſhewed they thought themſelves not only permitted, but commanded to deſire and do Evil to their <hi>Enemies;</hi> and all were ſuch in their Eſteem, who were not <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Proſelites:</hi> And therefore they denied them common Offices of Civility, would not <hi>(Monſtrare vias eadem niſi ſacra colenti)</hi> ſo
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96861:131"/>
much as direct a Stranger in his way, if he were not of their <hi>Religion.</hi> And beſides, call'd them by moſt uncivil Names, as <hi>Dogs,</hi> &amp;c. and would injure them by Fraud or Violence, and did all that which I before ſaid of <hi>Love,</hi> to thoſe of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>So then the Words of the Text being ſpoken in oppoſition to their Opinion of old, muſt be underſtood in the ſame Senſe they took them in; and then the plain Senſe of our Saviour is; that we ſhould deſign their Good and Welfare, who deſire and intend ill to us. That we ſhould repay <hi>Hatred</hi> with <hi>Love,</hi> ill Offices with good ones: and in ſum, do well to them, that do evil to us; not requiting Hatred with Hatred, one ill turn with another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us conſider the Words with <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to other Precepts: This is neceſſary to be conſidered for the underſtanding the Bounds and Limits of any Precept, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently how far it is obligatory.</p>
            <p>There are two Propoſitions, which in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral may ſerve for Rules, in the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any Command, and they are not, that I know, denied by any.</p>
            <p>Firſt; That <hi>no Action that is impoſſible, is commanded, and none that is neceſſary forbidden.</hi> If any Laws be made that keep not within theſe Bounds, it argues Folly, and perhaps Cruelty in the Maker of them; and he to whom they are made, cannot be under any Obligation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:96861:132"/>
Secondly; <hi>No Law that is particular, and of leſs moment, can null one that is greater and univerſally obliging:</hi> Such are thoſe, <hi>Love and do Good: Avoid Evil,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>where two good things are in Competition, and one is appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently better, chuſe the beſt;</hi> becauſe that which is leſs good, <hi>habet Rationem mali:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: This is the untranſgreſſible Law; it is contrary to Nature to do otherwiſe, this is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obliging: This is a Law which cannot be abrogated, from which no other Law can derogate in the leaſt. So that no Precept whatſoever can oblige any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not to do that which is better: <hi>Of two good things, the greater; of two Evils, the leſſer is always to be choſen:</hi> And indeed Men naturally do chuſe that which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liend to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Rules premiſed, it is manifeſt that our Saviour, in this Precept of loving our Enemies, doth not command us;</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>love</hi> any thing that is in it ſelf <hi>Evil,</hi> nor to be pleaſed with our own Harm conſidered in it ſelf: This is impoſſible for Humane Nature to do. He doth not by this intend to make us affected to Evil, as we are to Good. This we cannot be whilſt we are Men; our Nature muſt be firſt deſtroyed. Every one naturally and neceſſarily intends his own Preſervation, and is averſe from that which tends to his Ruine. The deſire of his own Preſervation and Perfection is a Principle ſo deeply ingraven in Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96861:132"/>
that it cannot be obliterated. Nor,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are we here commanded to do no Evil to thoſe who are <hi>our Enemies.</hi> Men who are competent Judges of Offences, and who have Power and Right to puniſh Offenders, are not hereby forbidden to inflict Penalties on them, where other Methods will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ineffectual, to remove or prevent ſome greater Evils. This makes doing ill to any, not only excuſable, but neceſſary, where a greater Evil cannot be removed without it. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we may do any Evil to another, then we may alſo deſire and will it. It is unqueſtionable, a Man may will to do what he may do. And he may do Evil to another Man, where,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the likelieſt means to procure the Offender ſome greater Good, than by this he is depriv'd of. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where it is but conſiſtent with his Happineſs; if it be in order to the greater Good and Advantage of others, the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Security of other Men, the Publick Peace. This is the only Reaſon I can readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think of, why the Life of a Robber ſhould be taken away, that People may be ſecure and quiet in their Poſſeſſions, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Labour and Induſtry to get, by their being protected by the Laws in keeping what they have; and alſo leſt the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould ſpread, and the Malefactor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf proceed to more Offences, and others receive the Infection from him. All which is more valuable than ſuch a Man's Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:96861:133"/>
Theſe are the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and our Saviour came not to overturn any of theſe Foundations.</p>
            <p>This then ſeems to be the Senſe of our Saviour in this Precept. Not that we ſhould <hi>love</hi> any thing that is <hi>Evil</hi> to us, and tends to our Ruine as ſuch: Nor, that we ſhould not endeavour and take the beſt and likelieſt ways to free our ſelves from a bad Eſtate: Nor that we ſhould not do and deſire ſome Evil to Men who may be our <hi>Enemies,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that it be in order to a greater Good, than it is a Deprivation of to themſelves or others, and never inconſiſtent with their Happineſs. But that we ſhould deſire and do as much as we can, all that <hi>Good</hi> to them who deſign and do the worſt <hi>Evils</hi> to us, which can be conſiſtent with our wiſeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after their, our own and others greateſt Good.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to be all that is meant by this Precept. Only this Caution is neceſſary; that <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and Intereſt, and <hi>Folly</hi> muſt not determine in the caſe; but <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> muſt ſit in Judgment, and decide what is, and what is not conſiſtent with their, or other Mens greater Good.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Now let us conſider the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a Practice conſidered in it ſelf; and the Arguments that are drawn from ſuch a Conſideration of it, as well as the more external that perſwade to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider <hi>Love</hi> in it ſelf. It is the moſt <hi>pleaſant</hi> as well as the moſt beneficial and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96861:133"/>
perfective Operation of Man.</p>
            <p>There is none but will confeſs himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to this Paſſion, for the greateſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights he hath ever met with. It is that which makes us receive any thing of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in our Enjoyments: Without it the beſt Condition would afford us no Content, and with it we ſhall have Satisfaction in the worſt. It is <hi>Love</hi> more than any other thing, that differences Mens Delights, Eſtates, Enjoyments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Delight conſiſts not in having abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Riches, nor in being honoured, nor in knowing much; but in our Love and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for theſe things. He that hath much, and loves not his Wealth, hath no more of pleaſure from his Riches, than he who is poor. Hence is it that the Neceſſitous hath more of Delight in his Condition, than the Wealthy-Man in his; becauſe he more loves and values his few Neceſſaries, than the other can his many Superfluiries.</p>
            <p>But I need no further Evidence of the Pleaſures of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good-will,</hi> than an Appeal to every Mans Senſe and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf will give. The more he has of this, the better it is with him. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be extended as far as there is any thing that may be an Object of Love, how great muſt his Delight be? The moſt that we know of Heaven, which is a State of the greateſt Pleaſure and Delight that Humane Nature can have, is, that there is a conſtant and a great <hi>Love;</hi> and Hell; which is the greateſt Torment, is deſtitute of all Good-will:
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96861:134"/>
               <hi>Love</hi> and Kindneſs are baniſhed hence, and Spite, and Hatred, and Envy, take the place.</p>
            <p>How beneficial this Temper is to Humane Nature, is very apparent. The Body it ſelf ſhares in the Advantages that come by it. In the Opinion of the French Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, as well as the Obſervation of many, it is literally <hi>Health to the Navel,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to all the Bones.</hi> It gives Warmth and Motion to the Blood, and new freſh Spirits to the whole Body: and on this account he thinks it more adviſeable to live in a miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Love,</hi> than in <hi>Hatred</hi> that is true, and hath a Foundation.</p>
            <p>But if this admit of Diſpute, yet that is unqueſtionable, that it is far better to love with Reaſon, than to hate without it; and that is all I plead for.</p>
            <p>But theſe are the leaſt of the Advantages we have by <hi>Love:</hi> the greater are thoſe, which more immediately concern the <hi>Soul,</hi> and they are ſumm'd up in this, the knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Shackles and Fetters, which Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and Sorrow and Fear had bound up our Powers by; <hi>Love,</hi> that comes and mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſcues us from that Bondage and Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: It ſets us at liberty, unties the Tongue of the Dumb, and unlooſes our Hands that were bound. It brings us back from the Solitude, whither Hatred or Fear had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, to a Converſe amongſt Men, and makes us active, and diſpoſes us to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of all our Powers, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to their Perfection, and hath a great
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96861:134"/>
tendency to it. That is the firſt, from the conſideration of <hi>Love</hi> in General.</p>
            <p>Secondly; Now conſider it with its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They may do us much Good, and we are often the better for them.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That whereby they intend to ruin us, is often our Advancement; the Blow by which they would kill, cures us; ſo that the Sword becomes a Lancet; and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who deſigns to make Wounds, proves a Chirurgion and heals them.</p>
            <p>Indeed this being beſides their Intention, we perhaps ſhall not think they merit our <hi>Love,</hi> or Thanks the more; but however, they are Inſtruments of Good to us; and we ſhould love that which is any cauſe of Good to us. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> on this account, was not himſelf, nor would have his Brethren angry with themſelves, becauſe tho they intended him Evil, yet God did him good by it, and uſed them as Inſtruments thereof. We <hi>love</hi> things that cannot intend us any Good, if yet we receive any from them, ſuch are all without Reaſon. Thus the Sword with which a Man hath defended himſelf, is of great value with him; and why ſhould not we as well <hi>love</hi> them that do us Good againſt their Will, as thoſe that do it without any Will at all? But,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We owe much to their evil Deſigns and miſchievous Devices againſt us.</p>
            <p>This makes us cautious and circumſpect, and this Caution makes us wiſe. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered this rightly, who when he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96861:135"/>
every one what he had received from them, gave his <hi>Prudence</hi> to his <hi>Enemies.</hi> This Apprehenſion makes us more exact in what we do, than otherwiſe we ſhould be. We ſhall go upright, if we know there be thoſe that watch for our halting: We ſhall be more accurat in our Actions, where we are to receive our Doom from Enemies, than where Friends are to judg us. Friends are often ſo blinded with Paſſion, that they can ſee nothing that is amiſs; and Enemies are ſo envious, that they acknowledg no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Good, but what is eminently ſo. This is therefore a Spur to make us do our beſt.</p>
            <p>Many Men, if they had had fewer Friends, and more Enemies, had been much better than now they are: Therefore we muſt love them as we love Poiſons, that are mixt by the Phyſician ſo, as they are made ſoveraign Medicines, and cure our Diſeaſe. This is the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho <hi>our Enemies</hi> do Evil to us, yet there is Good in them; and for the ſake of that we muſt <hi>love</hi> them. <hi>Wilt thou deſtroy the Righteous with the Wicked?</hi> ſaid <hi>Abraham</hi> to God, <hi>Far be it from thee.</hi> It is the ſame Injuſtice, for any to hate and deſtroy the Good which is in any Man with the Evil, where a Separation can be made. God ſent his Angel to bring <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and in the Deluge, <hi>Noah</hi> was warned and ſaved in the <hi>Ark</hi> We ſhould follow this Example; proſecute and deſtroy the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, the Evil of a Man; hate that with a perfect Hatred; but ſpare the Man, be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:96861:135"/>
kind to our own Kindred, have regard to God's Creature and Image, <hi>lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> the Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Phyſicians do never cut off any part of the Body which is not ſo corrupted, that there is no hopes of a Cure, and where the reſt of the Body is not in danger by it, and the Part it ſelf not vital, not neceſſary to Life.</p>
            <p>And in the Body Politick, the Relatives of an Offender are not involved in his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, where the Offence is not very great; nor there unleſs it can be ſuppoſed they were Partners with him; or it be neceſſary for the publick and greater Good, both to demonſtrate a great Severity againſt ſuch Crimes, and thereby to terrify Men, and alſo the more to engage all Relations to concern themſelves in one anothers well-doing.</p>
            <p>Somewhat like this ſhould our Carriage be in the Caſe before us. Is there any hopes that the Evil may be removed from the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Mind</hi> of the Man, without his Ruine? Try if it may. And it is hard to ſay that a Man is, or can be ſo much our <hi>Enemy,</hi> that he will never be our <hi>Friend.</hi> We cannot affirm that the Caſe is deſperate, that he is unreconcileable. Surely no Man is ſo much a Devil, as to be implacable, this can never be. Beſides, there may ſometimes be a deal of Wiſdom and Goodneſs, which muſt be loved, and the Man valued for it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly; We are never to do any Evil which will make it impoſſible for our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to be happy: this would be to cut off
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:96861:136"/>
a vital Part. Such was his helliſh Malice, who perſwaded his Enemy to blaſpheme in hopes of Life, and then preſently ſtabb'd him, and then triumph'd in the greatneſs of the Miſchief. I never yet met with an Inſtance of one more a Devil. This Man had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly caſt off Humanity; and he hath done ſo too in great meaſure, who doth not ſo much deſire every other Man's Happineſs, as that he can do nothing, that is not in order to, at leaſt very conſiſtent with it.</p>
            <p>As to the other Compariſon, let us not do that which the Soveraign Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſo much diſowns, <hi>puniſh the Fathers for the Tranſgreſſion of the Children.</hi> Let every one <hi>die for his own iniquity:</hi> Find out the Criminal, let him ſuffer. Here's a diſorderly Paſſion founded on ſome eaſy and ordinary Miſtakes; remove theſe, but let the Man live: Let not him ſuffer, unleſs this be the beſt Method for the removal of this, and prevention of a worſe Evil that may befal him.</p>
            <p>What I have now ſaid, ſignifies, that a ſpecial Care and due Regard ſhould be had to all that is good: and when our Anger and Diſpleaſure would inſtigate us to deviſe and do Miſchief to <hi>our Enemy,</hi> then conſider, he is a Man, that is, one who is liable to Error, but yet capable of Information: One who is ſubject to do Evil, but yet often is changed, and amends his Life: One of God's Creatures, and one of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of them; and ſhall we deſtroy that which we could not make, that which God
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96861:136"/>
himſelf made, with ſo much Wiſdom, and ſuch greatneſs of Power? Can we have ſo little eſteem of the <hi>Work of God?</hi> Can we deſtroy what we do not underſtand?</p>
            <p>Beſides; <hi>Man</hi> is <hi>God's Image,</hi> and all the Lines can never be ſo much obliterated, as that there ſhould be no reſemblance: And if there remain any Lineaments of our <hi>Father's</hi> Face in a Picture, we ſhall ſurely keep it as a ſacred Relique.</p>
            <p>Will not this move us? Yet our own Likeneſs may. Can we love our ſelves, and not love our own Picture, that is ſo very like us? Or not love one, that is <hi>Fleſh of our Fleſh, and Bone of our Bone?</hi> So every Man is to another.</p>
            <p>Or laſtly; Have we any <hi>Love</hi> to our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?</hi> and ſhall not we <hi>love</hi> his <hi>Diſciple?</hi> Do we value our Religion, and have no more regard to the Profeſſors of it? Did Chriſt die for him, that he might live for ever? and will not you ſuffer him to live here?</p>
            <p>Briefly; there is often a great deal of Good in him that is <hi>our Enemy;</hi> and we muſt love that, and him, for the ſake of that Good. We do not well to caſt away the Corn with the Chaff; nor the Garment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of one Spot; nor disfigure the Face, becauſe of a Mole; nor pull out the other Eye, becauſe one is loſt already. And yet thus we do here, when we hate the Man, tho he be otherwiſe very good, becauſe he is our Enemy. But,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:96861:137"/>
3. If there be very little that can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led good in him; if he be an Infidel, and fooliſh, and evil; if he not only be no Chriſtian, but hath alſo put off Humanity; if worſe than a Beaſt, if almoſt as bad as we imagine the Devil is: then the greater is his Miſery; and ſince he is capable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, the more compaſſionable is his Caſe.</p>
            <p>The Man is miſerable, and therefore to be pitied: It is unnatural Cruelty, it is monſtrous Inhumanity, to hate, to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute one in Miſery. And this is the State of that Man whom I have here deſcribed; nay, it is in part true of every one that is my Enemy: For every Man is ſo far from <hi>Happineſs,</hi> as he is from <hi>Love,</hi> and Hatred is diſtant enough from that.</p>
            <p>Beſides; He who continues in Spite and Malice againſt me, is an Enemy to God; and he that is ſo, is in the unhappieſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition imaginable: Why ſhould we add to his Miſery, which is already ſo great?</p>
            <p>Thirdly; Conſider your ſelves, they are <hi>your Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is no way proper for your ſelves to ſentence and puniſh in the caſe, becauſe you are ſo apt to miſtake every where, and eſpecially to be partial in your own cauſe. We are neither wiſe nor juſt enough to be Judges in ſuch a matter. We may be ſo far deceived, as to think them our Enemies who are not; and we oftner miſtake thus than we think we do: In this caſe to hate, is very evil in the opinion of all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:96861:137"/>
It is ſuppoſed in the Text, that Men are <hi>our Enemies,</hi> yet we muſt <hi>love them:</hi> If they be not ſo, we are worſe than Heathens; and if they be, yet,</p>
            <p>The Cauſe being our own, we cannot be thought competent Judges for our ſelves, againſt another Man. We are ſo apt to over-value every petty Intereſt of our own, as to think that all other Mens Concerns, how great and valuable ſoever, muſt give place to ours. We generally only conſider our own Affairs, and are wholly regardleſs of other Mens.</p>
            <p>This is one Reaſon why all Controverſies betwixt Man and Man, are referr'd in all Countries to a third Perſon, who is more indifferent and impartial, and ſo will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be more wiſe and juſt than a Party would be. Here alſo it cannot be proper for you, becauſe it belongs to God himſelf. <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it, ſaith the Lord,</hi> He only can underſtand the Crime, ſo as to proportion a Puniſhment to it.</p>
            <p>Conſidering how apt we are to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate in our own Concerns, and to be too much exaſperated, where we are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any little trifling Intereſt, we ſhould rather refer our ſelves to one that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wiſe and juſt, than paſs Sentence our ſelves againſt a Man, as we do if we hate him.</p>
            <p>It becomes the Modeſty of one that knows himſelf apt to miſtake, to refer himſelf to the Judgment of another; and if we will
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96861:138"/>
be decided by him who is moſt fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that is, by God himſelf, then the Controverſy is ended, and we muſt not hate, but <hi>love our Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He is <hi>our Enemy,</hi> but a <hi>Friend</hi> perhaps to many others as good and better than we: and cannot we be ſatisfied with, and love that which is prejudicial to our particular Intereſt, if others receive Advantage by it? If the Rain that overflows me, make my Neighbour's Field fruitful, I muſt not diſlike it: And if the Sun warms thouſands by the Heat, which ſcorches me; or the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by which I ſuffer, favour many others; I am not to be diſpleaſed.</p>
            <p>And if he that is mine Enemy, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes my Intereſt, be a Friend to many, I will love him, in as much as I am taught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard other Mens Intereſts, and not only to <hi>mind mine own Things.</hi> He that only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders himſelf, and his own particular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is his Center, may hate every thing that oppoſes him in it; but he that takes other Mens Concernments into his thoughts, and deſires their Welfare as his own, as everyone doth, that is true either to Chriſtianity or Nature, will not be ſo much diſaffected to that which is againſt himſelf, if it be for others; but will love that which doth them good, tho it preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice himſelf.</p>
            <p>3dly; <hi>Your Enemies;</hi> Who have therefore known what it is to have Enemies, and have felt the evil Effects of Hatred and Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs: It is reaſonable to expect that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96861:138"/>
ſuch ſhould not do that, which they know to be ſo great an Evil.</p>
            <p>If it be no Evil to have Enemies, why do you complain? And if it be, why will you do thus? You ſee the Evil of it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, why not in your ſelves? Will you condemn that in them, which you allow and practiſe?</p>
            <p>Both Religion and Nature teach us to be affected towards other Men, as we are to our ſelves; to love our Neighbours as our ſelves; and to do to them, as we would have them do to us.</p>
            <p>The Providence of God has given us ſuch Natures, and put us in ſuch Circumſtances in the World, that we have the greateſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements laid upon us to mutual Kindneſs and Good-will. He had made us all of one Stock; we are alſo like one another; we ſtand in need of each others Help and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: We make voluntary Agreements, and enter into Covenants and Contracts, by the Inſtitution of God, as well as by the Conſtitutions and Appointments of Men, to love and ſerve one another. <hi>Love</hi> is the Heart of Civil Society.</p>
            <p>And beſides all this Proviſion, which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom has made for our Exerciſe of Love; he has by the Goſpel taught it us, and obliged us to it in a moſt extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner: For, <hi>Love your Enemies;</hi> that is,</p>
            <p>4thly; <hi>Yours,</hi> who were loved when you were <hi>Enemies,</hi> and had been miſerable if you had not. Rom. 5. 10. <hi>When we were
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96861:139"/>
yet Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are three Particulars very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable:</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) What kind of Enemies we were.</item>
               <item>(2.) Who it was to whom we were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and who loved us.</item>
               <item>(3.) With what kind of Love.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">(1.) We were the moſt cauſeleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, the moſt diſingenuous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, the moſt weak and inconſiderable Enemies that could be. What Reaſon, or ſhadow of Reaſon will any Man bring for his Hatred againſt God? Why ſhould Man be angry with God? Or why ſhould he hate him, who is altogether Good, and can do no Evil? What could make him at odds with his Maker? or engage him in a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with his Preſerver? This is wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable. How baſe and ungrateful is Man, to oppoſe the Intereſt of God, who has done him ſo much Good? Doth he thus <hi>requite his Love, his great Kindneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly; How little can he do againſt God? He is not, nor cannot be hurt by Mens Ingratitude and Rebellion: No; what we intended againſt Heaven, falls upon our own Heads. Such a kind of Enemies we were; and yet,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Our God and Saviour loved us. God who is infinitely wiſe, who depended not on us, who is our Example and Patern, and to be like him is our greateſt Perfection.</p>
            <p>And leſt any ſhould ſay, Becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended not on us, and was ſo much above
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96861:139"/>
us, therefore he loved us: God in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Man Jeſus Chriſt, loved us; he who was like as we are in all things, except Sin. He that was ſo injured as never Man was, who received the greateſt Indignities and Contun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elies, and taſted the bittereſt Fruits of Malice; yet he <hi>loved,</hi> and <hi>prayed for,</hi> and <hi>did good</hi> to his worſt and cruelleſt <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) God and Chriſt loved their Enemies with the greateſt and realleſt Love. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. And our Saviour, <hi>laid down his Life;</hi> and, <hi>greater Love than this hath none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then we, who have ſeen ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Love, as are thoſe of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed God and our Saviour, and who have received ſo much of Good by this Love to us, when we were Enemies; how can we not love our Enemies, who are in no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſo unreaſonable, or diſingenuous, or inconſiderable as we were to God?</p>
            <p>5thly; <hi>Tours,</hi> who are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be hurt by any Man, ſo as to be made miſerable. All that any Man can do againſt a Diſciple of Chriſt, is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſo little, that it is not worth his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Contention. Our Saviour bids us <hi>not fear them that can kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do.</hi> And our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination repreſenting Evils much greater than we find them, if there be no reaſon to fear our Enemies, there can be none to hate them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:96861:140"/>
There is nothing more conducing, nor indeed eſſential to our Happineſs, than <hi>Love.</hi> And therefore the Religion of Chriſt, which manifeſtly deſigns our greateſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, has by all means ſecured the Practice of <hi>Love;</hi> it has removed all Obſtacles out of the way, and enlarged its Bounds; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering new Objects, that were not before thought of; extending it to Juſt and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, Strangers and Acquaintance, Friends and <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly;</hi> This is the wiſeſt Method we can take to be freed from the Evil we complain of. We ſhall hereby moſt probably,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Put an end to this Evil.</item>
               <item>2. Prevent new ones to our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And if this be true, then there can be no Plea for Hatred.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This is the meaning of Hatred, to deliver our ſelves from ſome Evil, to deſtroy that. Now let us compare and ſee, whether Love be not a better and wiſer Method to this, than Hatred.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is more innocent, doth leſs harm to the Party himſelf or others, and deſtroys leſs Good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth more ordinarily prevail upon Men to lay aſide all malicious thoughts. And there are many Cauſes in Nature, which make it neceſſary ſo to do:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We are naturally prone to imitate; and here is a contrary Example ſet before us, a Patern of Love.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) There is no Reaſon for any to hate one that loves him, becauſe we only hate
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:96861:140"/>
that which is evil to us; but if any Perſon love us, we cannot think he doth us evil, for he deſigns and will do us good: So that he who hates ſuch an one, hates his own Good.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Ingenuity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Returning Love for Hatred quencheth the Violence of it. The common opinion is, let the Sun ſhine upon the Kitchin-Fire, it will put it out. Love takes away the Fuel from thoſe conſuming Fires: it deſtroys both the Parents and the Nurſe of Enmity, which are Hatred and Evil: Theſe propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and preſerve, but Love and Goodneſs deſtroy and extirpate it. <hi>Overcome Evil with Good,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: that indeed is the likelieſt way to overcome it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Love</hi> by yielding overcome that, which by reſiſtance increaſes its ſtrength; as Wooll-packs damp the force of that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Bullet, which will make Breaches upon a Stone-Wall. Farther, let us conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either we deſerved to be oppoſed in this Intereſt, or we did not: If we did, why do we complain? If not, our Reward will be greater. Let us patiently bear Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and the Revilings of Men: and <hi>great</hi> will be our Recompence that God will give us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Enemy either doth well or ill in being ſo: if well, love; if ill, pity him. His Sin is worſe to him, than our Suffering can be to us. If he do ill, do not follow his Example; if well, do not hate him.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:96861:141"/>
3. This Practice will bring Religion into Repute, we ſhall <hi>adorn our Profiſſion,</hi> and ſhew that Chriſtianity can do ſomething ſingular, ſomewhat above other Religions; that they who have the Light of the Goſpel, exceed Heathens and Infidels in their Lives.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is neceſſary to Salvation. Our Sins will not be pardoned to us, unleſs we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don others. <hi>If ye forgive not Men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive yours. Whatſoever ye would that others ſhould do to you, the ſame do ye to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. We condemn our ſelves if we do not. Our Prayers and our Lives claſh: We daily pray for Forgiveneſs from God, as we forgive others; and yet we do it not.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This is a firm Foundation of Peace. If this Principle obtained, there would be no Quarrels; for theſe cannot ariſe, except both Parties be agreed to be Enemies.</p>
            <p>If all theſe Arguments be well conſidered, it will appear how little reaſon the Enemies of our Religion have to take any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from this, as they account, unnatural Precept of our Saviour, to diſparage his whole Goſpel. I hope my Diſcourſe has ſhewn both how reaſonable and how natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral it is; and that it has taken away all the Pretences, which weak and inconſiderate, or ill-natured Men have for their neglect of it. So that I have prevented my ſelf of what I propounded to do next, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:96861:141"/>
III. To ſhew the Falſeneſs of thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which are offered againſt it. The moſt conſiderable, I think, are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. It is unnatural to love one that does and intends us Miſchief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. It is neceſſary to hate for our own Defence and Preſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Example doth encline us to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. If we hate our Enemies, they will expect and be afraid of this, and ſo will be deterred from being our Enemies.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to the Firſt Objection;</p>
            <p n="1">1. I have ſhewn in my Explication, that we are not required to love any thing that is in it ſelf evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I have in my following Diſcourſe ſhown, that this Evil may be a Cauſe of much Good unto us here, but eſpecially hereafter: Or if of no Good to us, yet there is ſo much Good to others, as may make our Love prevail above Hatred.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>2d</hi> Objection, I have made out, that Hatred is not the likelieſt: Method to be rid of this Evil, or to prevent it for the future.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>3d</hi> Objection; I have ſhew'd that we muſt not follow Example <hi>to do Evil.</hi> It may become Apes and Children to be wholly determined by Example, and to imitate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing they ſee; but it is very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:96861:142"/>
of them who have the uſe of their Reaſon.</p>
            <p>As for the fourth Objection, I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is no Method to remove or leſſen, but to continue and encreaſe their Hatred. It is commonly ſaid, <hi>Men hate what they fear.</hi> Theſe two differ very little: We hate all Evil, and fear that which is abſent; but <hi>Love,</hi> on the other hand, removes this Evil from the Mind; and therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tends to reform and mend the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf: It is a means to free him from his Malice, which is not extinguiſhed, but rather inflamed by that which increaſeth his Fear: For, notwithſtanding that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Mind is as evil as before, Fear not at all abating his deſire of doing harm, but only cutting ſhort his Opportunity. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will (if it increaſe his Hatred, and leſſen his Opportunity) make him watch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very little occaſion of doing the Miſchief he deſigns. And it is hard for us to keep ſuch a conſtant and ſtrict Watch, as to give no Advantage to one who ſeeks it.</p>
            <p>If all theſe Reaſons which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, prevail not with us to put in practice this Precept of <hi>Loving our Enemies;</hi> yet let the Authority of our Lord and Saviour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us. <hi>I ſay unto you:</hi> I who practiſed thus my ſelf; I, whoſe you are, who have Right to you and all Men; I, who know what is good for you, better than you do your ſelves; <hi>I ſay unto you, Love your Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:96861:142"/>
All the Inference I ſhall make is, That then we muſt love thoſe who are not our Enemies, and ſtill much more our Friends, and thoſe that love us. If we muſt love thoſe that intend and practiſe Evil againſt us, much more thoſe that deſire and do us Good. If he that loves not his Enemy, be ſhort of a Chriſtian; he who loves not his Friend, is worſe than an Infidel: and if he be ſo, then the Name of Chriſt, will not ſave him. He that is a Pagan, tho he ſeem a Chriſtian, ſhall fall under the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Unbelievers.</p>
            <p>I conclude all, with reminding you of my Intention in this Diſcourſe, which was to ſerve the Deſigns of <hi>Love,</hi> by removing one of the greateſt Obſtacles of it out of the way. Let us all therefore be perſuaded to love univerſally; to be pleaſed with Good where-ever we ſee it, even in our <hi>Enemies;</hi> to procure it where-ever it is wanting, and there is any capacity of it. Let us be ſo wiſe, as to ſerve our ſelves and Religion of all the Conditions of Life which we are in, by making them ſerviceable to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good-will,</hi> which aſſuredly is the beſt Life we can live; that which will make us moſt acceptable to God, moſt eaſy and delightful to our ſelves, and moſt uſeful and pleaſant to others; it is the beſt that Earth or Heaven is capable of.</p>
            <p>God of his infinite Mercy grant unto us the true Spirit of Chriſt, that Spirit whoſe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:96861:143"/>
Fruits are Love, and Joy, and Peace, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Patience Goodneſs, Faith, and Temperance; that no Law may be againſt us; that we may begin to live that Life here, which we hope to live hereafter, and which glorified Saints and Angels now live in the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, you, the Life which God himſelf lives, who is <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf, to whom he Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Glory, and Praiſe. for ever and ever.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>MATTH. 23. 8, 9, 10.</bibl>
               <q>But be not ye called <hi>Rabbi;</hi> for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt, and all ye are Brethren. And call no Man your Father upon Earth; for one is your Father which is in Heaven: Neither be ye called Maſters; for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT appears from his Diſcourſe in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> that our Bleſſed Saviour had conceived a great and juſt Indignation againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> It was ſurely a great Anger, that moyed the meekeſt Man upon Earth ſo freely and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:96861:144"/>
to rebuke them. The Lamb of God here became a Lion: and he who was ordinarily a Man of Conſolations, is now turned into a Son of Thunder, denouncing Woes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; which we cannot conſtrue as the Iſſue of a hot and haſty Temper; for our Saviour's whole Carriage, both to his own Diſciples (who were ſuch as would have ſufficiently exerciſed a great Patience) as well as to his deadly Enemies, argues his admirable Mildneſs; and that he it was in whom that Prophecy was fulfilled, that <hi>he ſhould not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his Voice to be heard in the Streets. A bruiſed Reed he ſhould not break,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We may therefore conclude that there muſt be ſome juſt, and reaſonable, and great Cauſe of this great Indignation: and this we find was an Accumulation of great Wickedneſs in theſe Men, which received Aggravations,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From their Pretences to greater San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity than others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From their having greater Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of being better than others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe they being many of them in in publick place, their Practice muſt have a bad Influence on their Followers. For they who pretend Holineſs, and are wicked; they who are wicked, tho they have great helps to be good; and by being wicked cauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be ſo too, their Sin is exceeding ſinful.</p>
            <p>The Particulars for which our Saviour taxes them, were principally theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:96861:144"/>
1. Their great <hi>Pride. They loved the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Rooms at Feaſts, and the chief Seats in the Synagogues, and Greetings in the Markets, and to be called of Men,</hi> Rabbi, Rabbi, &amp;c. And under that Title affected a greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then is competible to Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their wretched <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> which ſhewed it ſelf in the Inſtances of <hi>devouring Widows Houses,</hi> of eſteeming the <hi>Gifts</hi> and the <hi>Gold</hi> above the <hi>Altar</hi> and the <hi>Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Their abominable <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> which appeared in their <hi>teaching others to do what themſelves would not do;</hi> in ſerving a carnal Intereſt by a Religious Carriage, <hi>making long Prayers in pretence, and wearing broader Phylacteries,</hi> that ſo under theſe Vizards they might paſs more unſuſpected, and have a better Opportunity to ſeize on their prey. This further appeared in their <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Obedience, chuſing to obey thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that were leaſt conſiderable, but yet make the greateſt appearance of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Holineſs, whilſt they omitted the weightier and more neceſſary, but which have leſs of Pomp and Oſtentation. They were much in external Waſhings and Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, neglecting to waſh their Hearts from Wickedneſs: They <hi>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:96861:145"/>
at laſt murdered the greateſt <hi>Prophet</hi> that ever the World had. Who could have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that they who pretended to ſuch as honourable Eſteem of the Dead, ſhould have ſo little Affection for the Living?</p>
            <p>The faireſt account of this Carriage is this; <hi>Nos mericles ca qua per didimus bona magni facimus, qua habimus nihili:</hi> But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the trueſt is, <hi>mortui non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But tho they could either conceal, or put a falſe gloſs on the Writings of dead Men; yet they could not either ſilence our Saviour, or by any Arts of interpreting c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the ſenſe of his Words: No, he would ſpeak and tell them their Faults truly and plainly.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like were thoſe great Crimes in theſe Enemies of our Religion, which our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> ſo ſeverely taxed, and threatned. Whereupon it might have been ſuppoſed that <hi>his Diſciples</hi> had been out of danger of theſe <hi>Evils,</hi> that they would not have come near the place where their Pilot had ſet a Sea-mark. But, (not to go further back) whoſe takes a view of the Chriſtian <hi>Church</hi> (at leaſt a great part of it in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts) as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> hath repreſented it, he'll ſay, that <hi>Phariſaiſm</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Now,</hi> as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> complains, <hi>the Diſciples of Chriſt are more truly Phariſees, than the Phariſees themſelves, and Chriſtians are become more ceremonious than Jews.</hi> How every where doth ſo far this in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, even in thoſe that ſhould have been Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of good Works?

            <p>There hath indeed been a very great and good Change made, for which thouſands of Souls muſt bleſs God: but that much of this <hi>Leaven of the Phariſees</hi> ſtill remains, is too notorious; that this <hi>Proteus,</hi> who can change himſelf into any Shape or Colour, who is of all Sects and Profeſſions, who can be <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Mahometan,</hi> or <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> a Member of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Geneva, Scotland</hi> or <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a <hi>Teacher</hi> or a <hi>Learner:</hi> That he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe ſeveral Forms; that this <hi>Phariſee</hi> is to be found in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church as well as the <hi>Jewish Synagogues,</hi> that he is both of <hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:96861:146"/>
That I be not miſtaken, I underſtand by all this, what our Saviour plainly taxes, <hi>viz.</hi> a Spirit of <hi>Pride</hi> that affects, and arrogates undeſerved <hi>Titles,</hi> and a <hi>Power</hi> which no Man can reaſonably challenge; of <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or an Humour of monopolizing all the World; a <hi>neglect</hi> of the <hi>greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> with endeavours to make amends by a <hi>Zeal</hi> in the <hi>leſſer matters.</hi> An exact Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Externals, with a Supine Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Intrinſicks and Eſſentials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; ſuch are <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice, Love</hi> to God and Men. This is what I underſtand by a <hi>Phariſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt I am on this Argument I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert this neceſſary Caution, that all I aim at, is to tax the Vices of ſome Men in our Church, not to diſparage all.</p>
            <p>Let none therefore take occaſion from what I ſay, to wreſt my Words, and think me an Enemy to the Church, who if I had been ſo, I ſhould then have been ſilent, or flatter'd and ſaid, <hi>all is well.</hi> Let none be ſo unreaſonably ſuſpicious of my honeſt Intentions, as to think me to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining, whilſt I am really uſing the beſt Method I know to build and ſettle. That I take to be a free and plain cenſuring, a publick Notice-taking of thoſe Sins that are done openly in the Face of the Sun: ſuch we are guilty of, and theſe are the Diſturbers of our Peace, theſe ſhake our Foundations: Theſe are they that cauſe Earthquakes, and raiſe thoſe Tempeſts that threaten our Subverſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:96861:146"/>
Whilſt we pretend to inſtruct others who are groſly ignorant our ſelves, to exhort them to a diligent Obſervance of thoſe Commands which we neglect, and ſo pull down what we would ſeem to build: Whilſt we are frequently guilty of profane Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Intemperance, and other Immoralities, we open other Mens Mouths, but ſtop our own: for we cannot condemn that in them, which we allow in our ſelves; nor can they approve that in us, which we have taught to condemn in them.</p>
            <p>Whilſt we live in the neglect of God, are really without any Senſe of, or Love to him in our Minds, have not Faith and Hope in him: Whilſt we are void of true Love to Men, are ſo far from Charity, from Bounty and Kindneſs, that we are not Juſt: Whilſt we omit <hi>Judgment, Mercy and Faith,</hi> tho we be very punctual in all leſſer Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, both of God's and the Churches Commands; we are no better than they who tithed <hi>Mint, and Aniſe, and Cummin,</hi> and <hi>made long Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we be ſuch, our Saviour threatens us, and Men not only threaten us, but our way too; by ſuch Practices a <hi>good way is evil ſpoken of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aſſuredly thoſe are the things that have given Men that Advantage againſt us, which elſe they could never have had; for, <hi>Who ſhall harm us if we do well?</hi> No certainly, if we lived in the Love of God and of all Men, in Humility and meekneſs, in Temperance, in Juſtice, and Truth, in Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96861:147"/>
tho our Church-Conſtitutions were worſe than (in the Senſe of thoſe that think them bad) they are, yet they would be accounted very tolerable. And whilſt Men ſee them ſo well agreeing, ſo very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a good Life, ſurely they would not ſo eaſily ſeparate from us.</p>
            <p>But when it is too too evident that Men do not grow better but worſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Communion with us; others will be afraid of entring into that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Pagans</hi> would be prone to think, that the <hi>Cup of the Lord</hi> is indeed a <hi>Cup of Devils;</hi> the <hi>Circean</hi> Cup, which turns Men into Swine. And ſuch as find fault with the Conſtitutions of our Church, will the ſame way conclude, that it is our <hi>Croſs,</hi> or <hi>Surplice,</hi> or <hi>Kneeling,</hi> or <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> that makes us ſo bad. Which Opinion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be confuted by any Argument ſo well, as by a good Life, this will do it effectually: When Men ſhall gather theſe good Fruits in abundance, they will think the Root and Tree good that bears them; when they ſee us that profeſs our ſelves <hi>Sons</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Vertuous and truely Chriſtian, they will think the better of our Mother for our ſakes.</p>
            <p>We all know it was (principally) Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Piety, and an excellent Vertue, which ſhone forth in the Lives of its firſt Profeſſors, that ſo much commanded Chriſtianity, and made it ſo ſucceſsful in the World: and it muſt be the ſame good Life, that muſt gain Proſelites to our Church. If we, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

of it, live badly, if Men ſhall be made worſe by their Society with us, they will not fear, but deſire <hi>Excommunication;</hi> they will join themſelves to <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To conclude this Digreſſion (which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Love and Faithfulneſs have put the upon); as we deſire our Religion ſhould thrive, the Name of our Saviour be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Peace continue, our own Church be unſhaken from its Foundations; as we would be in <hi>Favour with God and Men,</hi> let us lay aſide Pride, Covetouſneſs, Hypocriſy: Let us do the greater matters, and <hi>not leave the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>It is Vertue that puts an Eſteem upon Men, it makes their Countenances lovely, their Words to be remembred; it caſts a Perfume on all that Men do or ſay, gives e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Word and Action a rich Scent: This will make our ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This is the beſt way, the only Method I know to beget in Men a good Eſteem of our ſelves, and of our Way. Whoſoever neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects this, whilſt he pretends to be a Friend to the Church, he is, an Enemy to Chriſt. And how many ſuch there are, who falſly arrogate to themſelves that honourable Name, of <hi>Sons</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but are indeed Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> who think to have their Vices as well as themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted; who look upon Conformity to the Commands of the Church, as making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for their Diſobedience to Chriſt's; who put on our form as a Cloke of Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Alas! How many ſuch <hi>baſe Sons</hi> as theſe is our <hi>Mother</hi> diſcredited with?

            <p>If any, for whom neither God, nor the Church intends the Bleſſing, ſhall get the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Childrens Garments, and lie, feigning themſelves to be her Off-ſpring, when they are not, and ſo get a ſhare in the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by abuſing her Charity; Shall ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be blamed? Why alas! like good old <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſhe is impos'd upon; her own great Sincerity makes her think her Children have no more Guilt than her ſelf, and her mighty <hi>Charity covers their Sins</hi> from her.</p>

Thus it may be for a time, but I hope ere long the Fathers in our Church will find out thoſe amongſt us, <hi>who walk ſo as that they are Enemies, &amp;c.</hi> And when they have found them, will uſe that Severity which is meet for ſo groſs Miſdemeanours; as ſome of them have already in their Viſitations declared they will. And may they proſper, who after the Example of our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>whip out of the Temple</hi> all thoſe <hi>Money-Changers,</hi> thoſe Religious Merchants, whoſe Devotion is a Trade, their Church a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Place; thoſe who buy and ſell, who have turned the <hi>Houſe of Prayer into a Den of Thieves,</hi> have made the Habitation of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a place of Uncleanneſs. May they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their oppoſition to all Vice, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it; and may they ſerve in the Advancement of the Kingdom, and Name of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour.</p>
            <p>I have now done with this Digreſſion, for which I have only this to plead, that it came from a great Affection to, and a ſincere Aim at our Churches Good.</p>
            <p>To return then to Words of the Text, which intimate to us one fundamental Error of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> on which much of their falſe Opinions, as well as bad Practice was built: It was this, They aſcribed to Men more than their due, and to God Ieſs; they took too much from him, and gave too much to them; made God no God, by making Men Gods: this I think to be implied in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:96861:149"/>
From hence it was, that they were ſo ſtrict and zealous in obſerving the <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Men, whilſt they were careleſs of the <hi>Commands</hi> of God. They had expreſly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their <hi>Rabbies</hi> as <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to a Superiour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded themſelves under neceſſary Obedience to their Commands, and a Faith in their Opinions.</p>
            <p>They had not ſo explicitly reſigned up their Underſtanding and Will to God, whence he was not believed, or obeyed as they were; and therefore they were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to <hi>tithe Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin;</hi> but very indifferent to keep <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> They had reſolved their Faith into a very fallible Authority, and their Obedience to the Determinations of a Will ſubject to Miſguidance, which for any Man to do univerſally, cannot be without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Danger. For in this caſe the <hi>Blind lead the Blind,</hi> and ſuch our Saviour tells us the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were.</p>
            <p>That this was their Miſcarriage, appears from our Saviour's Exhortation to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which plainly implies an Oppoſition to the Practice of the Phariſees.</p>
            <p>He will not have his Diſciples, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, to arrogate to themſelves, or attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to others, that which is God's peculiar, or is proper to himſelf, whom God has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, <hi>viz.</hi> To be Abſolute over Mens Faith or Manners.

Thus having declared what I take to be the true Senſe of the Words, it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for me to add any more, to ſhew their Miſtake, who think from this place, that the uſe of theſe Words, <hi>Maſter, Father,</hi> &amp;c. is forbidden. No ſurely, our Saviour did not condemn the Words, but as they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a bad Signification, and did humour Mens Pride.</p>
            <p>He was diſpleas'd that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> would, under theſe Titles, arrogate a Power that did not belong to them; and that they could be ſo hugely pleaſed with a Lie of their own making; that they could be delighted with the empty Titles of <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Doctor,</hi> which themſelves had aſſumed.</p>
            <p>And it is a ſufficient Argument, that he did not forbid the uſe of theſe Titles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe himſelf allowed and uſed that of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Mother.</hi> And his Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> called himſelf a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Teacher</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> which we muſt think he would not have done, if he had underſtood our Saviour to have abſolutely forbid it; and ſurely he would have underſtood it, if it had been ſo.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid what I think neceſſary for the Explication of theſe Words, I proceed in the next place to lay down thoſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which may be deduced from, and alſo thoſe that are more expreſly contained in the Words.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Chriſtians have a <hi>Maſter</hi> and a <hi>Father.</hi>

In the largeſt Notion wherein theſe Words are ſometimes taken, it is true of all Men in the World: for every Man living is dependent and ſubject, they may all make that Confeſſion: <hi>It is he that has made us, and not we our ſelves; we are his People, and the Sheep of his Paſture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true alſo in that more reſtrained Senſe, wherein theſe Titles ſignify <hi>inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>teaching</hi> (and thus I underſtand them here) for all Men will acknowledg ſome <hi>Superiour,</hi> who teaches them, and from whom they can make no <hi>Appeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is very natural to the Mind of every Man thus to think, will appear, if we conſider how generally the moſt part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the Teſtimonies of Men: and it is almoſt neceſſary that both they and others ſhould do ſo, if we conſider the way we are all educated; for we take all our Words upon truſt from others, and we derive our Actions too from an Imitation of what we ſee them do. And whilſt we do thus, we acknowledg Superiours. And for them that are more wiſe, that perceive themſelves to ſtand upon pretty equal Ground with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, yet they find they are liable to be deceived, and therefore they make their laſt Appeal to the Veracity and Goodneſs of God. This made the Principle, from which they infer the Truth and Certainty of all the Knowledg they have.</p>
            <p>There is no Man who conſiders himſelf, and his ways of working, but will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg he is beholden to ſome other than

            <p>Now every Man doth thus: upon ſeveral Motions he hath divers Thoughts ſuggeſted to him, which without demur, without all heſitancy he entertains and proceeds to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; he doubts not of the Teſtimony which his Senſes bring in, and proceeds forthwith to paſs Judgment.

               </gap>ſe Thoughts, he acquioſces there. But for Chriſtians, their very Name implies them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have a <hi>Maſter,</hi>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:96861:151"/>
one whom they believe and follow. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is a Believer, and ſo every Scholar ought to be, and they profeſs themſelves to be the <hi>Scholars</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If this be true of all Chriſtians, that they have a <hi>Maſter,</hi> a <hi>Father,</hi> then none of them are to aſſume this Honour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They muſt carry themſelves as <hi>Fellow-Scholars,</hi> as <hi>Brethren;</hi> that is, they muſt not propoſe their <hi>own Doctrines,</hi> (ſuch as are properly their own) which they have not received from their <hi>Maſter,</hi> to be aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to as <hi>infallible:</hi> Indeed they muſt not propoſe them at all, ſo as to determine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for in ſo doing they deſert their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, forget they are but <hi>Scholars.</hi> If they will propound to others <hi>that</hi> which ſhall determine them, it muſt be their <hi>Maſter's,</hi> not their <hi>own;</hi> for otherwiſe they will not be ſo much <hi>Praecones &amp; Nuncii,</hi> as <hi>Inventores &amp; Autores Dogmatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that demand Mens Aſſent to their Opinions, and Obedience to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which are <hi>theirs,</hi> and not their <hi>Maſter's,</hi> do by this make themſelves <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All they then fall under Cenſure, who are <hi>Creed-Coiners,</hi> or <hi>Law-makers</hi> in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; who frame Creeds, and make Laws of their own, ſuch as they had not from the <hi>Father</hi> of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Chriſtians have but one <hi>Maſter,</hi> but one <hi>Father.</hi>

Indeed if we ſuppoſe the Inſtitution ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, there can be no more than one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be but One <hi>Infallible,</hi> and we cannot imagine that the Chriſtians would ſet up any other, by whom they would be univerſally and abſolutely determined.</p>
            <p>Tho there be many Names that have propoſed the Chriſtian Doctrine to us, and from whom we cannot appeal; yet all their Authority is derived from <hi>One,</hi> and it is by his Commiſſion that they have done it. They are his Heralds, and he hath authorized them. They propoſe his Doctrine, and not their own; his Articles and Canons: That they are ſo, we are aſſured, becauſe he bears them witneſs by Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and many mighty Works. And that they are his, is further evident from this, that they are very agreeing with, and in purſuit of the Revelation which is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly his.</p>
            <p>If thus, whence are thoſe diverſities of Names amongſt us? <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>I of</hi> Apollo, <hi>a third of</hi> Cephas: One is a <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iifician,</hi> another a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> a third a <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt,</hi> a fourth an <hi>Arminian:</hi> Are any of theſe our <hi>Fathers?</hi> If they be not, why are we called by their <hi>Names?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why ſhould any of theſe dividing <hi>Names</hi> be heard amongſt us? Are not we all the Children of one <hi>Father,</hi> the Diſciples of one <hi>Maſter,</hi> the Servants of one <hi>Lord?</hi> Are we not <hi>Brethren?</hi> why ſhould we then fall out? Are we not Fellow-Scholars of one and the ſame <hi>Maſter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:96861:152"/>
Yes, it will be ſaid, we are ſo indeed, but we may differ about our <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Sence. <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> were both <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but yet agreed not. We all own the ſame Maſter, but yet cannot agree in his Mind, in many both Articles of Faith, and Rules of Life.</p>
            <p>This is granted, and yet the Expedient whereby Unity may be preſerved in the Church is not hard, if we come with peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Minds, if we indeed deſire it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this caſe, if we can but ſuppoſe our ſelves fallible in interpreting, and grant our Brethren a liberty of judging; if we can think the Words capable of the Sence they give, or can but believe that they think them ſo, tho we do not; if the Sence they put upon them be not in it ſelf oppoſite to, and inconſiſtent with the Foundations of Faith, a <hi>good Life,</hi> the great Deſign of our Maſter, and only neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Or tho their Conſtruction be in its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency deſtructive of a good Life, yet if it be not ſo in them; if notwithſtanding this difference in (perhaps) ſome obſcure and great Myſtery, they agree with us in all that is plain, and their Practice is ſuitable to the Rules of our Maſter; in this caſe I ſee no reaſon to diſown them, as no Chriſtians; and whilſt we own them as Chriſtians, we muſt love them as Brethren.</p>
            <p>Perhaps their Underſtanding is ſhort of mine, (but perhaps alſo mine may be ſhort of theirs) ſhall I not therefore bear with them? Yes, as long as they hold the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:96861:153"/>
tho they <hi>build on it Wood, Hay, Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> &amp;c. they muſt not be rejected; for they ſhall be ſaved, tho it be as <hi>by Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Apoſtle's Reſolution in the like caſe ſhould be ours: <hi>If in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal this unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it may be objected;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Doth not this abridg them of their liberty of thinking, and conſequently hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Improvement which might be in a free Enquiry after Truth, which the Mind would make, that is not determined by the Dictates of others?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they do thus give up themſelves abſolutely to the determination of one, is agreeable to the beſt Reaſon. If there be One who is infallible, who neither can be deceived, nor deceive; it is moſt highly rational to reſign up our ſelves, to believe and obey him. No Man can aſſent on better Evidence, or act on better Reaſon, than the determination of ſuch an One, and ſuch an One as he is, into whoſe Authority Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have reſolved their Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This no way prejudices, but rather advantages the true Uſe of our Reaſon; for it determines us to examine all Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that pretend an infallible Authority, whether they do not contradict thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which we know are infallible. This Courſe we are put upon, that we may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our ſelves from Cheats; for if that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96861:153"/>
which is propoſed, contradict the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples commonly received, and which all Men take as true, we have reaſon to ſuſpect it, and muſt think, that out <hi>Maſter</hi> who taught us theſe, if he be wiſe and good, did not teach us this.</p>
            <p>But then (becauſe Principles common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received may be doubted by ſome, and ſome granted by all perhaps may be falſe) if any <hi>Doctrine</hi> be propoſed to be believed, which is impoſſible to be believed, that cannot come from him who is <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I account it impoſſible for a Man to aſſent to contradictory Propoſitions, whether the Contradiction be expreſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit; for it is all one to ſay, <hi>A Man is reaſonable, and not reaſonable,</hi> and, <hi>A Man is a Stone.</hi> They therefore that would bring in Contradictions into our Religion, and aſſert that there are Doctrines in it, which are not only above our Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but are plainly repugnane to the true Principles of Reaſon, as well as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are a great Offence to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and lay a ſure Foundation of Mens rejecting it; for they put them upon doing what they cannot do: I ſay, what they cannot, not only becauſe of the Corruption and Weakneſs, but becauſe of the Nature of our Faculties.</p>
            <p>In this caſe a Man muſt either forſake his Religion, or his Reaſon: And I know not to what purpoſe any ſhould keep his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if he forſake his Reaſon; nor indeed
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96861:154"/>
do I ſee how he can do it, if his Religion be reaſonable; and his Reaſon will ſignify little, if Contradictions may be true.</p>
            <p>By all this I blame their Practice, who affix a Sence to the Scriptures, and to thoſe Confeſſions of Faith, which the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſhould be publickly uſed, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious; and then to make the beſt of their Miſcarriage, and keep their own Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in credit, will tell us we muſt believe Contradictions; when they may as well bid the Sun give forth darkneſs, or the Fire to wet, and the Water to burn.</p>
            <p>For all this they pretend an Authority into which we are to reſolve our Faith, not conſidering that they deny the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which they pretend: for can it be conſiſtent with the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of a Superior, to oblige his Subjects to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibles, to require them to do what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant and deſtructive to their Natures?</p>
            <p>Whoſoever therefore have, under the Pretext of ſuch an uncontroulable Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ventured ſo far in the Explication of the Myſteries of our Religion, that they have uſed ſuch Words as in their moſt proper and uſual Senſe, imply manifeſt Contradictions, they have been no Friends to the Chriſtian Faith. And whatſoever they ſay, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>Father</hi> will not dertermine his Sons to believe Contradictions. But I conclude this ſecond Propoſition with this practical Inference.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:96861:154"/>
If Chriſtians have but one <hi>Maſter,</hi> one <hi>Father,</hi> then they muſt own his <hi>Authority;</hi> that is, believe his <hi>Revelations,</hi> obey his <hi>Commands</hi> without any doubt or diſpute: for his Authority is undeniable, his Will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable, no Appeal to be made from his Determination. Therefore aſſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out debate, obey without demur. If we have a <hi>Father,</hi> give him his <hi>Honour;</hi> and a <hi>Maſter,</hi> let him have his <hi>Fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>There is no Man upon Earth that is the Chriſtian's Father or Maſter</hi> None by whoſe Senſe he is to be abſolutely, neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. He needs not to reſolve his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience into any Mans or Mens Authority. Our Religion is ſo very excellent and wiſe, that it could not be of humane Original. Surely this <hi>Tree of Life</hi> never grew firſt in an Earthly <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> but was tranſplanted from ſome more excellent Soil, and ſet in this red Earth.</p>
            <p>Beſides; if we conſider the Deſign of it, it is to prepare Men for the <hi>Heavenly Life,</hi> which it doth, by begetting in them ſuch Perſwaſions and Affections, and teaching them to act here, juſt as they do <hi>there.</hi> Therefore our Creed and Law muſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be a brief Tranſcript of ſome of theirs; and none can tell what theirs is, but he that made it, God. Religion, like Water, will not riſe higher than the Spring; if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its Origine from this Earth only, it will not riſe and raiſe us up with it to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:96861:155"/>
But if this be true, that we have no <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> on Earth, how is it that: we hear ſo much of an Infallible <hi>Judg:</hi> either an old Man ſitting in a Chair at <hi>Rome:</hi> Or elſe a <hi>Synod</hi> of Doctors, for the moſt part packed together by a Faction, and deſigned to drive on ſome Secular Intereſt? For, ſuch have been many Councils, tho not all.</p>
            <p>But what mean thoſe Pretenders that they thus take upon them? Will they decide all our Controverſies end our Debates? An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Attempt! But will they do it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? Yes, effectually; and if any doubt of their Decrees, they ſhall be quickly convinced by a light burning Fire. They'l take care to keep thoſe that are under them iniIgno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they ſhall not have Knowledg enough to queſtion their Determinations; Or, if any little Light do break through all the Curtains they have drawn, then they afright them with <hi>Anathema's;</hi> and if theſe will not do neither, they ſhall to the <hi>Stake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How grievouſly the Chriſtian World hath been abuſed by theſe Practices, is too notorious; whilſt, theſe falſe Fathers do not at all ſerve the Deſigns of Truth and Piety, but merely of their own Ambition and Covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding what I have ſaid of thoſe Conventions that are politickly and unwarrantably peck'd together by a Party, for the holding up of a Faction, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a carnal Intereſt; I would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to detract in the leaſt from a duly congregated <hi>Synod</hi> of wiſe and learned Men
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96861:155"/>
their juſt <hi>Authority:</hi> which yet I muſt think doth not amount to that of a <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Rabbi,</hi> as here explained. They are not abſolute, cannot determine univerſally.</p>
            <p>But have they no Power in determining? What is it? Tho this be an Argument fitter for a larger Diſcourſe; yet to prevent Miſtakes and Abuſe of what I have ſaid, I ſhall here ſpeak ſomewhat of my Mind, in two or three Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They who cannot be ſuppoſed to have any better Reaſon than the Authority of a <hi>Synod,</hi> ſhould be determined by them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters both of Faith and Practice. That this may be the caſe of the Vulgar, I doubt not. Many are in the ſtate of Children, who at firſt muſt take all on truſt, and it is beſt for them in that State ſo to do, tho afterwards they may ſee how they have been impoſed upon, and lay aſide thoſe infant-Prejudices: the common People firſt believe and obey, becauſe a Company of wiſe and learned Men tell them, that what is propoſed is true and good; but afterwards theſe Mens Reaſon may be more improved, they may have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Arguments to believe, and higher Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to obey, than their Word; and may ſay as the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> we now believe, not becauſe of your Words, but becauſe we our ſelves ſee.</p>
            <p>The ground of this firſt Poſition is, that Men are to be determined to aſſent or act by the beſt Arguments they can have. Now I ſuppoſe very many in ſo low a Condition, that this is the beſt they can meet with, <hi>viz.</hi>

the Authority of a <hi>Synod;</hi> nay, many times the Determination of a ſingle Man. <hi>This</hi> is indeed a pitious Caſe, when in all matters of Good and Evil, true and falſe, a Man muſt relie on anothers Teſtimony: and yet it had not been ſo ſad, if Men that had Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Knowledg enough, had had more of Honeſty; but they have been ſo unfaithful to their Truſts, that they have very much impair'd their Credit with the World. I underſtand the Popiſh Councils eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More improved Men, where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is diſputable, and ſomewhat equal, and unconcluding Arguments on both ſides ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if a Synod interpoſe their Authority, I think, ſhould be determin'd by that; yet not ſo far as to exclude all after-Thoughts, they muſt leave room for them. For if their Reaſons againſt the Synod's Determinations ſhould prove concluding, and afterwards appear evidently ſo, they need not continue under that former Determination.</p>
            <p>In this caſe a Man muſt compare his own beſt Arguments with that of the Teſtimony of thoſe Men; that is, he muſt conſider as well as he can, not only whether they be wiſer than himſelf, (which will be granted) but alſo whether they be honeſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That I may ſhew whither their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity cannot reach, I lay down this Poſition: That where the Synod ſhall determine that to be believed, which is, and appears re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to it ſelf, to granted Principles of Reaſon, or plain Scriptures; or where they ſhall enjoyn that to be done, which is, and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96861:156"/>
appears intrinſecally and eternally evil; or, which I can certainly conclude, is in thoſe Circumſtances evil, they are not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or obeyed. Of this nature I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and worſhipping <hi>Images,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What the Senſe of our Church is in this matter, appears by the 6th, 20th, 21ſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. <hi>The Scripture containeth all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation; ſo that whatſoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any Man that it ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as an Article of Faith, or be thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite or neceſſary to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 20th: <hi>It is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing contrary to God's Word written; neither may it ſo expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherefore the Church, tho it be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Keeper of Holy Writ, yet as it ought not to decree any thing againſt the ſame, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſame ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed for neceſſity of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for Councils: In the 21ſt after it is declared, <hi>that they have erred, and may err,</hi> it is concluded: <hi>Wherefore things ordained by them as neceſſary to Salvation, have neither Strength nor Authority; unleſs it may be declared that they be taken out of Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence is there ſuch an Inequality, that any ſhould undertake thus the Guidance of others? Were they born with more Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than their Brethren? Or have they had ſo much better Opportunities to get it?
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96861:157"/>
Or, hath God extraordinarily conveyed it to them? And doth he give them Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Let them produce it: God's Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a Power to work Miracles, which if I ſee exerted in Atteſtation of a Doctrine agreeable to Principles of Reaſon and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then I will believe ſuch a Man to be God's Inſtrument; I will yield up my ſelf to be determined by him in all Particulars, where I do not ſee a Contradiction to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Scripture.</p>
            <p n="4">4: God is the Chriſtians only Father, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt their only Maſter. <hi>Grosius</hi> tells us that <gap reason="foreign">

They may alſo ſit down quietly and reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Shadow of Divine Goodneſs, nor fear that the Maſter ſhould himſelf be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, for his Underſtanding is infinite; nor yet deceive them, becauſe his Love is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If any ſhall ask, Where we are to expect thoſe <hi>Decreta Factis,</hi> thoſe Articles of Faith, and Rules of Life, which he hath given us?</p>
            <p>I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the plain Principles of <hi>Reaſan,</hi> and the neceſſary Concluſions that flow from them: Such there are, from whence no Appeal can be made, of whoſe Truth we cannot doubt. Notwithſtanding all that the <hi>Sceptick</hi> can ſay, we need not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in very many Caſes, and in ſome we cannot.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Revelations</hi> made by Men, with whom God was in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Such were <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> but eſpecially the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf, with whom God was preſent in a far more extraordinary manner, and ſo as he was with none other, for he was <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> with him. God in him aſſumed our Nature into Union with himſelf. <hi>God was manifeſt in the Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I ſay, God was with them, I mean that an extraordinary <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Holineſs reſted</hi> upon them, accompanied with a Power of working Miracles. Beſides; they were extraordinarily inſpired with a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> which they then delivered, and is now recorded in Scripture: Many of which were indeed immediately directed to others, and therefore concern us no further, than a Parity of Reaſon makes them: that part
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96861:158"/>
of thoſe Writings which moſt belong to us, is the Sayings of our Lord, and all the reſt ſo far as is conſiſtent with and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them.</p>
            <p>The Inference that follows from this, is, That we would behave our ſelves toward our <hi>Maſter</hi> as it becomes us; that is, receive his Inſtructions, follow his Directions, be wholly reſigned up to him, acquieſce in his Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, believe what he reports without diſpute, obey what he commands without demur: Give full aſſent to the <hi>Principles</hi> of natural Reaſon, give a ready Obedience to the <hi>Natural Law.</hi> Theſe were the firſt <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> that ever were given. This was the <hi>Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> when there was yet no written Word; and theſe <hi>Laws</hi> were engraven in <hi>the Heart,</hi> before the <hi>two Tables</hi> of Stone were hewen.</p>
            <p>Since God hath ſet out a large and fair Edition of theſe Articles and Canons in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> which are an Expoſition of what was before imprinted in Man's Nature. The firſt Edition was in danger to be loſt, and therefore our <hi>good Maſter</hi> made Proviſion for us in this ſecond.</p>
            <p>This is then our Duty to refer all to thoſe <hi>Teachings of God,</hi> whoſe <hi>Inſpiration</hi> gives <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> whoſe <hi>Word</hi> makes <hi>wiſe the Simple.</hi> If any therefore <hi>ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God;</hi> and let us, as the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> judg by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:96861:158"/>
the things they ſay <hi>be ſo</hi> or not. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi> (where we doubt): for, <hi>if they ſpeak not according to this, it is becauſe they have no Morning in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I conclude this Particular, I cannot but take notice of the excellent Condition of Chriſtians. See our <hi>Liberty,</hi> our <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> both theſe appear in that we are not determin'd by any thing, but what appears to be <hi>of God:</hi> He is our only abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign. If any on Earth challenge a Power over us, it is only under God; and we are ſubject to them in and for him, and becauſe by being ſo, we obey him: And there is no Man living, whom we are bound to believe on his own Authorityl he muſt produce his Reaſon, or cite his Text: Or, if he propoſe ſome new Doctrine, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with theſe, and he muſt work his Miracle.</p>
            <p>If, any Man therefore demand my Aſſent to his Doctrine, I may and muſt ask for his Authority: and if he have no more than his <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> I muſt tell him, he is not my <hi>Maſter,</hi> nor any Man on Earth, but <hi>One,</hi> even <hi>Christ.</hi> Let us then ſcorn to live in Slavery to any Mans Opinions; but <hi>ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free.</hi> If we fail to do this, we are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſelves, and our <hi>Maſter</hi> too, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our Liberty, we are in manifeſt danger of erring, we give from him the Honour
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:96861:159"/>
that is due to him; he will be jealous of this piece as well as any other. Indeed it is as great as any; it is the Honour of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs. Whoſoever fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſces in any Man's Authority, and upon his ſingle Teſtimony ſuperpercedes further reaſoning, he aſcribes to him infallibility, and makes him a God.</p>
            <p>And then how exceedingly doth Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity ennoble us? by which we are taught to conſider God in all we do, and own no Authority but his.</p>
            <p>Laſtly; We muſt infer, from this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of our Lord, that we ſhould not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dury aſſume or attribute Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>es of Honour to our ſelves or others. That is,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. We ſhould not over-earneſtly deſire thoſe that are deſerved and due. Nor,</item>
               <item>2. Much leſs affect ſuch as are falſe, and above our Merit.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To do thus, proceeds from an Ambition, that ill becomes the Diſciples of him that was ſo exceeding lowly: who tho he was <hi>Lord of all,</hi> yet came here into the World, <hi>not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we much affect theſe Titles, tho de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, it is from a weak Underſtanding: But if we ſeek an Honour above our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert (to omit other Conſiderations) we ſhall loſe that which we have: whilſt we
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:96861:159"/>
catch at theſe Shadows we ſhall loſe what we are poſſeſs'd of.</p>
            <p>Never was <hi>Alexander</hi> more below a Man, than when he affected to be a God. A Sword and Spear did get him more Renown than the Thunderbolts with which he vvas pictured. This vvas our firſt Parents Sin, to deſire to be <hi>as God;</hi> let it not be ours. No, let us not rob God, but give him that vvhich is his, and to Man vvhat belongs to him.</p>

This is it that broaches the Doctrine of Indulgences for Sins to come, of Maſſes for the Dead, and the like: which whoſoever conſiders in their tendencies, I doubt not but they'll be ſatisfied it's the Intereſt of Money, not of Goodneſs, that is carried on by the Aſſerters of thoſe Opinions; that they ſerve <hi>Mammon,</hi> and their Religion is <hi>Covetouſneſs.</hi>

            <p>This Inordinacy of Deſire turns Apoſtles into <hi>Judas</hi>'s, Paſtors into Robbers, the <hi>Houſe of Prayer</hi> into a <hi>Den of Thieves;</hi> and it doth as eaſily transform the Flocks of Sheep into Herds of Wolves: For, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Sheep's Coat and Shape, if there be a ravening <hi>Appetite,</hi> an unſatisfied <hi>Deſire,</hi> 'tis a Wolf, tho it ſeem a Sheep, a <hi>Wolf in Sheeps cloathing.</hi>

If the <hi>Spiritual Men,</hi> whoſe <hi>Converſe is in Heaven,</hi> yet be ſo much within the Influences of this Earth; the <hi>Laity,</hi> they whoſe Employment is in it, muſt be more under the power of them. If the Light of the Heavenly Bodies be obſcured by terreſtrial Vapors; then the Candle which is in the Earth, muſt be put out by its Damps. And if the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> be under the Power of Deſire, it's not to be imagin'd, that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Scholars, or the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Mahomes,</hi> or the Worſhippers of

            <p>We'll therefore take it for granted, that if Chriſtendom be not exempt from this Tyranny of Deſire, the reſt of the World is not: If the Goſpel hath not rectified Mens Affections, neither the Pentateuch, nor the Alcoran, nor the Traditions of the Gentiles, have or can do it.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, that Deſire hath an Empire further extended than ever they had, who would be call'd Lords of the World. We'll next conſider how this Catholick King, this univerſal Biſhop, this proud <hi>Sultan,</hi> this great <hi>Cham</hi> manages his Affairs.</p>
            <p>And we may obſerve that this <hi>

Where he hopes to gain the Affections of his Subjects, he practiſes Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, gratifies them tho to then Ruine; and pleaſes, tho in that he undoes them. Where they will not love, they ſhall fear; and if he cannot court them by Flatteries, he will rule them as a Tyrant; and in both ways his Government is arbitrary and irregular.</p>
            <p>Either Laws are never made, or never kept in his Dominions.

            <p>The calm and quiet Deciſions of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, that uſed to be in Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, where Reaſon ruled, are either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid aſide, or ſtrangely degenerate; and ſo either to bad purpoſe, or to none at all.</p>
            <p>Here the Clients do not conſider <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but <hi>Intereſt;</hi> neither do they regard Right or Title, if they can make the leaſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and therefore will deſire in their Advocates not Law, but Oratory and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry.</p>
            <p>They will alſo ſuborn Witneſſes that ſhall ſwear for Hire, not for Truth, and will corrupt their Judges to pervert the Senſe of the Law; and under colour of Juſtice, to be unjuſt.</p>
            <p>In theſe Courts the richeſt Client hath moſt Right, and the beſt Purſe carries the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Or, if this will not do, they try another. If they either want Craft or Money, they will fly to Power; if they cannot out-wit their Neighbours, they will try to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter them; if the Court and the Law will not give it for them, they'll ſee what the Camp and Army will.</p>

            <p>Thus I have given a brief Repreſentation of the State where <hi>Deſire</hi> rules, by which <hi>Fiction</hi> we may a little gueſs at the <hi>Truth</hi> of Things, and how they are, and have been, and are likely to be in the World, becauſe of <hi>Covetouſneſs.</hi>

               <hi>Object.</hi> That, may ſome think, is a <hi>hard ſaying;</hi> Doth God oblige us to impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Or, how can he require this of us, who made it natural to us to deſire? Is he fallen out with himſelf, or diſpleaſed with the works of his own Hands? Doth he firſt give us a faculty, and then forbid us to uſe it? Or, is Chriſtianity a piece of Stoiciſm? Doth our Religion teach us to maim our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? to ceaſe to be Men? Doth it inſtruct us unto Apathy? Is this the perfection it points and leads to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Far be it from us to ſuffer ſuch a blemiſh as this to lie on our Profeſſion; let none have ſuch an unworthy thought of our <hi>Religion,</hi> as if it ſhould be at variance with <hi>Nature,</hi> as if the <hi>Diſciple</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> could not be a <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Man:</hi> For ſurely, never any Religion in the World did ſo be-friend, nor was ſo perfective of Humane Nature as ours. And 'tis only a miſtake of the true meaning of theſe Words, that can make any to think otherwiſe. For they do not (as they ſeem) forbid all <hi>Deſire,</hi> but only that which is <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable,</hi> of that which we either have not, or cannot have a Right to.</p>
            <p>This appears, becauſe the word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is <hi>mediae ſignificationis</hi> in all Writings; and may indifferently ſignifie good or ill, and in Scripture ſeems generally to be taken in the worſer part: and ſo our Interpreters uſually render it by <hi>Concupiſence</hi> or <hi>Coveting,</hi> which words we now generally underſtand in an ill ſence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:96861:166"/>
Beſides; theſe words refer to the tenth <hi>Command</hi> of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> (and that ſpeaks of other Mens Goods) they are an Abridgment of it; and yet, becauſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Deſire is not expreſſed, may give us the liberty of a larger Diſcourſe, than if we only confined our ſelves to ſpeak of deſiring what is another Man's. And I ſhall accordingly,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Diſcourſe briefly and in general, what may, and what may not be deſired, what Deſires are approved or forbidden. And then more particularly,</p>
            <p n="2">II. How far the deſires of another Man's Goods are prohibited. And here it will be requiſite to diſcourſe what that is which gives <hi>Propriety,</hi> and makes any thing to be a Man's Peculiar.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I ſhall offer ſome Conſiderations, which both by perſwading and directing, may aſſiſt us in the reſtraining all unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and unjuſt Deſires.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning <hi>Deſires</hi> in general: I will not go about to prove, but will ſuppoſe that all are not evil, but that ſome are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nay and good too; that ſome may and ſhould be, are not only matters of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but Duty.</p>
            <p>This is Evident to him that conſiders that they are natural to us, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; that Humane nature cannot in this
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96861:167"/>
Eſtate be without them. Alſo that many of our Duties towards God, our ſelves, and the Publick, cannot be performed without Deſire; ſuch are Prayer, and Hope, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Divine Will, and exerciſing our ſelves in ſeeking after ſuch a condition, as may be beſt both for us and others.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like Conſiderations may ſerve to convince thoſe, that queſtion whether they may have any deſires at all.</p>
            <p>This then ſuppoſed, we will now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of what ſort they are, which may and muſt be had.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore all Men may, and ought to deſire what is and appears to be good for them, and they have not.</p>
            <p>But yet here are three Cautions to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, which indeed are all implied in this Rule, but deſerve to be more expreſly taken notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> That the Good we deſire be poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> That that which is good for our ſelves, be alſo good, at leaſt no detriment, to the Publick. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> That it be not prejudicial (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever not near ſo much as the want of it would be to us and the publick) to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Deſires</hi> ſhould not be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what is good to us, nor can they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that which ſeems ſo: If that ſeem good which is not, the fault is in our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, not in our Affection; our Guide hath made us to wander.</p>
            <p>Again; if there be good which yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears?
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96861:167"/>
not, here alſo we are to blame our Underſtanding now for not informing us at all, as before for miſinforming. Our Spy before gave us Intelligence that our Friends were coming, and they proved Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and now that our friends are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed near, we have no notice.</p>
            <p>All this while I ſuppoſe, that the thing we deſire we want, and we want only that which we can uſe: So that, if we either have it, or do not want it, neither ſhould we deſire it. Such Deſires are ſuperfluous and vain, and engage us in a needleſs labour. And the cauſe of all this is our Ignorance of what we have or want.</p>
            <p>This Rule, as I ſaid, doth imply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the thing we want and ſeek, is <hi>Poſſible:</hi> for that cannot be <hi>good</hi> for us, that cannot be; nor can we ſtand in need of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities; nor can we deſire what appears to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>But this is not all what I underſtand by this word <hi>Poſſible, viz.</hi> all that is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction abſolutely; but that which is not repugnant on ſuppoſition of ſuch and ſuch an order of things. And thus we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obſerve, God himſelf doth not do all, that abſolutely implies no contradiction to be done; but he doth all that is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with ſuch Beings and Natures, ſuch a Conſtitution as he hath ordained, which was the beſt that could be.</p>
            <p>And this well conſidered, would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to free us from either ſuſpicions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible Fate, or from unworthy and hard
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:96861:168"/>
thoughts of God: we ſhould not tax him for want of Goodneſs, becauſe he doth not all that's abſolutely poſſible, ſince he doth all that in ſuch a conſtitution (which is the beſt that can be thought on) can be done. But to return to my Argument.</p>
            <p>If the great God (to whom nothing is hard, yet) do not will to effect all that, which implies no contradiction to be done; much leſs ſhould Man let his Deſires run pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with Poſſibility: nor can it be congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for him, whoſe Power is limited, to have an unlimited Will, a Will that's only bounded by contradictions, an affection commenſurate to the greateſt Power.</p>
            <p>This ſurely was the <hi>Stoicks-</hi>ſenſe, when they would not have us to extend our deſires beyond the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, things in our Power. And if they intend this, that where we can do nothing by it in order to the obtaining the thing we wiſh, there we ſhould ceaſe to deſire; I am of the ſame mind.</p>
            <p>But if they intend, that we ſhould be unconcerned in all that is not wholly and ſolely in our Power, I think they leave us little or nothing to be employed in: for, our very Acts, which we are ſaid to be Lords of, ſeem moſt, if not all, partly to depend on other cauſes beſides our ſelves.</p>
            <p>There is thus much of Truth in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, that we ſhould have the greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to thoſe matters, where, if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our own Power, we may reaſonably expect the Concurrence of all other Cauſes, that are neceſſary to effect it. And it will
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96861:168"/>
be our Wiſdom, if we would avoid the Torment of Diſappointment, only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that, which in ſuch an order of Cauſes, not only can, but probably will be produced; and on whoſe production that Deſire may have ſome Influence. This is the firſt Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the thing we deſire be <hi>Poſſible.</hi> The</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2d,</hi> is That it be for <hi>Common-Good,</hi> at leaſt not to the prejudice of the <hi>Publick.</hi> And this is alſo ſufficiently intimated in the Rule it ſelf: For, if any thing be really ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to a Man's <hi>Private</hi> Intereſt, it muſt be alſo to the <hi>Publick;</hi> and if it be not this, it cannot be the other. He that ſinks the Ship, endangers his own Life; nor ſhall any one Member of the Body better its condition, by drawing to it ſelf the Nouriſhment which ſhould be diſpens'd to all. No, if all the other Members ſuffer, that one muſt ſuffer too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Man</hi> is a Member of the Body <hi>Politick,</hi> a part of <hi>Society;</hi> and if it do not go well with the <hi>Polity</hi> in general, it muſt go ill with <hi>him</hi> in particular. As therefore we ſhould not, for the ſafety of one Member, deſtroy the Body; ſo it would be equally unreaſonable for a Private Intereſt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do the Publick.</p>
            <p>And beſides this conſideration of every private perſons reference to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he is a part of it, if we further look on him as a Lover of Good, and can but ſuppoſe him to prefer the greater before the leſs, and to think that that which is bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to many, is better than that which is ſo
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96861:169"/>
to one, or to a few; he cannot (if theſe be his Thoughts) deſire his own particular Intereſt may be promoted with Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Publick. That's the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As our <hi>Deſires</hi> muſt be harmleſs, as to the <hi>Publick,</hi> ſo likewiſe to every <hi>other Man.</hi> For there can be no Reaſon why I ſhould pull down his Houſe, that I may build one for my ſelf upon its Ruins; why I ſhould endanger his Life to ſave my own: for he is naturally of equal value with my ſelf; and if he be not ſo well improved as I, perhaps neither may he deſerve much Blame, nor I Praiſe for this, but it may be the Circumſtances into which we fell, were the chief cauſe of this Difference: Perhaps if he had been in mine, he might have been better than I; and if I had been in his, I might have been worſe than he. But be it otherwiſe, our preſent Inequality doth not argue however, that he hath forfeited the Right he had; or if he hath, yet not to me.</p>
            <p>This then muſt be remembred, that my <hi>Deſires</hi> be innocent. I may be as <hi>wiſe as a Serpent</hi> for my ſelf; but then I muſt be as <hi>innocent as the Dove</hi> to others.</p>
            <p>Nor yet do I deny, but my <hi>Deſires</hi> may extend to thoſe things which may a little inconvenience my Neighbour, provided that Inconvenience bear no Proportion to the Loſs I ſhould ſuſtain by the want of what I deſire. It ſeems not unreaſonable that he ſhould be debarr'd of the Pleaſure of his <hi>Proſpect,</hi> rather than I want a Houſe to dwell in.</p>

Thus all the Members of the Body will ſuffer a little, rather than one ſhould periſh; and many will rather put their Shoulders to the Burden, than one ſhould be oppreſſed with it.</p>
            <p>This is the third and laſt Particular to be conſidered for the regulating our <hi>Deſires,</hi> which I ſhall further diſcourſe of in the ſecond part of the propoſed Method.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Firſt; That Men have <hi>Properties,</hi> that ſome have <hi>Right</hi> where others have none, we ſuppoſe, and the <hi>Scripture</hi> allows it in the <hi>10th Commandment,</hi> and in other places, where <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>ſelling</hi> is ſpoken of; or indeed where <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>lending</hi> to him that would borrow, or giving <hi>Alms</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: For no Man can lend or give what's not his <hi>own;</hi> if there were no <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> any Man might take without anothers leave.</p>
            <p>This then ſuppoſed, we'll conſider the <hi>Foundation</hi> of this, and that we may in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerel conclude is the <hi>Law;</hi> by this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:96861:170"/>
both the Law of Nature, and of Nations, and the Municipal.</p>
            <p>The Municipal Laws are very various, according as the Condition and Temper of the People, and Cuſtom of the Place, and ſuch other Circumſtances inclined the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Governours to make them. And that they have very variouſly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Proprieties, and the ways of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring juſt Title, is known to them, who have but looked into the Laws of ſeveral People, as of the <hi>Jews, Athenidns, Spartans, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thoſe ways which obtain amongſt us, and have been generally received (if we abſtract from the Particular Modes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of them) are theſe; <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Gift, Contract,</hi> and <hi>Ceſſion:</hi> The reſt are ſufficiently known.</p>
            <p>I forbear to ſpeak any thing of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities which are obſerved amongſt us in <hi>giving</hi> or <hi>buying,</hi> or the reſt, becauſe it would be needleſs to do it at this time. Only this I add, That there being ſeveral wiſe unintereſted Men made Judges in theſe Caſes when they come in debate, and they have the Law reported to them on both ſides by the Advocates; and in caſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Law, or Failure in Judgment, there are Courts of Equity for the ſupply of ſuch Shortneſs, or Redreſs of ſuch Wrongs: Things being thus, nothing can be imagined better, nor a more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Settlement invented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:96861:170"/>
This I have ſaid, that we may acquieſce in our own excellent <hi>Conſtitutions;</hi> and be ſatisfied that he to whom our Law gives Right, hath a good and undoubted Title; eſpecially ſince our Law is ſo agreeable to, and founded on both the Law of Nations and Nature. Thus much concerning the Municipal Laws.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Jus Gentium,</hi> Civilians tell us, that <hi>ex hoc Jure diſtincta ſunt Dominia, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercia, &amp; Obligationes inſtitutae.</hi> From hence it is that Pacts are obſerved, which it's generally ſuppoſed were made at the firſt Diviſion, and that amongſt others, is thought to have been univerſally conſented to, that the firſt Poſſeſſor ſhould be accounted the rightful Owner. <hi>Cenſeri debet inter omnes conveniſſe, ut quod quiſque occupaſſet, id propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um haberet.</hi> That Right which is obtained by Victory, ſuppoſes a <hi>juſt War;</hi> and that the Party who had the Title, has forfeited it; and that he, who contends with him, has Right to take that Forfeiture.</p>
            <p>Thus far Writers ordinarily go in their Account of this matter; and here for the moſt part they ſtay. And it is ſufficient to put a ſtop to the Enquiries of the greateſt part, that the Covenants and Conſent of the Ancient, of their fore-Fathers, as alſo the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Places where they live, have determin'd, that there ſhall be Property, and what ſhall be ſo accounted.</p>
            <p>Few Men are capable of higher Reaſons than Law and long Cuſtom, but ſome are, and ſome that are not, yet think they are;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96861:171"/>
and both theſe will be enquiring into the riſe of ſuch Cuſtoms, the Reaſons of ſuch Laws, the Cauſe of ſo univerſal a Conſent.</p>
            <p>And this may alſo make it neceſſary for us to ſearch into the very firſt Foundations of theſe Municipal Laws, and thoſe <hi>Jura Gentium,</hi> which both have given Man a Right to <hi>Propriety;</hi> becauſe there is a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Levellers, who pretend that all this is without Reaſon, and that they have the Law of Nature on their ſide for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>
            <p>This we ſhall briefly conſider: But as for that which they alledg from Scripture, I do not think it worth mentioning, it is ſo palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a miſtake to think, that one particular Example of the Primitive Chriſtians can be obligatory to all Perſons, in all Places and Times whatſoever. And the Arguments from the great Love that Chriſtians owe to each other, are of no force, unleſs they firſt prove it <hi>beſt,</hi> that there ſhould be no <hi>Propriety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Law of Chriſt doth not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that Opinion, ſo nor the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which will appear, if we can diſcover that the firſt Foundations of theſe Laws, Cuſtoms, and Pacts, that ſettle Properties, are laid in Man's Nature, and in the Nature of the things which he uſes and converſes with.</p>
            <p>And this will be very evident to him who conſiders, that all Men have <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>read</hi> of ſeveral things in Life; that they are of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Tempers,</hi> and ſome more inclined to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:96861:171"/>
make uſe of one ſort of things, others of another: that one Man cannot be in all places, nor all Men in one; that all places will not bring forth all things; that ſeveral things which are uſeful to Man, may receive Increaſe, and conſequently Man's Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be better'd by his Diligence and good Husbandry; and again, through his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſs, and Neglect, and ill Management, their number may be leſſened.</p>
            <p>Thus the wiſe Governour of the World hath ordered it for the Puniſhment of Man's Sloth, and the Reward of his Induſtry.</p>
            <p>Add to this, That Men are not of very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Powers, but ordinarily one uſeth himſelf, and manageth his Affairs as well as another; and that it's very needful that all things ſhould be put to their beſt uſe; and that Peace and Quiet ſhould be preſerved in humane Society.</p>
            <p>We have enumerated ſufficient Cauſes of <hi>Diviſion</hi> and <hi>Propriety,</hi> ſo that we need not either tax God, as if he had too much ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man, and not made a plentiful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for him, and ſo neceſſitated Men to ſcramble and to catch that catch can. Nor yet ſhould we have recourſe to Mens Vice and Fault in this caſe, nor attribute the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Property to their covetous or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Deſires, which might proceed from Reaſon and juſt Appetites.</p>
            <p>Let none blame that which was reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor aſcribe that to a vain cauſe which was neceſſary. If Men were from their differing Tempers variouſly inclined, they
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:96861:172"/>
will hereby be ingaged in differing Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and various Pleaſures. And if every place will not afford them all ſorts of Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for their Exerciſe, or Objects for their Delight, if no one place will contain them all, then they muſt part. If they do ſo, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one will be beſt acquainted with the things he moſt converſes with; he that knows them beſt, will uſe them beſt, and on that ſcore hath moſt right to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's fit that all things ſhould be put to the beſt uſe that they are capable of.</p>
            <p>And hence is it that <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> gives ſo good a <hi>Title;</hi> as alſo becauſe it's preſumed that Men will ſeize on that only, which by their natural Conſtitutions they are more diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to uſe or enjoy. And beſides this, it's ſuppoſed that they are for the moſt part not very unequal; or if they be, yet that is not ſo eaſily known: and then all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, no Pretence can be made, why one ſhould be thruſt out of his Poſſeſſion to make way for another; ſince it cannot be known, that this latter will make better (but probably worſe) uſe of what he ſhall have, than the former had done.</p>
            <p>And if this were not admitted, that in Vacuities, firſt Poſſeſſion gives Right, the World muſt be perpetually filled with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and Tumult, and Injuſtice; and he that hath thruſt another out of his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, ſhall be dealt ſo with himſelf by others.</p>
            <p>And in after-Ages, when their Title ſhall be examined, where will the Records
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:96861:172"/>
be found by which it ſhall be cleared? Or, what other evidence can be hoped for, but a long Poſſeſſion? No People on the Earth can at this day make a better Claim than this.</p>
            <p>And if we ſuppoſe Men idle and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their Deſires, there is a further ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Diviſion:</hi> for elſe ſome would live on other Mens Labours, would do nothing, yet enjoy as much as any; and this would tend to impoveriſh the World, ſince Increaſe depends on Mens Labours.</p>
            <p>And indeed this is one of the excellent Fruits of <hi>Propriety,</hi> that it is an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Induſtry, and a Spur to the Lazy; for that is the regular and innocent way for Men to acquire Right, and to become Owners.</p>
            <p>It's true, it cannot be avoided but there will be ſome ill Conſequents of Propriety: For Owners knowing that the things they poſſeſs are part of their Power; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural to Man to have an Affection for that which he uſually converſes with, and ſo loth to part with it; hence they will not many times, neither by way of Gift, nor upon reaſonable Terms, and where they may have a valuable Exchange, for go their Title. And hence it will come to paſs, that ſome will have all, and others nothing; that they whoſe lot it is to be born of rich Parents, or who have more immoderate Deſires, and are more endleſly buſy, they ſhall abound with Wealth,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:96861:173"/>
whilſt they that are not ſo fortunate or foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, ſhall be in want.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding theſe, and other like Inconveniences, we cannot be made to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow of Proprieties, till we find that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity hath none, or fewer, which, things ſtanding as they do, cannot be proved.</p>
            <p>And then there is as good Proviſion as can be made, in the two Caſes ſuppoſed, that Fools may have abundance, and Wiſe and Good Men be in extreme want: For, our Law gives the Eſtates of thoſe that are judged Fools, to the King. And in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſe of extreme Neceſſity, and where the Owner will not recede from his Right (according as ſome in the Civil Law deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine) the Neceſſitous may take what will be ſufficient for him in that Exigence. But then, as <hi>Grotius</hi> well conſiders, there muſt be theſe three Reſtrictions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Neceſſitous</hi> cannot by any pains, or other way extricate himſelf; for if he can, he muſt. <hi>Solon</hi> hath well deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in one Caſe, that a Man muſt dig forty Cubits in his own Ground, before he take Water out of his Neighbour's Well; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves in his Life, and giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:96861:174"/>
there were no ſuch <hi>Deſires,</hi> there could be no ſuch Contracts and Exchanges as there are; if we might not deſire that which is anothers, then we ſhould not ask him to Iend or give us any thing: for this alſo, as well as that of bargaining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſignifies and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes one Man to deſire to have what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath.

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:96861:175"/>
1. Let every one that would prevent or ſubdue all Deſires that are not wiſe, juſt, and innocent, inform himſelf truly of all his real Wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>This may at firſt propoſal ſeem rather a Method to inflame, than cool Deſire: and it may be thought better Advice to him to be ignorant of, than to be acquainted with his Wants: For, ſo long as a Man thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rich, tho he be poor, he will not ask a Supply.</p>
            <p>But who knows how long this Ignorance may continue? that would be to make it, impoſſible for Man ever to be happy: for Senſe of his preſent Miſery, and Diſtance from that good State, is the firſt ſtep to his ſeeking it, and that's indiſpenſably neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his obtaining it. For a Man to affect Ignorance for the Mortification of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, is all one, as to put out his Eyes, that he may rectify the Feature or Motions of his Body. And he that would lay aſide his Knowledg to regulate his Paſſion, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders himſelf to remove a Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides, no Man can be perfectly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his Wants; and where we cannot be wholly ignorant, 'tis beſt to be throughly informed; till we be, we are in the Dark or Twilight, which are Seaſons of Miſtake and Paſſion.</p>
            <p>In the Night we may as well, and do as uſually imagine our Friend to be our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than otherwiſe; or if we do take out Enemy for a Friend, this Miſtake hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed leſs of Fear, but more of Danger with
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:96861:175"/>
it. He that's benighted, follows an <hi>Ignis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> as a truſty Guide, and loſes his own faithful Companion that was with him.</p>
            <p>Thus Ignorance increaſes our Wants, and Want is the Mother of Deſire. It cannot therefore upon any account be adviſeable to keep our ſelves from evil Deſires, by not underſtanding our Neceſſities.</p>
            <p>This might be a way to take away De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it ſelf, and not only the Evil of it: for, to cure the Wound, it cuts off the affected part. That's not it we are endeavouring, to kill Deſire, but only to bind it to its Good-Behaviour. And the way to regulate it, is this which I have propoſed.</p>
            <p>For ſurely all the Irregularities of our Deſires proceed from our failure in this Particular. Our Imagination hath made our Wants more and greater, or leſs than indeed they are; hath made them be when there were none, hath made them ſeem contrary to what they are; and hereupon we deſire where there is no cauſe: Our Deſires are over-vigorous, or too faint; are directly oppoſite to what they ſhould be.</p>
            <p>He that imagines he wants what he hath, his Deſire will be vain; and he that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends himſelf to want all he hath not, he will deſire infinitely, and Impoſſibilities ſhall not ſcape him.</p>
            <p>But he that thinks he hath no need of that, of which he hath no uſe, and knows all that's uſeful to him, and keeps his Deſire within theſe Bounds, will not tranſgreſs.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:96861:176"/>
He that can come to an end of his Wants, that can determine rightly what's enough, his Deſires will not be endleſs.</p>
            <p>Thus far Men do generally agree, that that's only to be deſired which is <hi>uſeful.</hi> But that's Wiſdom to be truly informed what that is. He that knows this, and all that's uſeful to him, hath reſolved what's ſufficient, what's enough for him, and he that's determin'd in this caſe, cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in his Deſires.</p>
            <p>This is the Sum. Let not our Deſires ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed our Wants, nor let us imagine we want that which will not be uſeful, nor greatly want that which is not neceſſary to us. And very few are the things that are of neceſſary uſe in order to our Happineſs. He that lives within Natures Bounds, is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with a little; having <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> can be <hi>content.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If his Houſe will defend him againſt the Injuries of the open Air, tho it be not built after the neweſt Faſhion, nor of the fineſt Materials, he is pleaſed; and is not grieved tho it have no Marble Pillars, or Flowers, curious Chimney-pieces, or Wainſcot of the fineſt Grain, on which the <hi>Italian</hi> Artiſt hath ſhewn his Skill in Colours and Shadow. This Man can make a hearty Dinner, tho his his Meat be not ſerved in Plate, tho he do not drink in Gold, nor have his Cup-board of Plate and Glaſſes before him, nor his Table ſpread with Pheaſant or Partridg, or Quail. He is not much aggrieved that he doth not ruſle in Silks, nor that his Suit is
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:96861:176"/>
not made after the lateſt Mode at Court, his Frieze Coat pleaſes him as well: Nor doth he find himſelf more healthful, or qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, or merry, or wiſe, or vertuous, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving large Fields, full Barns, much Cattel, and his Bags full of Silver and Gold. He obſerves, that they that have all theſe, yet live without them; they have no more than the ſight of them: and he will ſet the ſame Bounds to his Deſires, that Nature and Uſe hath ſet; and there is no difference then betwixt him that hath more, or him that hath leſs.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Direction; When I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to know your Wants, I would have you in order to this underſtand what's <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> the want of which is the great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our want of Contentation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be diligent to ſeek a ſupply of your real Wants in all lawful, likely, harmleſs Ways: Then do not increaſe them by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalities and Exceſs, by vain and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Expences. Men that are profuſe in their Expences, muſt have proportionable Incomes; and where they are unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thoſe, they muſt either be unjuſt in theſe, or they'll quickly be Beggars or Thieves; for ordinarily Men cannot, in honeſt and innocent ways, make proviſion for profuſe layings out.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Be not idle; for Idleneſs is the High-way to Want, and that to Deſire, and ſuch Deſire as ſhall be only an Inſtrument of Torment, not in order to obtain. The
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:96861:177"/>
               <hi>Sluggard,</hi> whom <hi>Solomon</hi> repreſents in his ſleepy: Poſture, hath received this Doom, he ſhall have <hi>Poverty</hi> coming on him as ſure as the Traveller, and <hi>Wans</hi> as irreſiſtibly as an <hi>armed Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in another place he tells us, <hi>The Soul of a Sluggard deſires, and hath nothing:</hi> And he that hath nothing, muſt deſire to have; and if he will not ſeek it by Labour, he will by ſome unlawful ways. The idle Man will deſire; and if he deſire any thing, 'tis that which he hath no Right to; for I look on that Rule of the Apoſtle's as an eternal Truth, <hi>He that will not work, let him not eat.</hi> And it almoſt univerſally obtains, as if it were of natural impreſſion; for when we ſee a Man poor through his Lazineſs, we deny him our Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>On this account thoſe People deſerve Praiſe, who made ſuch early Proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt unjuſt Practices and Deſires, when they would not give their very little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Meat, till they had performed ſome bodily Exerciſe. And I look upon them to have out-done us in Politicks, who will have all their Inhabitants to be of ſome Trade: They have cruſh'd the Viper in the Egg, and have prevented all unjuſt Actions by preventing the unjuſt Deſires. We may wreſt the Poet's Words to this Sence:</p>

            </lg>
            <p n="2">(2.) That which is added in the Rule is, That our Diligence muſt be employed in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Means,</p>
            <p>First; That are likely, elſe it will be fooliſh. And,</p>
            <p>Secondly; Lawful, elſe we ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. And,</p>
            <p>Thirdly; They muſt be harmleſs, elſe we cannot be innocent; and no Action can be good, where Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is not.</p>
            <p>All this ſuppoſes, (which is moſt true), that Things are ſo ordered in the World, that Induſtry, which is wiſe, and juſt, and innocent, cannot be deſtitute of that which is of neceſſary uſe.</p>
            <p>And that we need not at any time have recourſe to unlikely and unlawful Ways for a Supply of that which we really need: Nor are Humane Affairs ſo ill managed by the Wiſe Governour of the World, as that one muſt be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to enrich another; that I cannot be made happy, unleſs my Brother be made miſerable.</p>
            <p>I conclude this Direction with the Reaſon of it, which is this, That the more wiſely and harmleſsly induſtrious
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:96861:178"/>
any Man is in ſeeking after ſupply of his Wants, the leſs he will want; and the leſs he wants, the leſs he muſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, if he act by Reaſon. And ſo long as <hi>Want</hi> continues, <hi>Deſire</hi> muſt; and if it be earneſt, it may probably hinder us in the good uſe of our Reaſon, and ſo engage us in that which is diſhoneſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us tranſgreſs thoſe Bounds and Land-Marks which Propriety hath ſet.</p>
            <p>On the other hand; It would be ſtrange, if the happy Man ſhould be envious or ravening: When the Sun ſhines upon his Tabernacle, who can deſire his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Candle?</p>
            <p>That which may confirm all this, is, That in all the Deſcriptions we have of the Golden Age, which is ſuppoſed to have been in the World, we have no mention made of Mens Inordinate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: which ſhews, that when they are in good condition, theſe have no place; or if they have, they ſpoil it. And this leads me to the Arguments againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and unjuſt Deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> They are both noxious and vain: They do others hurt, and our ſelves no good. How much Harm they do in the World, I have ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, when I have ſaid, that all the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> and all the <hi>Evil</hi> that one Man doth another, grow from this Root. Whatever Miſchief of this ſort
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:96861:178"/>
you complain of, know that unreaſonable <hi>Deſire</hi> is acceſſory to them.</p>
            <p>All Murders, and Robberies, and Wars, and Over-reaching in Bargains, owe their Original to this. This turns Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Brutes, and makes Societies of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, become Dens of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Kennels of Foxes. Nay, this hath made a City leſs eligible than a Wilderneſs; and 'tis more ſafe to be in a Herd of Brutes, than in a Society of Men; ſo much more inſatiable are our <hi>Deſires</hi> than theirs: And there is therefore leſs Danger in converſe with unreaſonable Nature, than with immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Deſires.</p>
            <p>And as unreaſonable Deſires do harm to others, ſo they are no way advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to our ſelves: for, whilſt we deſire unjuſtly, we lay a Foundation for Diſquiet to the Publick Peace, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Ruine to our own particular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. For, our Example hath an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on others, to make them do as we do; and that will bring in all Confuſion amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, whilſt any one impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates too much, the leſs remains for others Uſes. And this brings near extreme Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; and when that is their Caſe, they have Right to other Mens Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and when they are near it, they may eaſily miſtake it for their own Caſe; and if they do but think it is their Caſe, they'll act as if it was, and ſeize upon
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:96861:179"/>
that which they have not, but imagine they have Right to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> Remember our Profeſſion. We call our ſelves the Diſciples of him, who had not <hi>where to lay his Head;</hi> who tho he was Lord of all, yet Poſſeſſor of almoſt nothing: And ſhall the Diſciple be above his Maſter? Had our Lord ſo very little, and ſhall we graſp at all? Why have we need of more than he had? If we have, ſhew it; if not, why do we deſire it? How is it that we cannot be content with Food and Raiment, (when by a harmleſs diligence we can obtain no more) when our Saviour was? For, if we be indeed his Diſciples, that is, if we live well, and follow his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we have alſo the <hi>Promiſes of this Life, and of that which is to come.</hi> We have all Aſſurance given us, that the great Diſpoſer of all Things intereſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in our Affairs, and will manage all for the good of them that live well.</p>
            <p>We know that the worſt that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us is Death; and that is the End of all our Miſeries, and is our Paſſage to a bleſſed and endleſs Life. We know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the Unrighteous ſhall not be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this Happineſs; that the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the Oppreſſor, the Deceiver, ſhall be excluded: Nay, that they who have not ſubdued and overcome the <hi>evil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> of doing ſuch Things, are not owned by Chriſt to be his Followers,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:96861:179"/>
and then they cannot be ſaved. And if we cannot be Chriſtians, if we cannot be happy whilſt they prevail in us, why do we ſuffer them?</p>
            <p>Beſides; The Goſpel which we own, nay, and our own Reaſon, hath repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented all the Things of this World as very undeſirable. We cannot but ſee how little Tendency they all have to make us happy. Do we not ordinarily find the Poor as good as the Rich, and the Servant as wiſe as his Maſter?</p>
            <p>And we know, that all theſe Things are to us as <hi>We</hi> are: To the Good, all are Good. <hi>Res perinde ſunt, ut illiu ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus qui <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And if the Things themſelves be not valuable, their Number doth not add to their Eſteem.

Beſides all theſe Engagements which our Chriſtian Profeſſion lays on us, to ſubdue our <hi>Deſires,</hi> there's this one other, which I will only mention, and that is, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Love,</hi> that Love to all the World, which Chriſtianity doth ſo much oblige us to. We are commanded, we are exhorted to this, the higheſt Examples lead us to it; our God and Saviour go before us in the plaineſt ways of Love and Kindneſs. It is a great part of our Religion, and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable to Happineſs: Yea the very <hi>Badg</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> of Chriſtians; ſo that we are not to be call'd by that Name, if we do not live a <hi>Life of Love;</hi> and if we do, we ſhall not covet what's another's. For <hi>Love,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>fulfils the Law:</hi> it will not only preſerve us from doing, but alſo from deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any other Man's Injury.</p>
            <p>If then we would do well to the Publick by preſerving Peace and Order: if we have any regard to other Men that are like to, and generally equal with, or better than our ſelves: If we would not fall of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if we would not act in Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Religion and Reaſon; if we would approve our ſelves to be Men or Chriſtians: let all our <hi>Deſires</hi> be wiſe, and juſt, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: Let it be all our Endeavours; and God of his infinite Mercy afford us the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Aids of his Grace, which we beg for the ſake of his Son, to whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>To do their own Buſineſs,</hi> their proper particular Work: On which, how much the Quiet and State of Men depends, may appear in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe.

            <p>And this latter Duty being in order, and a help to our Diſcharge of the former, I ſhall begin with it: And ſhall enquire,</p>

            </p>
            <p>This was the occaſion of that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſecond Epiſtle; and 'tis moſt likely<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that on the ſame occaſion, he had before given them the ſame Precept in the Text, <hi>To do their own Buſineſs:</hi> In which we may be further confirm'd by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the end of the <hi>11th</hi> and <hi>12th</hi> Verſes, <hi>Working with your own Hands; that ye may
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:96861:182"/>
walk honeſtly towards the Gentiles, and that ye may have need of nothing.</hi> By which, as he plainly intimates, that the very Heathens did not approve of Idleneſs and Beggary, but thought it unſeemly for Men to live the Lives of Drones and Paraſites; ſo likewiſe that he ſhould prevent ſuch foul Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with the ill Conſequents of them, if he could engage them to mind and do their <hi>own Buſineſs.</hi> This would raiſe them from the Bed of Sloth, this would keep them from being Eves-droppers, and Interlopers in other Mens matters, and thereby cut off many Occaſions of great Troubles both to themſelves and their Neighbours. This would probably ſecure them from neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Dependances, and their Religion from Contempt.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the Occaſion of this Precept, partly from the Hiſtory ſet down in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle, where it is repeated, partly from the Reaſons annexed to it in this. From which we may conclude (in order to our next Enquiry) that this <hi>doing their own Buſineſs</hi> was ſomething, that was good and honeſt in the account of the Heathens, and that by natural Light might be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to be ſo: Something alſo that would be a means to ſecure them from a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on other Men for Neceſſaries, which is one of the worſt States of Humane Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eraſmus</hi> thinks the Apoſtle had in his Eye both the <hi>Idle,</hi> and the <hi>Buſy-bodies. Deterret,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ab otio, &amp; ab alienis Appetendis. Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> is of the ſame Mind, and tells us that

            <p n="2">II. Having ſeen the Occaſion, let us now proceed to the Senſe and Import of the Words. And here the main Enquiry is, What is meant by (the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) your own private matters, thoſe which are peculiarly and <hi>properly yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſeems here to be oppoſed to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and to be diſtinguiſhed from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, our <hi>own,</hi> in oppoſition to other Mens, and in diſtinction from what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to us and them. Do <hi>your own,</hi> not others Mens <hi>Buſineſs.</hi> Do not only what belongs to all Men, but that alſo which particularly appertains to you. For our better underſtanding this, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Man under a fourfold reſpect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of his Nature as he differs from Beaſts, and as he differs from other Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> we may look on him as endowed with Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Liberty in general, which is common to all Men; or, as with greater Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, with all thoſe Inclinations and Averſations (which may be ſuppoſed to be born with Men) that are peculiar to this or that Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may conſider a Man under the various Changes that are made in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:96861:183"/>
the ſeveral Acceſſions to his natural Faculties, with all that Knowledg with which Study and Experience has enriched him; with all thoſe Arts and Habits, which by Time and Exerciſe he has acquired; or elſe with all inculpable Impairments, and Leſſenings of the Faculties, either of his Body, or of his Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may conſider him in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which he is in reſpect of outward things, ſuch as Poverty of Riches, Liberty or Confinement, Honour or Diſgrace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider him in thoſe Relations in which he is to other Men; whether he came into them by Neceſſity, ariſing either from Nature or Laws, or voluntarily and out of Choice: As Husband or Wife, Parent or Child, Maſter or Servant, Magiſtrate or one of the People, Teacher or Learner, of the Clergy or the Laity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, with ſome Addition, is <hi>Tully's Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druplex Perſona,</hi> which every Man bears. Now as to the Buſineſs before us: Whatever Work is ſutable and proper to Man under any of theſe Conſiderations, that may be ſaid to be <hi>his Work;</hi> he was, as it were; made and fitted for it, it is proper to him, he is obliged by the Divine Law to do it.</p>
            <p>And becauſe Man cannot be ſuppoſed to have been deſigned for ſuch a Work as is unſuitable to his Nature; as falſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, not following his Underſtanding, not loving that which is good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Wickedneſs and Vice is thus unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; therefore nothing can be <hi>proper</hi> for
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:96861:183"/>
a Man that is unreaſonable or vicious; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Work</hi> of his muſt be rational and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Truth and Goodneſs muſt be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Attendants, the neceſſary Ingredients of every Buſineſs, which Man can call <hi>his own.</hi> Briefly then, that in general is called any Man's Work, which is both good in it ſelf, and fit for him, that for which he was, as it were made and framed; that, of which by his Nature and Temper, by his Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Inclinations, and Opportunities, his Relation to others, and his Conditions in reſpect of external Goods and Evils he is capable, and for which he is fitted.</p>
            <p>Thus we call the making, the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Government of this World, the Redemption of it by Chriſt, the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing Men according to their Ways, the hearing the Prayers, and granting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the Poor, Deſtitute, <hi>&amp;c. The Works of God,</hi> as being <hi>proper</hi> to the moſt glorious Perfections of the Divine Nature. Indeed there is nothing elſe to be conſidered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the moſt abſolutely perfect Nature of God, in reſpect of which any <hi>Work</hi> may be called <hi>his;</hi> that being the ſole Cauſe of them all. But 'tis otherwiſe with Man, who both in his being and working, ſo depends on God, and on other things, that he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be nor act without them.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that many <hi>Works</hi> belong to Man, and are properly <hi>his,</hi> not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Nature generally conſidered, as uncloath'd of all Circumſtances, but alſo of his Dependancy and Subjection: In
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:96861:184"/>
which reſpect, that may be ſaid to be a <hi>Man's Work,</hi> which he is appointed to do by one who has Right to diſpoſe of him, <hi>i. e</hi> God, and by thoſe who have Authority over him: That is ſaid to be a Servants <hi>Work,</hi> which his Maſter ſets him to do.</p>
            <p>That alſo which a Man undertakes to do, he being at his own diſpoſe, may be called <hi>his Work:</hi> As alſo that which is moſtly and immediately converſant about himſelf, or about that, in which he is moſt nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, as his Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which will be his in the Iſſue and Effect, as well as it was in the Beginning and Production; that which will redound to his proper Advantage and Benefit, as well as it did proceed from his Power, which will be for him, as it was from him; 'tis his <hi>own,</hi> i. e. for his Intereſt.</p>
            <p>On theſe accounts any <hi>Work</hi> or <hi>Buſineſs</hi> may be called a Man's <hi>own.</hi> And if they be conſidered in general, as they are common to, and the ſame in all Men; they are the Foundation of that, which is all Mens <hi>Work</hi> or <hi>Buſineſs:</hi> but if they be conſidered par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with the Differences, with which they are found in ſeveral Men, ſo they conſtitute every Mans <hi>particular Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make this plain by Inſtances. The <hi>common Work or Buſineſs</hi> of all Men, is to worſhip God, and to ſerve him in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Perfection and Happineſs of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and all Men; and as much as in them lies in co-operating towards, and ſetting forward the good State of the whole World. To this every Man is bound in proportion
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:96861:184"/>
to his Ability, and as he has Opportunity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of this or that Man <hi>in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> is to do ſuch part of this, and in ſuch manner and way, as by the inculpable peculiarities, which are found in his Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Inclinations, his acquiſitions and the acceſſions he has made to his natural Power, his different conditions in reſpect of things without him; the particular appointments of his Soveraign Lord, and of thoſe that have Authority from him; or by his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking (where he is at liberty) he is <hi>eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially</hi> determin'd, qualified, and obliged to do.</p>
            <p>Every man in the World is in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relation to God and Men, and in a condition which Challenges ſome ſpecial Service from him; ſo that he is obliged to do ſomething for his part (by the natural and perhaps the written Laws of God, or alſo by the good Laws and Cuſtoms of Men) to ſerve the whole Society, of which he is a Member, and God the ſupream Head and Governour. Every Man is a Governour or a Subject; ſome are ſet apart to attend the publick Worſhip of God, and the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men in the Divine Laws; others have undertaken to ſtudy the Municipal Laws, and by their Skill in theſe to ſecure Mens Rights and Properties; others take upon them (and are authoriſed to do ſo) the Care of Mens Health; ſome are Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Wives, Parents, Children, Servants, Merchants, Mechanicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever Particular Employment (wherein a Man can in ſome <hi>peculiar way</hi>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:96861:185"/>
ſet forth the Glory of God, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards any part of the good State of his Creatures, particularly of himſelf and his Family) is by one, who has Right to diſpoſe of him, laid on any Man, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to (at leaſt with the allowance of) the Laws of God, and good Conſtitutions of Men, is undertaken by himſelf; That is <hi>his Work,</hi> his <hi>own proper Buſineſs.</hi> This is his Place, his Station, his Part, his Province, his Office, his Truſt, his Trade, his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Calling, his Profeſſion from whence he is denominated. And to fullfil this his Place, to keep his Station, to act his Part, to govern his Province, to execute his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to diſcharge his Truſt, to follow his Trade, to do that which he profeſſes to do, and which he bears the World in hand he does: This the Apoſtle ſeems to mean by <hi>our own Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He illuſtrates this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4. by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Chriſtians to the Members of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body. <hi>As we having many Members in one Body, and all have not the ſame Office</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Which way then ſoever we ſerve the great Lord of All, in proſecuting the ends of his Goodneſs, which is the welfare of his whole Family; whether by miniſtring to your neceſſities or conveniencies of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by ſerving the greater Bodies, or leſs Societies, or Single Perſons in reference either to this or a future Life: Whatever our Employment be, if innocent and uſeful,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:96861:185"/>
if Lawful and Honeſt, whether in publick Office, or a more private Capacity, in what place ſoever we are, let us whilſt we are in it, <hi>do the work of it. Spartam, quam nactus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand and mind, and do this which is your proper Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I hope is ſufficient to make the meaneſt Capacities underſtand what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle does require of them; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe Miſtakes which might ariſe in weak minds about this matter; and to ſhew that there is no interfering betwixt this and other Duties, which I have an eſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to, leſt whilſt I am exhorting to the obedience of one Command, I ſhould occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the neglect of another, and perhaps a greater. I ſhall only mention the Miſtakes which ſome may have, of which they may rid themſelves by what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One Miſtake is, that they ſhould ſo do their own Buſineſs, as to allow none elſe to do any thing for them, to uſe the Service of none, to endeavour to have need of no Man, to live without the help of any. But this cannot be the Apoſtles meaning: becauſe the Scriptures in many places, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in divers of his Epiſtles ſuppoſes, and allows, and gives Directions both to Maſters and Servants.</p>
            <p>It was a piece of Cynical Moroſneſs in <hi>Diegenes,</hi> not to have a Servant; and no way agreeable with the State in which we
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:96861:186"/>
are, nor with thoſe Cuſtoms of the World, which Experience has confirmed to be good, and all Laws have approved. I know there is a great vanity in many, who devolve all their weighty Buſineſs, wherein their own Care is moſt neceſſary, upon their Servants, but I meddle not with that now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Miſtake may be, That we be ſo intent on our own Matters, as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard other Men's. This was St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that <hi>All minded their own things. Phil.</hi> 2. 21. And it is the Law of Chriſt that we <hi>bear one anothers Burdens. Gal.</hi> 6. 2. The Apoſtle's Intent was to take Men off from vain Curioſity about, from unneceſſary med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in other Men's matters: But when Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and Kindneſs, Compaſſion and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, when Juſtice it ſelf calls us out of our Houſes, and takes us from our Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to help our Brethren in managing their Affairs; we are not in this caſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our ſelves under pretence that we are doing <hi>our own Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be danger of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the natural World, the next Bodies will (as ſome Philoſophers ſpeak) <hi>againſt their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> remove out of their Places to prevent it: the ſame muſt be done by us in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral World. But indeed, it is not <hi>againſt Nature</hi> that we ſhould do thus: For, by <hi>Nature</hi> we are made to promote the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good, not our own only but other Men's, and in the Explication I have ſhewn, that that is every Man's <hi>own Buſineſs,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to that Place or Station, in which he is in
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:96861:186"/>
relation to other Men. His <hi>proper Buſineſs</hi> has, in the very Notion of it, a reference to <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. After what has been ſaid, none ſure will think themſelves excuſed from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Works</hi> of all Men, becauſe they muſt do their <hi>own proper Buſineſs;</hi> that becauſe I am to do that which is my particular Work, I may therefore neglect that which is every ones, but mine no leſs then theirs. The works of our general and particular <hi>Calling</hi> (as Divines expreſs it) conſiſt and agree and are ſubordinate to each other. Every Man's buſineſs is to help forward the good of the World, but that which is mine and yours in particular, is to do it in this or that was as our Place and Office requires. Do your <hi>particular Buſineſs,</hi> but do not think you may leave your <hi>Common</hi> undone. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand,</p>
            <p n="4">4. None muſt think they have done what is here enjoyned, becauſe they have done the <hi>Common Work</hi> of all Men. This Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take began in the Primitive Times, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues till ours: There were ſome then, who thought themſelves exempted from Earthly <hi>Maſters,</hi> by their being <hi>Servants of Chriſt:</hi> And how many are there now, who imagine that if they faſt and pray, and read the Bible, and do thoſe things which every Man in the World ought to do, they have then done all; but they have ſomething more to do ſtill in their Families or Shops, or Fields, in the Towns, and Kingdoms, and Churches, of which they are Members.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:96861:187"/>
5. Nor let any ſo miſtake the Apoſtle, as if he forbad them at any time to reſt from their Labour, or that all manner of <hi>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> or <hi>Curioſity</hi> muſt now become unlawful. No ſuch matter, there is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall therefore content my ſelf with what I have ſaid in the general Explication.</p>

Having then reſolved that, whatever good Work it is, of which a Man is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally capable, and the Divine Providence has given him opportunity of doing, and has peculiarly fitted him for, and (where that is needful) has otherwiſe authoriſed him to the doing it, much more which God has commanded him to do, or Men (who have Right ſo to do) have impoſed it on him, or himſelf has Voluntarily undertaken, that is his proper Work, his <hi>own Buſineſs:</hi> I now proceed to thoſe Arguments which perſwade us to mind, to do, to be diligent in this.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The conſiderations which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us that this is very good and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and according to the Will of God, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Account it was in with the wiſeſt of the Heathens.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Teſtimony which the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſuitableneſs of it to the Nature of Man, and to his State and Condition.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The numberleſs Benefits which flow from it, both upon our ſelves and others, upon ſingle Perſons and upon Societies. And alſo the horrible Miſchiefs which ariſe from the neglect of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this as one reaſon, why they ſhould do their <hi>own Buſineſs,</hi> that they might <hi>walk honeſtly,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] ſeemly, towards them that are without: which
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:96861:188"/>
plainly implies that when Men minded their <hi>own Buſineſs,</hi> they did that which was <hi>ſeemly</hi> and fit in the account of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
            <p>It is plain what the great <hi>Athenian</hi> Law-givers thought of it by theſe two or three Laws: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Any one that would, might indite an idle Perſon; he was, it ſeems, outlaw'd; and the Puniſhment in <hi>Draco</hi>'s Laws was no leſs than Death. So it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo amongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as <hi>Heredotus</hi> and <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dorus Siculus</hi> inform us, from whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably this Law was brought into <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other was, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, That no Man ſhould be of two Profeſſions, or exerciſe two Trades. We may ſuppoſe one Reaſon of this to be, leſt being divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both, they ſhould be good at neither: And another Reaſon, becauſe as they would not allow Men to be idle, ſo neither to be over-buſy; they would have them mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately employ'd.</p>
            <p>And in purſuance of the Deſign of this Law, which was to keep Men at work, they required them every Year to appear before that great Court of the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> to give an Account how they maintained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>It is a known Story of <hi>Menedemus</hi> and <hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> who had no viſible Eſtate, and yet look'd well, and liv'd handſomly, tho they followed the Study of Philoſophy all day, (which it ſeems was not the way to get<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Livelihood then neither) which made
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:96861:189"/>
them to be ſuſpected; and when they were cited into the Court, they call'd for the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who teſtified that they wrought with them in the Nights, and ſo earn'd their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: Which procured them, not only an honourable Diſmiſſion, but alſo a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from their Judges.</p>
            <p>Beſides, They have another Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they excuſe a Son from maintaining his old and indigent Father, if he had never put him to a Trade.</p>
            <p>Nay, amongſt them none might be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep a Servant in his Houſe, who had not been brought up in ſome Employment.</p>
            <p>To this let me add; That I have not yet obſerved any flouriſhing Commonwealth or Kingdom, where their Law-makers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates have not taken care, that all Men ſhould be employ'd in ſome honeſt uſeful Calling, and be induſtrious in it.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was degenerate, yet one of the Emperors, when he ſaw an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Courtier ſprinkling Water before him, to lay the Duſt as he walked; and ſeeing he expected Thanks for it, told him, That he was ſo far from rewarding, that he uſed to puniſh Works that deſerved much better than his. But I paſs on to ſome more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Arguments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. See what the Scripture ſaith in this matter, and it is full and plain. Beſides this, and the parallel Place in 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> we have St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting the <hi>Romans, chap.</hi> 12. 11. that <hi>in Buſineſs they ſhould not be

To be earneſt and active in Buſineſs, he thought very conſiſtent with <hi>Fervency of Spirit,</hi> and to be a part of the Service we do to God. And as he exhorted the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to Induſtry in their Callings, that they might want nothing themſelves; ſo he charges the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>work with their own hands,</hi> that they might be able to ſupply the Wants of others.</p>

            <p>If this were the Sin of the Angels, as it ſeems not improbable; it ſhould be a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to us how we deſert our Station, and neglect our own Buſineſs, and ſo either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come idle and uſeleſs, or troubleſom to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and perhaps rebellious againſt our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, as they may be thought to has been: For, if we commit the <hi>Sin,</hi> we muſt expect to fall into the <hi>Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> So much for Scripture.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:96861:190"/>
3. To do a Man's <hi>own Buſineſs,</hi> is very ſuitable to Humane Nature, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which it is here. In the Nature and State of Man here, theſe Things are obſervable:</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is endowed with many active Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which were never intended by the wiſe Contriver to lie idle, and do nothing. What means this Shop of Tools which we have in our Body, if they muſt never be uſed? Man's Body is the Houſe where his Soul muſt dwell: It muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whilſt in this State, the Soul muſt act with and by the Body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he is limited in his Preſence, and Power, and Knowledg. He cannot be in many Places at once, nor endure to be in perpetual motion; nor can he ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and act, but very little at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Now by all theſe things he ſeems to be directed and determined by his Nature and State, to ſome Buſineſs that is near him; for, he can beſt underſtand and act where he is preſent. I ſaid, Man and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Faculties, but they are not ſufficient for every Work, for they may as well be over as under-wrought.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He does that moſt willingly, which he has been accuſtomed to do, and which he can do with moſt eaſe, and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. And this we may ſuppoſe of his own Buſineſs: For probably a Man falls upon that Profeſſion, to which he has either been trained up by his Parents, or to which
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:96861:191"/>
his own Inclination hath led him. Now that in which he hath been inſtructed and exerciſed, or to which he has been inclin'd, will be moſt eaſy to him: for he underſtand it beſt, and has greateſt Skill in it, and has likewiſe the greateſt and moſt frequent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of doing it.</p>
            <p>He that leaves his own Work, which he is fitteſt for, and meddles with the Affairs of others, by this means neglects what he can beſt do, and faulters in the doing that for which he is not qualified.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He muſt be moſt concerned to do it, and beſt affected to it: For, he has a great Love to, and Care of himſelf, and a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affection to his Kindred, and thoſe who are near him; he is more ſenſibly moved by them than others, and by them when they are near him, than when at a diſtance?</p>
            <p>Now this is a conſiderable part of a Man's Buſineſs, to provide for himſelf and Family; to order matters ſo, that it may be well with his Wife, Children, and Relations. If he has ſo little Love for himſelf, as not to do <hi>his own Work,</hi> who does he think will do it?</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is ſuch a fitneſs in it, that it would be a great Injuſtice for any Man: not to do <hi>his own Work.</hi> God has committed to his Care a proper <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> a particular Truſt is laid on him by the great Governor of the World, which is, That he do that Good which the Place in which he ſtands, and the Relation he bears to others, calls for. If he be a Parent, he is to ſee to the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:96861:191"/>
Education of his Children; if a Magiſtrate, to the keeping of the Laws of the Society; if a Miniſter, to inſtruct his People in their Duty. And whoſoever doth not the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theſe and ſuch Places, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
            <p>Or in whatſoever Employment any one is, if he does not what he pretends to, if he takes upon himſelf a Profeſſion, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to do the Work of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. It is fit for every Man to be doing his own Buſineſs, becauſe if he do not this, he will be doing ſomething elſe for which he is not ſo fit. If he does not his own, he will be a-doing other Mens, and ſo will be guilty of two great Faults, neglecting what he is fit to do, and offering to do what he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for, as I have already ſuggeſted. And to this I might add, that every Man is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for his own Work, and not for other Mens.</p>
            <p>On all theſe Accounts Man is fitteſt for his own Work. And if Order be obſerv'd, every thing will be put to that uſe for which it is fitteſt, becauſe probably every thing will then attain its End. But how
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:96861:192"/>
unbecoming and ugly, how vain and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual is it, to uſe Things to other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes than thoſe they are fitted for?</p>
            <p>If the Ox and Horſe ſhould change Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as the Poet expreſſes it,
<q>
                  <l>Optat Ephippia bos piger, optat arare caballus;</l>

            </p>
            <p>The Saddle would not ſit well upon the Ox, nor the Yoke upon the Horſe: Juſt ſo unſeemly, ſo to no purpoſe will it be, for one Man to undertake another's Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The laſt Argument by which I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all Men to a diligent Attendance on their own proper Buſineſs, is, from the numberleſs Benefits which will flow in upon us and others, if we do thus.</p>
            <p>Let Reaſon be heard, let your own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Obſervation be conſulted, let the Records of Ancient Times be look'd into, and theſe will all bear witneſs to this Truth.</p>
            <p>They will aſſure us, that Induſtry is the beſt Preſerver and Reſtorer of Health; that the Bed of Idleneſs becomes very often a ſick Bed; that a needleſs Medler in other Mens Matters, very frequently loſes his Life for a puniſhment of his vain Curioſity.</p>
            <p>And is not this the plain and ſure Way to Riches? Have you obſerved many of thoſe that mind their Buſineſs, fall into Want? I deny not but Accidents may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them, by the over-ruling Providence. <hi>The Battel is not alway to the Strong, nor the

Race to the Swift;</hi> but ordinarily it is. And the beſt way for a Man to ſecure his Eſtate from ſuch Accidents, is to be at his Buſineſs. <hi>Time and Chance happens to all Things;</hi> but commonly <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Obſervation holds, <hi>The diligent Hand makes rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I appeal again to your Experience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe that break amongſt us, be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, the Sedulous, the Shop-keepers, the Men that mind their own Affairs; or rather the Idle, the Men who are in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thruſting themſelves into every Man's Company and Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Our neighbouring Commonwealth puts it out of doubt, that Induſtry is the High-way to Wealth. They have no Mines, but this hath brought home the <hi>Indies,</hi> and hath made a Place that is barren of all things, to be the Storehouſe of theſe Weſtern Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>Nor is this the way to Riches only, but alſo to Honour. <hi>Seeſt thou,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, a Man diligent in his Buſineſs? He ſhall ſtand before Kings, he ſhall not ſtand before mean Men;</hi> he ſhall be exalted. There are few Men who are ſo unfit for, or ſo averſe from the Buſineſs of their Calling, but by diligence they may attain to a Maſtery, to have a perfection in it; and if they do, let it be what it will, they will be praiſed whilſt they live, and when they die, be remembred with eſteem.</p>
            <p>But is it thus with the idle Man? No; as he is dead whilſt he lives, and as his Soul, ſo his Name is periſhed before his Body.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:96861:193"/>
No Man was ever eſteem'd for ſleeping, nor is a Bed, but a Field, the Place of Honour. Have the trifling buſy Medlers ever been known to gain a Reputation? No; they have conſtantly been the Subject of Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Scorn. How are they expoſed by the Deſcriptions that are given of them?</p>

            </p>
            <p>But I ſtay too long on theſe leſſer Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Let us go on to conſider what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit accrues to the Soul by Mens diligence in their Callings, and minding their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Buſineſs. This miniſters both to our Vertue, and to our Quiet.</p>
            <p>Firſt; To our Vertue.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I need not ſay what an Hedg this is to Vertue; from how many Temptations Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſecures us, to which we are expoſed by Idleneſs and Medling.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By this our Underſtandings are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The idle Man loſes his for want of Exerciſe; he has only ſome fluttering Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and they are for the moſt part ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, but he can have no orderly Series of Thoughts. And the buſy Intruder into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Buſineſs, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his Thoughts are ſo diſtracted, that he loſes his Soul in a Crowd, in too much Buſineſs, as the other did in too little: He has no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, no leiſure for Reflection, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way going out of himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:96861:193"/>
3. This is an Occaſion for the Exerciſe of many Vertues. Every Man's particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſineſs is the Stage, the Theatre in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Vertue is acted and ſeen, the Sphere in which he moves and ſhines. He has here an Opportunity to exerciſe his Prudence and his Juſtice, his Temperance and his Patience. And it is a kind of Nurſery, from whence they may be tranſplanted into a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employment. In the beſt times of the Chriſtian Church, they that were admitted into the Prieſthood, were ſuch as had firſt ruled their own Houſes well; and after they had diſcharged the Office of a Deacon, ſo as to be approved, were then made Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. And never did the Roman Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proſper more, than when they fetch'd their Dictator from the Plow.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This will help to perfect Vertue: For, this brings it into Act, and it is never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect till then. Whilſt it ſtays in Thoughts and Deſires, in Deſigns and Reſolutions, it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an <hi>Embryo;</hi> it is not compleat till it come forth in action.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This will help to preſerve a Man from entertaining wild and unpracticable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits in Religion, from running out into airy and uſeleſs Speculations, to fond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and groundleſs Imaginations, which are uſually the Products of idle Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and are never confuted till they be brought to Practice, which is a Touchſtone to try them. For, whatever Mens Thoughts are in their Retirement, if they be not practical, or do not aſſiſt us in our
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:96861:194"/>
Practices, they are not true, nor good.</p>
            <p>Secondly; As doing our own Buſineſs miniſters to our Vertue, ſo likewiſe to our Quiet. I appeal to Experience, if it be not, and to Reaſon, if it muſt not be ſo, that he who faithfully diſchargeth the Duties of his Employment, will be at peace within himſelf; when the idle Perſon is tormented with the Conſcience of his Neglect, and the Over-buſy is diſtracted with the Multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Buſineſs, and the Medler is diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted with the needleſs Hazards he runs, and with the ſenſe of vain and hopeleſs At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
            <p>It is with many of theſe that are ſo buſy abroad, as it is with ſome Travellers, who when they are in other Countries, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet becauſe they are not in their own; and when they are there, they are uneaſy, becauſe they are not in Travel: So theſe Men are reſtleſs becauſe they do not their <hi>own Buſineſs;</hi> and when they are about that, they are ſo uſed to variety and rambling, that they have no quiet.</p>
            <p>There are three things which greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Men:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. When they have no one ſetled, fixed End, which they proſecute.</item>
               <item>2. When they propound to themſelves an End which they cannot attain.</item>
               <item>3. When they are in ſo cloſe a purſuit of their Deſign, that they have no Reſt, or Time to conſider what they are doing, or whereabout they are.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:96861:194"/>
Nor is this well-guided Induſtry beneficial to a Man's ſelf alone, but to others alſo; his Family, his Neighbourhood are the better for it: If he be in publick place, the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in which he is, are ſerved by his well-regulated Diligence.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, how many, how fatal are thoſe Miſchiefs, which he who neglects his own, and thruſts himſelf into other Mens Buſineſſes, brings upon Families, upon Towns, Churches, nay, and whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms? when the Tradeſmen will not ſtay in their Shops, but muſt leap into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not be particular, but I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent this by ſuch Similitudes as theſe: Whilſt the River keeps its Courſe in the Channel, it is pleaſant, it doth no harm, the Stream will carry Veſſels from one place to another, and the Water is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but if it leap over the Banks, ſpread it ſelf all over Fields of Corn, it does great Miſchief, and is loſt in the Ground.</p>
            <p>If the Fire keep in the Chimney, its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, it is pleaſant and uſeful; but if it move into every part of the Room, and every Place of the Houſe, it then proves miſchievous.</p>
            <p>The Poets have repreſented the Folly and Miſchief of buſying one's ſelf in other Mens Affairs, in <hi>Phaeton,</hi> who would needs mount his Father's Chariot, undertake a thing in which he had no Skill; but what came of it? Himſelf was thrown out of Heaven, and the World had almoſt been ſet on fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:96861:195"/>
To come nearer: In a <hi>Ship,</hi> how neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is it for every Man to mind his Buſineſs? how dangerous, if he neglect? How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is every Man to do his own? If any one fail, it may coſt his own Life, and all theirs that are with him. Of ſo great efficacy is this, that they are preſerved by it, in the midſt of Waves, and Winds, and Rocks.</p>
            <p>In an Army every Souldier muſt obſerve his Orders, muſt keep his Rank: if he do not, if he will not obey, but give Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by this he hazards his own Life, and endangers the Loſs of the whole Army.</p>
            <p>I add but one more: How much the Community depends on every Man's doing his Office; his own proper Work appears by the natural Body, in which if any one part fail in its Function, the Whole ſuffers; and if the Body be kept in a good ſtate of Health, every Member in it muſt do that for which by Nature it was fitted.</p>
            <p>I need make no Application, nor add any more on this Particular; for there is no Man of any Obſervation, but ſees how much the Quiet of Families, of Neighbours, nay, and of Kingdoms, depends on this regular, orderly Induſtry: For, who are the Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, the Perſons that cauſe Anger in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that do the Devil's Work in fowing Diſcord amongſt Friends and Brethren? Who are the Picklocks of, and Pryers into other Mens Secrets, the Obſervers of others, the Story-tellers, the Makebates? Are they not the Idle?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:96861:195"/>
Who are they that ſit in Judgment on every Man? Who call their Governours to account? Who gravely blame their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and cenſure them for impolitick or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Adminiſtration? Are they not Men that neglect their own Buſineſs?</p>
            <p>If others were as vain as they, and would be as inquiſitive into their Affairs, as they are into othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Mens; might they not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover as many Miſcarriages in them, as they do in others? Why, <hi>Thou Hypocrite, firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Beam out of thine own Eye: Thou that judgeſt another, judg thy ſelf.</hi> Firſt do thine own Buſineſs, and then I dare ſay, thou wilt not be ſo much at leiſure, or have no great liſt to meddle with other Men.</p>
            <p>Thus I have repreſented ſome of the Advantages that ariſe from Mens doing their own Work, and the Miſchiefs which follow on the neglect of it. They are either idle, and do nothing; or needleſly, and fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and miſchievouſly buſy, and ſo do worſe than nothing. And both ways bring innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Miſchiefs on themſelves, and are the Authors of the greateſt Diſturbances and Calamities in Human Society.</p>
            <p>In ſhort then, that I may conclude this Diſcourſe. Such who ſpend their Time in doing nothing, let me ask them, Why will they <hi>ſtand all the day idle?</hi> I am ſure they cannot anſwer me, as they in the Parable, <hi>No one has ſet us to work:</hi> For, the great Lord and Maſter of us all, has ſent us into this his Vineyard, that we ſhould labour in
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:96861:196"/>
it; he has given us a Charge to promote the Perfection and Happineſs of our ſelves, and of our Brethren; and has directed us to the particular ways in which we are to do it, by the natural and acquired Abilities he has given us, and by our outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the Relations we are in to others, and the Opportunities we have; hath ſhewn us particularly what is <hi>that Good which he would have us do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God and our own Nature, the Neceſſities of our private Relations, and perhaps alſo the Service of the Publick, call aloud to us, that we would up and be doing; that we would pull our hands out of our Boſom, and be at work.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo, when the Time ſhall come when we muſt receive according to our Works, how we ſhall be abaſh'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, if we have ſpent our Life in Sloth and Idleneſs, if we have, like that idle Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>laid up our Talent in a Napkin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would hope that this Diſcourſe is leſs needful in this Renowned City, where you have learn'd by long experience, that whatever ſome miſtaken Gentlemen may think or ſay to the contrary, your Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not only your Profit, but your Honour.</p>
            <p>I will therefore ſay ſomething to the other ſort, at whom the Apoſtle aim'd in this Exhortation, thoſe that are idly and very evilly buſy, that ſpend much of their Time in obſerving other Men, are
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:96861:196"/>
very inquiſitive what others do, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not themſelves. They, like thoſe Women in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 13. are firſt <hi>idle,</hi> and then asking concerning others, (as <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ius</hi> renders <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) and <hi>Pratlers,</hi> and then <hi>ſpeaking things they ought not;</hi> for in <hi>many Words muſt be Vanity.</hi> They ſpeak againſt their Neighbours, againſt their Governours; nay, and perhaps ſtay not there, but go on, and open their Mouths againſt Heaven; they blaſpheme God, and ſpeak evil of his Adminiſtration of Things.</p>
            <p>Let me a little plead with you. And firſt I will ask you, Have you ſo much leiſure over from your own Buſineſs, as to take upon you the Care of others Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and ſuch as do not in the leaſt apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to you?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Have you done your own Buſineſs? or have you done it ſo well? Have you ſo diſcharged your Office, your Truſt? if you have not, mind what belongs to you. Be not dreſſing other Mens Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, whilſt you neglect your own; nor be ſo your Brother's Keeeper, as not to be Keeper of your ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, Let me ask you, Who made you a Judg? Has God made you a Cenſor of the Manners and Ways of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? Where is your Commiſſion? And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hy will you meddle with that which concerns you not? Why will you run whither neither Charity nor Wiſdom
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:96861:197"/>
ſends you? Why will you do ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, ſo vain, ſo hazardous a thing as this? Why will you ceaſe to live the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and uſeful Lives of Men, and live the Life of Flies; wondrous buſy, poſting from one place to another, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great Buz, ſpoiling many things, mending nothing, cauſing a diſturbance, blowing upon every thing, but doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to any good purpoſe?</p>
            <p>If any think themſelves too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and that a larger Sphere would bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter become their great Minds; I deſire them to conſider the Apologue: If the <hi>Candle</hi> ſhould think it ſelf confined in the <hi>Lanthorn,</hi> and therefore take it ſelf out, and ſet it ſelf upon a great Hill, it would neither be ſo ſecure it ſelf, nor ſo uſeful to others; it would be in danger to be blown out; and whilſt it burn'd, it would not ſerve the Neceſſities of Men ſo well as it did in the Lanthorn.</p>
            <p>To conclude; Remember, I beſeech you, the Time is coming, when it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of every one of us, what we have done with the <hi>Talent,</hi> thoſe Parts, and thoſe Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities which were committed to us; and how we have behaved our ſelves in that Station and Place in which we are ſet; and how every one of us, Magiſtrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Maſters, Servants, Merchants, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks, diſcharged our ſeveral Work we undertook.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:96861:197"/>
Let us all therefore be perſuaded, firſt, to ſhew Piety at home, to rule well our own Houſe, our own Province; to be true to our Truſts, and faithful in the diſcharge of every Office in which we are; to do carefully our own Work, whatever it be; that ſo when the great Lord ſhall come, he may find us All to have been <hi>faithful and good Stewards:</hi> And we may then hear him ſaying, <hi>Well-done, good and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, thou haſt been faithful in a few things; thou ſhalt receive more.</hi>

            <p>THE Apoſtle is here after his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, crowding together and heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Exhortations on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This he uſually does with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to their Connexion with, and Dependance on each other: He knew the Cognation of all Vertues to be ſuch, that any one diſpoſes to any, to every one.

            <p>As for thoſe who will not allow this Text to belong to Religion: They look upon it as Advice given them, how to manage their ſecular and domeſtick Affairs, and that it has no relation to their Spiritual State; Or at beſt, that it is only a piece of Morality, which they allow to come no farther than the Court of the Gentiles; that it might be a proper Argument for the Diſcourſe of a Heathen, but not of a Miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To theſe I ſay, that this is indeed excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Counſel, and very advantagious to Mens ſecular Intereſts; but it is alſo of great moment to our Spiritual State, the Welfare of our Souls.</p>
            <p>We muſt not oppoſe Soul and Body, the preſent and the future Life. <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> or the Chriſtian Religion, has <hi>Precepts</hi> as well as <hi>Promiſes,</hi> whereby it is <hi>profitable to the Life that now is,</hi> as well as to <hi>that which is to come.</hi> But I beſeech you take care how you ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Morality from Religion, this will prove the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>There is no ſuch Gulf betwixt theſe two, as they imagine, who confine Religion to thoſe Actions which immediately reſpect God; no, it extends it ſelf to the whole courſe of our Lives: Nay, let us not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:96861:200"/>
Morality, as if it did not (if rightly underſtood) make the far greateſt part of our Religion; or as if it were not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make us good and happy; for nothing can be more neceſſary than that is, nothing can be ſo neceſſary as that.</p>
            <p>This I premiſe, that no Prejudice what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may make the Apoſtle's Exhortation leſs effectual: The particular occaſion of which ſeems to have been this: There were thoſe among the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> who were thruſting themſelves into other Mens <hi>Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and Concerns, but neglected <hi>their own,</hi> by which they occaſion'd Trouble to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Diſturbance to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The Apoſtle therefore, willing to reform this great Abuſe and Diſorder, and to remove and prevent all that Diſquiet and Diſturbance which roſe from it: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them in general, <hi>To ſtudy to be quiet, i. e.</hi> to keep themſelves and others out of Trouble, to do nothing that may cauſe, or, but occaſion diſquiets, to omit nothing that may keep them off. And in particular, he adviſes them to do their <hi>own Buſineſs,</hi> which implies that they ſhould not meddle with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men's; this having been the Inlet to, and Cauſe of thoſe Diſturbances which had been amongſt them.</p>
            <p>This appears to have been the occaſion of theſe Words. In diſcourſing of which, I ſhall,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Explain and declare what is the Duty here enjoyned.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:96861:200"/>
II. Shall offer ſome Reaſons of it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Shall lay down Directions, and give ſome Advices, whereby we may be aſſiſted in doing it. And having ſhewn what it is we are to do, and why, and how it is to be done, I ſhall conclude with a ſhort Reflexion upon the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For Explication of the Words. That which we here render, <hi>to ſtudy,</hi> ſignifies ſuch an earneſt Contention, as Men uſe vvhen they are in purſuit of Honour: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it denotes the ſhewing our greateſt Care, and exerting our utmoſt Endeavours.</p>
            <p>That about which we are required to be ſo earneſt, is <hi>to be quiet</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which Word when it is applied to <hi>natural</hi> Agents, ſignifies Reſt, the Abſence of, and the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Motion: When it is transferred to <hi>moral,</hi> we underſtand by it a Privation or Ceſſation from ſome voluntary Action or Paſſion, which may be either good or bad, but is for the moſt part bad, either phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally or morally, or both. So this Word is rendred, <hi>to keep ſilence,</hi> in the <hi>Acts;</hi> and in St. <hi>Luke, to reſt from Work;</hi> in other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors it is commonly put for <hi>Truce</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and is oppoſed to <hi>War;</hi> and likewiſe to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to <hi>being unduly and over-buſy;</hi> and indeed to all <hi>Trouble</hi> whatſoever, a quiet and a troubled Mind are Expreſſions of two very contrary States, as all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe the Apoſtle might uſe the Word in this large Senſe, and ſo give a general
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:96861:201"/>
Precept on a particular occaſion of the Troubles that aroſe from ſome Mens Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in their own Affairs, and Pragmatl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs in other Mens, to which he chiefly referr'd: And I ſhall have regard to this alſo in my Diſcourſe, tho I ſhall not confine my ſelf to it, but ſhall conſider <hi>Quiet</hi> more largely, as it denotes freedom from other Troubles, beſides thoſe that have their Riſe from the meddling with matters that belong not to us.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may here enquire, whether this Precept be univerſal, and how far it obliges, whether in all Caſes, or in ſome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. This reaches Chriſtians of all Times and Places, as well as thoſe that lived in <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> 1600 Years ago. For, it was not founded on any particular, but on gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal Reaſons, and is a Law to us all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I cannot ſay it obliges us either to be our ſelves, or to keep others always <hi>quiet,</hi> (for in many Caſes; this is neither poſſible, nor fit, nor beneficial) yet it does lay this Obligation on us, alway to intend and aim at, to purſue and endeavour after it, even in thoſe very Inſtances where it would be evil and miſchievous to us, if we were not under ſome preſent Diſquiet, we are in and by thoſe particular Troubles to ſeek after <hi>Quiet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when we are, and it is good we ſhould be under ſome Diſcompoſure, yet ought we to take care, that we be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:96861:201"/>
of this Treaſure, and that we fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go no more than Neceſſity extorts; <hi>i. e.</hi> we ought not, where we can help it, to ſuffer our ſelves to be more or longer under Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than will ſerve for the attaining ſome greater good, ſome greater and more lalb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranquillity. As much as is poſſible, we ſhould take care never to ſuffer our ſelves to be diſturbed, unleſs it be in order to ſomething that is better, and will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a greater <hi>Quiet</hi> than that was, of which by this Trouble we were diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed.</p>
            <p>If we do otherwiſe, we make a very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Bargain: for, we ſhall part with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and certain Good (as <hi>Quiet</hi> is) for ſomething that is worſe, or that we are not ſure of obtaining. We muſt do in this caſe, as Merchants do, when they are in danger of Shipwrac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then, and not till they be out of hopes to ſave themſelves any other way, will they throw their Goods over-board. We muſt never part with our <hi>Quiet,</hi> but to gain ſomething better by it: part with it as the Husbandman does with his Seed, which he throws into the Gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ored unto us with great Encreaſe.</p>
            <p>Thus then we are obliged to <hi>be quiet</hi> in all caſes, where it is good ſo to be; and it is good (as all things elſe are) as far as it hath a Tendency to the Perfection, and beſt State of our ſelves and others: and where-ever it will contribute more to this, than the contrary Trouble, there it is not only

poſitively, but comparatively good, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to be preferr'd.</p>
            <p>This, I think, is as much as is neceſſary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be ſaid for the Satisfaction of this Enquity, how far we are obliged <hi>to be Quiet, viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſomething more ſhould be added concerning the Obligation that lies on us as to others. Two things I ſhall advertiſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we cannot judg ſo well for that as vve may for our ſelves, when it will be beſt for them to be diſturbed; and conſequently it will be ſeldomer that we muſt deprive them of their Quiet, than we may forgo our own For, we muſt never do this, but when we know it is beſt, and that we can very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know of other Men. But this is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> neither. For,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt alſo know, that we are fitted with Skill and Power, and qualified with Authority to give them this Diſquiet. For how profitable ſoever it might be to them yet if we be not thus inſtructed and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized for the doing it, we muſt not do it <hi>E. g.</hi> I a private Man, muſt not take upon me to puniſh another Man's Child or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, tho his Father, or Maſter, or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:96861:202"/>
By what hath been ſaid, may appear, how far this Precept of <hi>Studying to be Quiet</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory; and it does appear to be of a large extent. For there are few Inſtances, wherein we can ſay concerning our ſelves, that it is better and more conducing to our happineſs, that we be in Trouble than in Quiet.</p>
            <p>And there are fewer, in which we can pronounce thus concerning other Men, who are leſs known to us than our ſelves. And where we can come to any certainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, yet for the moſt part we want Wiſdom to manage their Diſturbance to ſuch an advantage, or Warrant from the Laws to undertake it.</p>

            <p>The holy <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in his moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effuſions, had not this effect to make Men raving and frantick, but calm and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. All his Influences fall on our Souls gently and eaſily: he does not uſe Violence and Force, but moves us naturally. He does not afright and amaze, but inſinuate; nor ſuddenly excite vehement Paſſions, but inſtruct and teach; and in this natural way raiſes thoſe Affections that are conſequent on, and do comport with the uſe of our Minds.</p>
            <p>If we take a view of all the Methods which the Wiſdom of God has uſed with us, we ſhall obſerve that his <hi>Doctrine has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:96861:205"/>
gently and gradually, and in no ſuch way as might aſtoniſh and diſmay us. As there was no <hi>noiſe of Axes and Hammers</hi> in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo neither has any noiſe been in building the Temple, of which that was a Type, the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then <hi>God</hi> hath been pleaſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter humane affairs in ſo <hi>quiet</hi> and ſtill a way, as not to put us into the leaſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure, we cannot but conclude, that a quiet even frame of Spirit, is <hi>with God a thing of great Price,</hi> and therefore moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently Good.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If any deſire yet further aſſurance in this matter, let him conſider the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man. Let him conſider it both Singly and in Society, and ſee if <hi>Quietneſs</hi> be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly well ſuited to it, and if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary be not very incongruous.</p>
            <p>Let any one that ſees a Man in Fury and Rage, or under any diſturbance, ſay if he be himſelf, if this become him. On the contrary, if he ſee him quiet and compoſed, and reaſon calmly and cooly, this is a pleaſing Sight; now he acts as he thinks a Man ſhould.</p>
            <p>It is for Lions and Tigers, for Bears and Wolves to roar and howl and rage; but this is not fit for Men; it belongs to them to reaſon, and to be wiſe, and judge truly of things; but <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> are ſeldom conſiſtent together.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Society,</hi> tho' it is a moſt lovely thing when the Members of it are all u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:96861:205"/>
in a firm Peace; yet when they are Quarrel ſome and Contentious, when they are caſhing with each others Intereſts, there is not a more horrid Monſter to be found than this; It appears ugly and deformed to all Men.</p>
            <p>From whence it appears, that <hi>Quietneſs</hi> is moſt agreeable to Humane Nature, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone or incorporated in Society; and conſequently highly good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>I need not add to this, how well it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us, as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to be quiet. I will only ſay this, he that hath the Faith of Chriſt, what ſhould diſmay or diſquiet him? He may triumph over all the troublers of other Mens Peace, and ſay that none of them all ſhall diſcompoſe him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To this we may add the numberleſs Advantages, which ariſe from being quiet, both to Single Perſons and to Bodies of Men. He that keeps himſelf undiſturb'd, hath a clear underſtanding, a perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and is hereby enabled to the beſt Diſcharge of all the Functions of his Mind. He enjoys a great and conſtant ſatisfaction: this being the State of (and according to <hi>Epicurus)</hi> the higheſt Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, this Man hath attain'd to a great degree of happineſs already, and is in the ready way to the moſt conſummate Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Bliſs of which he is capable.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This is intrinſecal to, and an eſſential part of Happineſs, inſomuch that it cannot be without it. No Man that is in trouble
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:96861:206"/>
is happy, and no Man that is <hi>quiet</hi> can be thought miſerable.</p>
            <p>After all this, which is but a ſhort ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of what might be ſaid to ſhew the goodneſs, the profitableneſs, the abſolute neceſſity of Quiet, ſure every one will ſet an high value on this moſt ineſtimable Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and will by no means prodigally throw away his own, nor uncharitably hinder other Men's <hi>Quiet.</hi> Nay, I hope every one will by the excellent Goodneſs of this be perſwaded to be ſo wiſe as to provide for, and ſecure Quiet to himſelf: and that he will alſo, in all prudent and fit ways beſtir himſelf, that all others may live quiet and peaceable Lives as well as himſelf.</p>
            <p>Since therefore <hi>Quiet</hi> is ſo neceſſary to ſo great a part of humane Happineſs, out of the deſire we have that both we and others ſhould be happy, let us endeavour to keep them and our ſelves quiet: and as we would not be acceſſary to our own, or their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, let us not trouble our ſelves or them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I proceed now to the Directions and Advices, whereby we may be aſſiſted in the Performance of this great and good Duty.</p>
            <p>I begin with thoſe, that reſpect every Man's <hi>own Quiet.</hi> Indeed this is in the firſt place to be looked to; becauſe it will have a mighty Influence on the Quiet of others. There is nothing more truly obſerv'd than this, that if a Man be at Peace within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will behave himſelf peaceably to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And accordingly we may ſee, that
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:96861:206"/>
all they who are the Diſturbers of the Peace of Societies, are unquiet in their own Minds. They have unſatisfied Deſires, ungovern'd Appetites, tumultuous Paſſions, a War within their own Breaſts; Underſtanding and Will, Reaſon and Paſſions are at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: How can it be then, but that as they are in themſelves, they ſhould be to others?</p>
            <p>He that does not keep Peace within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how is it to be expected he ſhould keep it in his Family, or Neighbourhood; in the Church or State wherein he lives? The firſt Springs of all the Diſorders, Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Tumults, Wars in the World, are the Diſorders and Commotions that are in the Minds of private Men.</p>
            <p>My general Counſel to particular Perſons is, That they would ſtrive after <hi>Perfection,</hi> or <hi>all Good</hi> in <hi>themſelves</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, conſtant, orderly Exerciſe of all their Faculties, and purſuit of all their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this Advice is, That we naturally and neceſſarily deſire the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſelves or others, and we cannot be <hi>quiet</hi> but in the Accompliſhment of that great Deſire, which our great Creator hath implanted in our Natures, and hath rooted ſo deep, that it can never be ſeparated from them.</p>
            <p>More particularly; Let us above all keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, keep a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> a Conſcience void of Offence toward God and Men. Let us undertake every thing with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:96861:207"/>
of our own Mind, and do every thing ſo as to have our own Approbation, and to have reaſon to believe that we are <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by God,</hi> and by all wiſe and good Men. If we do thus, we do well, and that is the only firm Foundation of inward Peace.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <hi>There is no Peace to the Wicked, but he is like the troubled Sea, whoſe Waters caſt up M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e and Dirt.</hi> He is troubleſome to himſelf, and he that is ſo, will be troubleſom to others.</p>
            <p>This is the Sum of the Advice I would give, in order to our being quiet in our ſelves, Live well, do good, be holy and vertuous.</p>
            <p>And if we would endeavour that others may be quiet, as we our ſelves are, let us endeavour to promote their Holineſs, and Vertue, and Perfection, as we do our own: For aſſuredly, an unmoveable Quiet, and a ſure and laſting Peace, can be ſet on no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundation, but Holineſs and Vertue. So much are they miſtaken, who think to make Men quiet, by making them vicious, and wicked, or by leſſening their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>They that govern the World, and deſign the Peace of it, would do well to obſerve, if this courſe they take, be the way to make any Man quiet in himſelf; if Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Wickedneſs will make him peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able within, then they may expect the ſame ſucceſs from them in Societies and States: but if moſt of our inward Trouble riſe
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:96861:207"/>
from theſe Springs: Why ſhould it not be thought that they will have the ſame Effects in others, which they have in us, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities as in private Perſons; and that they will as much diſturb the World, as they do the Mind where they are?</p>
            <p>No, if <hi>Politicians</hi> would obſerve, they might take notice, that as Satisfaction of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and purſuit of the Inclinations, which are natural, and the neglect of thoſe that are not; the conſtant and orderly exerciſe of all our natural Faculties in a tendency to the perfection of the vvhole, is the only vvay to procure an univerſal and laſting <hi>Quiet</hi> in a Man's own Mind; ſo neither is there any other way to procure the Peace of all Men.</p>
            <p>Yet more particularly; the Sum of what I ſhould adviſe for the removing and obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Trouble, and the procuring and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Quiet</hi> in our ſelves and among Men, is;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we ſhould oppoſe no Man's true <hi>Intereſt,</hi> where that does not oppoſe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and greater Good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we ſhould reconcile it with, nay, as much as is poſſible, make it our <hi>own,</hi> as indeed it is, ſince no Man can be happy if another be miſerable. No Man can be quiet in himſelf, vvhile another that is by him is in trouble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be willing to remit of, and recede from your ovvn ſtrict <hi>Right,</hi> if that vvill contribute to Peace. So <hi>Abraham</hi> did vvith <hi>Lot,</hi> tho being the elder, and his Uncle, he
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:96861:208"/>
might, if he vvould, have inſiſted on it, have had the choice, yet he leaves it to <hi>Lot: See, the Land is before thee,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Keep your ſelves <hi>innocent,</hi> hurt no Man by Word or Deed; let no Man be the vvorſe for you: Do ill to none, ſpeak ill of none. Do not take upon you to be an Hiſtorian, an Intelligencer of Mens Faults, nor ever uncover the Shame and Nakedneſs of your Brother, but vvhen Neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, and Charity incites you.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Be <hi>juſt:</hi> Allow every Man that vvhich the Lavvs of Nature and Society have given him. Intrench the Rights, invade the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of no Man: do not abridg him of that vvhich God and Nature, or Men have conferr'd on him; or, vvhich by his ovvn Vertue, his Prudence, Care and Induſtry he has acquired.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Be univerſally <hi>charitable;</hi> that is, be willing to contribute vvhat in you lies, to every Mans Happineſs. Maintain a conſtant Diſpoſition to Goodneſs and Benignity. Hate none, envy none: Love not only your ſelf, or a few, but all.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Be diligent in your <hi>own Buſineſs:</hi> for by this means, you,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Will have more Liberty, and be better able to aſſiſt others. <hi>Work,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that ye may have to give to him that needs.</hi> The diligent Man doth not only get that which is ſufficient for his own Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but an Overplus for other Men: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the idle Man, his <hi>own Mouth</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) his own Wants take up not only all
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:96861:208"/>
that he gets, but ſtill calls for more. And yet,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The diligent Man, tho he has ſome time to ſpare from his own Work, he hath not ſo much as to throw away in a needleſs buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in other Mens matters: he is ſo much at liberty from the Service of himſelf, by his having been diligent, as that he hath leiſure to help his Brother; to do whatever <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> under the Conduct of Prudence ſhall direct him: but his Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will not ſuffer him to be vainly and merely out of <hi>Curioſity</hi> prying into, and buſied about other Mens matters. <hi>Tantumnè ab re tua tibi ſuppetit otii aliena ut cures, ea<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> quae nihil ad te attinent?</hi> What, ſaith he to himſelf, when he finds he is haſtily ingaging himſelf in ſuch foreign Affairs, Can I find nothing to do of my own, that I muſt thus go a forraging for Work? Is not mine own Vineyard neglected, whilſt I dreſs other Mens? Is there not ſomething to be done, which is more my proper Buſineſs than this I am about?</p>
            <p>This is that which follows in the Verſe, <hi>to do our own Buſineſs;</hi> which one Counſel, if it were well minded, would prevent the moſt and greateſt Troubles that we have from one another. If we would keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our own Compaſs, move in our own Spheres; reach not at things too high for us, engage not to do what we cannot do; not judg, where we do not underſtand; obſerve
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:96861:209"/>
our Order, and keep our Rank; it would contribute very much both to the quiet of our own Minds, and to the Peace of the World. The neglect of this <hi>one thing,</hi> ſeems to have been the great cauſe of all the Sin and Miſery, and conſequently the Trouble that is in the World. The proud <hi>Angels left their own Habitation,</hi> their Province, and this was their Fall.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort: Carry about no idle Tales: Do not make, nor widen Differences: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not thy ſelf in any Angry Contention: indeed never contend with others, but who ſhall do moſt Good.</p>
            <p>And now in a word, to reflect upon what has been diſcourſed: If <hi>Quiet</hi> be ſo good and deſirable, if we have ſo much reaſon to ſeek it, let us take Shame to our ſelves, that we have ſo much neglected, that we have ſo much oppoſed ſo great a <hi>Good,</hi> that we have been Enemies to our own and other Mens Peace.</p>
            <p>I doubt we have all too much reaſon to tax our ſelves of being notoriouſly faulty in this Particular. How little have we ſtudied our own <hi>Quiet?</hi> how have we diſturbed other Mens? And what a cauſe of Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is it, when we ſee Mankind ſuch Troublers every Man of himſelf, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man of his Brother; that whereas we ſhould be taking all good ways to pleaſe
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:96861:209"/>
and quiet our ſelves and others, we are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faſt in the ways that lead to Sorrow, but the <hi>way of Peace</hi> we will not <hi>know!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us no longer be ſo fooliſhly, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally wicked, as to be Troublers of our ſelves and others; but in all wiſe and good ways poſſible, let us do our utmoſt, that both we and all other Men may be as quiet here on Earth, as is compatible to this State; that this may be to us the firſt-Fruits of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Sabbatiſm, that perpetual <hi>Reſt,</hi> which remains for the <hi>Peaceable,</hi> the Children and People of God.</p>

            <p>THere is a general, and I doubt a very juſt Complaint of a moſt groſs, and almoſt univerſal Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in the <hi>Education of Children.</hi> And indeed I fear, if a <hi>Viſitation</hi> were made of every Family and School in the Land, few in compariſon would be found, who take care of, or have Skill in this great Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who ſeem not to be negligent, I would ask them, What Time they beſtow, what Thoughts they lay out on their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? I would enquire after the Deſigns and Methods they have, all the Contrivances
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:96861:211"/>
and ways they uſe vvith them. And I am afraid thoſe that are thought by others, and think themſelves moſt careful, would not be able upon ſuch an Enquiry to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of great Negligence; they would appear both very unskilful, and very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
            <p>And yet this thing which is ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and leſs underſtood, is of as great Moment and Conſequence as any one thing; and that both on a publick and private ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And among the other, perhaps there is not a greater and more general Cauſe of all Wickedneſs, and of the Miſchiefs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon it, than the no, or ill Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children.</p>
            <p>We do, and we have too much cauſe to complain of In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>delity and Atheiſm, of the Profaneneſs and Debauchery, of the Unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſs, the Superſtition and Fanaticiſm, the perverſe Schiſmaticalneſs, the dull Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and great Corruption of the Age in which we live. One main cauſe of which, if we look back, we ſhall find to have been the want of Care and Skill in the educating of Children.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Action that is here required, <hi>Train.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The Object, <hi>a Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The Specification, <hi>in his Way.</hi> And then I ſhall propound ſome Reaſons and Arguments to perſwade us to this Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:96861:211"/>
I. As to the Action, <hi>Train:</hi> This Word does fully expreſs the Original, which alſo is tranſlated <hi>Catechiſe:</hi> And it ſignifies two Things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Inſtructing or teaching, which is done by Precepts, and by Examples.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Initiating, inuring, exerciſing. Thus Souldiers are train'd when they are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in handling of their Arms, in their keeping Rank and File, and in the doing of thoſe things which they muſt do when they come to encounter an Enemy.</p>
            <p>This is that which the wiſe Man adviſes to be done by the Child; let him be <hi>trained.</hi> And 'tis excellent Counſel, much better than if he had ſaid only, inſtruct or teach. For, as the diſciplin'd and exercis'd Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is much more dextrous at the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Arms, than he only, who has been told what he muſt do, but has never us'd to do it; ſo undoubtedly, he who has been initiated in his Work, will be far more ready at it, and more diſpoſed to it, than he who has only been directed what, and perſwaded why he ſhould do it, but has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver begun to do it.</p>
            <p>We obſerve a very great diſtance betwixt our knowing what and why we ſhould act, and our acting. How frequent is it for Men very well to underſtand what is to be done, and yet not to do it?</p>
            <p>In many Caſes alſo, Actions are never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but by acting: The doing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Works informs and incites, and enables
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:96861:212"/>
us more than any other way: Nay, the very Attempt and Eſſay at that which we cannot yet do, we all know carries ſo much Power along with it, that we are in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and by frequent Trials, enabled to do that well, which we could not do at all when we firſt attempted it.</p>
            <p>I have the rather taken notice of the force that is in the word <hi>train,</hi> becauſe, as I have ſaid, we may in ſome Caſes underſtand, and not act: and in ſome, acting is the beſt way to underſtand; I am ſure it is always the beſt Method to ſecure and keep that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and thoſe Inclinations which we have to ſuch Actions. In <hi>Practicals,</hi> the beſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and the ſtrongeſt Inclinations are got by Practice: Uſe inclines Men to repeat the ſame Actions: And Cuſtom has always been eſteemed a ſecond Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I proceed to conſider the <hi>Object,</hi> who it is that is to be thus <hi>trained:</hi> It is a <hi>Child, i. e.</hi> Man whilſt he is young<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when he is firſt capable of this Inſtruction and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
            <p>Man is ever to be learning. <hi>Cato</hi> thought himſelf never too old to learn: And every other Man ſhould think the ſame, but there is very great Advantage of this being begun betimes. They that make no entrance on a thing in their firſt Years, ſeldom are brought to it afterwards; or if they be, 'tis always with great Difficulty; and it muſt be with Damage; for they are hindred from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king progreſs in ſome other matters more

            <p>

            <p>This I take to be the true meaning of that Phraſe, <hi>His Way,</hi> which implies two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Way that's common to all Men, the Way of Man, of every Man, every one endow'd with humane Nature and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="418" facs="tcp:96861:213"/>
2. That Way, which is peculiar to this, or that, or the other Man; that for which, by his <hi>Genius,</hi> (as we ſay) by his Temper and Inclination, or by his external Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he is moſt adapted, and fit, and as it were, ſet apart: That is by Divines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, our general Calling, this our particular.</p>
            <p>That Way which is common to all, and is the <hi>Way of every Man,</hi> is the doing thoſe Works, which every one that has the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Man, is made and furniſhed to do. I need not mention thoſe of the Body, which are common to us with Beaſts. But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are more peculiar to Man, and belong as it were to him, are Knowledg, and Choice, and keeping good Order among all our Faculties, purſuing the Inclinations we have to our own Perfection and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to help others to be in as good a condition as our ſelves are, or would be: To be devout towards God: To be juſt and honeſt, true, and faithful, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Men: To do that univerſally, which we think to be fit and right, which, upon the largeſt knowledg we can get, we judg to be good: To do no Evil, and to do all the Good we can poſſibly: This is the <hi>Way of every Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which is <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that Man</hi>'s Way beſides, is to be employed in this or that Trade, according as he is fitted; the Husbandry, Merchandiſe, Mechanick or Liberal Arts; the Study of Phyſick, Law, Divinity, as his own Inclination and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:96861:213"/>
and the Opportunity he has to attain to any of theſe, ſhall direct. Tho we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read it in the Faces of Children, yet in their Humour and Carriage we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture what they will be fit for.</p>
            <p>Now whoſoever takes a ſurvey of the Nature of Man, as he will diſcover it was the Contrivance and Work of great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs; ſo from an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral Faculties and Capacities, Inclinations and Appetites, Inſtinct and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>city of Mankind, he will conclude which is the <hi>Way in which he ſhould go,</hi> which is the <hi>Way of Man,</hi> the Life that is ſuitable to ſuch a Nature as ours is: For, he will be fully reſolved in this, that it muſt be the natural Exerciſe and Perfection of thoſe Powers, the filling thoſe Capacities, in the Purſuit of thoſe Inclinations, the Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Satisfaction of thoſe Appetites, the Obſervance of thoſe Inſtincts, and giving heed to ſuch Preſages and Conjectures as the Mind by its Nimbleneſs and Sagacity makes.</p>
            <p>If theſe be conſidered, 1. Severally and a part; 2. Jointly, as they are all united and conſiſting together, they make up the whole human Nature. As they conſiſt with, and are in ſubordination to each other, they will give us a clear view of the whole Way or Life of Man, all that he was made for by his great Creator.</p>
            <p>That which will help us to a more diſtinct knowledg of this, will be to compare our Nature with the Brutiſh, which is below us,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:96861:214"/>
and the Angelic, which is above us. We partake of both Natures, we have the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Appetites both of Angels and of Brutes.</p>
            <p>From hence I infer, That if we live wholly as either meer Animals, or as pure Spirits, we live not agreeably to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and State. We muſt, on the one hand, raiſe up our ſelves above the low Life of Senſitives; and yet we muſt not foar ſo high as the Life of Spirits deveſted of Fleſh and Blood. That Way is too low, and this too high; the Way of Man lies in the middle betwixt theſe two. We muſt not ſink down into, and yet we muſt comply with our earthly, fleſhly, animal State.</p>
            <p>And indeed here is the great Difficulty, to ſee that theſe two Lifes do not claſh and interfere, but conſpire with, and be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable and friendly to each other, to bring down Heaven to Earth, and to advance Earth to Heaven, as much as is poſſible.</p>
            <p>This is the Skill, this is <hi>Wiſdom</hi> indeed, that the Soul condeſcend to the Condition and Services of this lower Life of Fleſh and Senſe, and yet not loſe, not forgo its own ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Life. To come down from, and yet ſtill to be in Heaven, whilſt we are on Earth: To behave our ſelves like Men <hi>in the Fleſh,</hi> and yet at the ſame time to act as becomes thoſe who are endow'd with ſpiritual divine Souls; this is the way of Man, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction to the way or life of brute Animals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:96861:214"/>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how is this Life to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? What muſt we do, that we may neither ſink below our ſelves, and become Brutes, nor yet ſtretch our ſelves beyond our Line, and live like the Spirits, which are not in conjunction with earthly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let us be in a ſincere and conſtant purſuit of that which is, and, when we are fitteſt to judg, we think to be <hi>beſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This will be as the Polar Star to direct our Courſe. If we mind this, we ſhall ſteer ſafely betwixt the two Rocks; we ſhall neither depreſs the Soul, nor neglect the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: we ſhall advance Underſtanding and Liberty, and all the rational and higher Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. And this will be done without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Senſe, and the Animal Life and Powers.</p>
            <p>If we conſtantly aim at doing that which is <hi>best,</hi> which is that to which by our very Natures we are framed, we ſhall then make more account of our Soul than of our Body, more account of Underſtanding, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Conſcience, than of Senſe and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality; we ſhall bring the Body into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and keep the Animal ſerviceable to the Mind. And when they are once come to this, (which is the true natural State, and tends to the preſervation and perfection of them both, as well as conduces to that of the World without) then the Intereſts are reconciled, they are all one, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:96861:215"/>
and conſpire together; the Soul makes much of its good Servant the Body, and the Servant is well-pleaſed with the Employment it is put to by ſuch a Maſter: Neither of them hinder other's attainment to its juſt perfection: but on the contrary, the Soul is helped and furthered by its Conjunction with the Body; and no Faculty of that, but ſhall one way or other become an Occaſion, and the Matter or Inſtrument of the Soul's Uſe, and thereby of the Enlargement of its Underſtanding, or Liberty, or Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus the Animal Life is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with, but ſerviceable to the Life of Knowledg and Liberty, of Wiſdom and Vertue: And on the other hand, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life heightens and invigorates the ſenſible and animal: It <hi>becomes Health to the Navel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From all that I have hitherto ſaid, I may conclude, That Man's Way in general, or the Way in which all and every Man ſhould go, is ſuch an Exerciſe of his natural Powers, as either is their Perfection, or has a direct tendency to it, and is alſo in order to the perfection of all others, and will bring Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the great Author of them. This in general.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now deſcend to a ſomewhat more particular Account of this Way; and ſhall mention,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Way of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> when a Man's Reaſon preſides and governs, and all the other Faculties and Appetites are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:96861:215"/>
and obedient to it. This is the truly natural Way; for the Underſtanding was made to be chief, and all elſe in Man to be Inferior and ſubordinate. Conſequently to this, and which is implied in it, is,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Way of Knowledg and Truth.</hi> Theſe are the Perfections of the Underſtanding, and without which it is no more fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and guide our Appetites, than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted Candle is to give us light; or a Guide that is ignorant in the Way, is fit to direct us to our Journey's End. More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly;</p>
            <p>The Way of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which is, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding to our ſelves good, and great, and attainable Ends, and purſuing them in the uſe of proper, and fit, and likely Means. This implies not only Knowledg, but Choice, and therefore contains in it the Will, as well as the Underſtanding; but yet all this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reducible to that which I call the <hi>Way of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I inſiſt the rather on this, becauſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> is the greateſt, higheſt, and moſt proper and peculiar Principle that is in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, that which ſo remarkably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes betwixt Man and Beaſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one Man and another: And becauſe our Works are of no account, if they do not proceed from this; if they be done without it, they are not (as the Moraliſts call them) <hi>humane,</hi> not Works of <hi>Men.</hi> And the greater Perfection of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they ariſe from, the greater and better they are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:96861:216"/>
This then is the firſt particular Way, the Way of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> when our Will and all our Inclinations and Appetites, our infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Powers, are under the Conduct and Government of true Knowledg, the true <hi>Knowledg of Good and Evil,</hi> which is the Principle of Wiſdom, which is chiefly ſeen in preferring the better Good before the leſs, and in diſcerning the reference which one has to the other.</p>
            <p>This Way of Underſtanding is that which the Sacred Scripture doth ſo often call on us to walk in, and bids us not be as the <hi>Horſe, and as the Mule, which have no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, whoſe Mouth must be held with Bit and Bridle.</hi> That which a Bridle is, to reſtrain and turn them hither and thither, that ſhould our Underſtanding be to us. And how often is the good Way called the Way of Underſtanding? And they that walk not in this Way, are ſaid to be <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>err in their Hearts,</hi> and to be <hi>fooliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly;</hi> I may here alſo mention the Way of <hi>Voluntary Action,</hi> the Way of <hi>Self-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> and <hi>free Choice.</hi> This is alſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Man, not to be thruſt and puſh'd on from Cauſes without; but Things muſt firſt approve themſelves to his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they are good; and when they appear ſo to him, whether he can refuſe them or not, I liſt not here to diſpute. All agree, that a Man can will nothing but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appearance of <hi>Good.</hi> And this is certain, that the Perfection of the Will is,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:96861:216"/>
when it's under the guidance and ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of the Underſtanding, when it can do nothing <hi>againſt the Truth,</hi> but with it, and <hi>for it,</hi> (if I may borrow that Phraſe.)</p>
            <p>And this is a great Perfection of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures indeed, when our Appetites and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are ſo wholly ſwayed and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Reaſon and true Knowledg, that they are never carried to any things which that does not approve; there's a perfect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, no Claſhings, no Oppoſitions. <hi>To walk</hi> in this <hi>Way,</hi> is to <hi>ſhew our ſelves Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I proceed to more Particulars of theſe Ways, both of Nature in general, and of Underſtanding and Will in particular; and I will name only three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Way of <hi>Religion</hi> and Piety towards our God, and our Saviour, which in ſhort is, to believe, and love, and fear, and truſt, and obey God above all. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, to believe, and love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the only begotten Son of God, according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation made of him in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Way of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our Brethren, to all Men: To be honeſt and juſt to every one, in giving him that which is his own, that is, that which he has a Right unto, either by the Law of Nature and Reaſon, or by the Laws of the Country, and Cuſtoms of the Place where we live: To do good to thoſe that have done good to us: To obey our Governors: To honour, <hi>i. e.</hi> to obſerve, and if they
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:96861:217"/>
need it, to maintain our Patents: To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for our Children, that they may live, and live well, and be happy: To deal fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Equals, and to be courteous to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors: To keep Promiſe with them to whom we have made it: And to be good, to be benevolent and beneficial to all, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the beſt, if they be indigent: To deſire and endeavour the Perfection and Happineſs of every one in the World; to <hi>do good to all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Way of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> by which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſuch a Regulation and Government of our ſelves, in all we do and ſuffer, as is conſiſtent with the preſervation, and makes for the perfection of all our Faculties; or, if not of all, yet of the ſupreme and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and of the reſt, ſo far as conſiſts with the perfection of the higher.</p>
            <p>We commonly call that <hi>Sobriety,</hi> which is the good Government of our ſelves, in Eating and Drinking, and ſome other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Pleaſures and Paſſions: And in ſum, when that about which we are converſant, is leſs conſiderable than our ſelves: which perhaps may imply thus much, that when we are converſant about that which is more conſiderable and valuable than we are, then we ought not to have ſuch regard to our own Preſervation and Perfection; but if we could produce any Effect which would be of greater worth than our ſelves, we ſhould do it, tho it were with the leſſening, nay, and loſs of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:96861:217"/>
But when I ſay thus, I underſtand that of our ſelves, which can be hurt, and loſt in the doing of the greateſt good: which can never be imagined of the ſupream Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for that's their Perfection.</p>
            <p>The Perfection of the Soul is to know, and where it knows fully and adequately, it knows the Perfection of a thing, and what's in order to that, and then it wills and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, it is pleaſed with that, and deſires and endeavours it where it is not; the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and greater the Soul is, the more it knows, and the more it wills and is pleaſed with the Perfection of more things.</p>
            <p>And if this, if Truth and Goodneſs, or Knowledge, and Pleaſure in the good State of things, of all things, be the Health, the Strength, the perfection of the Soul; there is no fear that it can be hurt by theſe. It cannot be leſſened or impaired, much leſs loſt and deſtroyed by Truth and Goodneſs; But on the contrary, it is raiſed and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is ſecured and advanced by them.</p>
            <p>Our other miniſtring and inferiour Powers may be loſt and deſtroyed by this, but not our Governing and Supream, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will. Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are the very Life of the Soul, and as ſoon may Bodily Life kill the Body, as thoſe ſhall hurt the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But may not this <hi>Candle of the Lord</hi> waſte it ſelf? The hotter and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Fire burns, is it not the ſooner out? And may not the Soul neglect, and ſo da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and at laſt deſtroy it ſelf, whilſt it is
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:96861:218"/>
ſo much taken up with other Objects? and particularly finding ſomething greater and better than it ſelf, it may be ſo very much employed about that other thing, as wholly to diſregard it ſelf?</p>
            <p>Again; <hi>Seeing</hi> is the Perfection of the Eye, but yet by looking on the Sun the Eye is blinded. And who knows but there may be Objects ſo tranſcendently glorious as to dazle and put out the Eye of our <hi>Mind:</hi> there may be ſo vaſt a diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſome Objects and theſe Faculties, that they may ſtretch them beyond their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tone, and ſo crack and break them. <hi>Scrutator Majeſtatis opprimetur à Gloriae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides; Experience tells us, that if the Soul does not reflect and know it ſelf, and obſerve its actions, it is Imperfect, and in the way to Ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. All theſe Inſtances are of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Or 2. of the Soul as it depends on the Body. Or 3. if they be of the Soul conſidered in it ſelf: yet they will ſignify no more than this, that the Soul may be hurt and damaged by the knowledge of ſome Truths, or Delight in ſome Goods, but it will have a preſent ſence of it; as the Eye is dazled in looking on the Sun, and ſo will turn away it ſelf from that Object.</p>
            <p>If my Obſervation be true, hitherto I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found my Faculties impaired by more clear and perfect knowledge of any thing, nor by delight in that, which I had a true knowledg of. But I have found my ſelf worſe for imperfect and obſcure Knowledg,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:96861:218"/>
and for ſuch delight, as was founded in a Lie, or a Miſtake.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſometimes the Purſuit of clear Knowledge, when it was not at all, or difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attainable, or when it was not of great uſe; and ſometimes the clear Knowledg I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of a thing has been the occaſion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining me from ſuch an Employment of my Underſtanding, or other Faculties, as was more neceſſary. So alſo Delight in, or Endeavour after this or that particular Good, may have hindred me from doing more or greater Good. But from all this I obſerve, that all the prejudice that is done me comes to this, that I am hindred from more Knowledg, or from delight in, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Good.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall eſcape this danger, if I aim at all the Knowledg I am capable of, and take delight in the Good of all.</p>
            <p>And if it ſo happen, that by this I ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice my ſelf to the Common Good, I do but follow my natural Inclination; and it is much better to periſh in obeying, than to continue in oppoſing my Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tully,</hi> ſomewhere ſays, <hi>Life is not ſo dear, as that Affection of doing Good.</hi> I add, that this is our very <hi>Life;</hi> and being ſo, I do not ſee how we can loſe or hurt our ſelves in complying with this Inclination. But I muſt not now purſue this matter any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>To return to my main Argument. From all that I have ſaid, in Explication of what is the <hi>Way</hi> or Life of <hi>Man,</hi> it may appear,

that that is called <hi>his way,</hi> which leads to that for which he was deſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> the Perfection, or good State of himſelf and others, and the Honour of God, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from this: And conſequently, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs</hi> are the Life of Man. Theſe are the things for which Man was made, for theſe he has Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which fit, and Appetites which do incline him to them.</p>
            <p>All I add farther to this is, That as we have diſtinguiſhed the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> from that of Brutes, ſo we muſt put a conſiderable Difference betwixt the <hi>Way</hi> of a <hi>Child</hi> and that of a grown <hi>Man,</hi> and take due Care not to make the <hi>Child</hi> a <hi>Man</hi> too ſoon.</p>
            <p>This may ſerve for Explication. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to ſome Conſiderations by way of Argument. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us conſider the abſolute neceſſity that every Man ſhould underſtand his <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and be exerciſed in it. This is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his living well, to his preſent and to his future Happineſs: Nor to his own only, but to other Mens alſo; as many as have relation to him, as are near him, are the better or worſe for his being good or bad.</p>
            <p>It's abſolutely neceſſary, that every Man ſhould know and do all that, which his great Creator deſign'd and made him for; elſe he is in vain, he will never attain his End. But that's not all, he will be miſerable, he will not only fall ſhort of God's End, but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. He will be ſo far from being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:96861:219"/>
and happy in himſelf, and from contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the Perfection and good State of others, that he will be in a moſt forlorn Condition himſelf, and will help to undo his Fellow Creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In an ordinary way, no Man comes to the Knowledg and Practice of what he ſhould do, unleſs he be firſt inſtructed and exerciſed in it.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, God has given to Man ſuch a Mind, that it can teach it ſelf in ſome Caſes; but yet it is ſo made, that it muſt be excited, and ſome way aſſiſted by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Inſpiration</hi> that gives Wiſdom, or ly the Communication of Knowledg from wiſe Men, or by both; which is indeed the uſual way the Divine Providence takes with us; he inſtructs us by one another. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to <hi>Ananias,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Where ever was the Man, that without exerciſing himſelf to Godlineſs, ſtarted up excellently good all on the ſudden? Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is no Muſhroom that grows up in a Night. It is not ſo natural, that it will come upon us, as our bodily Strength and Stature do, while we ſleep; but it's the Effect of Pains and Induſtry, of Care and Exerciſe.</p>
            <p>By doing, Men come to better Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of what they ought to do, and alſo acquire a greater Ability and Readineſs to do it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There's no better, no fitter time for Inſtruction and Exerciſe, than when we are young: then we are pliant and tender, as
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:96861:220"/>
ſoft Wax, which will eaſily receive an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Then we are not prepoſſeſs'd with Errors and inveterate Prejudices, we have no ill Cuſtoms to lay aſide.</p>
            <p>Beſides; there can be no ſuch fit time of learning how to live, as at the beginning of Life. It's a fooliſh and vain thing to put this off to the laſt, as many do, who, when they are near an end of their Life, then are enquiring how they ſhould live.</p>
            <p>And why will Men defer this till many Years of Life be ſpent? Why ſhould they be learning how to live, then when they ſhould be living? No, it behoves us to be inſtructed how to live, and to exerciſe our ſelves as we are taught, as ſoon as is poſſible: for otherwiſe our Life will paſs away unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, at beſt it will be to no purpoſe, if it be not to ill purpoſe and miſchievous.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, that it's indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably neceſſary for every one to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his way, and to walk in it; and that no Man ordinarily comes to underſtand what he ought to do, and to do it without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Exerciſe, and that the firſt Time, the young Age is beſt for theſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. I now proceed to plead with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and all that are appointed, and have taken on them the Inſtruction of <hi>Children,</hi> that they would not neglect this great Truſt. Nay, let me perſwade every one of you, who are come to underſtand this good way your ſelves, and to walk in it, that you would be aſſiſtant to Children. Inſtil good
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:96861:220"/>
Principles into their tender Minds, ſet good Examples before them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You that are Parents, conſider this is expreſly commanded in Scripture. Under the Moſaick Diſpenſation, <hi>Deut. 6. 6, 7. Theſe Words which I command thee ſhall be in thy Heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently to</hi> (ſhalt whet them upon) <hi>thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy Houſe, and when thau walkeſt by the way, when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was commanded the Jews by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and leſs is not required of us by Chriſt: Epheſ. &amp;. 4. <hi>Ye Fathers provoke not your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Wrath,</hi> (do not uſe the Power you have over them tyrannically, be not cruel, be not over ſevere) <hi>but bring them up in the Nature and Admonition of the Lord;</hi> In the Inſtruction and Diſcipline of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Beſides; the Wiſdom of God in <hi>Solomon</hi> has from the Obſervation he has made, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this Inſtruction and Diſcipline of Children to their Parents in many places; Prov. 29. 17. <hi>Correct thy Son, and he will give thee Reſ.</hi> Chap. 23. 13. <hi>Withhold not Correction from the Child; for if thou heateſt him with the Rod he ſhall not die.</hi> Chap. 19. 18. <hi>Chaſten thy Son while there is hope.</hi> Correction and Chaſtening is one way of Inſtruction; and that which to a tender Parent is moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and that is therefore ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, becauſe they would be moſt prone to neglect it. Thus we find its commanded in the Scriptures, but that's not all. For,</p>

2. In the ſame Holy Writings we find Obedience to it highly commended, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized as an Inſtance of great Goodneſs and true Religion: And it's repreſented as the way wherein a very great Bleſſing was conveyed: Gen. 18. 17, 18, 19. <hi>God ſaid, Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>the thing which I will do, ſeeing that</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhall become a great and mighty Nation, and all the Nations of the Earth ſhall bleſſed in him? for, I know him, that he will command his Children, and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment; that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>that which he has ſpoken of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beſeech you obſerve how great a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation God himſelf has given here of this, that <hi>Abraham</hi> would command <hi>his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Houſhold after him to keep the way of the Lord.</hi> How well, how kindly does God take this, that he was not only good and righteous himſelf, but would take care that his Servants, that his Children, and thoſe that were to live after him ſhould be ſo too?</p>
            <p>And how is the Righteous God pleaſed to reward this Practice? He would here upon diſcover to <hi>Abraham, the great thing he was about to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, farther; It ſeems to be brought in here as a Reaſon, why all the World ſhould be bleſſed in <hi>Abraham.</hi> And indeed it was the means whereby that Bleſſing was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the World, <hi>Abraham's</hi> inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Children after him, tho at ſo great a diſtance from our Saviour, yet had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence

               </gap> this was one of the Means that condu red to the making of <hi>Timothy</hi> a very good Man, and one whom God thought fit to uſe in the Government of his Church.</p>

It is a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Child it ſelf; it will be in all likehood very advantagious to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, his or her Family, the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in which they live, the Society, the Church or Kingdom, of which they are Members or Subjects: Much Good alſo may thereby redound to the Parent or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor, who took the eare of educating the Child.</p>
            <p>The Child it ſelf, by the Bleſſing of God upon this Method, and his Grace accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it, is made a good and vertuons Man or Woman; and by being thus early Inſtructed and exerciſed in his Duty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

his Life, and after Death, enters into the Happineſs and Joy of all good Men.</p>
            <p>Thus the firſt Inſtructions are the Seeds of Holineſs and immortal Bliſs; they are the firſt Beginnings of everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and of which when they come to be poſſeſs'd, they will look back on all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Cauſes that brought them thither, and will diſcover, that the Care of their Parents and Inſtructors to teach them the good Way, and to engage them to walk in it, was one of the firſt and chief.</p>
            <p>Every one that will conſider, may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>now,</hi> how much he owes of all the Happineſs he has and hopes for, to the early Inſtructions he had from his Parents: But then we ſhall ſee more clearly how all contributed to our Happineſs; we ſhall then evidently diſcover, that our Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had a mighty Influence on it. What-ever Benefits Wife or Husband, Children or Servants, Neighbours or Strangers, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations or Friends receive from any one's being good and vertuous, wiſe and holy, they are beholden for it in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the Care of Parents and Inſtructers, who ſaw to their firſt Education; for in their firſt Years was laid the Foundation of all that Vertue and Goodneſs, which is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards built upon it Then were ſown the Seeds, which in after-Years grow up to Maturity, and bring forth thoſe excellent Fruits. The Honeſty, the Truth, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the Charity, the Humility and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Sobriety and Temperance, the

Zeal, the Courage, the Fidelity, the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whatever 'tis that makes Men good and uſeful, received, if not its very firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, (for that I ſuppoſe to be in the very Nature of Man, which he had from God) yet very neceſſary Supplies for its Increaſe; this Education was, if not the Womb that bare, yet the Breaſts that gave it ſuck.</p>
            <p>And are not the Clemency, the wiſe and good Government of Princes, and the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Peaceableneſs of Subjects, much owing to the Care that was taken of them in their firſt Time?</p>
            <p>Thou that haſt the Education of a young Prince, one who ſhall rule over many, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thy Charge, be faithful to thy Truſt: for ſhow knoweſt thou, but thou mayeſt do that now in the diſcharge of thy Office, for which Thouſands will rejoice?

And if this by the Divine Providence come to paſs, what a Joy will this be to thee, to reap ſuch an unexpected Fruit of thy Care! That the little Seed which thou ſowedſt, is grown up to be a great Tree, and then thy ſelf mayeſt reſt thy ſelf under the ſhadow of it; for ſo many times it has been.

how great muſt that Joy be, which thou wilt have in ſeeing the Child grow up to Wiſdom and Vertue, to be a good and a great Man. And for this I deſire you to conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How many, who have been thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wiſely educated, have come to a moſt excellent State; and how naturally this early Inſtruction and Exerciſe tends to bring them to it; vvhat a powerful Efficacy it has on them to make them good?</p>
            <p n="2">2. How few that have wanted it, have ever come to any thing? or at leaſt, how ſhort have they fallen of vvhat others have been, and themſelves might have been?</p>

            <p n="1">1. Conſult your own Obſervation, and let your Experience ſhew you the Truth of this. Have you not known in your Time many who have been carefully educated, vvho have riſen from a mean low Condition to a moſt excellent Eſtate?

or Example: ſome little Grain of Muſtard-Seed was then ſown, which has grown up to be a Tree, and which not only themſelves and Family, but the whole Church or Kingdom ſit under its ſhadow with great delight, and reap the Fruit of it. View all the Steps by which theſe Perſons are moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuch an height above others, and you will find ſome of the lowermoſt were the Inſtructions of their tender Years. If you will diligently trace them back to their firſt ſetting out, you will obſerve that their Feet, when they were very little, went to the Houſe of Inſtruction. And on the other hand have you obſerved thoſe who have not been inſtructed and diſcipim'd in their firſt Age, to have become faiſiouſly good Men?</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will be here ſaid, That there are Inſtances of thoſe that were well edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, who proved very bad; and of thoſe of whom no care was taken to inſtruct them, who came to be excellent Perſons.</p>

               </hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> wherein young youths were trained up in ſuch ingenious Ways, as fitted them for the reception of Divine Revelations; And out of theſe Schools, for the moſt part, the Prophets are ſuppoſed to have been taken. Let me give one or two Inſtances out of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the rather becauſe 'tis ſaid, that
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:96861:227"/>
               <hi>they ſhall be all taught of God;</hi> which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is ſo miſtaken by ſome, as that they make it an Excuſe for their own Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
            <p>The great Apoſtle of us Gentiles was brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a learned <hi>Rabbi;</hi> and the Divine Providence, which had ſo furniſh'd him with Learning, after made excellent uſe of him in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Chriſt's Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> after him was promoted to an high Office in the Church: and he had been nouriſh'd up in the <hi>Words of Faith and good Doctrine, and from a Child had known the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Apoſtles of our Lord, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever defective their firſt Educationn might have been, yet they had this Want ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by three Years Converſation with our Lord; and after he left them, they were miraculouſly inſpired with the Spirit of Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, which is very conſiderable, the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf was ſubject to his Parents, and went with them to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at twelve Years old, where he was amongſt the Doctors, and asked them Queſtions: He's ſaid to <hi>grow in Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. and he grew by thoſe ways of Inſtruction, which were ordinary: His Parents directed, the Doctors informed him, by which he has honoured, and as it were conſecrated this Way, and has greatly commended it to us all. When the Son of God himſelf was train'd up in this way, whilſt he was
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:96861:227"/>
young, we ſhould all look on this Way, as the beſt Method we can take with our Children And,</p>
            <p>After this Example, I ſhall not need to mention any more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this is ſufficient to convince us of the Goodneſs of this Way, and that 'tis ordinarily neceſſary to fit Men for any high Place.</p>
            <p>But if we aim at no more for our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than ſo much Wiſdom and Goodneſs, as will qualify them to diſcharge themſelves faithfully and honeſtly in any ordinary way of Life; yet neither is this to be expected ordinarily, unleſs they be inſtructed, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, and exerciſed to it in their firſt Age.</p>
            <p>Of this we may be further ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fied, if we take notice how it is with us all in other Matters. Does any one come to great Skill in his Profeſſion and Trade, to which he has not been bound Apprentice in his younger Years? Or, if ſome few do, yet nevertheleſs the other is the common way of Men. And we look on the tender Age, as the proper Time of beginning to learn any thing; and that if we do not inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e our Children betimes, they will be in great danger of miſcarrying.</p>
            <p>And if it be ſo in all things elſe, why ſhould it not hold in the matter before us? is it becauſe Vertue is not difficult? or that Inſtitution and Exerciſe, the common way of attaining to other things, are not the means of acquiring this? Or, is it becauſe we think Children uncapable of ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? But none of theſe are true; and
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:96861:228"/>
therefore, if we do wiſely in binding thoſe that are young to Trades, putting them betimes into this or that Employment, which we would have them follow, and come to the Maſter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, we ſhall alſo do no leſs wiſely, to bind them out betimes Apprentices to Vertue and Goodneſs, which is the <hi>Way</hi> of them, and of all Men. And if we do not this, we do not act uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we contradict our ſelves, and do not that in one Caſe, which we approve in all other, tho there be no difference.</p>
            <p>I now ſpeak of Education in general, and that which I ſay is, Let your Children be taught ſomething or other, that they may be fitting themſelves againſt they be Men, to be employed in ſome way that will be beneficial to themſelves, and the Publick. That I might the more effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you to this, I have appealed to your own Obſervation, and to ancient Hiſtory, whether this be not the only likely way to make good and uſeful Men; I will now offer you Reaſon why it muſt be ſo.</p>
            <p>Young tender Minds are more apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Impreſſion, and to retain thoſe that are made them afterward; the Reaſon of which I take to be this, that they are more vacant to attend, they are not prepoſſefs'd with, nor ſo fixedly buſy about, nor intent on other things; thoſe Impreſſions that get firſt poſſeſſion, keep it, the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Mankind does atteſt this.
<q>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:96861:228"/>
                  <p>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens ſervabit odorem Teſta diu.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And it is ſemblably in other ſorts of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both Animals and Plants, they are all, we know, more teachable and more pliant at firſt than afterwards.</p>
            <p>This may convince us of the Neceſſity of teaching them betimes that which we would have them underſtand perfectly.</p>
            <p>Let me add this, That our Minds come to Knowledg gradually; that there is no one way of Life, but there are many things to be known before we comprehend it fully; that this requires Time and Trial, that therefore we ſhould begin early.</p>
            <p>But beſides Knowledg, Practice is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and to be doing, is the way to do well. Now to begin betimes to do what we would do perfectly, is very neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſhall be ſooner accuſtomed to it, and be kept from accuſtoming our ſelves to other things: For, 'tis obſervable, that ſewer Actions ſhall habituate a Child to any Practice, than a grown Man. It ſooner and eaſier becomes a Cuſtom, if it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in tender Years, than at full Growth; as you can eaſily with a hand bend a Plant, when a Tree will not yield to all your Might.</p>
            <p>But this is ſufficient to give you a view of the Reaſon why it is ſo, which your own Thoughts may eaſily trace further.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="450" facs="tcp:96861:229"/>
I will now diſmiſs this Argument, by which I hope, as many as will attend to what either themſelves obſerve, or is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Hiſtory, will be perſuaded to look well to the Education of their Children; becauſe according to all Obſervation, (and that not without good reaſon to ſecond it) this is the only ordinary way to make them good and uſeful. Would you have your Children come to good? would you have them uſeful in their place in ſome way or other? This is the only Method in which you can probably expect it; take care of them in their firſt Time; ſee to their Inſtruction and their Practice in their tender Years.</p>
            <p>If we had no ſuch Aſſurance of the Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of this our timely Care, to produce ſuch great Effects; yet the very Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that it is meerly poſſible for ſo much Good to come of it, ſhould methinks engage us to make the Experiment; and we can't doubt the Poſſibility, when we have Examples before our Eyes what has been done. And if this be ſo, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Parents, what kind of Men are thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are not moved with ſo fair a proſpect of ſo much Good, of ſo many and great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, as may come to their Child or Scholar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to themſelves, to their whole Family, the Town and Country where he was born, the Church and State of which he is a Member?</p>
            <p>Would ye not have your Children to be good and uſeful, to enjoy Wealth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour amongſt Men on Earth, and to find

To conclude this; We that are Parents and Inſtructors, have ſuch a fair proſpect of ſo much Good that may accrue to our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to our ſelves, to the Society of which they are Members, by their being wiſe and good, that if we be not by this moved to do all we can to make them ſuch, we are neither ſo good to them, nor wiſe for our ſelves, nor do we ſtudy and ſeek the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Benefit as we ought. If this Argument will not prevail, let me offer another.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The very great Danger your Children are in, of being fooliſh and vicious, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, or uſeleſs in this Life, and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the future.</p>
            <p>As I argued before, That all Men that are born into this World are in capacity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Good, and of being uſeful and excellent Perſons; of glorifying God, by attaining to that Perfection which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them, and by contributing towards the Welfare of their Fellow-Creatures; and of enjoying that ineffable and unconceivable Bliſs, which remains for the Obedient in the other World: (And the Conſideration of this ſhould move any one, that has the Faith of a Chriſtian, or but the Underſtanding and Heart of a Man, to give all the help and aſſiſtance he can to his Children, that they may be as good and happy as they are capable of being; that they may not fall ſhort of that moſt excellent Condition, which our great and good Creator intended us all: and conſequently, that they ſhould take great care of inſtructing and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plining
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:96861:230"/>
them in their firſt Years.)</p>
            <p>So I now engage you to uſe the ſame Care, from a Conſideration of the great Dangers in which every one is, that comes into the World.</p>
            <p>Man is in ſuch a Condition, that as he may be raiſed up to Heaven by Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and be exalted to ſuch a State, that he ſhall be but very little lower than the Angels of Glory; ſo by Folly and Vice, and Neglect of himſelf, he may ſink ſo much below his kind, that he may in nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the Brutes; nay, he may degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Devil, may hate God, and live in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>And if this be the Caſe of all our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as certainly it is, that they are in ſo very great danger of ſuch dreadful Evils; we ſhall be moſt inhumane and mercileſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to them, if we do not what in us lies to prevent their Ruin. We ſhall ſhew our ſelves ſtupid, if we do not, as ſoon as they are capable of Inſtruction, principle them againſt all Vice and Wickedneſs, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them what is good; engage their Wills to like and chuſe it, and put them on the doing it; and by all means to preſerve them from Sin, and ſecure them from the Snare of the Devil.</p>
            <p>It may be, ſome may not be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned whether their Children be good or great, they may have no deſire they ſhould be eminent: But can any of you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they ſhould become Beaſts? You do not aſpire at their doing much Good; but are you ſatisfied they ſhould do none, nay, that they ſhould do Evil? You care not they ſhould be famous for good and brave Actions; but are you willing they ſhould be infamous Villains, and live and die as <hi>Evil-doers?</hi> And tho you never once think that your Children ſhould be raiſed up to the pitch of Angels; yet ſurely none of us but ſhould be very fearful they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:96861:231"/>
Devils. None of us would be Parents of a Beaſt, or of a Devil: And yet our Children are in danger of being ſuch; and if we take no other care of them, but to bring them into the World, and to maintain the Animal Life, we put them into that Condition, that they muſt (without a very extraordinary Aſſiſtance of God's Grace) be ſuch. We have but by this brought them into Danger.</p>
            <p>This World is a vaſh and howling Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: And how mercileſs would that Father or Mother be, that ſhould bring a little Child, a young unexperienced Youth, amongſt the both wanton and ſalvage Beaſts, and leave him to ſhift for himſelf? Thus does every Father and Mother, that takes no care to inſtitute their Children in the <hi>Way of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore you be ſo low-ſpirited, as not to deſire your Children ſhould be in the beſt; yet ſure none can be willing they ſhould be in the worſt ſtate of which they are capable. If you would not have them holy and happy, as Saints and Angels; yet neither would you have them without Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtaning, <hi>as the Horſe and the Mule,</hi> nor without Goodneſs, as the <hi>Devil.</hi> You would neither have them wicked, nor miſerable; and if you would not, you muſt take care to inſtruct and exerciſe them betimes in the <hi>Way they ſhould go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour ſays of <hi>Judas</hi> that betray'd him, <hi>It were good for him if he had not been born;</hi> It was far more eligible for him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:96861:232"/>
to have been, than to have committed ſo great a Wickedneſs: And is not this the hapleſs State of many more? So that they who are, with and under God, the Authors, or rather Inſtruments of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> to any, do by this make them lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to great Miſery, as well as capable of great Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And indeed thoſe Parents, who have done no more for their Children, than to bring them into the World, and make proviſion for the Animal Life only, I queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this they have not done more to bring them into great Miſery, than they have contributed toward their Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This leads me to another forcible Motive to take care of their Education, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if we do not, we ſhall be acceſſory to all the Evil they both do and ſuffer. It will be Trouble enough to think, we have thoſe ſprung from us, who have been the Authors of great Miſchief to others, and fall into uttermoſt Ruine themſelves, tho our ſelves had no hand in it. That thoſe that came from, and are as it were parts of us, are moſt juſtly ſentenced to endleſs Torments; this thought is almoſt unſupportable to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: But what will it then be to make this bitter Reflection, All this Ill that my Child has done, and all the Miſery he endures, is the Effect of my Negligence; it's through my faulty Careleſneſs, that he was ſo ſinful, and is ſo wretched?</p>
            <p>If the Happineſs of Heaven admit of Allays, as it does of Degrees, the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:96861:232"/>
that I did not do my utmoſt to reſcue any of my Acquaintance and Friends from Sin, will give a great damp to the Joy of that State: But that I ſhould be ſo groſly negligent of mine own Child, as not to do all I could to prevent ſuch unſufferable Woes; this muſt pierce the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly</hi> then, Let all Parents conſider what account they will be able to give of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Judg, of the Neglect of their <hi>Children:</hi> When they ſee them doom'd to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Miſery for that Wickedneſs they fell into for want of <hi>timely Inſtruction:</hi> When God ſhall ſay, theſe my Creatures are loſt for ever through your Heedleſneſs and Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, becauſe you neglected the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities you had of principling and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to Vertue and Godlineſs, they fell into a vicious Courſe of Life, and muſt now eat the bitter Fruits of it eternally. What will you then anſwer to your Judges? And with what face will you look upon thoſe your neglected Children, when they ſhall ſay, O had you but call'd on us <hi>to remember our Creator in the Days of our Youth,</hi> we had then been kept from <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and now from unconceivable Miſery? Had you but watched us at firſt, and been careful to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to Goodneſs, we had lived good Lives on Earth, and now have been happy in Heaven? Conſider, I beſeech you, how you will be then affected, and let this make you wiſe to prevent that Aſtoniſhment and Confuſion of Face, which muſt neceſſarily accompany ſuch a Guilt as this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="458" facs="tcp:96861:233"/>
And that you may be able to know how you will be able to abide the Judgment of God, I would deſire every one of us to ſummon our own Souls before themſelves, and ſee what account they are able to give themſelves of this moſt grievous Omiſſion. What will the guilty Offender ſay to ſuch Queſtions as this, which his awakened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will put to him?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Why haſt thou been ſo unnatural, as not to deſire and endeavour thy Child's beſt State? Or, why haſt thou been ſo unwiſe, as to ſlip the fitteſt, if not only Seaſon thou canſt ever have, to do him the greateſt Good? How is it that thou didſt not go to the brute Creatures, and learn this of them, who as ſoon as ever their young Ones are capable, fail not to ſhew them how they muſt live?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again; How fooliſhly haſt thou act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and contradicted thy ſelf, in providing carefully a vaſt Eſtate for a Swine to wallow in? for thou haſt taken no care to fit him for it, to teach him to uſe it. And how careful haſt thou been of thy young Dogs, that they be made; and of thy Horſes, that that they be managed? But only thy Sons and thy Daughters are not regarded.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And then, was it not moſt fit and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, that thou who hadſt brought thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into Being, ſhouldſt take all poſſible Care that they may live well, and be happy?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="459" facs="tcp:96861:233"/>
4. Thou haſt done ſomething for them, then thou ſhouldeſt either have done more, or nothing. Better it were for them not to have been, than to be miſerable: They had better never have lived, than fall ſhort of the End of Life.</p>
            <p>What Anſwer canſt thou make to ſuch Queſtions as theſe, which thine own Mind will put, if thou giveſt it leave to think? Or, how art thou ſatisfied with thy ſelf, when ſuch Thoughts as theſe ariſe in thy Mind?</p>
            <p>And if thou canſt not ſtand before thine own Conſcience, how wilt thou appear before the Tribunal of the Great God?</p>
            <p>I conclude this Exhortation. What would you ſay of a Father and Mother, that ſhould expoſe a new-born Infant in a Wilderneſs full of Salvage Beaſts? Would you not call this moſt unnatural Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? It would be ſo. And it is not leſs, but more Inhumanity, to leave the Soul of thy Child untaught, undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd, to be a Prey to that roaring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In the one the bodily Life is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; in the other, the higher Life of the Soul, the Spiritual and Eternal, is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded. Thou who takeſt no care of thy Child's Education, expoſeſt him to Eternal Death and Miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:96861:234"/>
How mercileſs and unnatural would that Mother be thought, who ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her Breaſts to the <hi>hungry Child,</hi> who could ſee it ſtarve without giving it, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Food?</hi> She would deſerve to be branded for a Monſter. And what ſhall we think of thoſe that ſtarve the better and higher Life? That hear the Cries of the little Soul after Knowledg and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but turn a deaf Ear to them, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once take care to nouriſh them up to Eternal Life, but ſuffer them to faint, and die the worſt of Deaths, that of the Soul.</p>
            <p>And if Murderers of the lower Life ſhall be puniſh'd ſo ſeverely: if thoſe that, when they have wherewith to do it, deny to feed the hungry animal Life, ſhall not be able to ſtand in Judgment before God: how then ſhall the Murderers of Souls be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged? and where ſhall they appear, that have denied the Bread of Life to their own Children?</p>
            <p>It's an inhuman thing counted, not to ſhew the Way to an ignorant Traveller: but O how monſtrouſly unnatural is it, when the Soul of thine own Child is calling to thee by its Inclination, and its Neceſſities cry to thee, to ſhew it its <hi>Way of Life;</hi> when it ſtands gazing, and knows not which way to go, that thou ſhouldeſt not by thy Counſel and Example ſay to it, <hi>This is the Way, walk in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sum of theſe Arguments is, That if we will not tranſgreſs the expreſs Law of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:96861:234"/>
God; if we think our ſelves bound to follow the Examples of good Men; if we will obey God in an Inſtance where Obedience has procured moſt ſingular Bleſſing; if either the Senſe of what's juſt and fit, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Benefit and Advantage will prevail with us; if we either love God, or our ſelves, or our Children; if we either fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Inclinations of Nature, or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of Reaſon; if we will be concluded either by the common Senſe of Mankind, or the Divine Oracles; if we would ſecure our Souls from the Guilt of inhuman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Cruelty, and our Children from the greateſt Miſery, We muſt take care to <hi>train them up betimes in the Way in which they ſhould go.</hi>

            <p>Concerning which I ſhall endeavour to ſhew three things in general.</p>
            <p>Firſt; What that is which is here ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us by Hoſpitality.</p>
            <p>Secondly; How good and neceſſary it is. From whence it will appear that there is an Obligation on all Chriſtians, nay on all Men to practiſe it.</p>
            <p>And having done this, I ſhall proceed to ſhew that <hi>you</hi> eſpecially of all Men are moſt peculiarly and moſt ſtrictly bound to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitable.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall diſcourſe of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that will redound to thoſe that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and conſcionably practiſe this Duty; likewiſe I will mention ſome of thoſe
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:96861:237"/>
Practices which are notorious Violations of the Laws of Hoſpitality. And ſhall alſo offer ſome Directions, which may help to the better Performance of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In general; To have ſuch Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch inward Diſpoſitions toward <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> as are fit for us to have, is to be <hi>hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:</hi> and to carry and demean our ſelves toward them in a becoming manner, is to exerciſe Hoſpitality.</p>
            <p>This is all that's imported by the word <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> which is originally Latin; or by the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which denotes that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affection, or outward Deportment that ſhould be towards Strangers.</p>
            <p>And if the generality of Mankind were asked what that is, they would anſwer, that it is to be juſt and honeſt, faithful and true in our Dealings with them. 'Tis to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, courteous, humane, loving, kind in our Diſpoſition and Carriage. 'Tis to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd and ready to do all Good Offices for them, that are in our Power, which their Condition calls for, and which they either do, or; if they underſtood, would deſire: That is, to inform them when they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, to rectify their Miſtake, to aſſiſt them in the Government of their Paſſions about thoſe matters with which they are unacquainted. To withhold them what in us lies, from doing any fooliſh evil Actions, to which their Unexperience might betray them. To ſupply them with thoſe things, of which, by reaſon of their Abſence
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:96861:237"/>
from their Acquaintance, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, It is to bail and ſcreen them from that Evil, and thoſe Miſchiefs, and Dangers to which, by being Strangers, they are expoſed: to ſecure them from all that Harm, to which their Condition makes them liable; and to do all that Good to, and confer thoſe Benefits on them, which, if they were where they are known, they might expect and would have.</p>
            <p>It is to be their Friends, to do them any good Office that they want and we can do; civilly to converſe with them, to adviſe and counſel, to relieve with Money or any other way, to entertain them at our Tables, to lodg them; and to do this with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Mind and a chearful Countenance, which is more than a Circumſtance in this matter; for this hoſpitable Look (if I may ſo call it) is no ſmall part of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior, that's intended in <hi>Hoſpitality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho in our modern uſe of it, the Word imports no more than an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Perſon with whom I have no great Acquaintance at my Table, and lodging him; yet anciently it ſignified all ſorts of Civility and Kindneſs, which is ſhewn to Stangers.</p>
            <p>So that this is the Sum of vvhat I mean by <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> to be <hi>kind and friendly to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> I proceed,</p>
            <p>Secondly; To make it appear that this is very good: That is,</p>
            <list>

               <hi>1ſt,</hi> It's a piece of that <hi>good Nature,</hi> which ſo well becomes Man, that it is called <hi>Humanity:</hi> and therefore the Ancients call our Kindneſs to Strangers by this Name, <hi>Humanity;</hi> and the defect of this is ever cenſured by them with this Expreſſion of <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>Inhumane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we have further Reaſon to think this good Nature, if we conſider the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and good Principles of our Actions, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are naturally compaſſionate and inclined to relieve thoſe that are in want; that we are pleaſed to ſee others in good State; that we think we ought to <hi>do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as we would have them do to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like are the Principles of our Actions, and they are acknowledged by moſt to be both natural and good. Now, if we will follow theſe, we muſt be good and kind to Strangers; for, we ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they are abſent from their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Friends, and that they want their Help; we ſhall, out of the Pleaſure we have to ſee Men in a good Condition, do what in us lies, to bring them into it; we ſhall think, if our ſelves were in the ſame caſe they are, what we ſhould deſire of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and we ſhould do to them, as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they ſhould to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The holy Scriptures give us full proof of this, and they being an expreſs Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:96861:238"/>
of God's Will, do not only declare, but make a thing fit.</p>
            <p>Now in the Bible how expreſly is <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> injoyned? How often inculcated? How much commended? And how ſeverely is the very neglect of it cenſured and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed?</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ancient People of God, the Jews, are in moſt plain Words commanded to uſe Strangers well; not to oppreſs, no nor to vex them, but to love them as themſelves: Exod. 22. 21. <hi>Thou ſhalt neither vex a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor oppreſs him; for ye were Strangers in the Land of</hi> Egypt. Exod. 23. 9. Levit. 19. 34. <hi>And thou ſhalt love the Stranger as thy ſelf; for ye were Strangers in the Land of</hi> Egypt. And many other places. And theſe Commands are back'd with a moſt forcible moving Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that themſelves <hi>were Strangers in the Land of</hi> Egypt; and they knew the <hi>Hearts of Strangers:</hi> they are put in Mind of the Condition they were once in, and what Uſage they then wiſhed for from the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> And this reaſoning ſuppoſes they would now deal with others, as themſelves once wiſhed they might be dealt with.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Chriſtian Law defective in this: For, as we are here in the Text exhorted to <hi>follow earneſtly after Hoſpitality;</hi> ſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 2. we are caution'd <hi>not to forget it;</hi> which ſuppoſes that Chriſtians are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, both by Nature and the former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, taught to do thus.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:96861:239"/>
2. This is highly commended to us from the greateſt Examples. It is recorded to have been the Practice of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>Lot,</hi> Men beloved of God, and famous with us; they were not only honoured whilſt they lived, but they are renowned amongſt all Poſterities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 1, 2, 3, to the 11th: In this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is obſervable what <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and with what Heartineſs, and Alacrity, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence he entertained them; how free he was in it: he asked them not, but they him, this was a Carriage that became the hearty Goodneſs of thoſe old Times, and 'twas a Work worthy of, and ſuitable to the great Faith of that excellent Man.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the 19th Chapter we have <hi>Lot's</hi> Hoſpitality recorded, when he ſaw two <hi>Strangers he went to meet them, bowed himſelf with his Face toward the Ground;</hi> addreſs'd to them with all obliging Civility. He would not be denied, but when they ſaid, they would tarry in the Streets all Night, he importuned them to come in; and when they were come in, he entertain'd them bountifully; <hi>he made them a Feaſt,</hi> ſaith the Text.</p>
            <p>Nay, in the 10th of <hi>Deut. 28, 29. God</hi> himſelf is ſaid to <hi>love the Stranger,</hi> and <hi>give him Food and Raiment.</hi> But we have far greater proofs of God's Love to Strangers than theſe: For <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> Gentiles, that were <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Foreigners,</hi> hath he <hi>viſited with his Salvation;</hi> to us he hath given his Son, and hath treated us with all imaginable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:96861:239"/>
of Kindneſs and Love, nay beyond all Imagination.</p>
            <p>Now, if this be the Practice of the beſt Men that ever lived, nay, of God himſelf; if this be one of his Titles, that he <hi>loves the Stranger,</hi> as it was of the Heathen <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> who was called <hi>Jupiter Hoſpitalie,</hi> the Hoſpitable God, the God of Strangers: then ſurely we muſt conclude Hoſpitality to be a fit and becoming thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scriptures ſhew this Practice not only to be good and fit, but neceſſary and indiſpenſable; which will appear from the ſad Doom that ſhall paſs upon them who but neglect this. See <hi>Mat. 25. 43. I was a Stranger, and ye took me not in.</hi> This was part of their Charge, who are ſentenc'd to everlaſting Flames; that he, that is, the leaſt of our Lord's Diſciples, was not taken in when a Stranger.</p>
            <p>He doth not ſay, ye ſcorn'd, ye revil'd, ye perſecuted me <hi>when I was a Stranger;</hi> but <hi>ye took me not in.</hi> Nor is their Fault, that they did not entertain the Chriſtians they knew, and were acquainted with; but that they did not receive into their Houſes thoſe whom they <hi>knew not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This certainly is a great and neceſſary Duty, which the Judg of all the World thinks fit to mention, where he hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Proceſs that ſhall be at the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he hath not inſtanced in many others that we eſteem (but ſeveral are not) grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="472" facs="tcp:96861:240"/>
Thirdly; To the Scriptures, I might add by way of Accumulation, the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony the Heathens have given to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitable Temper and Practice, and this both by their Sayings and their Examples: Which muſt have the force of a convincing Argument; for it is ſo manifeſtly good and becoming, that by the dim Light of Nature they could diſcover it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Homer</hi> in the third Book of his <hi>Odyſſes,</hi> brings in <hi>Neſtor</hi> importuning <hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Telemachus,</hi> to ſtay with him. He tells them, they leave him as if he had no Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them; or that he could not lodg them: but this he would never ſuffer as long as he liv'd, or kept a Servant, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whoſoever ſhould come to his Houſe.</p>
            <p>This ſhews what Hoſpitality they uſed, and what they thought of it in thoſe old Times.</p>
            <p>Again, The <hi>Thynians</hi> and other Nations, which were look'd on as barbarous, yet were famous for their kind Uſage of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, as is obſerved by Hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cretians</hi> amongſt others, are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Athenaeus</hi> to have two Tables, which were called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> for Strangers.</p>
            <p>This was of great account amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> who thought it a moſt inhumane thing, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbis prohibere Peregrinos,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>And indeed nothing was more deteſtable amongſt all the Heathens, than not to be civil to Strangers. <hi>Inhoſpitalittora, Populus</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, were Appellations of the worſt ſound in their Ears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="473" facs="tcp:96861:240"/>
But I muſt not now give any account of the manner how this was practis'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to how great a Friendſhip this Kindneſs to Strangers grew, how ſacred a thing it was; and how the Hoſt and Gueſt received Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, little Monuments of that Friendſhip they had contracted, which were delivered from Father to Son. And if ever this Friendſhip were violated, they invoked their <hi>Jupiter Latialis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had ſuch a regard to thoſe Gueſts that were Friends, that as <hi>A. Gel. lib. 5. cap.</hi> 13. in his Deſcription of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Offices, ſaith; after Parents, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, and Clients, they were to have the next place, and to be ſet before Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, whether <hi>Conſanguinei,</hi> or <hi>Affines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Jus Hoſpitii</hi> was by all look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a moſt ſacred thing. <hi>Tull. 3. Offic. Cum Tyane Patrenſi eſt mihi quidem Hoſpitium vetus, quam ego neceſſitudinem ſanctè colendam puto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſufficient to ſhew that Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is a fit and becoming Practice.</p>
            <p>Secondly; I now ſhall ſhew that this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is very beneficial, and indeed ſo is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that, is fit and becoming.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's beneficial to the kind Hoſt: See the Recompence <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> had: the one had a Child given him in his old Age, the other was reſcued out of the Flames of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Theſe Bleſſings were beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, upon their kind Entertainment of Strangers. Some, ſaith the Scripture,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:96861:241"/>
in ſo doing have <hi>entertained Angels unawares;</hi> and I doubt not, but great Bleſſings have been left behind Gueſts, that were not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>Acts,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>Publius</hi> is ſaid to have entertained <hi>Paul three days courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and this kind Gueſt in requital heal'd his Father-in-Law of a Fever.</p>
            <p>But beſides all this; He that is a kind <hi>Host,</hi> does that which moſt directly tends to his own Perfection: For, whoſoever goes in the ways of Love and Kindneſs, is in the Road to Happineſs. He, by doing that which is agreeable to Humane Nature, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſes and delights himſelf: Beſides, he takes the beſt courſe that can be, to make a ſure Friend: The Kindneſſes ſhew'd to Strangers will never be forgotten by them. Now I ſuppoſe we all know, that a <hi>Friend</hi> is the greateſt Treaſure on Earth; next to the Goods within, there's nothing in the World comparable to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I need not diſcourſe how profitable this is to the Gueſt or Foreigner; for 'tis plain that he is reliev'd, he's ſerv'd, he's gratified, he's pleas'd.</p>
            <p>And beſides this Service done to private Intereſts, the Welfare of the Publick is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways promoted: for good <hi>Hoſpitality</hi> encourages Men to go abroad, this increaſes Commerce, and gives an Opportunity of making the Good of one Nation common to others. What an Advantage was the Diſperſion of Chriſtians to the whole
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:96861:241"/>
World? And what a publick Benefit would it be, if the Men of all Countries were by kind and friendly Treatment invited into all Countries? How ſhould we grow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and learn to bear with, if not to like one anothers Manners: And this would increaſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irſt into Private, and then Publick Friendſhips.</p>
            <p>Enough I think is ſaid to ſhew, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitality is exceeding good. And from what hath been ſaid, appears the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, under which all Men are, to be kind to Strangers. I do not ſay they are all bound to relieve them with Money; for many are poor and have it not: but I ſay all ought to be kind, and expreſs their Kindneſs in the ways they can, that is, as far as they are able, and as is conſiſtent with other greater Duties.</p>
            <p>All can be hoſpitable, tho they cannot exerciſe Hoſpitality; they can do ſomething of it, tho not the whole. The pooreſt Man can have kind Thoughts, and a benign Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition toward a Stranger; he can look chearfully on him, he can ſpeak and carry civilly towards him: He can perhaps ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w the way to a wandring Traveller. The things which he can do, every one ſhould do in this matter: and all will do it, that have any regard to the Law writ in our Hearts, or to the Holy Scripture, to what was commanded the Jews by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd all Men by Chriſt Jeſus: If they will follow the Examples of good and holy Men, or be Imitators of God himſelf; If
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:96861:242"/>
they will not be worſe than Heathens: If they will receive good to themſelves, or be Benefactors to others, and good to the World: If they will eſcape the ſad Doom to everlaſting Miſery, and be admitted to endleſs Joys, let them <hi>follow after Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and be kind and good to <hi>Strangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have hitherto diſcourſed of <hi>Hoſpitality</hi> in general, and the Obligation under which all Men are to uſe it. I now apply my ſelf to <hi>you,</hi> Gentlemen, who are of this (in my account) Honourable Company, which was not made a Corporation till the 6th of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8th, as the Hiſtorian ſaith. It is to me a wonder, that it ſhould have no ancienter Date, unleſs it were becauſe the Neceſſities of Men of this Profeſſion were not ſo many, nor frequent, and ſo did not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Proviſion againſt them, as in ſome others they did.</p>
            <p>Or elſe it might be becauſe your own benign and friendly Diſpoſition did as cloſely and firmly unite you, as any Charter or Patent could do.</p>
            <p>Be the cauſe what it will, it matters not. <hi>To you</hi> that either are of this Employment, or at leaſt think it honourable to bear the Name, and go under the Character of <hi>Innholders,</hi> I now addreſs my ſelf, and ſpeak to you all under that Notion.</p>
            <p>I have exhorted all Men to be hoſpitable, I now call upon you more particularly, to uſe <hi>Strangers</hi> well. I do not, becauſe I hope I need not, beſpeak you to be juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. I hope there is not one amongſt you,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:96861:242"/>
that would injure, that would rob your Gueſts, that would not be true to the Truſts they repoſe in you, that would take from them more than by the Law of Nations and Nature, as well as the Cuſtom of this Land, you may challenge as your own.</p>
            <p>But not doubting of your Juſtice and Honeſty, I beſpeak your Kindneſs and Friendſhip to your Gueſts. Do not only no ill Offices, but alſo do all good ones; be <hi>kindly affectionated to them</hi> that come into your Houſes; expreſs this good Affection in a benign pleaſing Aſpect, and courteous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Language, and all manner of good Deeds you can do.</p>
            <p>If you ſee your Gueſt ignorant of the Cuſtom of the Place, inform him. If you ſee him viciouſly inclined, tho it be in a Caſe where you might be inriched by his Folly, that is, by Intemperance or the like, yet reſtrain him, be ſo bold as to deny what he calls for, when you ſee him exceed the Bounds of ſober Chearfulneſs. Perhaps he may thank you for putting this Reſtraint on him another time; or if he do not, you act like a true Chriſtian <hi>Gaius,</hi> like an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and vertuous Hoſt and Friend.</p>
            <p>And as you will do well to reſtrain ſuch Exceſſes, and to withhold the Fuel of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance; ſo you muſt take care that your Gueſts be ſupplied with all that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wants, and well regulated Deſires call for. See that your Proviſions be good, that your Meat and Drink be wholſom and well ordered, that your Lodgings be eaſy and
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:96861:243"/>
accommodate for the Travellers Quiet and ſafe Repoſe; and that your Houſe may be a Shelter, a Harbour, a Sanctuary, a Home to your Gueſt.</p>
            <p>Let your Servants alſo bo diligent and faithful in their Miniſtrie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Let your Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo extend to the Servants of your Gueſts, if they be attended.</p>
            <p>Nay, let it come out of the Chamber, and viſit the Stable, that the poor weary Horſe be not neglected. And when you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Recompence, which the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows for all this Care, do not take the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage you have of hoiſting up the Prices of things to the utmoſt; but according to a moderate Eſtimate of matters deal with him; and give him occaſion to ſay, that you have not only been juſt, but fair; that you have uſed him kindly as well as honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that you have not been an Hoſt, but a Friend.</p>
            <p>Uſe your Gueſt ſo, that he may not miſs his other Acquaintance and Friends; nor have occaſion to complain that he is from home.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhould demand of me for what reaſon he ſhould do this? I think I might give him full Satisfaction. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would tell him that this will be the beſt and ſureſt way to bring Gueſts to his Houſe, and thereby promote his Secular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, Men will themſelves go and invite their Friends to the Houſe where they have been well uſed. But this is a ſmall matter; For,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="479" facs="tcp:96861:243"/>
2. This is a neceſſary Exerciſe of that univerſal Love and Benevolence, which is found in every good Man: Where-ever Love is, it will be working, as it has oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. And I am ſure thoſe of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion have great and frequent Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of expreſſing their Humanity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>This then is my Plea; You have a fair Opportunity of doing much Good, neglect it not. Above all, I beſeech you take heed leſt you turn that into an occaſion of Evil and Miſchief, which was intended for Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and good Offices.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your very Calling, and the Nature of your Employment requires you to be good to Strangers, ſo that if you be not kind, you are not honeſt, you are not what you profeſs to be.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Out of an Inclination to this way of Life, 'tis to be ſuppoſed you have taken it up: or at leaſt you have been bred to it, and profeſs it; and will you not do what you ſeem and pretend, and bear the World in hand you do? this cannot confiſt with Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>You</hi> are they who are truſted by the Government to entertain: Strangers, and how can you break this Truſt? This is a Truſt publickly committed to you, which therefore you muſt by no means break.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, who were ſo famous for Hoſpitality, choſe ſome excellent Perſons to take care of Strangers. You are thoſe choice Perſons, upon whom,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:96861:244"/>
by our Conſtitution this great Care is left. You are by Publick Authority ſet in this Station; ſee therefore that you maintain it, that you diſcharge ſo publick a Truſt.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Strangers themſelves put a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in you, they expect you ſhould have a care of them, they look for not only juſt, but fair Dealing; they hope to be treated friendly and civilly, as well as honeſtly. And if you do not thus, you diſappoint and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and ſo cannot be honeſt.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) You are publickly allowed ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for this. And ſince the Law doth not forbid, and your Gueſts are content to make fair Allowance for what you do in this kind, it is great Injuſtice not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let me deſire you to conſider what place you fill up in the World. Now I look on your Employment thus to have begun.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Ages of the World, when Men were fewer and better than now they are: I ſuppoſe the beſt and richeſt to have entertained Strangers freely, and that they received no Requital, but only ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Gratitude.</p>
            <p>Afterward, when the World was more peopled, as in the days of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as I know not but this was become a Trade by that time; ſo I am ſure that thoſe that were both good and rich, would ſtill continue the ancient free Hoſpitality; they would not be deprived of the Pleaſure, and other Advantages they had by Converſe with Strangers.</p>
            <p>

In theſe latter days, when Men are more numerous, and travel more frequently, and do not carry their Houſes with them, as they did at firſt: and when Money, that common Meaſure of the worth of all things, is ſo eaſily carried; and for theſe and ſome ſuch Reaſons, it is thought beſt by all, there ſhould be ſuch Houſes as yours of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reception; So that now the Care of Strangers by the confent of Mankind, is even wholly devolv'd upon you; others, in a manner diſcharging themſelves of it (tho' all ought not) for, ſome in theſe days are as Rich, as they were in old times, and if they were but as kind too, they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſtrangers ſtill: But however, they all caſting this on you, this Conſideration muſt carry great force in it to engage you to Hoſpitableneſs.</p>
            <p>As the Hoſpitals are Places appointed for the Sick, and the Lame, and the Poor; ſo your Houſes are Hoſpitals for the Stranger, the Traveller to come into; yours are <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>You ſeem to be riſen up in the Room, and to fill the places of thoſe antient Hoſts, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and ſuch other great and good Men, whoſe Houſes were open to all Strangers: Be you therefore Imitators of them. I do not mean that you ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain all on free-coſt, as they did: that your Conditions will not ſuffer; nor would this (according to the beſt eſtimate of things I can make, be for the good of the World: that is, it would be no way to maintain

that <hi>Equality,</hi> by which <hi>Societies</hi> ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>But this is that I would perſwade you to, to be as kind to Strangers as they were, to do them all the good and friendly Offices within your Power, that any of them did. Let your Hearts be as large, tho' your hands cannot be ſo open; and by this means you will be the <hi>Children of Abraham,</hi> if you thus <hi>walk in the Steps of the Faith of Abraham.</hi>

            <p>Now that the Love more than the Wealth of Men is decreaſed, and we are grown more ſelfiſh and contracted in our Spirits; now that there's leſs Generoſity in the World than there was, let me call upon you to emulate the Goodneſs of old Times, and to retrieve that ancient Hoſpitality which is almoſt loſt. Be ſo kind and good to your Gueſts, that they may have no occaſion to complain of theſe Days, that they are ill for Strangers, nor wiſh they had lived in thoſe former Times.</p>

            <p>Whether all this be true, I know not, but I deſire you to conſider, that none may on ſuch accounts as theſe blame us, nor deſire to travel beyond Sea, rather than in their own Country. Let Strangers have no juſt occaſion to complain for ſuch things as theſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I do the more earneſtly preſs all this on You, becauſe You have fair Opportunities, that invite and aſſiſt You in being hoſpitable.</p>
            <p>Some Men, who have mind enough to converſe with, and be kind to Strangers, cannot, if they ſhould go out to ſeek for them, find them.

            <head>OF DOING GOOD UNTO ALL MEN.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>GAL. 6. 10.</bibl>
               <q>As we have therefore Opportunity, let us do Good unto all Men.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is generally confeſſed that all Men in the World have ſomething to <hi>do,</hi> a Buſineſs wherein they are to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; and that none ought to live Idlely. Whoſoever would do nothing, he affects the greateſt violence to Nature that can be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="486" facs="tcp:96861:247"/>
It is alſo agreed that Men ought to <hi>do good,</hi> for it is more eligible to do nothing than to do Evil. But what that is, which in general we call <hi>Good,</hi> to whom and at what time we ought to do it, this is not ſo well underſtood ordinarily.</p>
            <p>A great Part of every Man's Buſineſs in the World is with and about Men: And therefore moſt of the Duties, which God hath enjoyned him, relate to them: And his Happineſs no leſs depends on his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of theſe Duties than any others. For, Juſtice and Charity, Faithfulneſs and Gratitude are as neceſſary Conditions of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life as the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>In the Text we are inſtructed what our Carriage ſhould be to <hi>all Men,</hi> and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it. And our Inſtruction is delivered us ſo ſhort, and yet ſo full and plain; and the Exhortation is founded on ſo clear and ſtrong Reaſon, that if we will conſider, we cannot but underſtand our Duty, and if we do, we ſhall certainly reſolve, that it's good and neceſſary to practiſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore.</hi> This Particle ſhewsthe Text to be an Inference or Concluſion drawn from what was ſaid before. The Coherence of Scripture is very dark in the Epiſtles. It is uſual in the ſtile of this facred Book to fall from one thing to another immediately, and as it were accidentally, and without conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of a long Diſcourſe: But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which this Concluſion has to the Context ſeems to be this; The Apoſtle in the beginning of the Chapter had perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:96861:247"/>
the <hi>Galatians</hi> to a gentle tender Carriage towards their faulty <hi>Brethren,</hi> and to <hi>bear one anothers Burdens:</hi> Alſo to a grateful and liberal Retribution to their Spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors. To enforce theſe Particulars, he uſes an Argument, which perſwades to all ſorts of good Actions; <hi>Whatſoever,</hi> ſays he, a <hi>Man ſoweth, that ſhall be alſo reap;</hi> i. e. according as a Man acts, it ſhall be with him; as his carriage is now, his condition ſhall be hereafter, But that they might not loſe their reward, by giving over well-doing, he exhorts them to Conſtancy. And that they might not think it long before it come, He tells them, they ſhall <hi>receive</hi> what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) in <hi>Gods time,</hi> that which Divine Wiſdom has ſet, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certain and the beſt time.</p>
            <p>After theſe Arguments he concludes with the Text. <hi>As we have therefore Opportunity, let us do good unto all Men, eſpecially unto them who are of the Houſhold of Faith;</hi> i. e. Since Men ſhall be rewarded according to their Works, and they that continue to <hi>do well</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) that which is Honourable and Worthy, Handſome and Becoming, ſhall not fail of a great Recompence from God, let us <hi>do</hi> that which is <hi>good</hi> and beneficial to Men, <hi>to all Men,</hi> and eſpecially to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> as <hi>Opportunity</hi> ſerves. I will briefly gloſs on the Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore;</hi> That which follows is by its own Light known to be good, it's a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which evinces it's own truth and goodneſs. However, the Apoſtle takes in
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:96861:248"/>
Arguments from without to enforce it. It's good to take all ways to perſwade and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Men to Vertue, to uſe all Arguments to convince and move them.</p>
            <p>Exhortations to Vertue are as rational and accountable as any other thing. They are Concluſions drawn from as clear and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Principles as any. For, let it be laid down, as it cannot be denied or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Man is of ſuch a Nature, and ſet in ſuch Circumſtances to God, and to other Men; And all the Vertues that were ever commended by the Heathens, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Religion of Chriſt, will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily reſult.</p>
            <p>Man never acts with ſo much Reaſon, can never give ſo good an account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as when he is in the practice of Vertue in general, particularly <hi>Doing good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us.</hi> Theſe words ever imply that ſomething may and ought to be done, no Exhortation, but ſuppoſes that: Wiſdom never requires what is in it ſelf Impoſſible, nor exhorts them who are utterly Impotent and can do nothing.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Let us.</hi> The Apoſtle is not of their Number, <hi>who bind heavy Burdens to lay on other Mens Shoulders, but themſelves will not touch them with one of their Fingers.</hi> He requires nothing of others which he does not himſelf. He does that which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns them, and ſo engages them by his Example as well as his Counſel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As we have opportunity.</hi> Time and Seaſon are carefully to be obſerved. Time is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:96861:248"/>
neceſſary to every Action, and Seaſon is neceſſary to the well doing of it. It is as the Wind and Tide, that makes the Work eaſier and quicker when it is with us: We can do more and with leſs Pains, when we ſtrike in with <hi>Opportunity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may be ſaid to have on <hi>Opportunity</hi> in general, whenever we can do any thing; more particularly and properly, when we are aſſiſted by ſuch an happy concurrence of all other External Cauſes and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, on which our Action depends, as we can do it <hi>beſt;</hi> i. e. <hi>1ſt,</hi> When that Action is moſt convenient and ſuitable to us in that Condition. <hi>2dly,</hi> When it will be done with leaſt pains and difficulty. And, <hi>3dly,</hi> with moſt certainty, wen our Endeavours will be moſt effectual.</p>
            <p>A Time, when any Action is the beſt, or as good as any that can be done, is the ſeaſon of that Action; that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Opportunity ſimply ſo called. And when that action is not only the beſt that can be done, but can alſo be <hi>beſt</hi> done at that time, this is not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a good Opportunity. The former we find, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 15. the latter, in St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 16.</p>
            <p>All our Actions depend, <hi>1ſt,</hi> on our own Power, the inward Principle from whence they proceed; <hi>2dly,</hi> on the Concurrence of Divers External Cauſes, which make us act with more eaſe, and in leſs time, and more ſurely to effect what we endeavour. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this, we may be ſaid to have an <hi>Opportunity</hi> of doing good to Men, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:96861:249"/>
we can do it, and when we have ſo much aſſiſtance from External Cauſes, as that we can <hi>beſt,</hi> i. e. with moſt eaſe, and quickneſs and certainly do what we intend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As, i. e.</hi> When and whilſt, as ſoon and as oft as <hi>we have Opportunity.</hi> Do not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run, do not ſtay behind, but accompany the Seaſon, take the Tide, ſet up your Sails when the Wind is with you, loſe no time, ſlip no opportunity; and whilſt that laſts let us continue, up and be doing with the firſt Light, and hold on till the <hi>Night come when no Man can Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us do.</hi> Let us not only think of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, and talk, but do: (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) Let it be our Work, our Buſineſs, our Trade, that in which we employ our ſelves; the word implies Care and Diligence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Pains in acting: The thing to be done <hi>(Good)</hi> requires more Power to effect it than Evil does: Very impotent things can do great Miſchiefs, but they muſt be Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that do any great Good.</p>
            <p>Beſides; We had need thus to work in this Buſineſs of doing Good, becauſe we ſhall find Difficulty, and meet with Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in it. Our corrupted Natures are very backward to it, it is contrary to the Practice of this degenerate World. Let us uſe our Endeavour to do what we can. And let none reflect on the Wiſdom of that Divine Spirit, by which St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ: nor ſo deny their own Senſe, as to ſay they can do nothing, this is but a Plea for Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Unwillingneſs to <hi>do good,</hi> by the
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:96861:249"/>
ſame reaſon they may alſo ſay, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk, nor ſpeak: For, all our Power, both for the one and the other, is from God originally. But what is that which we are to do?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us do Good, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) i. e.</hi> that which is profitable, behooveful, beneficial, and advantagious: By this Word we are here and every where (when it is uſed of Creatures) to underſtand that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to the Preſervation and Perfection of their Beings and Powers.</p>
            <p>When we call any thing <hi>good,</hi> we refer it always to ſomething or other. Here it is applied to <hi>Men,</hi> and we underſtand by it particularly Wiſdom and Vertue, inward Quiet and Pleaſure, Life and Health, and all thoſe Circumſtances, which contribute towards the getting and ſecuring of theſe Perfections. Briefly, that which has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to Man's attaining his End, his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Happineſs, that we call <hi>Good.</hi> To <hi>do Good</hi> to Men, is to do thoſe Actions, which tend to make them as perfect as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for them and to bring them into the happieſt Circumſtances they can be in.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto all Men,</hi> i. e. not to our ſelves only, but to them that partake of our Nature, (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. This doubtleſs means Men.

that it reaches the loweſt parts of the Creations of God, of which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Philo)</hi> the High-Prieſt's Veſtment was an Emblem.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>our Goodneſs</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks) extends not unto God, and very little to Angels, farther than it excites and occaſions their greater Joy: But it may to the Saints that are on Earth, and to all our Brethren, the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and to the Cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tures of a lower kind, which God has made to ſerve us.</p>
            <p>But our Apoſtle here means <hi>Men,</hi> all that have rational Souls, and Bodies of the ſame Make with our ſelves, and capable of as great Happineſs or Miſery. He requires us to do Good to all theſe, to exclude none, whether they be Acquaintance or Strangers, our Countrey-men or Foreigners, Friends or Enemies; all, tho of contrary Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or of bad Practices; all and every one. We are to aim at the Happineſs of every Man, to endeavour the Perfection and good State of <hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An unlimited Love, an unconſined Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is here required; and a ſelfiſh, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Affection are here excluded; where-ever Man is, Love is to be. But is there no difference to be made? Yes, in caſe of a Competition of oppoſite Intereſts, ſome are to be preferred above and before others: So the Apoſtle directs in the following Words;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſpecially to them who are of the Houſhold of Faith,</hi> i. e. who are of the Houſhold or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:96861:250"/>
of God by Faith, (as <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds it) <hi>i. e.</hi> the Children and Servants of God, which they are in an eſpecial manner, who believe and obey the Goſpel, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Followers of Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe Life was in nothing more remarkable, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo imitable by us, as in Benignity, and Kindneſs, and univerſal Charity. They who by Faith obey him, are of the Family of God, God takes eſpecial care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for them; he takes them, as it were, under his Roof and Harbour: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and practiſe the beſt Religion in the World: And altho they may be ignorant of, or miſtaken in ſome Matters; yet they believe and underſtand ſo much as makes them <hi>deny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, and worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World;</hi> to love other Men ſo, as they <hi>do to them, as themſelves would be dont <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o by them;</hi> and to love and truſt in their God, who made, and redeem'd, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and will eternally ſave them.</p>
            <p>Let them be of the Eaſtern or Weſtern Church, let them dwell in the North or South, let their Differences be what they will, if they be as I have deſcribed, they are the chief Objects of our Care and Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llence. We are to do good to them chiefly, tho not only.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly gloſs'd on all the Words, I ſhall treat chiefly of that Clauſe, <hi>Let us do Good into All,</hi> i. e. to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Mankind, and to all Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="494" facs="tcp:96861:251"/>
A Man may be deceived whilſt he is contemplating Generals only, unleſs he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to Particulars. An <hi>Idea</hi> of Human Nature is a lovely thing; no Man thinks of it, but is pleaſed with it in general, he hath no malice againſt it: But we muſt alſo conſider it particularly, as it is ſubjected in this or that Man. A Man may be <hi>Aliquis in omnibus, &amp; nullus in ſingulis,</hi> in reſpect of his Love, as well as his Knowledg. We muſt do good to the Generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but we muſt alſo do good to Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>Again; We muſt be beneficent to this, and that, and the other Man, but yet always with reſpect to the reſt of Mankind. Our particular Affection muſt not exclude our Regard to the Community. On the other ſide, our loving and doing good to this, or that, or the other Perſon, muſt conſiſt with, and be determin'd and bounded by our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good unto all Men. This is founded on that received Principle, The greateſt Good is to be preferred; and it is a greater Good which reaches more, than that which belongs to fewer: And <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is good to all, than that which is only good to ſome.</p>
            <p>In treating of this Argument, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What that is which is Good to Man.</item>
               <item>2. By what means we can contribute to it.</item>

               <item>4. Offer ſome Conſiderations that may engage us all to the Practice of this great and good Duty.</item>

            <p n="1">1. In anſwer to our firſt Enquiry. That in general is <hi>Good to Man,</hi> which is either his Perfection, or which has a Tendency to it; that has the Goodneſs of the End, this of the Means.</p>
            <p>Here we are to conſider, that Man is made up of two Natures, of various Powers and Faculties; that one of theſe Natures is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to the other, and ſome of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are ſubſervient to the other: that when we ſpeak of Perfection, we intend the Perfection of the whole, and have ſpecial regard to that which is principal and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, the Soul of Man. For, tho the Body has its Perfections and Goods, yet if theſe be not conſiſtent with, and ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Soul, they are of no account.</p>
            <p>We are not therefore ſo much to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our lower Appetites, and the State of the Body in this Diſcourſe, but as it is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to Knowledg and Wiſdom, to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of our ſelves according to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to the good Government of our Wills and Affections, and contributes to that Joy and Peace, which is conſequent on Vertue and Goodneſs. Nor is any State of our Body, or any outward Condition to be accounted good but evil, which does diſſerve and hinder us either in the uſe of our Underſtandings, or
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:96861:252"/>
in the Government of our Wills and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. If it do not further and promote theſe things, it is not good to us, as Men.</p>
            <p>I will more particularly ſpeak my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe few Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Man's Perfection conſiſts in a good, <hi>i. e.</hi> a clear, diſtinct, full and quick under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all thoſe things that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Compaſs: particularly in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, and of himſelf, and of the Rules and Reaſons of his own Actions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In a Will conſtantly following what is Good. In the Guidance and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Affections, his Appetite and Inclinations, his Intentions and Reſolutions, and all Principles of Action, according to his beſt and cleareſt Knowledg. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in the exerciſe of a natural, rational, hearty Religion, in a conſtant and even Fervency of Devotion toward God; alſo in the Inclinations, Habits and Practices of Vertue: which refers to Men, all which is ſumm'd up in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Goodwill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In that Joy and Peace, that Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Satisfaction which is the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Underſtanding ſo enlightened, and a Will ſo directed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That is a good State and Temper of Body, which will not obſtruct and hinder, but aſſiſt and be inſtrumental and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Soul in all theſe things. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life, and Health and Strength, and ſuch like are the Bodies Goods; which are then good to Man, when they ſerve the Ends aforeſaid, when they miniſter to Rell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:96861:252"/>
and Vertue, to Knowledg and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thoſe outward Circumſtances, an Eſtate and Reputation, and ſuch like, are the beſt, which moſt help us to obtain, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and uſe the Perfections before named; when they tend to increaſe our Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, or our Charity to Men, and miniſter to our Devotions and Vertue, as a competent Eſtate, and a clear Reputation have an Aptitude to do.</p>
            <p>All that's good to Man in any reſpect, muſt be either ſubſervient, or at leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this; therefore a Gratification of the ſenſitive Appetite, if it prove preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to Vertue and the Soul, is not good, but evil to the Man: And an Eſtate may be for <hi>hurt to the Owner thereof,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>God many times doth good to us, when he withholds Eſtates, or Health, or Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from us. For, thereby he cures us of many Maladies, rids us of many Vices. And ſo amongſt Men, they that have Power over others, and underſtand which are the beſt Methods to promote their Happineſs, do it very often by inflicting ſome Penalty, and by debarring them of ſome Gratification of one or more of their Appetites.</p>
            <p>But we muſt ſee that this be not a <hi>Cloak for Maliciouſneſs:</hi> we muſt not pretend that to be a Kindneſs, which is not; nor ſay we act from Charity, and with Intention to make others happy, when we act from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; when Peeviſhneſs, or Malice, are
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:96861:253"/>
the true Principles of what we do.</p>
            <p>We conſider Man all this while in his preſent State, but we are alſo to conſider him in reference to the future: And in that reſpect we attribute as great Perfection to him, as we can ſuppoſe him capable of; that he is there freed from all the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, under which the beſt Men labour here, and delivered from thoſe bad Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, from which the moſt fortunate Men are not exempted in this Life.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given a ſhort Summary of what's good to Man; and you will ſee the Reaſon in the following Diſcourſe, why I have made ſuch particular and diſtinct men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which is a ſubordinate, and that which is a principal and final Good, of that which is good to a part, and to the whole.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I now proceed to ſhew what are thoſe ways in which one Man may do good to another. They are of two ſorts; either ſuch as are mediate, and which by means of others; or immediate, and by himſelf are done.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt ſort are our hearty Deſires and Prayers to God, that he would do them good; and alſo when we live ſo good Lives, as God is pleaſed to teſtify his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of them, by ſhewing Mercy to our Family, Kindred, or Country. Thus the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for his ſake. Of this kind alſo are our Perſuaſions and Intreaties with Men on the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:96861:253"/>
behalf of others, when we prevail with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do them that Good, which our ſelves could not. To this alſo appertains the making of good and true Reports, and giving juſt, but fair Characters of Men. When we give any Character of another Man, it muſt be a good one, ſo far as is conſiſtent with Truth and Juſtice: we muſt always ſpeak true, and never ill of any Man, unleſs it be the beſt Method to make him wiſe and good, or it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the publick Good, or the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that Man, to whom we are moſt obliged. This is a way to increaſe a Man's Power, and enlarge his Opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good; which I wiſh that all, who falſly, or but groundleſly calumniate others, would conſider. Let all that needleſsly carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout little Stories of the Miſcarriages and Imperfections of their Brethren, and <hi>unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> their <hi>Nakedneſs,</hi> only to gratify their own, or their Companions ill Nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member they do a great Miſchief.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the ways we take to do Men good in, by the Mediation of others. The other by our ſelves are theſe three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Diſcourſe: By this we inform the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, rectify the miſtaken, ſatisfy the doubtful, compoſe the unquiet, moderate the vehement, excite the dull, revive the languiſhing. In ſhort, by Diſcourſe, we may direct and perſuade Men to be wiſe and good, we may miniſter to their Peace and Joy, we may end Quarrels. I need add no more, becauſe we are all as ſenſible of the
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:96861:254"/>
Beneficialneſs of a good Tongue, as we are of the Miſchievouſneſs of a bad one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Communication of our Eſtates, or the uſe of our Power, or Intereſt, or Skill for the Relief of others. By this means, how does the Oppreſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, and the heart of the Poor ſing? The Priſoner triumphs in his Liberty, and the Poor that he has got an Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The</p>
            <p n="3">3. is Example; which has a powerful, and a large and laſting Inſtuence. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples do more particularly, and ſenſibly inſtruct, more powerfully convince and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, more ſtrongly incline, and ſurely ingage and determine us to wiſe and good Practices than Diſcourſes themſelves.</p>
            <p>Man doth ſo naturally imitate, that he is very prone to do whatſoever he ſees done; and thus Religion and Vertue may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated from one to another, till it hath ſpread over a Kingdom, nay over the whole World, and may be derived from one Age and Generation to another.</p>
            <p>We and all the World are ſenſible of excellent Advantages we have received from the holy and vertuous Examples of thoſe that have liv'd hundreds, thouſands of Years ſince.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly enumerated the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways, wherein one Man may do good to another; which I have ſo particularly done for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we having a true, large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Notion of all that's good to Man, and what we can do to attain it, might not
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:96861:254"/>
confine our ſelves to endeavour after ſome one particular Good, but might ſeek the Good of Man in it's greateſt Extent and Latitude; which will give us this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that we ſhall never be unimployed in this good Work, but when we cannot be good to Men in one kind, we may in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, when we cannot inſtruct Men, and rectify their Miſtakes immediately; yet we may innocently divert and pleaſe them at preſent, and make way for their conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what we ſhall ſay another time. By this alſo we ſhall be ſatisfied, tho we be not doing them that Good we moſt deſire to do; yet if we deſire to do them that which we can do, tho we cannot make them richer, if we can help to make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented (which by our Diſcourſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample we may) it may ſatisfy us. We ſhall in this caſe do to them, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to the lame Man that asked Money; they had no <hi>Silver</hi> nor <hi>Gold,</hi> but they cured him of his Lameneſs: Or tho we cannot make Men wiſe at preſent, yet if we can make them innocently merry, we do them good. That's the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That by our diſtinct Conceptions of the ſeveral Orders and Degrees of Good, we might be kept from turning Good into Evil. How many are there that by their Ignorance of this intend well, but do ill to Men? And he that is ignorant, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not which are the Goods that are final, and which ſubordinate; which are for the
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:96861:255"/>
whole, and which for the part; which are for the preſent, and of ſhort continuance, and which for the future, and for ever, is very prone to ſlide into this Miſcarriage. Such a Man will pleaſe his Child, or Servant, or Friend, by a fond, and eaſy, and importune Compliance with his Humor, which is to gratify him at preſent, but by this deprives him of thoſe laſting Advantages, which a Father's Correction, or a Maſter's Rebuke, or a Friend's Admonition might have brought. He pleaſes his Humor, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ruins both Soul and Body, and had been much more kind, if he had given wholeſom, tho unpleaſing Counſel. That's the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have therefore mentioned theſe things ſo particularly, that we might be inſtructed to lay out our greateſt Care and Pains, and uſe our utmoſt Diligence about that Good which is greateſt and beſt, that we may not ſpend our ſelves, and our Time upon Trifles and Ieſſer Matters, whilſt we neglect thoſe that are of far greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to them: For, by underſtanding that Religion and Vertue, that Knowledg and Goodneſs are moſt eſſential and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal to the greateſt Happineſs of Man, we ſhall not ſo much inſtruct him how to grow rich, as how to be wiſe and good; nor ſhall we be ſo diligent to cure a bodily Diſeaſe, whilſt we neglect his Vices, thoſe Diſtempers of Mind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And I have therefore conſidered all the ſeveral Ways wherein we can do Good,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:96861:255"/>
that ſo we might not fail to do all that we can, nor be vainly troubled that we do no more. It's but little Good that any Man can do, it's highly reaſonable he ſhould not fail in any of that; and it would be fooliſh to grieve he doth no more than he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing, tho this is the Caſe of ſome melancholy and ſcrupulous Perſons.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee what uſe to make of what has been already diſcourſed. But before I leave this Particular, let me add this, That in all we do for the Advantage of others, we are to obſerve three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our own Ability, and the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we ſhall (probably) have to effect what we intend: for if our Undertakings be not proportion'd to our Power, or the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of concurrent Cauſes, we ſhall not accompliſh what we intend, we ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated of our Purpoſe, and labour in vain, which we ought to prevent by all Means.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ought to conſider in what degree and order that which we aim at is good, for the Reaſons already mention'd, that if there be a Competition, we may always <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> prefer that which is beſt, and may ſubordinate the other to that.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt alſo have a regard to the Neceſſity, the Number, and the Valuable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Perſons to whom we intend well; every Man's Prudence will ſerve to direct him by theſe Intimations, and keep him within the Bounds of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="504" facs="tcp:96861:256"/>
All that I will add under this Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, the Rule our Saviour has given, That we ſhould make every Man's Caſe our own; for naturally Man is not ſo apt to conſider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as himſelf. This will both excite us to Diligence, and make us charitable.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this Particular: If any Man ask me, What that is, that every one can and muſt do for all and every Man in the World, without exception?</p>
            <p>I anſwer; He may and muſt pray to God, that they may be good Chriſtians in this Life, and bleſſed and happy in the future. We muſt pray, that (which God hath declared to be his Will) <hi>All Men may be ſaved, and come to the knowledg of the Truth;</hi> i. e. that they may be brought to believe and obey the Goſpel, and ſo may be made Partakers of everlaſting Life and Glory. Our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy alſo teaches us to pray, that God would <hi>have Mercy upon all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I need not prove that this is our Duty; ſurely there's none that owns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Chriſtian, or but a Man, that doubts of this: I therefore take it for granted, and will infer from this Conceſſion,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That every Man in the World ought to deſire, that every other Man may be good and vertuous on Earth, and everlaſtingly happy in Heaven. If he muſt pray for this, that implies he muſt deſire it; and if he do pray to God for it, if he be hearty and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, he does deſire it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That every Man ought alſo to do what he can, to further every other Man's
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:96861:256"/>
preſent Goodneſs, and thereby his future Happineſs. If he be a Man that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe rationally and movingly, he ſhould plainly deſcribe their Duties to the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and paſſionately exhort the Lazy and Careleſs to the performance of them. Or if he has a good Pen, let him deliver theſe things to Poſterity, which are uſeful for them to know.</p>
            <p>But that which the Unlearned may reach, is to live a religious and an honeſt Life, and by this commend the Practice of Holineſs to others. And who knows how far the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one poor Man's Goodneſs may reach? perhaps to both the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the furtheſt parts of the World. This is the ſecond thing I infer, our Endeavour.</p>
            <p>From which follows by way of Corollary, that we muſt take care never to do any thing that interferes with our Endeavour after every other Man's Happineſs hereafter, and his Goodneſs here. We muſt never do any thing that's inconſiſtent with Mens being good Men in this World, and their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that to come.</p>
            <p>But that's not all that is implied in our Endeavour, that we do nothing to oppoſe and hinder Men from being good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: It implies alſo, that we do that which is ſerviceable to the attaining theſe Ends; and in all dealings with them, in all we do to and about them, that we help forward their Vertue and Happineſs; that either by more remote or nearer Methods, either by our ſelves or others, we contribute to their
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:96861:257"/>
preſent Holineſs, and their Glory in the Life to come.</p>
            <p>If we do not thus, we are inconſiſtent with our ſelves, and our Actions contradict each other; we are acted by contrary Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Principles of our Actions op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and thwart each other: For, when we deſire Men may be good, and vertuous, and everlaſtingly happy, this proceeds from Love and Good-will; but when we deſign to puniſh them in their Bodies, or to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their Reputations, or leſſen their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; unleſs this be in order to their great Happineſs, and unleſs we intend to further that in ſuch ways, we do not act from Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but Hatred; except ſuch particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>licted on them by us for their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and with eſpecial regard to their everlaſting Salvation, we are not charitable, but malicious: And if it be ſo, we are at variance with our ſelves; we deſire Men may be miſerable here, and happy hereafter, not that thereby they may be ſo.</p>
            <p>I wiſh that which I have here ſaid, may not be a Sanctuary to Uncharitableneſs; and that Men will ſay, they intend to do Men ſome greater Good by the Evils they lay on them. Landlords oppreſs their Tenants, to make them more diligent; Maſters will be hard, ſevere, and high to their Servants, to keep them in their due Obſervance; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers auſtere to their Children, to teach them Obedience: One Man will eclipſe another Man's Reputation, that he may not have an opportunity to do ſo much Miſchief as he
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:96861:257"/>
might, if he was unſuſpected. It's well if theſe be not meer Excuſes of Paſſion and ill Nature; 'tis well if they think as they ſay, and if it be as they think, that theſe be the beſt ways to ſecure Men from thoſe Evils. But I fear, it's too often Peeviſhneſs, and a waſpiſh angry Spirit that evaporates, and is not employ'd by Religion, and under the Conduct of Charity, nor deſigns any Good; or if Good be intended, I doubt, very often ſome wiſer and better Method might be taken for the effecting it.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle tells us of overcoming <hi>Evil with Good.</hi> I know, the hypocritical proud Phariſees, thoſe falſe-hearted Pretenders, were ſharply rebuked by our Saviour; and I doubt not but there are ſuch in our Days. Only let's be cautious we do not over-haſtily condemn Men, nor inconſiderately reſolve upon the Uſe of extreme Remedies, till the Diſeaſe ſeem incurable by any other.</p>
            <p>When in ſome of theſe Ways we do that which tends to bring Men nearer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Happineſs, we do them Good.</p>
            <p>But I need not be very particular in this, becauſe every Man's Mind will faithfully ſuggeſt to him what's good to and for other Men. No Man that is inclined to do Good to others, can eaſily be ignorant or miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>All the Danger is in theſe two Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he ſhould only conſider a part, and not the whole, or the preſent only, without reference to what's future; and ſo
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:96861:258"/>
many times may do them Hurt inſtead of Good. I have endeavoured to prevent this Miſtake in my Explication, where I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd thoſe Actions to be good to others, which conduce to the obtaining of their laſt End, which tend to make them perfect and happy.</p>
            <p>2dly; The other is, That he only hath regard to one or a few, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects others and more. Now the Text directs us here alſo, and teaches us to <hi>do Good to all Men,</hi> which is a Principle of great Wiſdom and Juſtice; and that Man who obſerves it, and hath attain'd to this Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to regard Univerſality, to take unto his Thoughts the Concerns of all Men, he will govern himſelf in his Carriage to them diſcreetly. He will be juſt and impartial in his Dealing; he will not, out of a too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſpect, neglect a more common pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good; will not, to ſerve one or a few, diſſerve and prejudice, nay, or be mindleſs of the Concerns of the Community, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He that lives by this Rule, ſo to do Good to one Man, as remembring he muſt do ſo to all, he will neither be guilty of Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and Contractedneſs of Mind, nor of Partiality; and he that eſcapes theſe Rocks, he ſteers his Courſe well and wiſely. And not only ſo, but he acts gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and bravely, and ſo as to deſerve Praiſe. He that deſigns the Good of the World, and intends the Welfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and conſiders himſelf as one little part of the great <hi>Compages,</hi> (as indeed he is)
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:96861:258"/>
and never ſeparates his own particular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts from the Order they have to the reſt of the Univerſe; this Man, as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends truly, and judges right, and as he acts both wiſely and juſtly, ſo he alſo acts nobly and generouſly.</p>
            <p>Every Man may be uſeful to another in all theſe reſpects, and for all the purpoſes I mention'd, and may contribute very much to his Happineſs.</p>
            <p>He may alſo in all theſe ways retard and obſtruct the Happineſs of others, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their preſent and future Miſery.</p>
            <p>We all have experienced the Advantages of Diſcourſe, which (as I have ſhewed) inſtructs Ignorance, convinces Miſtake, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies Doubts, compoſes Unquietneſs, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates Vehemence, excites Dulneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhes Memory; it both directs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades us to Vertue, inclines to Benevolence, aſſiſts our Joy, and increaſes Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And there is none but is ſenſible what a good Name is, and hath been not only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but alſo greatly aſſiſted in doing good Offices, by a good Report. I need not mind any that has liv'd in the World any time, how inſtrumental an evil Tongue may be to the Ruine of others; how by blaſting their Reputation, it obſtructs their doing Good; how it may ſeduce Men into Miſtakes and Lies, and rob them of common Senſe; how it may diſturb their Peace, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ire Mens Minds with turbulent and helliſh Paſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="510" facs="tcp:96861:259"/>
Again; Good Examples do more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>i. e.</hi> more ſenſibly and particularly teach and inſtruct, more powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and perſuade, more ſurely incline, and engage, and determine us to good Practices, than Diſcourſes themſelves.</p>
            <p>And nothing hath more Influence on us to make us wicked, and to lead us into Ways of Evil and Miſchief, than an ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Nothing doth more inſinuate into our Thoughts, and inſenſibly, but forcibly draw us to wicked Practices. Nothing more encourages and emboldens Men to Sin, than to ſee others committing it. I do not ſay all, but I am ſure much of the Wickedneſs of the World comes by Imitation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>And laſtly; When a Man doth, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid he did, <hi>deliver the Poor that cries, the Fatherleſs, and him that hath none to help him; is Eyes to the Blind, and Feet to the Lame; breaks the Jaws of the Oppreſſor, and plucks the Spoil out of his Teeth,</hi> &amp;c. Now that they are delivered from their Bondage, or drudging for neceſſary Supports of Life, they are vacant for the Employments of their Mind, and can have time to purſue after greater Goods, and better Enjoyments, and thoſe which contain more of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>On the contrary; he that hurts the Body, or ſpoils the Eſtate, or abridges the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others, how doth he hinder and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Mens Happineſs, by diverting them from Attendance on their higheſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:96861:259"/>
Concerns, to low Services, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring to the Body?</p>
            <p>And there is no Conſidering-Man will doubt, but that a good Man by his holy and vertuous Life, by his powerful Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions with God, doth Good not only to himſelf, but others; nor to a few, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; not to the preſent Age alone, but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſhall <hi>call him Bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> were Bleſſings to the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews; and not to them only, but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo have fared the better for theſe Mens Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>This is a ſhort Delineation of the ſeveral Particulars, wherein one Man may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged by another, and of the Ways wherein that can be done.</p>
            <p>To conclude this; We muſt contribute what we can to the greateſt Happineſs and Perfection of Man, and do the greateſt Good we can; and all other leſſer and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Goods muſt be diſpens'd and imparted, or with-held by us, according as either of theſe will moſt contribute to his Perfection, to his being wiſe and holy, religious and vertuous here, and everlaſtingly bleſſed and glorious hereafter in the future State.</p>
            <p>The greater Good is then in this Caſe to regulate our Actions. Let us ſo diſtribute our Alms, or give our Counſel, or lend our Help to any, as moſt to further their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Happineſs. Let us take care, that by ſuch things we do not ſet Men at further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from Heaven; as we do, when we
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:96861:260"/>
inſtruct a wicked Man ſo as by our Advice he accompliſhes his ill Deſigns; or if we beſtow our Alms on an idle Perſon, and thereby maintain him in his Sloth.</p>
            <p>I add; Let us look that in all we do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we ſtill have an eye to their great Happineſs, and intend ſomewhat more in every Act of ours, than to beſtow on them ſome preſent and particular Advantage. Let us aim not only at the Gratification of an inferior and bodily Appetite, but at the Advantages of the Soul, of Vertue and Goodneſs, of preſent, and of future and everlaſting Happineſs. If we keep this ſtill in our Eye, we ſhall both do more Good, and more certainly do Good, than otherwiſe we ſhould.</p>
            <p>This then is the Sum; Let us do any Good, every Good, all the Good we can, to All; ſtill preferring the greater in caſe of Competition, and ſubordinating all the leſſer to that which is principal, at leaſt, taking care that they be conſiſtent with, and never oppoſite to it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I propounded to remove ſome Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which lie againſt our doing Good to all Men: Two of the greateſt I think of, are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then we muſt inflict Evil on none: We muſt not oppoſe an Enemy, nor proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute an Offender, nor puniſh a Malefactor, which is altogether unuſual, and indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable; for there is no living on Earth, if this may not be.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="513" facs="tcp:96861:260"/>
2. If it muſt be our Buſineſs to do Good to all Men, this will take us off from that Regard to our ſelves, and our own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intereſts, which it's both natural and allowable for us to mind; we ſhould rather, as we are exhorted, <hi>ſtudy to be quiet, and to do our own Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt; I have already in my Explication very much prevented the former of theſe Objections: All that I need to ſay further is, That tho we are enjoined <hi>to do Good to All,</hi> yet this does not require we ſhould do no Ill to ſome; but rather enforce that on us; where it is the neceſſary or beſt Method to further their Happineſs, to make them ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and wiſe, and qualify them for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; or where it's neceſſary for procuring the Good of the Community, by ſecuring the Intereſts of many or more valuable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or thoſe to whom we are more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon other accounts, or of any inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Man.</p>
            <p>We are not therefore by this Doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from proſecuting and puniſhing Offenders: only it keeps our Anger and Hatred within their due Bounds, and requires them not to tranſgreſs the Limits which Charity hath ſet; that is, to do nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Goodneſs of any Man at preſent, nor conſequently with his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs. We muſt not puniſh Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul too, that belongs only to him that is the Judg of Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:96861:261"/>
We muſt not do any thing, but what may be, and what we intend to be ſerviceable to their Happineſs. And not to mention low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and leſſer Penalties, even the Puniſhment of Death it ſelf, has many times had this good Effect on them who have ſuffered it. Many Criminals by being ſentenc'd to Death, have been brought to a true Remorſe for their Sins, who probably had they eſcaped the Condemnation of the Judg, had fallen under the Condemnation of God.</p>
            <p>So that this Doctrine only tends to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our Anger, to direct and reſtrain our Hatred, and to ſet Bounds to our worſer Paſſions; not to extirpate, but to prune and rectify them, to bring them under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Charity.</p>
            <p>Secondly; The other Objection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds on a great Miſtake, that he that doth <hi>Good to All,</hi> whoſe Temper and Principles engage him to ſuch a large Beneficence, will neglect himſelf. Whereas,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It no way interferes with that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principle, but on the contrary, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens it: as will appear, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That he that doth Good to all, doth Good to himſelf, for he is one of that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and he has a greater Opportunity of doing Good to himſelf, than any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is alway with himſelf, ſo that a Man's ſelf is not excluded from his Care.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That himſelf is not the only Object of his Care and Kindneſs: I anſwer; Nor is this either fit, or juſt, or
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:96861:261"/>
reaſonable, or natural. No Man can be the ſole and adequate Object of his own Love; he cannot circle in himſelf, be his own both Center and Circumference. If he ſhould force himſelf to ſuch an unnatural uſe of himſelf, he would be very unhappy; if he take himſelf off from his Relations to others, he muſt be miſerable.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Every Man muſt be firſt good to himſelf, that he may be more good to others. He that would be a Benefactor to other Men, muſt firſt be kind to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) He that is good to others, is beſt to himſelf: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt; He engages them to make him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Kindneſs; and theſe Viciſſitudes of Benefits preſerve the Societies of Men, as the natural Life of Man is preſerved by the Circulation of the Blood to and from the Heart. And,</p>
            <p>2dly; If they fail to recompence, yet the great God will not; but whatſoever Good any Man doth, <hi>he ſhall receive of the Lord;</hi> his Prayers, and all his <hi>Labour of Love</hi> ſhall return into his own Boſom. And beſides all this,</p>
            <p>3dly; The very doing Good it ſelf, is a Work that is an abundant Recompence to it ſelf. To do Good, is certainly the higheſt Pleaſure of which the Soul of Man is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as will appear further, when I ſhew the Advantages which will accrue to us by ſuch an univerſal Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>So then notwithſtanding this Exception from Self-love, we may love univerſally,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:96861:262"/>
and do Good to all: for, theſe are two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles, that agree well together; which ſeems to be well repreſented in the natural World. For (as the Aſtronomers tell us) the Earth at the ſame time moves round its own Axis, and yet makes a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in the Ecliptick Circle, in which it always keeps the ſame ſteady Poſition, in reference to all the circumambient Bodies. This doth repreſent the Man of a regular Self-love, and an univerſal Charity: He moves about his own Center, but yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Relation to the reſt of Mankind, and keeps his Paralleliſm to the Axe of the Univerſe, as I may ſay. Or, to uſe a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar inſtance; The Syſtole and Diaſtole of the Heart, are very fit reſemblances of a Man's doing good to himſelf and to others. The Blood's coming into the Heart, is the motion of Self-love; the flowing of it out from thence into all the extream parts of the Body, is his Love and Beneficence to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to all Men. This is the motion that keeps Life in the Body; and the doing Good to a Man's ſelf, and to the reſt of the World, preſerves Society, and tends to the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid enough to clear this difficulty, and ſhewn that <hi>to do good to all,</hi> is no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to any Man's particular Intereſts.</p>
            <p>To ſum up then what has been ſaid by way of Explication. Becauſe of the great advantages that will certainly accrue to us by ſuch a practice, let us lay out our ſelves to procure the greateſt good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:96861:262"/>
of every Man in the World: Not of our ſelves only, or our Kindred, our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Acquaintance and Friends, or of good Men; but of all and every one, of thoſe that are, and thoſe that are not of our Blood, of Country-men and Foreigners, of ſuch as think as we do, and of thoſe that differ from us, of Friends and Enemies, of good Men and bad.</p>
            <p>I intend the Perfection and Happineſs, and in order to that, the Vertue and Goodneſs of all Men: Do this abſolutely, (this is to be univerſally, indiſpenſibly obſerved) and do them all other Good with reference and in order to this. Inform, Adviſe, Exhort, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, Comfort, Pleaſe them in your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, where it will be for their advantage, or where it will not hinder or obſtruct it.</p>
            <p>Thus do to all in general, and to every one in particular. And as in caſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, ever the greateſt Good is to be preferr'd; ſo if a Competition of Perſons be, we are, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> to prefer the moſt; or if you ſay the beſt, that is true, but that is alſo becauſe the moſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in them: For a good and a wiſe Man is a publick Benefit, and of more value than numbers of others that are not ſo. Doing Good to the moſt, is alſo the greateſt Good.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, In all the ways of imparting our Aid towards this, let us ever obſerve the Seaſons when any Actions will probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute moſt to this Effect, and when they can beſt be done by us. This I would have eſpecially obſerv'd, becauſe Actions that are
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:96861:263"/>
materially good, and where we mean well, are often ſpoil'd by being miſ-timed. As when Men are diſcourſing of their lawful ſecular Occaſions, or entertaining each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with pleaſant Diverſions; then for any to make mention of things moſt Sacred and Venerable, this is importune and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and here is a good meaning loſt by an in obſervance of Opportunity.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I now proceed to the Arguments which perſwade us thus, <hi>as we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do good unto all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, To do thus is very agreeable to Nature. I am of their mind, who think Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a truſty Guide, and make this the firſt and Sum of all their Precepts and Advices, to <hi>follow Nature.</hi> I do believe there is not one Command in the Goſpel which is not a Branch from this Root, a Particular under this General.</p>
            <p>I need not ſay that we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by Nature the Corruptions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations of it: So many that declaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Nature, interpret that Phraſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſhould be rendred the <hi>animal Man,</hi> the Man that lives the Life of a mere Animal, one that hath not the Reaſon and Underſtanding of a Man.</p>
            <p>By Nature therefore I underſtand here, 1. Nature in General. 2. Particularly that part of humane Nature, which is common to Man with inferior Torts of Beings. 3. That wherein he differs from, and excells them, and agrees with thoſe that are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="519" facs="tcp:96861:263"/>
1. As for Nature in general, it is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that all Beings do by their motions and alterations conſpire to the preſerving of the Univerſe: that they do not more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour their own Good and Continuance, than the Good of the Whole. Nay, many times they leave their own proper Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſeem to neglect as it were their private Concerns, to promote the more Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Univerſal. This is ſo obvious to every Obſervation, and there are ſo many Inſtances of it in both animate and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Bodies, that I need not inſiſt upon it. I ſhall only mind you of another almoſt as common as this; that Animals of the ſame kind are loving and helpful to each other, and do not only aſſociate and herd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but will alſo expoſe themſelves to danger for their mutual Defence, and other good Offices. But I go on further, and more particularly,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To that part of Nature which is in Man, common to him with other Animals, his Body; how does every Part miniſter to other, and all of them conſpire to preſerve and perfect the whole? How is Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conveyed from one to another through the whole Body? And when it is thus with it, the Body is in its natural good State of Health: If it be otherwiſe, if one Part draw all the Nouriſhment to it ſelf, it is then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, and this tends to the Diſſolution of the whole, and conſequently of that Part it ſelf which does not diſtribute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="520" facs="tcp:96861:264"/>
Add to this what the Naturaliſts have obſerv'd, that no Paſſion is more agreeable to Man's Body than <hi>Love,</hi> which is the Principle of doing Good; that nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes more to his Health, nor is a more certain Argument of it, than Good-will; that the very Body of Man is never in better State, than when he is moſt enclined to do good Offices; And that the Motions which maintain Life are then moſt equally vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, when we are in the Exerciſe of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Compaſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is no leſs congruous to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, as diſtinguiſhed from all other Animals, it is agreeable to the Mind and Reaſon of Man. Hear the Sence of an honeſt Heathen, which is the Voice of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not of Revelation. Saith he to his Friend. <hi>Qui tibi amicus eſt, ſcito hunc om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus amicum eſſe.</hi> Again, <hi>Non ſum uni an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulo natus, Patria mea est totus hic Mundus.</hi> Nor was it only one, but many of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, that called themſelves Citizens of the World, not that they forgot their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, but they remembred their Relation to the whole: They look'd on themſelves in the ſame order to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, which others do to the Town where they were born and dwell.</p>
            <p>Again; <hi>Poſterorum res ago.</hi> He did not content himſelf to be a Benefactor to the preſent Age, but would take care alſo that thoſe that ſhould be born after, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive advantage by his Labours, and ſo they have. <hi>Lucan</hi> ſays of <hi>Cato,</hi> and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:96861:264"/>
as ſpeak of him ſay the ſame:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Hi mores, haec dura immota Catonis</l>
               <l>Secta fuit, ſervare modum, finem<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> tenere,</l>
               <l>Naturam<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ſequi, Patriae<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> impendere vitam,</l>
               <l>Non ſibi ſed toti genitum ſe credere Mundo.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Thus we ſee Nature taught the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. And I do the more willingly inſiſt on this Argument from Nature, becauſe I cannot think that the God of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo the Author of our Religion, ſhould make this inconſiſtent with that, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of it: And becauſe by this means we ſhall have a great aſſiſtance both in the underſtanding of our Duty, and in making us willing to do it. Had this been duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, Men had never ſacrificed their Sons to <hi>Moloch.</hi> And if this be received, one of the greateſt Objections againſt our being Religious vaniſhes.</p>
            <p>In general then: If it be natural for the Soul of Man, before it be corrupted with any of thoſe Paſſions, that are the off-ſpring of Folly, to obſerve and be affected with the welfare and ill State of others, beſides it ſelf. If it be diſpleaſed and unquiet, and griev'd when it goes ill with them, and joyed and delighted to ſee them in good Plight; then it's natural to it, to will and endeavour their good and welfare.</p>
            <p>The Underſtanding of Man is a large and unlimited kind of thing, it reaches forth it ſelf to all Beings, and views them; and wherever it ſees Good, it loves and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:96861:265"/>
the continuance; and when it obſerves Evil, it's troubled and wiſhes it were not, and will endeavour it may not be. And if this be natural to the Mind of Man, unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by wicked Practices, and fooliſh Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; then it is natural to it to do good uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, and then certainly to all Mankind.</p>
            <p>Again; it's natural to the Soul of Man to love Pleaſure, and to purſue it, and to be averſe from whatſoever diſpleaſes it. Now nothing can be the object of Pleaſure but Good: or, if any Evil be, 'tis only in order to what is Good, and as it ſerves that, <hi>i. e.</hi> as it is good in Reality.</p>
            <p>No Man can be delighted to ſee any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in an ill Plight; or if he be, he is in an unnatural ſtate himſelf, and his Soul is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
            <p>More particularly and diſtinctly: If we underſtand by natural, that which proceeds from an inward Principle, and which tends to preſerve and perfect Nature in general: and particularly that which is a Concluſion deriv'd from Principles of Reaſon and clear Diſcourſes, (for that's natural to Man which is rational); then I will uſe this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to evince, that all this which is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, is agreeable to Nature in general, and to humane Nature in Particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> It's natural for us to be acting. If we either conform to the reſt of the Beings we live with in the World, or act agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to our own Natures, we muſt be doing. The beſt Philoſophers aſſure us, that in the vaſt Univerſe there is not one little Particle
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:96861:265"/>
that is idle, but the World, and all in it, are in unceſſant motion; tho' ſome Bodies that move more ſlowly and leſs diſcernibly than others, are ſaid to be at reſt.</p>
            <p>Whether we climb up into Heaven, or dive into the Sea, or dig into the Bowels of the Earth, we ſhall find all Beings employed and buſy, nothing idle. The Heavenly Bodies are whirling about perpetually, the Waters ceaſe not to run; and in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of the Earth, which might be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the dens of Sleep, yet the Mines are made. And Plants tho' they move not from, yet in their place they do, as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by their growth. Animals, their very Life and Senſe is Motion; their very make and nature inclines them to Action.</p>
            <p>Particularly, Man is endued with ſo many inſtruments of Action, and ſuch a Power and Principle of Motion, that it is very much againſt his natural Propenſion, if he be not in Action. We neither ſhould nor can be idle and unactive. Whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the many active Powers in Man, will be of this Opinion.</p>
            <p>It's alſo agreeable to Reaſon, that we ſhould uſe Diligence, take pains, have a buſineſs: becauſe no great thing can be done without difficulty; without diligence no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſiderable is ever done, and every thing is done with it.</p>
            <p>Beſides; We cannot expect to do well without Pains and Care: For tho' Evil may come through an Omiſſion and Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, yet an Intenſion of all our Powers,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:96861:266"/>
a vigilance and induſtry is neceſſary to our doing Good. Our obſervation of our ſelves will aſſure us of this, becauſe all Beginnings are difficult, and the greater any Actions are, the more attention and diligence they require.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's no leſs natural for a Man to <hi>do Good;</hi> for, he can do nothing but that which he thinks ſo.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that it's alſo natural to do Evil. I would anſwer, that we do not terminate there, it's only in order to do ſome Good, and then that Evil is truly good, doth <hi>induere rationem boni.</hi> Indeed if Man ſhould do Evil univerſally, he muſt deſtroy himſelf; but that's unnatural.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But is it natural alſo to do Good to others, to Men? I anſwer. If it be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to do Good to our ſelves, it is natural al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to do ſo to others, becauſe we depend on them. We ſtand in need of others to do us Good, and cannot live without them. We alſo wiſh that all other Men would do us Good, and muſt imagine that every other Man deſires the ſame. Beſides; we know Men beſt, and can therefore do them moſt Good: They alſo are of our kind, and are moſt like to us of all other Animals; and therefore if we love our ſelves, we muſt love them. Add to all this, that all other Beings within our Compaſs, they are capable of greateſt Happineſs and Miſery: and therefore its very reaſonable we ſhould do Good to them, ſince they may be exalted ſo high, or depreſſed ſo low; be in ſo very
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:96861:266"/>
good, or ſo very ill a Condition. Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Beings deſerve not our Pains to do them Good, ſince they can neither be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or unhappy, as Man can be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And on the ſame account we muſt do Good to <hi>all Men</hi> without Exception. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Some of the Reaſons mention'd, hold for all as well as for any.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We may do ſome Good in ſome kind to all (tho it be only in hearty Wiſhes and Deſires) and we ſhould do all the Good we can. And,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) All the Exceptions that can be made againſt this, are Arguments for it: the moſt material are, that many Men are uſeleſs, or evil, or Enemies to us, and this gives us a further Reaſon to do Good, becauſe there is greater want of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To Chriſtians. It's natural to love thoſe beſt, that are beſt; and ſuch are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and Practicers of the beſt Religion in the World. Now that this is natural, and reaſonable, appears,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe they are publick Goods: The World is the better for every honeſt Man; his Prayer, his Example, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel are full of Advantages. They therefore, being better than others, ought principally to be regarded. To do Good to one Good Man, is a compendious way to do Good to many.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) They will not fail to make Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Law of Gratitude is deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in the Heart of every honeſt Man:
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:96861:267"/>
What we do to them therefore will return into our own Boſom; we ſhall be the better for the Good we do to them.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) They have many Enemies. Thus it was when this Epiſtle was writ, and thus it is to this day. The <hi>World hates you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. The Reaſon is clear, If ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Men have many Enemies, that they ſhould be Friends to one another.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) We have better Opportunities of doing Good to them than to others. They are more capable of Counſel and Advice; more likely to be inclined and perſwaded to Vertue, more to be influenced by good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: ſo our Endeavours are likely to be more effectual with them; therefore eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we are to do Good to them. But,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Why as we have Opportunity?</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We are weak and inſufficient of our ſelves, and have need of Aſſiſtance from abroad; we ſhall do well to take in all Aids, to obſerve the fitteſt Seaſon, that what we do, may be to purpoſe. For, as I have ſaid, we ſhall do more, and with leſs Trouble, and ſurer Succeſs, when we ſtrike in with Opportunity.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Opportunity is both ſhort and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, therefore by no means neglect it. Our Time is very ſhort; but the time of doing Good is much ſhorter. Thus I have ſummarily repreſented the Reaſonableneſs and Naturalneſs of our doing Good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall alſo ſhew that,</p>
            <p>Secondly; This is very ageeable to all true Religion that ever has been, and is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:96861:267"/>
the great Deſign of the Chriſtian in particular.</p>
            <p>As for Religion in general; It is not (as too many miſtake it) merely a Syſtem of Opinions, or a Company of Articles which ſtay us in Theory and Contemplation; nor is it a Ritual of Formalities and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: It's no empty Name, nor uſeleſs thing; but that which is really Good, and makes us ſo; it makes every one better that has it, better in and to himſelf, and to his Relations; better Governours, and better Subjects; better Fathers, and better Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; better Maſters, and better Servants. It makes every one better, both to himſelf, and to the World.</p>
            <p>The Religion of the Jews (however miſtaken by themſelves, yet) made good Proviſion for an univerſal Love, when it ſo often and expreſly required a great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>Strangers,</hi> and puts them in mind of their own Condition in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the hard Uſage they met with there, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 21.</p>
            <p>The very Sabbath, which was for a Sign and a Diſtinction between the Jews and other Nations, yet provided alſo for the <hi>Reſt</hi> of the <hi>Strangers.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 4, 5. they are commanded to do good Offices to their <hi>Enemy,</hi> in bringing back his <hi>ſtrayed Ox,</hi> and in helping his over-burdened <hi>Aſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly whoever conſiders that Religion, will ſay that it was never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the wiſe Author of it to be ſuch an Hedg and Fence of Separation, as the Pride
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:96861:268"/>
and ill Nature of its Profeſſors had made it. Do not their holy Prophets every where recommended unto them Charity and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence? Was not this ever of more account with God than all Burnt-Offerings and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices? How did this procure Acceptance for thoſe Offerings? Inſomuch that when they were ſeparated from this, they could not be accepted; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13, &amp;c. <hi>To what purpoſe is the Multitude of your Sacrifices to me? ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Chap. 58. 6. <hi>Is not this the Faſt that I have choſen, to looſe the Bands of Wickedneſs, to undo the heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and to let the Oppreſſed go free,</hi> &amp;c.? Mich. 6. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God? ſhall I come before him with Burnt-Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,</hi> &amp;c.? <hi>He has ſhewed thee, O Man, what is Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for our Chriſtian Religion, its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Deſign is, that we ſhould <hi>do Good to all:</hi> St. <hi>James 1. 27. Pure Religion, and undefiled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, is this, to viſit the Fatherleſs and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in their Afflictions.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 5. <hi>The End of the Commandment</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>is Charity out of a pure Heart, and a good Conſcience, and Faith unfeigned.</hi> So that God eſteems himſelf moſt honoured, and Men to be religious in the higheſt degree, when they are beneficent. More particularly;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſtianity takes away all ſeparating and dividing Ceremonies, that were as Walls of Partition, and ſo intends the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyting of all Men without Diſtinction: And does not this tend to lay on them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:96861:268"/>
Engagements to an univerſal Good-will?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It has taken great care to remove all Obſtacles of this, and has made it the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Condition of being happy. We muſt love all Men, and do them good, tho they be wicked, tho they be our Enemies. <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. ſays our Saviour. And <hi>if ye forgive not Men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Repreſentations the Goſpel has made of God and our Saviour, whom we are inſtructed and obliged to follow, will engage us to do Good univerſally. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>went about doing Good;</hi> He loved his Enemies to Death, he laid down his Life for them, he requited the greateſt Malice with the greateſt Love. God is deſcribed as loving the World, and that with the greateſt, trueſt, heartieſt Love that can be. He <hi>does Good unto all,</hi> his <hi>Sun riſes</hi> upon the Wicked as well as the Good.</p>
            <p>If then it be our Duty, our Perfection and Happineſs, to conform to our Saviour's Example; if by this we come to the utmoſt that our Natures can reach to, to be like God, whoſe Mercy extends to all things: Let us alſo love and do Good to Enemies, to Strangers, to all Men.</p>
            <p>Were there thoſe among the Heathens, that had only the Light of Nature, and yet both taught and practiſed this Duty of Beneficence in ſo high a degree? and ſhall not we Chriſtians who have the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, we who read of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:96861:269"/>
               <hi>Son of God</hi> deveſting himſelf of the <hi>Glory he had with God before the World was,</hi> and taking our frail Nature into Union with himſelf, learn and practiſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> much more? Are we not told what the Bleſſed Jeſus did, and how much he ſuffered in Life and Death, and all this, that he might redeem Mankind from Sin, and Death, and Hell, and make us happy?</p>
            <p>Was this the Deſign and Buſineſs of his Life and Death to do the greateſt Good to all Men? Let us make it appear, that we are indeed his Diſciples, in that we carry on the ſame Deſign which he did, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Example in <hi>doing Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſo neceſſary a part of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that if I were to give a Character of a Chriſtian in ſhort, it ſhould be this, <hi>He is one that deſigns and doth Good unto all Men.</hi> Catholick Charity makes a Man a Member of the Catholick Church. Holding of the Catholick Faith is not ſo ſure a Mark of a Chriſtian, as living in Univerſal Love; whoſoever doth ſo, is a Chriſtian: he that doth not, is none; no, tho he can repeat his Creed, and think he believes every Article of it, it is not ſo material as this univerſal Inclination of doing Good: it is not ſo material in order to our Acceptance with God, what our Opinions are, as what our Affections and Lives are.</p>
            <p>This is final and ultimate in Religion, that which God deſign'd to bring Men unto by all the Revelations which he has made, and by all his Inſtitutions. All true Religion that
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:96861:269"/>
has ever been in the World, has aim'd at this, to make Men better, wiſer, and more vertuous; And why is this but in order to Action? And do we, or can we act only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our ſelves? If we be better, ſhall it not be better for other Men? Can a Man be good to himſelf ſingly, and not to Society? Or, does Religion intend the Good of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons, and not of Communities? Aſſuredly that which deſigns to make Men good to themſelves, deſigns to make them good to others.</p>
            <p>That Man is moſt truly Religious, who gives moſt Honour to God; and he does that, who makes the moſt true and worthy Repreſentation of him to the World; and he does that, who is univerſally good and kind: Not he who macerates his Fleſh with Faſting, or wears out his Knees with long and frequent Praying, or ſpends the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of his time in Hearing or Reading, or denies himſelf the uſeful and innocent Pleaſures of Life and Converſation; that turns Recluſe or Hermite, that goes a long Pilgrimage bare-foot, that expoſes himſelf to pinching Cold, or ſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>hing Heat, that calls for <hi>Fire from Heaven</hi> upon the wicked Tranſgreſſors of the Law: Not any of theſe, or others, that paſs for the only Religious Men in the World, make ſo clear, and true, and becoming a Repreſentation of God to the World, as that poor Man does, whoſe only Deſign it is to do <hi>Good unto all,</hi> who makes it his great Buſineſs to be innocent and uſeful to every one in the World.
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:96861:270"/>
This Man's Life ſhall do more, to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men entertain true and honourable Thoughts of God, than all the Devotions and Fervors of them, who confine their Religion to ſuch Paſſions and Exerciſes. Nor can all Faith and Knowledg have ſuch an effect upon others, to make them glorify God, as the Life of this good Man who does Good.</p>
            <p>Laſtly; Nothing can make us more ſure of, and fit for the Happineſs of Heaven than this: As nothing can make us more like to God and Chriſt, and the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, than this Divine Temper of Love to Mankind; ſo nothing more fits us for, nor more aſſures of their Converſe in Heaven. Indeed this ſeems not ſo much a neceſſary Condition of the Happineſs of that State, as an eſſential Ingredient in it, and a great part of it. The great Change which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend will be in Heaven, from what is here on Earth, is this, That our ſelfiſh contracted Love will be enlarged and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and that there we ſhall every one love all.</p>
            <p>By what has been hitherto ſaid, it may appear ſufficiently, that nothing better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, or is more worthy of us, either as Men following the Principles of Nature, or as Chriſtians enlightned by revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than to be univerſally good. But I ſhall argue this further by ſhewing, that,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To <hi>do Good to all Men,</hi> &amp;c. is one of thoſe means which are as well neceſſary as available to the attaining of all thoſe Ends
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:96861:270"/>
which Wiſdom can deſign. It will much conduce to their Accompliſhment, and they cannot be obtained without it.</p>
            <p>The Ends which Wiſdom aims at are, the good State of a Man's ſelf in particular, and of the World in general. That's ill Nature miſguided by Folly, which intends more Evil than Good, or Evil not in order to Good. That which only deſigns a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Good, without regard to the more common, is Subtilty, Craft, and Selfiſhneſs; but only that is Wiſdom, which deſigns the Welfare of particulars, and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty too.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he was a Man of a <hi>large Heart,</hi> as <hi>the Sand on the Sea.</hi> And Wiſdom is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>loving Spirit;</hi> and is ſaid to <hi>have his Delights with the Sons of Men;</hi> Prov. 8. 31. It gives a Man an Aptitude, a Largeneſs of Heart, and Greatneſs of Mind. Now where there is Love, and that not contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pent up in a narrow Soul, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Welfare of all.</p>
            <p>This then being ſuppoſed, that Wiſdom aims at the good Eſtate of the Man himſelf, and of others, as it is certainly true; and therefore we never ſay any Man deſigns wiſely who intends Miſchief, but only he who deſigns Good, or a particular and leſs Evil in order to a common and greater Good.</p>
            <p>Theſe being the Ends which Wiſdom propoſes, what more accommodate means can be choſen for attaining this End, than
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:96861:271"/>
to do the Good that is within our Power? Nothing more natural than to be doing that which we wiſh ſhould be, and that our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours accompany our Wiſhes. And tho I cannot ſay that every particular Man's Endeavours are neceſſary to the Welfare of the Publick, becauſe the All-wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath taken care that the Publick Good ſhall not depend on ſo great an Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as is every ſingle Man's Goodneſs of himſelf, yet whoſoever doth not caſt in his Mite into the publick Treaſury, he ſo far diminiſhes and takes off from the Publick Good. And however, doing Good to others is abſolutely neceſſary to his own Good State: Tho my Endeavours may not be neceſſary for the Good of others, they are for my own.</p>
            <p>It remains then that I ſhew in particular, that this is one of thoſe means, which are both effectual and neceſſary to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of whatever Wiſdom can aim at, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to a Man's own particular, or the World in general.</p>
            <p>When a Man conſiders himſelf throughly, he conſiders both his Reference to this, and to the future Life. And he that intends wiſely for himſelf, he principally intends the Welfare of his Soul, the good State of his Mind, and that his Body may be in a Condition to ſerve that, and all other things contributing to the Welfare of both.</p>
            <p>Particularly, he propoſes to his aim Knowledg, Religion and Vertue, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:96861:271"/>
and Pleaſure, Life and Health, a good Name and a competent Eſtate. And true Wiſdom, that <hi>loving Spirit,</hi> will deſign for others as for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now to do good univerſally is the beſt, and a very ſure, plain and ſhort way, both to get and to keep theſe things both for our ſelves and others.</p>
            <p>Firſt; It is the way to the beſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that's bent to do all the Good he can to Men, will be diligent to get Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that he may be able to inform others. None that conſiders, but knows thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to be one of the great Excellencies of Man, and that we cannot be more u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eful to each other, than by communicating uſeful Truths: For, by this means we direct the Ignorant, and perhaps erring Travellers; nay, we open the <hi>Eyes of the Blind,</hi> we give <hi>Light to them that ſit in Darkneſs.</hi> In ſhort, by this we lay the Foundation of Vertue and Peace; and there's no Man but knows this, that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is one of the beſt Gifts that one Man can give or communicate to another.</p>
            <p>He therefore that's reſolved to do all the Good he can, will earneſtly ſeek after that Knowledg, which will be ſo beneſicial to others as well as himſelf: and he doth not only ſeek it for the Improvement of his own Mind, but hath this further Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſearch after it, that he may be more beneficial to other Men. He doth now not only ſtudy, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiat,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:96861:272"/>
ſed ut proſit;</hi> not only to better him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but others alſo. Nor is he only inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſtudy; but,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is alſo determin'd to ſeek after that Knowledg which is beſt, which is moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and brings the greateſt Benefits with it. He that ſteers the Courſe of his Studies by a deſign of doing Good, will not ſpend his time in Trifles and Curioſities, in idle and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Speculations, in groundleſs Conjectures, and endleſs Diſquiſitions. His purſuit is not after any piece of uſeleſs Learning; and all that he counts ſuch, which doth not make him wiſer or better, which doth not help him to direct his Life, to govern his Paſſions by Reaſon and Vertue, to quiet his Mind, to preſerve his Health, and rid him of ill Circumſtances, and be ſome way uſeful to other Men. And then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. He will be very communicative of what he knows, and there is no better way to get, to keep, to improve Knowledg, than to communicate it. The liberal Soul will not, Uſurer-like, hoard up Knowledg, and applaud himſelf, that he knows ſuch and ſuch matters, of which others are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant: No, but he takes a Pleaſure in the Information of others, and heartily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make them as wiſe as himſelf: and whilſt he inſtructs them, he refreſhes his own Notions, and preſerves a Memory of them. And indeed this Furniture of Souls i like that of Houſes, if it be kept cloſe and unuſed, it grows mouldy, and Moth or Ruſt corrupt it: whereas if commonly uſed,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:96861:272"/>
and open to common ſight, it's preſerv'd.</p>
            <p>This is the Sum; An earneſt deſign of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Good we can to other Men, will engage us to ſeek after Knowledg, after the beſt and moſt uſeful; and when we have got it, to communicate it to others, and in all theſe ways increaſes it in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly; To do Good unto all Men, is the way to be truly religious. Religion, or to have a due regard to God, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one of the greateſt Perfections of Man's Mind: It's that wherein we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly excel all the Creatures of this lower World, and is the moſt ſpiritual divine Quality in the Soul of Man. Beſides, it is impoſſible we ſhould be happy without it: for, if it be neceſſary to our Happineſs, that we think truly of, and be rightly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to things in which we are leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary that we have right Apprehenſions of, and be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itting Affections to God, who is offered to our Thoughts ſo often, and with whom we always are, the Knowledg of whom is <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the clearing of this, I will not now ſhew how great a part of Religion doing Good is, becauſe I have already diſcours'd that. But I will ſhew what Influence a Life of univerſal Love and Goodneſs muſt have to make us think well and truly of God, and live in a due regard to him.</p>
            <p>In general therefore, this Life of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and univerſal Good-will helps us to a better, that is, a clearer and more certain
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:96861:273"/>
and ſenſible Knowledg of the Goodneſs of God, and thereby engages us to love him, and truſt in him.</p>
            <p>The Man who in his Diſpoſition and Practice is beneficent, he feels this to be the beſt State of all others; and conſequently will attribute it to him, who is the beſt and happieſt of all Beings.</p>
            <p>He who lays the Foundation of what he believes concerning God in Teſtimony only, his Soul may be filled with Doubts, he may queſtion, whether he rightly underſtands what he reads or hears; at leaſt, he cannot be ſo ſenſibly and fully aſſured of it, as he that builds upon his own Senſe and Feeling.</p>
            <p>Some ſay, and not without very good Reaſon, that none can know what God is, who are not themſelves <hi>Partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</hi> And the Scripture gives Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to this Opinion, in ſuch Paſſages as theſe; <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in Heart; for they ſhall ſee God. Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee God.</hi> Which places imply, that Purity and Holineſs (which is a Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Nature) are the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Qualifications of thoſe that ſhall know God. A Divine Life is a Prerequiſite, a Preparative to Divine Knowledg. And our Saviour tells them, <hi>if they will do God's Will, they ſhall know his Doctrine.</hi> A vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous good Life is certainly the beſt Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and doth moſt diſpoſe the Soul to the Reception of all Truths, but more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of that which concerns God, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Matters.</p>
            <p>

This alſo gives further Credit to that Aſſertion, That moſt or all Mens Opinions of God, are founded in their own Life and Temper. And there's good reaſon it ſhould be ſo: For, generally Men like themſelves, and approve of what they do; and all in their Reaſonings attribute that which they think good to God, who is abſolutely ſo.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the wicked profane Man thinks God like himſelf, and that he doth not deteſt, nor will puniſh Sin, any more than he. Or, if he cannot think thus of God, as it's ſtrange a Man ſhould; then he thinks there is no God. And indeed, Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as well as Reaſon, will teach us; that a wicked Life is the compendious way to Atheiſm. He that lives ill, either thinks there is no God, or thinks falſly of him: for, true Knowledg of God, and a vicious Life, cannot conſiſt any more than Light and Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Again; Others, Men of ſevere, auſtere Humours, and of angry and malicious Tempers, conceive God to be as they are. And the Man of a benign Mind, he accounts Love and Goodneſs the moſt eſſential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of God: which he therefore does, becauſe his own Senſe and Experience, in Conjunction with Reaſon and Scripture, and the Conſent of other Men, aſſure him, paſt all doubt, that this is the beſt Temper, and that no Life can be ſo good as that of Love and Benignity; and thence he firmly concludes this muſt be the Nature, the Life of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="540" facs="tcp:96861:274"/>
This Senſe, as I ſaid, takes away all that Obſcurity and thoſe Doubts which might remain, notwithſtanding all that is revealed in Scripture, or diſcourſed by Reaſon, or reported by other Men. For we might ſuſpect that we miſunderſtood the Text, or that our Reaſon were ſhort, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in Divine Matters, and the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Men leaves room for doubting; but what we feel, we cannot doubt.</p>
            <p>But the Man of Good-will he cannot in the leaſt queſtion, whether the Life of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence</hi> be not the <hi>beſt,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Divine Life.</hi> And this will engage him to give God the Worſhip that's due to him, that is, to love and truſt him. He that knows and feels the Goodneſs of God, he muſt love him and truſt in him; and then, and not till then, is God worſhipped in the Soul, when he is loved and truſted in.</p>
            <p>Particularly, this Man of univerſal Good-will, when he views the Creation of God, and beholds how good he made all Things, and with how great Wiſdom he conducts them all to the end of their Beings, their utmoſt Perfection and chief Excellence.</p>
            <p>More eſpecially, when he conſiders in what Condition and Place God hath ſet Man, to be Lord of this inferior World; how he hath given him an Underſtanding, in the uſe of which he may enjoy God and himſelf, and all things, and may make his Abode here eaſie and delightful to him, and may, by the uſe of his Reaſon, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of himſelf according to the
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:96861:274"/>
Rules of Vertue, raiſe himſelf above the Calamities of this State, and may ſerve himſelf and his Happineſs of all that befals him; may make the moſt unhappy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he can be in, ſerviceable to his beſt Intereſts. When he conſiders all theſe Wonders of Goodneſs that appear in the Creation and Providence of God, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores this great Benefactor, and praiſes the great Creator, and Preſerver, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World.</p>
            <p>And when he further conſiders thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing Paſſages of Divine Goodneſs in the Redemption of the World by Chriſt, and ſees the Good that hath come to Men by that miraculous Incarnation of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> by his Life and Death, his Doctrine and his Works; and the great Good that was deſign'd, and how God is never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to do all, that on his part is to be done for the attaining it, this fills him with Love and Wonder, and makes him break forth in Praiſes of the Divine Philanthropy.</p>
            <p>And when this good Man is endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Good and Welfare of others, but finds his Attempts unſucceſsful, and his Power too ſhort, that he cannot do the Good he deſires, then doth he ſend out his earneſt Longings to Heaven, that Almighty Power would ſupply his Defects, and do that Good to the World, which he would, but cannot.</p>
            <p>God is not by ſuch an one call'd upon to deſtroy, but mend the World. He doth not pray for <hi>Fire from Heaven,</hi> to conſume
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:96861:275"/>
them that oppoſe him, but for the good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to convince and change them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God is not then worſhipped, when he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to aſſiſt <hi>bitter Zeal</hi> and Anger, and to execute the Deſigns of Malice and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty: No, then God is worſhipped, and truly repreſented, when we ſeek to him, and depend on him for help in carrying on good and charitable Deſigns, in being univerſally uſeful and beneficial: For, then we ſhew that we think him benign and kind, and we do profeſs by this our Perſwaſion, that 'tis his Deſign and great Work to do Good to the World. And this is the trueſt and moſt honourable Repreſentation of God, and the beſt Worſhip we can give him. No Fear or Horrour is ſuch an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, as he will accept and own, or look on himſelf as honoured, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily repreſented by: No, the Devils <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and tremble;</hi> but they that believe and love, are the true Worſhippers, ſuch as God is pleaſed with.</p>
            <p>In ſhort: Nothing makes a Man ſo tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religious, as a through Belief and Senſe of the Goodneſs of God; and nothing ſo fully aſſures him that God is good in general, and will be ſo to him in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as being himſelf good and loving: For this aſſures him, it is the beſt Life that can be lived, and muſt therefore be the Life of God. And it is natural for all Men to expect to be dealt with themſelves, as they deal with others, and that if they be <hi>merciful, they ſhall obtain Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="543" facs="tcp:96861:275"/>
I have ſhewn, that to do Good to all Men, is the way to make Men themſelves Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. I add, it is the way to make others ſo too. This is the way to adorn the Doctrine of our Saviour, to honour our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to make Men entertain the Goſpel heartily, when the Profeſſors of it are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally beneficent and good; when they ſee them juſt and charitable, hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and liberal, and communicative in all good things.</p>
            <p>Prayers and Praiſes, Retirement and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, then are reverenced, when they go attended with a great retinue of good Works: but when Piety appears alone, it's no other than a Ghoſt and Specter that affrights and amazes; and when it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Injuſtice and Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with Inhumanity and ſordid filthy Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, then is it blaſphem'd and evil ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And Men are afraid to entertain that Religion which keeps ſo ill Company. And if theſe be the Effects of Praying and Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of Solitarineſs and Reading, to make Men moroſe and ill-natur'd, and rigorous Exactors of all Punctilio's of Duty, and ſevere Puniſhers of every little Offence, and ſtingy, ſelfiſh and inconverſible, they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lee from it.</p>
            <p>If they that worſhip God, have no regard for Men; if that Zeal which flames up to Heaven, ſet this lower World on fire, and fill it with Smoak, all Men will be afraid of it, and uſe all Arts to quench it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="544" facs="tcp:96861:276"/>
But on the other hand, when we ſee Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty toward God, and Charity toward Men, go hand in hand; when they that ſay, they love God, love Man alſo; and they that live in <hi>Communion with the Father and the Son,</hi> live alſo in Fellowſhip with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; when they that ask Pardon of God for their own Faults, forgive other Mens toward them, and are condeſcending, and meek, and patient, and communicative to their Fellow-Creatures, as they deſire God ſhould be to them; and becauſe they pray he would be thus to them, are therefore more ſo to others: then do they win others to their Profeſſion, by their good Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bring in many Proſelytes to their Religion.</p>
            <p>For, it is not Names and Profeſſions, not Formalities and Shews, not Opinions and Phraſes, not ſingular Conceits and uncommon Practices, that will commend us to God, or our Religion to Men: but Good Works and Kindneſs, to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative and loving: theſe things will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in them an Eſteem of our Profeſſion, and give a Luſtre to the Religion we own.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, Religion is like an excellent Diamond, well ſet; but in the other, it is a Diamond in a Dunghil. When Men <hi>ſee</hi> and feel <hi>our good Works, then do they glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how Religion, and a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to God, is promoted by this Temper of Univerſal Love and Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="545" facs="tcp:96861:276"/>
Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To be good to all hath a great Influence on us to make us Vertuous. An univerſal Benevolence is a Spring from whence all the Streams of Vertue run forth, which gives them both beginning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and increaſe.</p>
            <p>In general, this will make us both active and moderate. It will both engage us to action, and keep us within due Bounds, that we ſhall neither do too little nor too much.</p>
            <p>Some of the Principal Cauſes, why Men do not practiſe Vertue, are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That they are ſluggiſh and unactive, not quickned by any Affection. Or,</item>
               <item>2. They are overborn with the violent aſſaults of evil Paſſions, not governed by Love, as Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</item>
               <item>3. Their, Love is particular and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now where an univerſal Good-will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, it removes all theſe Obſtacles, and,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Makes us active and diligent in all ways of doing Good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It regulates all the other Paſſions, and ſuffers them not to exceed their Bounds: that is, they are always made to ſerve its deſigns. Both Anger and Hatred it ſelf are in order to doing Good. And Men that live by this Principle, do not do any Evil for it ſelf, but as it conduces to ſome greater Good. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſets Love at liberty from thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, which by being too particular, it was under before: And ſo prevents thoſe
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:96861:277"/>
numberleſs Vices and Immoralities, which ariſe from a ſelfiſh and too contracted Love. I think moſt of our Miſcarriages in Life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an undue Preference of our ſelves, and an unequal conſidering other Men's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; and the way to rid our ſelves of them, is to follow the Apoſtle's Counſel; <hi>not only to mind our own things, but alſo the things of others,</hi> and here, <hi>to do good to all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This gives that greatneſs and largeneſs of Mind, in which true Generoſity and brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Spirit does conſiſt. This Lover of the World, goes on ſteadily in his way of well-doing, and is not ſtopp'd by Injuries or Affronts, nor reduced by particular Reſpects. His mind is not only taken up with his own particular Concerns, but he has regard to his Brethren, and his Affection makes him call not only the Diſciples of Chriſt, but all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> by this Name.</p>
            <p>And this is Generoſity and Nobleneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to paſs by Offences, and pardon Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to requite Evil with Good. And is not that a great Mind which embraces the World in its Arms, and takes the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe into its Boſom? This is Divine and God-like.</p>
            <p>Particularly, There is ſcarce any Vertue, but univerſal Beneficence doth one way or other beget or increaſe it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No Man can be wiſe and prudent who doth not take into his Conſideration the Community: and he that does and intends the Good of Mankind, ſteers a Courſe directly
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:96861:277"/>
betwixt Folly and Miſchievous Cunning. He is neither amongſt thoſe that have none, or Evil, or but little petty Deſigns. No, this Man hath propoſed to himſelf one, and that an excellent good and great end, the Good of Mankind, and he takes the proper fit means for the attaining it, to do as much as he can. Thus available is doing <hi>Good to all,</hi> to Prudence. Beſides; this Practice will give a Man a great inſight into particular Mens affairs, and an underſtanding of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things and circumſtances, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and will much contribute to Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prudent Determination. And;</p>
            <p n="2">2. Juſtice is no leſs beholden to it. It's impoſſible that Man ſhould be Juſt, who doth not intend other Mens Good as well as his own, and all Mens as well as ſome, and moſt to thoſe that are beſt. But where the Hand that's ſtretch'd out to all, holds the Ballance, there probably will be no Deceit in the Weight; it will not give advantage to one ſcale wherein his own or Friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns are, but that wherein the Publick is, will certainly out-weigh with him.</p>
            <p>That Man who is bent on doing Good to the World, will be Juſt; for all Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice is founded on preference of private Reſpects before the publick Good. Let Men be Publick-ſpirited, and aim at the good State of the Community, and they are antidoted againſt Injuſtice. Thoſe that regard other Mens Concerns as well as their own, will not advance themſelves upon their Ruins, nor graſp at all, and leave
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:96861:278"/>
nothing for their Neighbour, but weigh his Conveniences as well as their own: and they that conſider the Publick, and deſign the welfare of Mankind, will not violate thoſe Rules, that are ſo neceſſary to Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the order of the World.</p>
            <p>This Man that carries Mankind in his thoughts, and hath Good-will for every one, cannot be unjuſt to any, cannot defraud or circumvent, or do any thing that's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to them, or the Publick. He is not biaſs'd by ſelf-Intereſt, nor will he heap his favours upon his Kindred, whilſt Men of greater Merit ſtarve. I do not ſay, that he hath no regard for his Relations, or that he is more kind to Strangers than to his Acquaintance and Friends; for that is a fooliſh Niceneſs, and a piece of unnatural Policy, which the Man of univerſal Good-will cannot be obnoxious to. But the beſt and moſt uſeful Man, whether a-Kin to him or not, ſhall be preferred by him. He that can be kind to all, cannot but be juſt to all.</p>
            <p>I cannot better repreſent this Man, than by thoſe Motions which the late Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers attribute to the Earth; it moves ever both about its own Axis, and in the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Circle, and from hence come the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Day and Night, Summer and Winter, to the ſeveral Inhabitants thereof: Thus the Good-man moves on his own Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, and yet round the Ecliptick, aims at the good of the World as well as his own; and he that doth ſo, cannot be Unjuſt.</p>
            <p>

            <p>I underſtand here by Juſtice alſo that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which is ſometimes oppoſed to it in common Speech; but is really the ſame thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where this Principle is entertain'd and obſerved, it muſt neceſſarily inſpire that Man with Courage and great Valour.</p>
            <p>There are two things which ordinarily make the Puſillanimous Valiant. <hi>Firſt,</hi> when they are engaged in a good Cauſe. <hi>2dly,</hi> when they are joyn'd with great Aids. Both theſe concur here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Man, that is ever on deſign of doing Good to the Univerſe, hath a good Cauſe, and he knows it. He is aſſured he is doing well, and that which will juſtifie it ſelf to every Impartial Conſiderer. He himſelf cannot have the leaſt ſcruple about what he doth; nor can any other Man juſtly, or with any colour of Reaſon, tax him, who is on ſuch publick Service. He that can ſay he is doing Good to the Community, and
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:96861:279"/>
that this is the buſineſs of this Life, he hath prevented all Calumny, and is as blamleſs as harmleſs. And when he conſiders how clear his own Deſigns are; how accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Actions, this will make him encounter dangers and difficulties, and aſſault all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that would hinder him from effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he aims at. He thinks with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that if it were his own private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns only that ingag'd him, or ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intereſt that he ſerv'd, then others might have ſome Plea to oppoſe; but when he intends the Good of Mankind, and in the good Offices he doth to particular Men, is ſwayed by a reſpect to the Publick, he knows none can have a better, a more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable and commendable Employment, Beſides this,</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath good aſſurance of Aſſiſtance, and he ſhall be enabled to overcome the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he meets with. He hath God, and all the good Beings in the World, to take his Part; it's the deſign of infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do Good to Mankind; it is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Bleſſed Angels, to ſerve the great Intereſts of Man's Happineſs. The Bleſſed Jeſus, to whom <hi>all Power in Heaven and Earth is given,</hi> was, whilſt he was here on Earth, and is, now in the State of his Exaltation, carrying on the grand deſign of Man's Happineſs. Nay, there is that in every Man, that is not degenerated into a Devil, that will take part and joyn in with him, who is bent to be an univerſal Benefactor. For, who can ſet themſelves
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:96861:279"/>
without reluctance againſt him, who hath none other Deſign but to <hi>do Good to All?</hi> Nay rather, how is he the Object of every Man's Care? how ſafe is his Condition?</p>
            <p>It is true, there are too many in the World, who are acted by a Spirit of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and Malice, who are ſelfiſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, who regard not others, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only: But what can theſe do againſt God and Nature, and all thoſe innumerable Miniſters of his, that are ready to do the Pleaſure of his Goodneſs? The Man of general Good-will, if his Eyes be opened, muſt ſay, that <hi>more are they that are with him, than thoſe that are againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, as I have ſaid, this Principle of univerſal Beneficence gives ſuch a Greatneſs of Mind to him that is acted by it, that he ſlights, and ſcorns, and makes nothing of all the little Difficulties and Dangers that he can conflict with. His Soul is ſo taken up with the greatneſs of his own Deſign, and is carried out with ſo much earneſtneſs in purſuit after it, that all the Things that might daunt or diſcourage him, make no Impreſſion of Fear on him at all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Principle, where it rules, muſt certainly reſtrain all Intemperance: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will ſo much employ and buſy a Man, that he cannot be vacant enough for thoſe Extravagancies. No Man is intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but he is firſt idle. Now he that hath entertain'd ſo univerſally an active Principle, as this of Good-will to All, he cannot ſpare Hours to throw away in intemperate Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:96861:280"/>
which he ſees no way conduce to his End. Nay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. He will perceive them quite oppoſite and contrary to his End: For, both Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Reaſon will tell him, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever indulges himſelf in exceſs of bodily Pleaſures, he indiſpoſes, he diſables himſelf from doing Good. He that hath gorged himſelf with Meat, that hath inflamed his Blood with Drinking, or hath wallow'd in any other bodily Pleaſures, how careleſs is he of other Mens Concerns, indeed of his own, of any thing? <hi>They drink Wine in Bowls, and forget the Afflictions of</hi> Joſeph. And how impotent and unable is he to do the good Offices which he may have ſome deſire to do? He hath not the uſe of either Mind or Body, they are both diſabled from diſcharging their Functions. Nor indeed is it poſſible he ſhould; for, by Luxury and Softneſs, and Exceſſes of corporeal Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, the Soul is made careleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, inordinate in its Deſires, and impatient of the leaſt Difficulty and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and the Body is rendred weak and feeble through want of Exerciſe, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn concerning the four, commonly called Cardinal Virtues, how they are befriended by this great Principle of doing Good to all. And every one will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that Dependance which moſt of the other Virtues have on it, and how much it contributes to their Being and Growth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="553" facs="tcp:96861:280"/>
This Man of univerſal Good will, how full of Humanity and Courteſy is he even to Strangers, and thoſe he knows not? What hearty Civility, and real Kindneſs doth he expreſs to thoſe that oppoſe his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, nay, that intend him Miſchief? How gladly doth he pardon Injuries, and receive a repenting Enemy into his Boſom? How willing, nay, forward is he to lend to the Borrower? to give to the Indigent? And what he gives is from a liberal Hand, and a bountiful Mind; no grudging, no ſparing appears in his Communications. He is as willing to take care of the Conveniences, as to relieve the Neceſſities of others; hath not only ſo much Charity as to keep them juſt from ſtarving, but ſo much as will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to endeavour to make them happy.</p>
            <p>And then for the leſſer Offices, that are the Graces of Converſation, and make it pleaſant, they derive from the ſame Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: For he, and he alone, that is ſet on doing Good to All, will be affable, and of eaſy Addreſs by all.</p>
            <p>He will not fail in giving all Expreſſions of Civility that are proper and natural; for the artificial and exceſſive, the Effects of Vanity and Hypocriſy, he uſes them not. He hath the Civility of a Courtier, and the Heartineſs of a Friend. In ſhort, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and Behavior, and Words to all, are ſuch as you may read in them real Good-will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="554" facs="tcp:96861:281"/>
I add only two more: This Man is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meek.</p>
            <p>The true Cauſe, as well as the Effect and Conſequence of moſt Mens Pride, is, that they conſider few or none beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The proud Man therefore loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too much, becauſe he loves not other Men at all: Whereas the Man who lives under the Power of this Principle, he values other Mens Merits as well as his own, and deſires they may have the Praiſe due to them, and doth not think himſelf diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, when another is commended; or if by Accident that come to paſs, he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, becauſe it's for the Good of the Man that is worthy, and of Mankind; and he can be content to ſacrifice his own Credit to the Welfare of other Men, and the Publick.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, where a Man loves others, he deſires that for them, which he doth for himſelf; and conſequently, that they may have the Honour done them which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as he would not be debarr'd of the Praiſe he merits.</p>
            <p>And for Meekneſs: This <hi>Love covers a Multitude of Faults,</hi> and ſo maketh thoſe not to be which are; ſo far is it from multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and magnifying them, from increaſing their Numbers and Aggravations. It doth not make Faults where they are not; or where they are, doth not make them worſe; doth not call a little Wart, a Wen: but rather where they can be extenuated, leſſens them; and conſiders which are the
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:96861:281"/>
Miſcarriages of ſurprized Infirmity, and unwilling Miſtake, and diſtinguiſhes between them and others.</p>
            <p>Nor is he forward to take Vengeance, or eager to puniſh, but is a Man of Long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and Forbearance, and will never puniſh but when it is the likelieſt and almoſt only way to Amendment.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewn how much the Principle of univerſal Beneficence conduces to Knowledg, Religion and Vertue. I now proceed to ſhew, how very available it is to our acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and keeping the reſt of thoſe good Things that make up the Happineſs of Man.</p>
            <p>And none that conſiders how eſſential do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good is to the Religion of Chriſt, and how neceſſary to the Happineſs of Man, will wonder that I In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly; The next of thoſe good Things I mention'd, which are in the Soul, are <hi>Quiet</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity, Joy</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> which I therefore join together in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, becauſe they are not often parted in Nature, and their Oppoſits go under the ſame Name of Trouble; and becauſe where they are as they ſhould be, they qualify one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: For, that is a good and deſirable Quiet, which is in order <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Again, The Mind of Man may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Joy, beyond the Bounds which Nature and Convenience have ſet, and ſo as to indiſpoſe it for doing that Good to it ſelf or others it might do. But when thoſe two concur and conſiſt together, that is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent State indeed; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> then a gentle Wind fills the Sails, and doth not raiſe the Waves, the Soul is then active and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate.</p>
            <p>And this State of Joy and Peace is the beſt State of which Souls are capable; 'tis the Crown of all our Works, the natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our Labours; and if our Actions be vertuous, 'tis a ſure Reward: It is the End and Conſummation of all, it is the Fruit and Flower that grows on them all.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall endeavour to ſhew how much the Principle of univerſal Goodneſs, where it's practis'd, and become a Temper, contributes to the Quiet and Pleaſure of Souls.</p>

            <p>And if he be deſirous of Revenge, how fearful is he to take it? And yet how impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient till it be had? And how reſtleſs when he hath it, for fear of a Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aliation?</p>
            <p>And the Man of immoderate unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Deſires, is tormented before they are
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:96861:283"/>
accompliſhed; and when they are, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied and diſappointed. The Senſualiſt his Expectations are great, his Enjoyments next to nothing, and both full of Trouble; the firſt of a Delay, the ſecond of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat.</p>
            <p>The Ambitious Man is vex'd to the Soul, that others do not make that account of him that he doth of himſelf; that they do not eſteem him as much as he would have them, much more perhaps than he doth deſerve, and many times, than he knows he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. Tho ſome, tho many honour him, if any one caſt a ſlight on him, he cannot bear it. This great little Man, that is ſo big in Conceit, and ſo ſmall in Truth; ſo little in other Mens Opinions, and ſo great in his own, can never be at reſt, becauſe there can be no agreement betwixt his Thoughts and Things, betwixt his and other Men. He doth not think of himſelf as he is, nor will others think as he doth: He can never have his Wiſhes, and his Deſires are impoſſible, and can never be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
            <p>And the ſame or greater is the Trouble of the Covetous; that poor rich Man is in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Diſquiet. He is infinitely ſollicitous to get, and as anxious to keep. He is anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to have, and fearful to loſe; and being rack'd betwixt Deſire and Fear, he enjoys nothing. He ſeeks for Riches, when he hath them; and ſeeks endleſly, becauſe tho he finds what he ſought, he knows it not; nor doth he think himſelf rich, tho
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:96861:283"/>
he be. And 'tis all one as to Enjoyment, whether a Man have a ſmall Eſtate, or a poor Mind; whether he be poor, or conceit he is ſo: therefore is it, that he hath, and hath not; that he wants what he hath.</p>
            <p>Thus is he diſtracted betwixt getting and keeping. And certainly infinite are the Cares and Anxieties that diſquiet theſe Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny Souls. 1 Tim. 6. 10. <hi>For the Love of Money is the Root of all Evil, which while ſome have coveted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced themſelves through with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sorrows;</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>transfixerunt.</hi> And are not theſe three the great Incendiaries of the World, and the Troublers of our Peace, both within and without?</p>
            <p>But laſtly; The Remorſe and Anguiſh that ariſes from Conſcience of Sin, when they have at any time been tranſported by the Rage of Anger, or Madneſs, or Envy, or by unſatiable Deſires of Eſteem, or Wealth, or Pleaſure, ſo as to imbrue their hands in the Blood of ſome harmleſs <hi>Abel</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> or take away honeſt <hi>Naboth's</hi> Vineyard: When they have maliciouſly belied a blameleſs <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or ſome way or other have irreparably and undeſervedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured their innocent Neighbour; then is it that they feel the ſharp Stings of an unquiet Conſcience; then are they frighted with Ghoſts and Specters, and laſh'd with Furies, and gaſh'd with the deep Wounds of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſing Thoughts.</p>
            <p>And theſe are certainly the moſt inward and piercing, the moſt inſupportable of all
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:96861:284"/>
the Sorrows of which the Mind of Man is capable.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee what an Antidote univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Good-will is, to preſerve us from theſe that are the worſt of Diſeaſes. <hi>Charity,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>envies not;</hi> it is not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that Men are ſo well, but deſirous they ſhould be better and happier than they are. And the Reaſon of this follows; for us ſaid, <hi>She ſeeks not her own;</hi> that is, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor chiefly, nor in oppoſition to the Concerns of all others. The charitable Man will take care to be innocent; none ſhall ever be wrong'd by him, nor ſhall any ſuffer, or be worſe by what he doth, where that is not neceſſary to publick Good.</p>
            <p>Nor, ſecondly, doth he in the firſt place intend himſelf; nor doth his own ſingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, in his Eſteem, outweigh the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of many, but he always gives the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict for the Community, againſt a private, tho it be his own Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Nor, thirdly, doth he much leſs only and wholly deſign himſelf; he knows not how to confine his Thoughts and Deſires to ſo narrow a Compaſs, but his Goodneſs hath enlarged his Soul, and ſtretch'd it forth as far as there is any Being. And where Love hath taken poſſeſſion of any Man, it conſtrains him to wiſh well, and <hi>do Good to All;</hi> ſo that where this Plant of God's planting grows, thoſe Roots of Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Envy and Malice, are pluck'd up, and caſt out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="561" facs="tcp:96861:284"/>
Where this Divine Temper of Benignity and Beneficence is, Envy and Malice can have no place. Where a Man is ſo outed of himſelf, and all particular and private Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Reſpects are brought into due Order, and a fit Compliance with the more publick and univerſal; there is no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for envious Diſcontents, or malicious Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>When this Spirit and Power of the bleſſed Jeſus, the Son of God, appears, thoſe Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Fiends, thoſe evil Spirits vaniſh, and flie away, as the Shadows of the Night do before the Brightneſs of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Anger, tho it may ſometimes by ſurprize enter into the loving Soul, yet it cannot ſtay there. This mighty Power of God, the Spirit of Benignity, commands theſe Winds and Storms, and bids them obey, and they are quickly calm and ſtill, and the Face of the Soul is preſently ſmooth and clear again. This Cordial ſoon allay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Feveriſh Heats of that Paſſion, and quenches the Violence of a <hi>Fire,</hi> that was kindled in <hi>Hell,</hi> and would conſume the World.</p>
            <p>We read of ſome Evil-Spirits, that would caſt thoſe into the Fire that were poſſeſs'd of them: Such is Anger alſo; it caſts into the Fire, and makes them foam, and tears them in whom it is. But this <hi>Power of God,</hi> this great Love, caſts it out alſo. When <hi>David, the Love that's after God's own Heart,</hi> plays on his Harp before <hi>Saul,</hi> the <hi>Evil-Spirit will go from him.</hi> Thus Goodneſs eaſeth the Soul of that Vexation which ariſes from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="562" facs="tcp:96861:285"/>
Beſides; It ſuffers no plotting of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, nor Contrivances of retaliating Evil for Evil; and ſo prevents ſome of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt violent Diſturbances, which we are ſubject to.</p>
            <p>And how accurately well doth it bound and moderate thoſe Deſires, which, when they are irregular, are the Cauſes of ſo great Diſquiet? For, our Love to others, will make us deſire their Honour, as well as our own. And where we love all, and have an Affection for the Publick, we ſhall deſire no more than we deſerve; we ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that other Men ſhould be ſo far im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on, as to think us better than indeed we are. We cannot be ſo unjuſt, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Reward without Merit, and Praiſe where it is not due.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity is not puffed up,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 4. and therefore frees a Man's Mind from all the Tortures that ambitious Spirits lie under. This makes a Man not diſpleas'd that other Men are prais'd, and himſelf not; nay, tho they have more, and he leſs than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, yet he is very well ſatisfied, becauſe his own, and the Approbation of a few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges, is ſufficient to ſupport him: whereas Men of leſs Worth, have need of greater Applauſe to bear up their Minds, and to bring them into Requeſt, and enable them to do Good.</p>
            <p>And how perfectly doth this Principle ſubdue and regulate all the Appetites of corporeal Pleaſure? He that is acted by univerſal Love, cannot go to a forbidden
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:96861:285"/>
Bed; for he will not draw one whom he loves into Sin; he will not deprive them of the laſting Pleaſures of Innocence and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity. He will not violate the Orders of all the Civilized World, which have been from the beginning of Time, which for the ſake of the Publick, for Poſterity, as well as the preſent Generation, ought to be inviolably obſerved. He will not eat nor drink more than is good for him, as for other Reaſons, ſo leſt others ſhould want that which is good for them.</p>
            <p>Again; This univerſal Love, by enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging us to do all the Good we can, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all inordinate Love of Money. We ſhall not now deſire more than we can and will uſe for the advantage of others, as well as our ſelves. And when it is thus with us, we ſhall not graſp at all we could get, and we ſhall uſe what we do get. And where we are thus minded, we have freed our ſelves from that infinite Carking and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety, which an inordinate Deſire of Riches cauſes.</p>
            <p>Laſtly; This will in many caſes prevent the bittereſt Remorſe for Sins, by preventing the Sins themſelves, as I have ſhewed. For, the good Man will not be unjuſt or unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he cannot oppreſs or cozen, falſly or needleſsly accuſe, will not violate the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, prejudice the Health, much leſs take away the Life of any: and thus ſecures himſelf from thoſe Terrors of Conſcience, which follow ſuch Wickedneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="564" facs="tcp:96861:286"/>
And where we are ſurprized, and do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly miſ-behave our ſelves towards God; if we be indeed charitable and loving towards Men, we can then pray that God would, and hope that he will <hi>forgive us as we do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn how this univerſal Beneficence frees us from Trouble and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs. And now I will briefly ſhew how it brings us Pleaſure as well as Quiet.</p>
            <p>By Pleaſure I here underſtand that Joy which is caus'd in the Soul, by an Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion or Senſe of Good. Now, where this Principle is become natural to us, and we act from it, and according to it, it muſt neceſſarily be a Spring of Delight to us. How pleaſant and joyful muſt the Mind of that Man be, which is govern'd by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Love? As much Good as there is in the World, ſo much cauſe of Pleaſure is there to them. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is ſet at Liberty from contracted Selfiſhneſs; every Man is now to him, as he is to himſelf, and other Mens Concerns are as his own: ſo that he now rejoyces in their Welfare, and is heartily glad at the Good which befals them. So much is his Joy greater now, than it was when he liv'd to himſelf; for then he was pleas'd with his own private Advantages, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps repin'd, or at leaſt was unconcern'd at other Mens; whereas now he is delighted to ſee it go well with any Man in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="565" facs="tcp:96861:286"/>
Thus he honeſtly and innocently enjoys the Good of others, without depriving them of any; gathers of the Honey-dew, without robbing the Flower of its own Sweetneſs. As much Good then as there is, and as he can ſee in the World (and there is very much, for <hi>the Mercy of God is over all his Works;</hi> and he that will conſider things, may diſcover it) ſo much cauſe of Gladneſs hath this good Man. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The infinite Love and Goodneſs of God, is an inexhauſtible Fountain of Joy to the good Man: For, tho he ſees many things much amiſs, and a great deal of Evil in the World; tho he ſees poor Man at a great diſtance from his Happineſs, and <hi>the whole World lying in Wickedneſs:</hi> yet he alſo ſees infinite Goodneſs at work, and that it has done very much in order to Man's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and doubts not but in ſome ways which he is ignorant of, all the ends of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs will be accompliſh'd at laſt.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed before, that this Goodneſs of Temper helps us to an aſſured Knowledg of the Goodneſs of God. We may alſo refer the two fore-going Particulars to the Object of Benevolence. If there be ſo great Pleaſure in loving one or two, or a few, how great is that which ariſes from an univerſal Good-will, a Love to all Men?</p>
            <p>Thirdly; The good Man hath Pleaſure as concerning himſelf, from his Beneficence to others: and it is ſuch a Pleaſure as hath many Advantages above moſt others. For,</p>
            <list>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. The Pleaſure that ariſes from a Senſe of our Beneficence, is without any allay or mixture of Pain, and that which is ſo, is pure and in the higheſt degree.</p>
            <p>This cannot be ſaid of moſt other Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the Price of them is much abated, by the Pains that accompany them. The more corporeal and groſs they are, the more they have of this Dreſs. This is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation that almoſt only belongs to the Pleaſure that ariſes from vertuous Practices; and yet not any, not all of the other Vertues, can afford ſo great a Delight as this, which is both a Complex of moſt of them, and the End and Conſummation of all. The reſt are but mediate and ſubordinate Vertues, this is ultimate and final.</p>
            <p>When a Man is in the exerciſe of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Love, of Charity and Good-will, he
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:96861:287"/>
is as good, and as great and happy as he can be, then is all finiſhed.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Pleaſure is in Love: Now when Love is univerſal, and in exerciſe, Pleaſure keeps proportion with it, and is as great as it can be; for it is as large as its Object, and therefore the Pleaſure that ariſes from it muſt needs be very great.</p>
            <p>The beſt Faculty is now exerciſed about its proper Object; and 'tis generally ſaid, that all Pleaſure conſiſts in the Congruity of the Object and Faculty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſtinguiſh this Pleaſure according to the three Differences of Time which its Cauſe hath, and we ſhall find it in all theſe to be extraordinary.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) For the paſt. Memory, tho it be but a languiſhing Senſe, and the <hi>Ideas</hi> are not near ſo lively as when they were firſt impreſt; yet the Remembrance of having done good Offices, gives a very ſenſible and lively Pleaſure; and it is a great Content to the Soul, when it calls to mind any Acts of Beneficence, and that it did ſuch Actions for which others were the better.</p>
            <p>To remember that I have relieved a Man in his Neceſſities, or added to his Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, eas'd his Pain, or cured his Diſeaſe, vindicated his Reputation, preſerved his Life, inſtructed his Ignorance, removed his Miſtakes, ſatisfied his Doubts, confirmed his Reſolutions, moderated his Affections; the Remembrance of this, that I have been inſtrumental in ſuch good Offices, will be very pleaſant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="568" facs="tcp:96861:288"/>
Indeed a Man is more pleaſed with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Good he hath done to others, than of that which he hath done himſelf.</p>
            <p>And I am well aſſured, that when we come to die, it will be a very great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, if we can think that none can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us for doing them Injury, and if others will teſtify that we have been kind and good to them.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As to the Preſent. A Man that is in the Exerciſe of Goodneſs, hath the pleaſant Senſation of the Health and good Plight of his Soul. He feels himſelf, his Mind as well as Body, in an excellent State. Some think, that Senſe of Health is the greateſt Pleaſure of Man; and this is the Pleaſure of a double Health.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Future. He that feels he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to ſo much, cannot but hope that what is yet behind ſhall be added; and that he ſhall continue in thoſe ways to the end, which are ſo infinitely pleaſant to him; that he ſhall aſcend to that Heaven, which is come down to him, and is in him; that is, that he ſhall continue the Exerciſe of that Love in Eternity, which he hath begun in Time. And this he hopes for, becauſe it is very natural, and becauſe this Senſe of the Excellency of his own Goodneſs and Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, aſſures him that God is good, and will do good to them that are ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When Man complies with the grand Deſign of Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> to promote the Happineſs of Mankind, and co-operates
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:96861:288"/>
with natural Cauſes, which have a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſubſerviency to the Good of the Generality, he is then doing Acts of Kindneſs and Benignity; and when he doth theſe, he not only refreſhes other Men, but lets in Streams of Pleaſure to his own Soul.</p>
            <p>And theſe Pleaſures which derive from ſuch a Spring, muſt be,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Sure; for they depend on very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cauſes, and ſuch as act naturally, and almoſt neceſſarily. All the Uncertainty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from his own Mutability; and yet he is under an Engagement, that is as powerful to determine him as the Nature of Man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; that is, he perceives a great and ſenſible Pleaſure in the Exerciſe of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and either this will determine him to ſuch Acts, or nothing can. Whilſt Man perſeveres in doing Good, his Pleaſure muſt remain; and he will perſevere, whilſt he conſiders God and the World, <hi>i. e.</hi> whilſt he uſes his Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Near. They are in and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and do not ſo much depend on Things without us, but on the Uſe of our ſelves Principally. They are always with us; if we do but reflect on our own Acts, (which we cannot chuſe but do) we ſhall not fail of Pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By reaſon of its Duration. It is, 1. Continued; 2. Laſting.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) A Pleaſure that ariſes from ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cauſes, and that are ſo near to us, muſt needs be continual, and without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:96861:289"/>
That which is near and within a Man, muſt certainly be more taken notice of, than things at a diſtance; ſuch are his own Actions, and the Principles of them; he cannot chuſe but he muſt obſerve them. And as often as he is conſcious of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent Temper, and Acts of Goodneſs and Kindneſs, he feels an overflowing Joy in his Mind. And if that be his Nature to incline him alway to do Good, he muſt alway be ſenſible of it, that is, his Pleaſure muſt be as interrupted as any thing can be in the Mind of Man.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It is alſo laſting. As long as the Sun is, the Rays will flow from it; and as long as the Soul continues benign and good, and acts from this Principle, ſo long will it continue in this pleaſant Senſe; for, this is an inſeparable Emanation or Property of a benign Soul.</p>
            <p>Other Pleaſures that depend on contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, mutable, external Things, muſt be tranſient and fleeting, and as full of Viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as the Cauſes on which they depend: but theſe, which flow from that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal and incorruptible, will themſelves laſt for ever. As long as the Fountain ſprings, theſe Streams will not fail: and that will not be dried up, for it is fed by the ſecret Aids ſent from the inexhauſtible Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of Goodneſs in God. And will certainly be one of the great Pleaſures of the other State; for the Soul muſt loſe it ſelf, muſt ceaſe to be what now it is, before this Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure can ceaſe. It is one of the greateſt and
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:96861:289"/>
faireſt of thoſe Rivers of Pleaſure which encompaſs Paradiſe, whoſe Waters fail not. How unconceivable is the Delight of Souls, when they are bathing themſelves in theſe Streams? when they are carried on with the greateſt Gales of Good-will to all their Fellow-Creatures? How will they be raviſh'd with their own Countenance, when they behold in it this excellent Grace with which Love hath beautified it? How muſt they be delighted to feel themſelves in ſo good a State, in ſo healthful a Plight?</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Pleaſure is abſolutely good. There are ſome Pleaſures that are hurtful. The Soul may too much be taken with low and ſenſual Delights, ſo as to neglect thoſe that are higher and better. There are Pleaſures of Sin, that are Baits to catch unwary Souls, and will enſnare them in thoſe Practices which will make them miſerable.</p>
            <p>But behold, the Pleaſures which ariſe from Beneficence are abſolutely good, have no mixture of evil, are perfectly innocent, and greatly uſeful, do no harm, and much good; for they engage us to repeat thoſe good Works, which bring us in ſo great an Income of Bliſs. Thus they continue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that is the greateſt thing I can ſay of them; for this is that which hath not the Goodneſs of Means only, but of the End alſo.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn how certain a Cauſe of greateſt and moſt exquiſite Pleaſure, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good muſt needs be; ſo as I might
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:96861:290"/>
hope to engage the greateſt Epicureans to take this Courſe to be happy.</p>
            <p>And now after all this, I dare encounter the Senſualiſt, who ſeeks for Delight from brutiſh Gratifications; or the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous angry Man, who expects to have it from Revenge; or the ſelfiſh and contracted Man, who purſues it in ways of Self-love, and all the Pleaſure he hath is in doing Good to himſelf. To all theſe I can ſhew greater and better, purer and more laſting Pleaſures, in the Exerciſe of an univerſal Love. Here's Pleaſure that will be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freſh and new, no ſatiety, no clogging.</p>
            <p>The Senſualiſt hath the pleaſure of a Brute in his Enjoyments; the malicious Man hath the pleaſure of Divels; the ſelfiſh, of the Sons of Earth: but the Man of Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and unbounded Love, hath the delight of thoſe that are Heaven-born, the Joys of Angels, and partakes of the greateſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God himſelf, for that undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is to <hi>do good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now ſhewn how much the temper and practice of univerſal Goodneſs tends to make us Knowing, Religious, Vertuous, Quiet and Joyful; which are the greateſt and moſt deſirable Perfections of the Soul of Man. But perhaps ſome may ſet a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er value on things leſs excellent, and will be more ſenſible of what concerns their Body, than their Mind, and of that which is without, than that which is within them. Now therefore that I may engage ſuch Men alſo, if it be poſſible, to a Life of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:96861:290"/>
and that I may fully diſcover the manifold Vertues of a benign Nature and Life; I will conſider thoſe alſo that are of leſs Importance, which relate to our Body, and Good-name, and Eſtate, but yet ought to have ſome place in our account. And laſtly, how Inſtrumental this muſt be to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and continue, and confirm Friendſhips, which in all theſe, and the other reſpects before-mentioned, are hugely ſerviceable to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Univerſal Beneficence conduces to long Life. <hi>Pſal. 34. 12. David</hi> asks this Queſtion; <hi>What Man is he! that deſires Life, and loves Days that he may ſee Good?</hi> Not that he thought there were any that did not; but therefore he propoſes this in form of Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the better to excite their attention, and to make us all regard what he would ſay: which is to direct us what Courſe to take, that we may attain our deſire, and that is, 1. <hi>Keep thy Tongue from Evil, and thy Lips from ſpeaking Guile. 2. Depart from Evil, and do Good; ſeek Peace, and purſue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Direction the Scripture gives to preſerve Life, and we find this very paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage cited in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. And that we may be aſſured, that by doing Good is meant Beneficence, ſee how it is brought in there as an Argument againſt <hi>rendring Evil for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> at the 9th Verſe, <hi>Not rendring Evil for Evil, nor Railing for Railing, but contrariwiſe Bleſſing,</hi> &amp;c. and then follows at the tenth Verſe. <hi>For he that will love Life, and ſee good Days,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="574" facs="tcp:96861:291"/>
Reaſon and Experience will ſay the ſame. There are, we all know, two ſorts of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Mans Life, one is within, the other without him. Thoſe within are the Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which as they ariſe from other cauſes, ſo very often (I know not whether I ſhould ſay for the moſt part) ariſe from diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paſſions.</p>
            <p>I know not any better general Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the preventing or curing thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, that ariſe from ill temper of the Blood and other Humours, than to keep the Mind in a benign diſpoſition and willingneſs to do good Offices: For there is a great Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy betwixt Soul and Body; and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and obſervation, ſhews us, that when the Soul is thus affected, it gives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues alacrity and briskneſs to thoſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which both Life and Health con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
            <p>And for thoſe that ariſe from Paſſions, which are contrary to this univerſal good Affection, or proceed from want of it: ſuch as Anger, Malice, Envy, great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and exceſs of Self-love, or a too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and contracted Affection; what ill effects theſe have on our Bodies, and what Diſtempers they cauſe, I leave it to Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Senſe to teſtifie.</p>
            <p>But we are ſure that thoſe ſudden chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Colour, trembling of the Fleſh, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation of the Heart, ſtopping of the Breath, Sighing, Inflaming our Heavineſs, diſtorting of the Face and Eyes, which are ſo often conſequent on thoſe, are very ill
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:96861:291"/>
Symptoms. And the beſt way to prevent them, and all the dangers they threaten us with, is to preſerve in our Minds an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to do good univerſally. For this will extirpate Malice, and deſtroy Envy; it will moderate Anger, and not ſuffer us to be Peeviſh; it will ſet us at liberty from a too particular Affection, and eaſe our Griefs, and thus prevent very many of thoſe Diſeaſes, which we lie under for want of due regulating our Paſſions.</p>
            <p>Nor will this ſeem ſtrange, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Phyſicians, when they adviſe a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for preſerving Health, caution us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Paſſions, that they be kept in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I have before ſhewn, that to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally Benevolent, is the beſt, and perhaps only way to govern them: and if ſo, 'tis evident that it muſt have a great Influence on Life, and that which is the Life of Life, without which Death would be more eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Health.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of Man's Death that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, are Men, or other things, ſuch as infectious Vapours in the Air, Famines, the ill Qualities of his Food, or other ſuch like.</p>
            <p>As for Men, <hi>Tully</hi> tells us, it was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of one <hi>Dicaearchus,</hi> that many more were ſlain by Men, than died by Diſeaſes, or any other way. The truth of my Diſcourſe depends not on the certainty of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture: all that I ſhall infer is, that thoſe great numbers that die by the hands of Men, and before their time come, by this
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:96861:292"/>
means might have had their Lives lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For, if the Law of Univerſal Love were obſerved by all, then Quarrels and Contentions, War and Fighting, Stabbing and Poyſon would have no place.</p>
            <p>But there is no better Preſervative againſt infectious Diſeaſes, than the Vertue and good Diſpoſition of the Mind, of which the Sum is <hi>Benignity.</hi> Therefore Hiſtories tell us, that in that lamentable Plague at <hi>Athens,</hi> which was ſo contagious and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet <hi>Socrates</hi> eſcaped, and this was aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to his Vertue and excellent Diſpoſition in general, particularly to his Temperance, which I have ſhewn how it, as well as all other Vertues, derives from Univerſal Love.</p>
            <p>One obſervation will very much aſſure us of the Truth of what I have ſaid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I will appeal to the experience of every one; it is this, That an unwillingneſs to be doing Good; is for the moſt part, if not always, accompanied with indiſpoſition of Body; and that when we enjoy the beſt Health, we commonly: feel our ſelves in the greateſt diſpoſition to Beneficence. For the Soul and Body, as in other matters, ſo here, mutually operate on each other.</p>
            <p>Whence I infer, That as Benignity and Goodneſs in the Mind, contribute to the Health of the Body; ſo the good plight of the Body, inclines the Soul to Good-will.</p>
            <p>And for the other Perfections of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this temper is not unſerviceable to them: for, where it is, it gives a Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Countenance, which no Power
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:96861:292"/>
of Art can equal. There is a conſtant cheerful Air in the Face of that Man, in whoſe Heart is the Law of Kindneſs, which far exceeds the Beauty of borrowed Colours, or forc'd and counterfeit Smiles.</p>
            <p>And for Strength, this Diſpoſition both gives and continues it. For, tho' ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſions make Men more violent, and impetuous in their aſſaults; yet not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and durable as this affection. And if this Man ſhould not always ſo well aſſault an Enemy, yet he will better defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or Friend, than the Boiſterous, Angry or Malicious Man.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, which is the very uſe of it, and (that for which it was deſigned) the Body is never ſo ſerviceable to the Mind, as when the Soul is acted by Love and Good-will, for then it is moderately active: So that the Soul needs neither reſtrain nor put it forward; whereas in other caſe, the Body is either dull and ſluggiſh, or elſe tranſported with ſo great a Violence, that the Soul cannot regulate its Motions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to our good Name, this can be no way ſo advanced as by univerſal Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Nothing ſo honourable to a Man, as to be a Benefactor. This alone will give him a good, and great, and laſting Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when nothing without it can make him truly Honourable. This is that Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which embalms a Name to Poſterity, and makes the Memory of the Good-man freſh and ſweet, many thouſands of Years after Worms have devoured his Body, and
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:96861:293"/>
a Prodigal fooliſh Son ſpent his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>This Univerſal Benefactor is every where extoll'd and prais'd. When the Ear hears him, it bleſſes him; and when the Eye ſees him, it gives witneſs to him; the young Men hide themſelves when they ſee him, and the Aged riſe up to do him Reverence, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Ch.</hi> 29. Verſ. 8. And why all this? Becauſe, ſays he, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Poor that cryed, the Fatherleſs, and him that had no helper: therefore the Bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me.</p>
            <p>Was not this it which deified ſo many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Heathens, and procured them a Divine Worſhip after they left this Earth, that by their uſeful Inventions and brave Deeds they had been Benefactors to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? Was it not on this account that <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres, Minerva</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> and divers others amongſt them, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed Gods? which Practice of theirs, how vain ſoever, yet affords us this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that to be uſeful to Men, to be a Benefactor to the World is in the Eſteem of Mankind a moſt Divine and God-like quality, and therefore moſt highly Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>For the further eviction of this: Suppoſe a Man endowed with the Gifts of Nature, and bleſt with the Goods of Fortune, and ſtrict in all Religious Obſervances, nay, and punctual in all matters of Juſtice: yet if he be not beneficent and a good Man, one that is benign and loving to others, and
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:96861:293"/>
doth the friendly Offices within his Power, he falls ſhort of that Praiſe, which this one ſingle quality will extort from all that ſee it.</p>
            <p>He that hath a great Eſtate, but not an Heart to uſe it; hath abundance of Wealth, and perhaps himſelf, but none elſe is the better for it. He will neither give to thoſe that want, nor lend to thoſe that would borrow; is not kind to Neighbours, nor hoſpitable to Strangers; racks his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, is unequal to his Servants, and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to his Children; he is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loved and honoured that he is hated and ſcorn'd, and the Object of every ones Indignation.</p>
            <p>Common obſervation tells us, that 'tis not having much, but the uſing what we have, whether much or little, well, which makes us Honourable.</p>
            <p>Search the Records of Antiquity, and ſee if great Poſſeſſions alone ever made their Owners valued whilſt they liv'd, or lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when they died, or honoured by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
            <p>The ſame is true of Power, and Intereſt, and great Places, which are inſtrumental to our Honour no other way, than as they give us opportunities of doing good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For if we through ſelfiſhneſs, or fear and littleneſs of Mind, or Idleneſs, neglect them, and do not do the Good we might, we become infamous, and ſtand like a Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Tree in an Orchard, that neither yields Fruit nor Shadow, nor is of any uſe, but
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:96861:294"/>
only cumbers the Ground, and only takes up the room where another and better might grow.</p>
            <p>The Potent Man that doth ill to all, yet in ſome reſpect hath more of Honour than he that doth good to none: for he, tho he be not lov'd, is fear'd, which argues he's conſidered; but this Man is ſlighted and contemned: The other hath ſomething of Courage in daring to do ill, but this is a puſillanimous Sneak. And 'tis ſuppoſed that he who is afraid to do Good, would do Ill, if he durſt: and that it is the ſame Cowardiſe which keeps him from doing ill Offices, that keeps him from doing Good: ſo that it is not his want of an ill Mind, but of a ſtout Heart, that makes him he is not miſchievous to all, who is beneficial to none, when he wants not Opportunity.</p>
            <p>So far is Power and Intereſt from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Man Honorable, that if it be not in Conjunction with Benevolence; if it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerves the deſigns of Malice, or be not inſtrumental to Good-will, it will be his Reproach and Infamy.</p>
            <p>Farther; Suppoſe a Man rich with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Gifts; let him have a quick and clear Apprehenſion, a faithful Memory, a pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Judgment, a ſubtil Reaſon, a fine Fancy, a nimble Wit, penetrating Sagacity; ſuppoſe him alſo to have attain'd great Learning, that he is a Critick in the Tongues, and very skilful and knowing in all the Arts and Sciences. Wee'l ſuppoſe him alſo by the experience he hath had, and
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:96861:294"/>
obſervations he hath made, to have a deep inſight into the management of Affairs, ſo that he is qualified to give Counſel to a Prince. Let him alſo be as well able to ſpeak as he is to think, and have a free and full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and an eaſy Eloquence.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Man thus accompliſhed by God and Nature, and his own Induſtry; yet if all theſe Perfections be acted by Malice and ill Nature, they make their Owner miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; if not animated by Love and Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, uſeleſs. And whoſoever is either not uſeful, or pernicious and hurtful, cannot be Honourable.</p>
            <p>We hate or fear the Miſchievous, and we ſcorn the uſeleſs Man, but honour nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Man of deſigns and contrivance, and ſubtil devices, if he be malicious, we fear and flee from him.</p>
            <p>The Sons of Knowledg, if they keep it all to themſelves, and will not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, we account them uſeleſs and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. If they vaunt it out of Oſtentation, and upbraid thoſe that have not had the opportunity to ſtudy which themſelves have, we juſtly cenſure them for proud Pedants. Theſe endowments or acquirements will not of themſelves entitle a Man to Honour. It is a benign Diſpoſition, which will uſe them well and to good purpoſes, that makes them commendable, and the Objects of our Praiſe.</p>
            <p>Proceed we farther to a Devotional Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that ingageth us to be ſtrict in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Performances. And that hugely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:96861:295"/>
Man, to be hearty, and ſolemn, and conſtant in the Worſhip of God. Yet even this will not procure us Honour, if not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Beneficence, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by good Works. For, tho' a Man ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter hours and days for Praying and Faſting; tho' he ſpend much time in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Contemplation; tho' he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant at Church, and much in his Cloſet; tho' he miſs not Prayers twice a day, nor Faſting twice a week; tho he faſt as often, and pray as long as the devout <hi>Phariſees,</hi> yet if, like them, he <hi>devour Widows Houſes,</hi> and cat the Bread of Orphans; tho' he <hi>tithe Mint and Cummin,</hi> yet if he <hi>paſs over Truth, and Judgment, and Mercy;</hi> if he that is thus devout towards God, be unjuſt, or but unkind and uncharitable to Men, we look on him as an Impoſtor and a Cheat, we conclude his Devotions to be animal and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and his Religion falſe, the Religion of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> but not that which he taught, who as he went up into the <hi>Mountain</hi> to pray, ſo he <hi>went about doing Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he came down from the Preſence of God, <hi>his Face ſhone,</hi> And we all expect, that Humility and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, that Benignity and Goodneſs ſhould appear in the looks and carriages of thoſe that have been in Converſe with God: That they who have beheld the Glory of God, and confeſs'd their own Vileneſs, who have praiſed and ſought his Goodneſs and Mercy, ſhould themſelves be meek and lowly, compaſſionate and forbearing to their Fellow-Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="583" facs="tcp:96861:295"/>
If they be otherwiſe, if mercileſs and cruel, if peeviſh and froward, if clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and unquiet, if revengeful and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if inhumane and uncivil; we then think that they do not in good earneſt praiſe that in God, which themſelves do not imitate; nor that they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to need Mercy, who will not ſhew it to others. For, it is the Sence of all Men, that he who is truly Religious, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips God as he ought, will alſo do good to Men. Therefore let all ſhew the Truth of their Devotion, by the benignity of their Temper, and the goodneſs of their Lives.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee Religion will not avail to Honour, if ſeparate from Beneſicence and doing Good.</p>
            <p>Nay, even Juſtice it ſelf (tho' nothing can be commendable without it, tho' it lay the Foundation of Praiſe) yet if not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Benignity, it is not ſufficient to entitle a Man to the name of <hi>Juſt.</hi> He doth Good as far as the Law requires, but no further; And ſo we know not whether his Good Works proceed from Nature and Temper, or from external Motives; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Love and a benign diſpoſition, or from Fear, and becauſe he dares not diſobey publick Sanction. For many Mens Juſtice is to be reſolved into their Fear, and neither their Wiſdom, nor their Choice.</p>
            <p>Beſides; if Juſtice be not directed and regulated by Goodneſs, there is no place for Equity; and that is Juſtice in name on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not in reality, which is parted from Equity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="584" facs="tcp:96861:296"/>
In ſum, It is Benignity and Godneſs that keeps Juſtice from degenerating into Sowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Severity, into an inflexible Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, a rigid adherence to Letters and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pexes, to Punctilio's, and Forms and Rules, indeed from becoming the higheſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
            <p>Thus that Juſtice which is ſo eſſential to all honourable Actions, is beholden to Benignity, both for its being, and for its name.</p>
            <p>And now I have ſhewed, that thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which when they are inſtrumental to Beniſicence, ſo much commend a Man, when they are either not uſed, or to ill purpoſes, they are either matter of Reproach, or add nothing to his Honour.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Particular with this ſhort Appeal. Suppoſe, on the other ſide, a good-natur'd beneficent Man, ſtript of moſt of thoſe natural and acquired Perfections and Endowments; he hath little, but uſes and doth good with that he hath; his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is not encreaſed by Learning, nor hath he had much opportunity to improve it by general Obſervations; but the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he hath, he impart, and will not fail, where he can, to counſel thoſe that want it; he can give little Alms, but he throws in his Mites, all he can ſpare, and ſuch as he hath, his Pains, he will freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow.</p>
            <p>His Devotions are not pompous, nor ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, nor long; he cannot ſet apart hours for Prayer; but all his time is ſpent in
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:96861:296"/>
doing the Good that is within his Sphere. Tho' his Goodneſs reach not to God in Heaven; yet it doth to his Creatures.</p>
            <p>He is poor in Eſtate, but rich in good works; is in low place, and hath ſmall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but great Good-will: is ignorant in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and miſtakes in divers matters, but is malicious to none; for tho his Knowledg is bounded, his Charity is unconfined.</p>
            <p>His Addreſſes to God are not taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, but his Viſits to his poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours cannot be hid.</p>
            <p>In ſhort; he that hurts none, and does Good to all; and if he do not do Good, it is for want of Power and Skill, not of Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; this Man is lov'd and valued, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured whilſt he lives, and after death is remembred and praiſed. Whereas the proud and uſeleſs Pedant, the Rich, but Covetous Miſer, the Man of great place, that uſed his Power to do Evil, or did not uſe it in doing good Offices, their names ſhall be forgot, or remembred with ſcorn and infamy.</p>
            <p>Here then is the only way to Honour, to be Beneficent. Would we be eſteem'd whilſt we live, and paiſed when we dye? let us do Good. Let our own Works praiſe us, and then Men will not be ſilent.</p>
            <p>The Univerſal Benefactor, as his name is written in Heaven, ſo it ſhall be regiſtred in the Rolls of Fame here on Earth, and both the preſent and future Ages will call him Bleſſed.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="586" facs="tcp:96861:297"/>
3. I will endeavour to ſhew, that to do Good, is the way to make us Rich.</p>
            <p>There are too many in the World, who think that Man's <hi>Life conſiſts in the abundance of the things he poſſeſſes.</hi> To be Rich, is in their account the chief Good, and the greateſt, if not only Happineſs. The Objection which they have againſt doing Good, is yet unremoved: This they fear, is an expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive practice, and will waſte their Eſtate; for Beneficence cannot conſiſt with Injuſtice, with Fraud or Oppreſſion, with pinching and ſcraping, and all the ſinful, little ſordid Arts they have uſed to make themſelves Rich.</p>
            <p>I do not now go about to ſhew them the unreaſonableneſs of their deſires; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Riches to be as good as they imagine, I will endeavour to make it out, that to do Good is the wiſeſt and likelieſt means to attain them, it is a very probable way to thrive.</p>
            <p>This is a Paradox, and therefore I will make it out, 1. by the beſt Teſtimony, 2. by Obſervation. 3. by Argument.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Teſtimony. <hi>Prov. 19. 17. He that giveth to the Poor, lendeth to the Lord, and that which he giveth will he pay him again.</hi> God is a ſure Pay-maſter: but perhaps he may not pay in kind, tho' the words ſeem to import that he will. <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. Verſ. 24, 25. ſpeak this more clearly, and are full to our Purpoſe. <hi>There is that ſcatters, and yet encreaſes; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to Poverty.
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:96861:297"/>
The liberal Soul ſhall be made fat; and be that watereth, ſhall be watered alſo himſelf.</hi> In the <hi>24th</hi> verſe is a double Paradox, wholly contrary to the Sence of theſe Men. He tells them, that ſome ſcattering is the way to encreaſe, and ſome ſparing the means to be Poor. And then in the <hi>25th,</hi> he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that Liberality, or a cheerful, free Communicativeneſs of what we have, ſhall be bleſt with Plenty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By Obſervation. <hi>Pſal. 37. 25, 26. I have been young, and now am old, yet did I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee the Righteous forſaken, nor his Seed beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Bread, &amp;c.</hi> Both he and his Children have been kept from Poverty and Want; they have not been reduced to extremity. The words ſeem ſpoken by way of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for it follows his <hi>Children are Bleſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Obſervation is <hi>Tullies.</hi> He tells us, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire flouriſhed and was great, whilſt they obliged their Aſſociates by Benefits, and their Senate was a Haven and Refuge to their Provincials: but when they became Injurious and Cruel, and had no regard to Strangers, they were quickly ruin'd. <hi>In has clades incidimus,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>dum metui quam chari eſſe &amp; diligi maluimus. Quae ſi popula Romano injuſté imperanti accide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re potuerunt, quid debent putare ſinguli?</hi> This is the Obſervation of this wiſe Man, that when they were good and beneficent to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, they were prſerved; when cruel, unequal and injurious, their Empire was deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="588" facs="tcp:96861:298"/>
Laſtly; I appeal to your own Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Call to mind how many we have known, who have been Juſt and Charitable, Merciful and Liberal, and Hoſpitable, who have by theſe very means both got and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their Eſtates: and how many Men have we known undone by their Malice, and Anger, and Envy? Nay, their very cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pinching have been the cauſes why they have not got more, or kept what they had. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The reaſon of this is plain. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the good Offices we do to others, we engage them to Returns. Few Men are ſo depraved, but they are grateful, and will ſtudy retribution: and gratitude will not only pay back the Principal, but give us it with advantage. It conſtrains the Debtor to pay greater Uſe than the Law will force from him. <hi>Whatſoever you would that Men ſhould do to you, do you do to them,</hi> is a truth that's written in Nature, as well as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Here's a Direction to us in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, whatever dealing we deſire from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we muſt uſe to them: and it ſuppoſes, that as we do to them, they will do to us: which is for the moſt part true: for, they lie under the double Obligation of Juſtice, and an Example, and without great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to themſelves cannot ſhake it off. And therefore there is no ſuch ſign of a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Wickedneſs, as Ingratitude. If then we do good to others, we probably ſhall not fail of a return from them; and ſuch a return ordinarily, as the Husband-man
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:96861:298"/>
hath of his Seed, Thirty, Sixty, or an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Men will love us, they will wiſh us well, and do us Good. The good, the beneficent Man hath every ones Prayers and good Deſires, and every ones Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for his Welfare: they all deſire that he ſhould be happy. No Man envies his good Fortune, who will uſe what he hath for the Good of others. None are afraid that he ſhould grow Rich, who will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe his Wealth to cruſh and oppreſs, but uſes it to relieve his poor Neighbours.</p>
            <p>He is not the Object of any ones Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for we all eſteem the Man that doth Good with it, worthy of what he hath. Men only grudge them their Wealth, who have no Knowledge nor Will to uſe it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, none will ordinarily hate or be malicious againſt the Good-man. <hi>Who will, who can harm you, if you be doers of that which is Good?</hi> By this means we are more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from Enemies, than by Bars, and Locks, and Iron Doors, and Cheſts. Take away Envy and Malice, Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and we may dwell ſafely. Men can have little Temptation to rob us, when they and others are the better for what we have.</p>
            <p>No, it's the ſelfiſh Man that catches what he can from others, and will part with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them; that muſt fear that will be taken from him, which himſelf cannot find in his Heart to give, or lend, or lay out for a publick benefit. Whereas the liberal Man
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:96861:299"/>
may lie down and ſleep without fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He needs not, he cannot much fear the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of crafty Men, or the Aſſaults of the Violent.</p>
            <p>But that's not all that doing Good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to an Eſtate; it doth not only keep what we have, but get more. It doth as well make Men that they ſhall be our Friends, as that they ſhall not be our Enemies. Our Neighbours will be ready to do us all kind Offices, and help our Buſineſs with Counſel, or Labour, or Money. And the good Man's Servants (on whoſe Truſt and Diligence Eſtates much depend) will not work out of Fear, nor only out of Conſcience, but out of Love; and this will make them more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and chearful, and careful in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Buſineſs, than any other Principle.</p>
            <p>Neither he that works for Hire, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dare do no other, will be ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, as he that loves his Maſter. And if he be good, and kind, and equal, liberal and charitable, he will, he muſt love him.</p>
            <p>I conclude this Particular with that of <hi>Tally; Rerum omnium nec aptius eſt quicquam ad opes tuendas ac tenendas, quam diligi, nec ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enius quam timeri. Quem metuunt oderunt, quem quiſqut odit periiſſe expetit. Multorum odiis nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae opes obſiſtere poſſunt.</hi> There is nothing more fit and ſuitable to the keeping and ſecuring of Riches, than to be lov'd; and nothing more ſtrange and oppoſite, than to be fear'd. He that is fear'd, is hated withal, and every one deſires the Ruine of him he hates. The greateſt Wealth is not ſufficient to give check to the Hatred of many.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="591" facs="tcp:96861:299"/>
3. This Beneficence of Temper will keep us from thoſe Ways whereby Eſtates are uſually waſted.</p>
            <p>There are five Ways that lead Men to Poverty, 1. Idleneſs. 2. Prodigality. 3. A Senſual Courſe. 4. Gaming. 5. Law-Suits.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When Men will not be diligent. If their Buſineſs will do it ſelf, it may; but by them it ſhall not be done. Now the Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that neglects his Field, ſuffers it to be overgrown with Thorns and Briars, what Crop, what Harveſt can he expect? None at all, but as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſhall come on him ſuddenly, and Poverty as an armed Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When a Man doth not give, but throw away; neither conſiders to whom nor why he gives, nor what he hath. He ſlatters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Eſtate; he ſpends, meerly becauſe he hath no power to keep. To avoid the Extreme of parting with Nothing, this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Man parts with All.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Solomon</hi> and Experience ſay the ſame, That he who loves Pleaſure ſhall be <hi>a poor Man; He who loves Wine and Oil, ſhall not be rich.</hi> The Sons of Appetite, if they be not born to Eſtates, never get them, and ſeldom keep what they have got to their hands. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is a great Waſter. <hi>By means of a Whoriſh Woman,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe Man, <hi>is a Man brought to a Piece of Bread.</hi> Luxury and Incontinence, Gluttonny and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are very chargeable Sins. How many Men have eat and drunk up great Eſtates? And how many have ſold their Lands, to make their Miſtreſſes fine?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="592" facs="tcp:96861:300"/>
4. And who knows not how many have been undone by Gaming? have ventured and loſt great Eſtates, by truſting to their own Skill and Fortune?</p>
            <p n="5">5. And are there not many ruin'd by Law-Suits? They either are contentious, and ſue others, or unjuſt, and provoke others (that have no mind to it) to ſue them.</p>
            <p>Now the beneficent good Man, he is out of danger of loſing his Eſtate in any of theſe Ways: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He cannot be idle and unactive. He will be labouring for this Reaſon, that he may have to give to him that wants. He will overlook his Affairs, and mind his Shop, or his Field, or where-ever his Employment is, becauſe this will enable him to do Good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho he be liberal and charitable, yet not prodigal and profuſe. He will part with what he hath freely on a good account, but not on none at all. He is ſo bountiful, as to lay out whenſoever it becomes him; and yet is ſo frugal alſo, as to keep what he hath, when it doth not misbecome him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſees how unprofitable it is to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to the World, to waſte away his Time and Subſtance in Eating and Drinking, or any other Senſuality. He finds theſe Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are miſchievous to him, and render him uſeleſs to other Men. Becauſe he is bent to do as much Good as he can, he will not riſe up early to drink ſtrong-Drink, nor continue at Night till Wine inflame him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He loves himſelf too well to loſe, and his Neighbour too well to win an Eſtate at
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:96861:300"/>
Cards or Dice. This good Man cannot be ſo fooliſh, as to run ſuch a Hazard as this, to diſable himſelf from doing that Good which he otherwiſe might, nor can he take any pleaſure to undo his Neighbour.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This good Man will neither be ſo quarrelſom, as to contend with others where he hath not Right; nor yet ſo unjuſt, as by detaining their Rights to engage others to ſue him. And when ever he is forced by the Injuſtice of others, he doth it more to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Juſtice, and preſerve thoſe Rights which Cuſtom, and the Wiſdom of their Forefathers have ſetled, than upon any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate particular Account.</p>
            <p>4thly; The ſecret Bleſſing of God goes with the good Man; Providence will and doth concern it ſelf, that ſuch an one ſhould not want the Power to do Good, who hath ſuch a mind to it.</p>
            <p>It is by the ſecret Curſe of God upon him, that the Covetous Man puts his Money into Bags with Holes. He puts it in, but never takes it out, never ſees, never enjoys it. He gets, and loſes what he has got. And it is the Bleſſing of God that makes the liberal Mans <hi>Bread,</hi> which he <hi>caſts upon the Waters,</hi> (where it ſeems quite loſt) <hi>after many days to return to him again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that takes care of others, God will take care of him; and if he lay aſide his own private Concerns, to ſerve other Men, the <hi>Angels of God will miniſter to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly, yet ſo plainly evinced, that to do Good is the way to be rich, that I
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:96861:301"/>
cannot but hope Covetonſneſs it ſelf will be engaged to Beneficence.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to ſhew how much an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Beneficence conduces to private and particular Friendſhips; and how much, if it obtain'd in the World, it would tend to Publick Peace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Friend is certainly the greateſt of all external good Things. Nothing ſo profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, nothing ſo pleaſant, nothing ſo ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to, and becoming a Man, as a Friend.</p>
            <p>Nothing without him ſo much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the attaining all his Ends. My Friend is my Riches, and my Reputation, my Life and Health, my Pleaſure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, my Underſtanding and Wiſdom, the Guide and Conductor of my Life, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of my Paſſions, he that moderates my Deſires, and ſubdues mine Anger, and doubles my Joys; that excites all the good and uſeful, that reſtrains and quells the evil and pernicious Motions of my Mind.</p>
            <p>My Friend doth me Good, when my ſelf cannot; for, he rectifies my Miſtakes, and allays my Griefs, and unburdens me of all the Loads, which mine own Folly and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy would bind faſt on. Thus he is better to me than my ſelf, he is more than all the World beſides; when I cannot help my ſelf, and when others will not, he doth.</p>
            <p>In ſum, my Friend is to me both my ſelf, and all the World, nay, my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God. I do with my Friend enjoy both Solitude and Company. When I converſe with him, I have both the Secrecy of mine
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:96861:301"/>
own Breaſt, and the Eaſe and Freedom of Diſcourſe: I ſpeak, and yet have the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Silence. When I am with him, I am retir'd into mine own Thoughts, and can contemplate without diſturbance; and yet I feel the higheſt Pleaſure, and moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Delights, that the whole Frame of Nature can yield. The Glories of the Sun are not ſo pleaſant to behold, as the Face of my Friend; and the moſt melodious Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick cannot be ſo grateful to my Ears, as the Voice of the Perſon who loves me, and whom I love. He is the <hi>Epitome</hi> of the whole World, and the livelieſt Image of God himſelf. He is God and Man in one Perſon, if I may ſo ſay; for he hath the Love and Goodneſs of God, an infinite Good-will, join'd with the Weakneſs and Impotency of Man.</p>
            <p>I can ſcarce forbear to go on, and ſet forth the Excellency and Uſefulneſs of Friendſhip, which of all the things in the World, doth moſt conduce to both our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and bodily Welfare, our preſent and future greateſt Happineſs.</p>
            <p>But I have ſaid all this, only that I may the more commend this univerſal Goodneſs, which is the beſt, if not only Means to great and good Friendſhips. To do Good to him, is the Sign and Effect of my Love to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and 'tis the ſure Cauſe of his Love to me; and where there is a mutual Love, it will not long be conceal'd; and where it is diſcovered, that is Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the Way to make all Men
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:96861:302"/>
my Friends, to <hi>do Good to All;</hi> they cannot poſſibly hate their Benefactor. This is the way to extinguiſh all the Fires of Hatred, and Glowings of Jealouſy, and Flames of Anger; to take away all thoſe Paſſions, which are the Ingredients of Enmity. No ſuch ſure and effectual, as well as brave and generous Method to overcome Evil, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Enmity, as that which the Apoſtle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes by <hi>doing Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that's not all; This doth not only make it next to impoſſible for Men to be our Enemies, when they ſee we are doing Good to all, and to themſelves, as far as that is conſiſtent with the Publick Weal; but it alſo makes it neceſſary that they ſhould be our Friends. So ſtrong are the Obligations of the Laws of Gratitude, ſo powerful is Example, that they are conſtrained to make Returns of Good Offices, and to retaliate Kindneſs.</p>
            <p>Herein lies the great Power that every Man hath to procure himſelf good Uſage from other Men, by carrying himſelf well to them; for, tis impoſſible but they ſhould love him, who loves them. And I look on it as the beſt and ſureſt Rule to be obſerv'd by them that would be lov'd, to love.</p>
            <p>I no leſs admire the Wiſdom, than the Juſtice of that Saying, which hath found ſuch an acceptance, that it hath ſometimes been entertain'd in a great Court; <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye would that Men ſhould do to you, the ſame do ye to them:</hi> For they are not only obliged, but inclined to it; they ought to do
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:96861:302"/>
it, and probably they will: ſo that it is as full of Counſel, as it is of Equity, and doth as certainly ſhew us what we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from other Men, as it ſtrictly requires us what to do to them.</p>
            <p>From this Diſcourſe is clear, That if we love, and do Good to all Men, all Men will love us, at leaſt it will be ſo with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality: And it is the likelieſt, and perhaps only Courſe we can take to engage all: for, if Kindneſs and Beneficence will not engage their Affections, nothing will.</p>
            <p>Thus, by univerſal Beneficence we take the way to be not only univerſally well ſpoke of, and well thought of, but alſo well dealt with: for none can reſiſt the real Charms of this powerful Philter; they muſt love him that loves them, and do Good to their Benefactor.</p>
            <p>That's the firſt Particular, That by doing Good to All, we ſhall procure an univerſal Friendſhip. There is a common Saying, <hi>That an univerſal Lover is never a particular Friend:</hi> That is not true; for our Saviour loved all, and yet had his particularly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſciple. But we muſt ſee that we do not verify that, That he who is every-body's Friend, is no-body's: Tho I believe, for the moſt part, they mean no more by that, than that he is not ſo much their Friend as they deſire; for they would monopolize and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs his Friendſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This will make Friendſhips not only large, but hearty; as well intenſe in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as extended to many: For, Men will
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:96861:303"/>
love us in that manner in which we love them. If our Love be only in Words and Countenance, they will return us good Looks and good Words again: But if we do not only love them <hi>in Word and Tongue, but in Deed and Truth,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> expreſſeth it, they will alſo love us heartily, and do us Good; for, <hi>by the ſame meaſure we mete to them, it ſhall be meaſured to us by them again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is an excellent Effect of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally beneficent Temper, to make us Friends to all in general, and hearty to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in particular.</p>
            <p>Men that are deſtitute of this Principle, their Love is like ſome Plants, that either all run up into the Root, or out into Leaf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here is both Root and Leaf; their Love is hearty in particular, and yet dilated to the Community.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This makes Friendſhips vertuous and juſt. No Friendſhip can be good, nor I think great, I am ſure not certain, that is not founded in Vertue; that is the Parent, that is the Nurſe of true Friendſhip. This was obſerved by Heathens long ſince. And indeed I can neither expect that he ſhould do me the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Good, nor yet be faithful, who is not a Man of ſteady Vertue. And no Man can be my great Friend, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not promote my beſt Intereſts, or whom I cannot truſt.</p>
            <p>Now how neceſſary univerſal Good-will is to the Vertue of Friendſhip, to keep it within its due Bounds, will appear by what I am now to ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="599" facs="tcp:96861:303"/>
Every Man is to endeavour to put himſelf into that Condition, and thoſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in which he ſhall do the moſt and the greateſt Good, and whatever indiſpoſes, diſables, hinders him in that, that is evil to him, and makes him not vertuous.</p>
            <p>The great Danger that a Soul void of univerſal Good-will, is expoſed to by pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friendſhips, is this, That it will be ſo confined and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ured, ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ſome one Perſon, that it cannot be at liberty to help and ſerve any others and thus that Affection is monopoliz'd and engroſt'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two or three, which ought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> more common and publick.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, this Man loves his Friend, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> elſe, But where Goodwill to all is, that keeps Friendſhip from degenerating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Partiality and injuſtice.</p>
            <p>For, tho this good Man loves his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Friend, as much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> loves none elſe; yet he will not be ſo kind to one, as to be unjuſt to the reſt of Men. He may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> doth prefer one before another, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> yet hath not ſo much regard to one, that he hath none at all to others. He will and may ſpend moſt of his Time and Pains in doing Good there, where he hath greateſt Obligations, and beſt Opportunity, and there is moſt need; but yet reſerves ſome for others, for any in the World, to whom he can be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable.</p>
            <p>In ſum, whilſt particular Friendſhip is no prejudice to Humanity, nor hinders us from
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:96861:304"/>
doing any more publick good Offices to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; whilſt it doth not take off our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from them, nor take up our Time, and employ us ſo, as we cannot ſerve the Community, it keeps within its own bounds.</p>
            <p>The only way to keep it thus, is to be univerſally beneficent: Endeavour to get into our Souls a great Good-will to the whole World of Mankind, and then, particular Friendſhips will never degenerate into too particular Affection; that will hold the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance even betwixt the Intereſt of other Men, and the Concerns of my Friend.</p>
            <p>When there is a Fault in this particular, Friendſhip is not to be blamed, but the Man; nor doth he love his Friend too much, but other Men too little.</p>
            <p>The way that is ordinarily taken to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy this Miſcarriage, is wrong: for, when Men love their Friend leſs, they mend one Fault by another: The right Courſe is, to love others more, and not their Friend leſs; to do good to all Men, and not to ceaſe doing good to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This will make Friendſhips more eaſy and pleaſant than otherwiſe they would be: For he that loves but one or a few, in their abſence is hugely unquiet and troubled, but he that hath a kindneſs for all, he ever meets with the Objects that pleaſe him (tho not all alike) and when Neceſſity parts him from his deareſt Friend, yet he fails not of thoſe on whom he does exerciſe Benevolence, and ſo hath both a pleaſant and profitable Diverſion. And it will prove the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:96861:304"/>
againſt the Trouble of parting with Friends, when we are ſo affected, as to do to others (for ſubſtance) as we have done to our Friends.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This will alſo make Friendſhips profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. When they grow on this Root, they will bring forth Fruit; when they derive from a Principle of Beneficence, they will not end in a fruitleſs Paſſion: But he that is upon doing Good to all Men, will certainly not fail to do it to his Friend; it will be his buſineſs to ſerve him in ſome or other of his Intereſts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This is the only probable way to make Friendſhips laſting. This is a firm Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that Friendſhip which is built on it ſhall ſtand faſt, tho the Winds blow, and Storms fall, and Waves beat upon it. When all others, that are founded only on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Humors, or Likeneſs of bodily Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, nay, on expectation of Advantages, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pleaſure or Profit, ſhall fall; this that is ſet on the Rock of univerſal Beneficence, ſhall continue for ever.</p>
            <p>He that loves his Friend in proſecution of, and conſiſtently with that great Principle of <hi>Love to All,</hi> he will love him to the <hi>end:</hi> Whereas he that is a Friend meerly from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or Temper, or ſenſe of preſent Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or hope of ſome future Advantage, will ceaſe to be a Friend, perhaps become an Enemy, when theſe change. Tempers alter, and Humors come and go, and whatever is corporeal, is mutable: Nay, Vice and Miſtake are ſo too; ſo that we can be ſure of
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:96861:305"/>
nothing ſo much as of Vertue and Knowledg</p>
            <p>Nothing that is unaccountable, or that is founded in Miſtake or Ignorance, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably continue long; and ſuch is that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is inconſiſtent, not in conjunction with, nor deriving from univerſal Good-will.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn generally, what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages accrue to the Friendſhips of thoſe Men, that live in the obſervance of this great Law of <hi>doing Good to All Men;</hi> for, by this means they are many and hearty, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and much more eaſy, and profitable, and laſting than otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>I proceed, laſtly, to ſhew how much the Temper and Practice of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Beneficence</hi> tends to <hi>Publick Peace and Tranquillity.</hi> How would moſt of the Quarrels in the World ceaſe, if this once obtained? Men would quickly <hi>beat their Swords into Plow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks;</hi> they would <hi>unlearn War,</hi> and betake themſelves to the uſeful Arts of Peace; if they lov'd all Men, they would not then ſtudy how to <hi>hurt</hi> and <hi>deſtroy,</hi> but how to help and ſerve, and be beneficial to each other.</p>
            <p>Let us imagine an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> on this Earth, where it is natural to the Inhabitants to obey this Law of <hi>Love to Mankind,</hi> how hardly do any Controverſies ariſe amongſt them? And how eaſily and quickly are they decided by the Parties themſelves? For, they are not more their own, than they are one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers Advocates. They conſider not their own particular Intereſts, in oppoſition to
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:96861:305"/>
the Publick, and the Rules of Juſtice and Order, wherein the Community is ſo much concerned, out of their good-will to the World, they will not violate.</p>
            <p>If any Caſe be ſo difficult that they cannot fathom it, or their own Modeſty make them think they do not; or that they may have more conſidered their own Cauſe than the oppoſite; how calmly, and with what quiet and compoſure do they ſubmit to a Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by ſome other? with what indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency do they hear it judged againſt them? Nay, they do not think that is againſt them, which is for Juſtice and other Men.</p>
            <p>All their Contentions are friendly, and they are all in a way of Reaſon; for they are all of the mind, that of the two ways in which Men contend, one by Reaſon, the other by Force, the firſt only becomes Men, the latter belongs properly to Brutes.</p>
            <p>And for a further Eviction of this, I do appeal to, and dare be concluded by almoſt any the moſt injudicious Men, whether it every Man were upon deſign of doing Good to others, to all, there would not be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace over the whole Earth, and <hi>Nation would not riſe againſt Nation;</hi> much leſs would the ſame People fall out with each other.</p>
            <p>If any doubt, let him ſearch the Records of Antiquity; and look back to the Hiſtories of ancient Times, or let him inform himſelf of his own, and he will very ſoon be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that Want of a regard to the Concerns of other Men, hath, and ever had the greateſt hand in the Breach of Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="604" facs="tcp:96861:306"/>
The great Diſturbers of the Quiet of the World, have been either acted by Malice and Hatred, or by a ſelfiſh and contracted Affection, but have ever been deſtitute of Good-will to the Generality of Men. By all that we have recorded of the great Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the World, we find they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to ſuch Undertakings, more by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Empire and Greatneſs, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne themſelves, than to be Benefactors to others. Certainly, if they had had a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Welfare of other Men, they would never have ranſack'd the Goods, and razed the Dwellings, and ſhed the Blood of ſo many. But enough in a Caſe ſo plain.</p>
            <p>I will only add, and with that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Particular, That the due Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this excellent Rule, is neceſſary to the right diſcharge of thoſe Employments, on which the <hi>Publick Peace</hi> ſo much depends, I mean, the <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and the <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> it is a neceſſary and excellent Qualification of him, both in his Legiſlative and Judicative Capacity.</p>
            <p>How can he make Laws, that intends not the Good of all them that are Subjects, ſince this is eſſential to a Law, that it aim at the Publick Good? And how unfit is he to judg according to the Laws, who himſelf hath not the ſame deſign with them? He that is acted by Malice and bitter Anger, or that hath Love, but it is confined to a Number, to a Party, how ill is he qualified to be either a Lawgiver, or a Judg?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="605" facs="tcp:96861:306"/>
               <hi>Plate,</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> from him, tell us, That all Governors ought to obſerve two Precepts:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To intend and refer all to the Publick Good, ſubordinating all private Reſpects and particular Intereſts to that.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To have a regard of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, not of a part only. If we add to theſe two,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To take moſt care of the beſt, moſt vertuous and uſeful Men; we have compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed all that is in my Text: which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever obſerves, can ſcarce fail of being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Magiſtrate, a wiſe and a good Law-giver, a juſt and an equal Judg.</p>
            <p>I ſay, he that conſtantly deſigns and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes, not his own private Advantages, but the Publick Good; nor takes care of only one Party, but of all the Community; and, laſtly, makes beſt Proviſion for the beſt Men, and doth moſt Good to them that do moſt Good: he will diſcharge his Office well; his Laws will be no tyrannical, arbitrary, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Impoſitions, but a gentle and eaſy Yoke; his Sentence will be equitable, and his Execution full of Mildneſs and Humanity.</p>
            <p>And how little cauſe of Quarrels and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions there can be in a State, whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors are thus qualified, we all ſee. Thus is it where the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> are bent on doing Good to all, eſpecially to the Beſt and moſt Vertuous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Publick-ſpiritedneſs is no leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to engage them to that extraordinary Diligence they muſt uſe, to carry them through all the Oppoſition and
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:96861:307"/>
Difficulties they ſhall certainly meet with in their general Converſe with all ſorts, with Men of the meaneſt Capacities, of loweſt Rank, and greateſt Vices, and worſt Natures.</p>
            <p>Nothing but this Univerſal Benevolence can fit them for ſuch Converſe: Only he that loves all, will bear with ſuch Converſation as a Miniſter meets with.</p>
            <p>All the Care and Pains he is at, firſt to find out good, and wholeſom, and fit Truths, and then to deliver them intelligibly and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, muſt have their Riſe from his great Good-will to Men; and therefore he doth thus, becauſe he is on a deſign of doing Good to them.</p>
            <p>Where the Miniſter is deſtitute of this good Temper, he is idle and careleſs, and his Diſcourſes uſeleſs and inſignificant: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is <hi>without Charity,</hi> he is a <hi>ſounding Braſs, and tinkling Cymbal,</hi> and his Carriage fooliſh and hurtful.</p>
            <p>The great Work of Miniſters is to teach Religion, ſo as it may be both known and done, to make it eaſy to be underſtood, and eaſy to be practiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to make plain, that Univerſal Beneficence is both available and neceſſary to all the valuable Intereſts which Man can propoſe to himſelf, whether he regard the preſent or the future State; whether he conſider himſelf and his own particular State, or the Publick; whether he be in a private or a publick Capacity, he muſt ſtrictly obſerve this Rule of <hi>doing Good to All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="607" facs="tcp:96861:307"/>
So that if we would be either good or happy in this World, or he that to come; if we would ſerve our ſelves or others; if we would pleaſe and honour our God and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, adorn our Profeſſion; if we would have Pleaſure in Life, and Peace in, and Glory after Death; if we would do all we can to make others as good as we wiſh they were, we muſt herein exerciſe our ſelves, <hi>to do all the Good we can to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any are idle, and would be doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I do aſſure them they ſhall have more pleaſure in this active Life than in Sleep and Dulneſs. If any love themſelves only, and do not regard how it goes with others, I do aſſure them that this is the beſt and likelieſt way to ſerve themſelves. As many as are of particular Affections, confined to Kindred, or a Party, or ſo; let them enlarge their Love to All, and they will proportionably increaſe their Pleaſure. And if any are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, and love to do Miſchief, I undertake to make it appear to them, that the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Love are far greater than thoſe of Revenge: And I entreat ſuch to leave off to lead the Life of Devils, and live that of Angels. If Heaven be more deſirable than Hell, it's better to love than to hate.</p>
            <p>Conſider what has been ſaid; and God grant, that we may all in good earneſt ſet upon the Practice of that moſt excellent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to which we are exhorted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="608" facs="tcp:96861:308"/>
And let the good Spirit of God inſpire the whole World with that Goodneſs and Love to one another, and all Men, that ſo we may both live well here, and be happy for ever hereafter, for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now to this Bleſſed Saviour, who hath loved us, and waſhed us in his own Blood, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, be eternally given all Honour, Praiſe, and Glory.</p>
