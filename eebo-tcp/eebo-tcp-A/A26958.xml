            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And now Publiſhed, not to Inſtruct the Proud,

            <p>IT is many Years, ſince this <hi>Prognoſtication</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
(1661, except the Sixteen laſt Lines) but it

Author now thinketh, that the Monitory Uſefulneſs,
may over-weigh the Inconveniencies of Mens Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
at leaſt, to <hi>Poſterity,</hi> if not for the <hi>Preſent Age;</hi>
of which, he is taking his Fare-wel. His Suppoſitions are
ſuch as cannot be denyed. <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 9. The Thing that hath been, is that
which ſhall be; and that which is done, is that which
ſhall be done: and there is no New Thing under the <hi>Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The ſame Cauſes, with the ſame Circumſtances, will
have the ſame Effects on Recipients, equally diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Operari ſequitur eſſe:</hi> As Natures are, ſo they act;
except where over-power'd.</p>
            <p>4. The Appetite (Senſitive and Rational) is the Principle of
Motion; and what any <hi>Love,</hi> they will <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Seek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Therefore, <hi>Intereſt</hi> will turn the Affairs of the World;
and he that can best <hi>underſtand all Intereſts,</hi> will be the
beſt <hi>Moral Prognoſticator;</hi> ſo far as Men are Cauſes of
the Events.</p>
            <p>6. The Pleaſing of <hi>God,</hi> and the Happyneſs of their own
and others Souls, being the Intereſt of True Believers; and
Temporal Life, Pleaſure, and Proſperity, being the ſeeming
and eſteemed Intereſt of Unbelievers croſs Intereſts, will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them contrary wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59455:3"/>
7. Contraries, when near and Militant, will be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to each other, and ſeek each others Deſtruction or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitation.</p>
            <p>8. The Senſes and Experience of all Men, in all Ages,
are to be believed about their proper Objects.</p>
            <p>9. Men of <hi>Activity, Power,</hi> and <hi>Great Numbers,</hi> will
have advantage for Obſervance and Succeſs, above thoſe that
are Modeſt, Obſcure, and Few.</p>
            <p>10. Yet <hi>Men</hi> will ſtill be <hi>Men;</hi> and the Rational Nature
will yield ſome Friendly Aſpect towards the Truth.</p>
            <p>11. Thoſe that are Ignorant, and miſled by Paſſion, and
carryed down the Stream, by Men of <hi>Malignity</hi> or <hi>Faction,</hi>
may come to themſelves, when Affliction, Experience, and
Conſiderateneſs have had time to work; and may Repent,
and undo ſome-what that they have done.</p>
            <p>12. As <hi>Senſe</hi> will be <hi>Senſe,</hi> when <hi>Faith</hi> hath done its best;
ſo <hi>Faith</hi> will be <hi>Faith,</hi> when Fleſh or Senſe hath done its worſt.</p>
            <p>13. Men that fix on a Heavenly, Everlasting Intereſt, will
not be Temporizers, and changed by the Worldly Mens Wills or
Cruelties.</p>
            <p>14. When all Men have tired themſelves with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
and Stirs, <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> must be the
quiet State.</p>
            <p>15. When all Worldly Wiſdome hath done its utmoſt, an<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ankind will be Born in a State of
Infancy and Neſcience, that is,
without actual Knowledge.</p>
            <p>2. Yea, with a Nature that hath

and to diverting pleaſures and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
and more than ſo, to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs

The Carnal Mind will have an Enmity againſt <hi>God,</hi> and
will not mind the things of the Spirit, nor be ſubject
to <hi>God</hi>'s Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>3. Sound Learning, or Wiſdom, in things of ſo high
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59455:4"/>
a Nature, as are the matters of Salvation, will not be
attain'd without <hi>Hard Study,</hi> and <hi>Earnest Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Submiſſion</hi> to Inſtructions; and all this a <hi>long time Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently</hi>
Endured, or rather <hi>willingly,</hi> and <hi>delightfully</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>4. And if the <hi>Seeds</hi> of Wiſdom be not <hi>Born</hi> with us,
in a <hi>capacious diſpoſition</hi> of underſtanding; but contrarily
a <hi>Natural Unapprehenſiveneſs</hi> Blocks up the Way; even
<hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Labour,</hi> will never (without a Miracle) bring
any, to any great Eminency of Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>5. And they that have both <hi>Capacity,</hi> and an <hi>Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Diſpoſition, muſt have alſo <hi>ſound,</hi> and <hi>able,</hi> and <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

and of <hi>partial factious guides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. There are <hi>few Born</hi> with good natural Capacities,
much leſs with a <hi>ſpecial diſpoſitive acuteneſs;</hi> and few that
will be at the <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> which the getting of
Wiſdom doth require; and few that will have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of <hi>ſound,</hi> and <hi>diligent Teachers;</hi> But <hi>feweſt of all</hi>
that will have a <hi>concurrence</hi> of all theſe three.</p>
            <p>7. Therefore there will be but <hi>few very Wiſe Men</hi> in
the World; Ignorance will be common, Wiſdom will
be rare.</p>
            <p>8. Therefore <hi>Errour</hi> or <hi>falſe Opinions</hi> will be <hi>common.</hi>
For unleſs Men <hi>never think</hi> of the things of which they are
Ignorant, or Judge nothing of them one way or other,
they are <hi>ſure to err,</hi> ſo far as they Judge in Ignorance.
But when things of greateſt Moment are repreſented as
<hi>True</hi> or <hi>Falſe,</hi> to be believed or rejected, the moſt Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Mind, is naturally inclined to paſs its Judgment
or Opinion of them one way or other; and to Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them according to the light he ſtandeth in, and to
think of them as he is diſpoſed. So that <hi>Ignorance</hi> and
<hi>Errour will</hi> concur.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59455:4"/>
9. He that <hi>Erreth,</hi> doth <hi>think</hi> that he is in the <hi>Right,</hi>
and Erreth not: For to <hi>Err,</hi> and to <hi>know that he Erreth</hi>
in Judgment, is a Contradiction, and Impoſſible. (How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Deeds</hi> a Man may <hi>Err,</hi> and <hi>know</hi> that
he Erreth.)</p>
            <p>10. He that <hi>knoweth</hi> not, and that <hi>Erreth,</hi> perceiveth
not that <hi>Evidence</hi> of Truth, which ſhould make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, and which maketh other Men receive it; And
therefore <hi>knoweth not</hi> that indeed another is in the <hi>right,</hi>
or ſeeth any more than he.</p>
            <p>11. Eſpecially when every Man is a Stranger to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Mind and Soul, as to any immediate inſpection:
And therefore, <hi>knoweth not anothers knowledge,</hi> nor the
Convincing Reaſons of his Judgment.</p>
            <p>12. As no Man is moved againſt his <hi>own</hi> Errours, by
the Reaſons which he <hi>knoweth not;</hi> ſo <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Self-love,</hi>
and <hi>Partiality</hi> thence ariſing, incline all Men naturally to
be <hi>over-valuers</hi> of their own <hi>Underſtandings,</hi> and ſo <hi>over-confident</hi>
of all their own conceptions, and over-ſtiff in
defending all their Errours, As <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> are the
firſt-born of Satan, and the Root of all poſitive Evil in
Man's Soul; ſo a Man is more <hi>Naturally Proud</hi> of that
which is the <hi>Honour of a Man,</hi> which is his <hi>Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> than of that which is common to a

of <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and Goodneſs oft Live, when ſordid Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
telleth you that childiſh Pride of <hi>Ornaments</hi> is Dead.
And this <hi>Pride</hi> maketh it very difficult, to the moſt <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi>
and <hi>Erronious,</hi> to know their <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi>
or ſo much as to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> their own Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>13. He that ſeeth but <hi>few things,</hi> ſeeth not much to
make him <hi>doubt,</hi> and ſeeth not the <hi>difficulties</hi> which ſhould
check his Confidence, and ſtiffneſs in his way.</p>
            <p>

much;</hi> eſpecially, if he ſee them in their <hi>Order,</hi> and
reſpects to one another, and leaveth out no one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
Part, which is needful to open the ſignification
of the reſt.</p>
            <p>15. He that ſeeth <hi>many things diſorderly,</hi> and confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and not in <hi>due method,</hi> and leaveth out ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
Parts, and hath not a <hi>digeſted</hi> Knowledge, doth
<hi>know much,</hi> and <hi>err much,</hi> and may make a buſtle in
the World of Ignorants, as if he were an excellent Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Man; but hath little of the <hi>Inward delight,</hi> or of the
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>16. He <hi>that</hi> ſeeth many things but <hi>darkly, confuſedly,</hi>
and not in the true <hi>place</hi> and <hi>method,</hi> cannot reconcile
Truths among themſelves; but is like a Boy with a
pair of Tarrying-Irons, or like one that hath his Clock
or Watch all in peices, and knoweth not how to ſet
them altogether. And therefore, is inclined to be a <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. This ſort of Scepticks, differ much from Humble
Chriſtians; and have oft as high Thoughts of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
as any others: For they lay the cauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the difficulties in the Objects, rather than on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
Unleſs, when they incline to Brutiſhneſs or Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceiſme,
and take Man's Underſtanding to be uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of True Knowledge, and ſo lay the blame on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature as ſuch, that is, on the <hi>Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. Few know ſo much as to ſee the difficulty of
things, and make them <hi>doubt,</hi> or Sceptical. But far
fewer know, ſo much as to reſolve their doubts and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties:
Therefore, though (as Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> ſaith of
<hi>faithful Pastors) I ſay not that there will be few Cardinals,
few Biſhops, few Doctors, few Deans, few Jeſuits, few Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
(there will be anow of theſe)</hi> yet there will be <hi>few
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59455:5"/>
Wiſe Judicious Divines,</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> even in the beſt and
happyeſt Countrys.</p>
            <p>19. Seeing he that <hi>knoweth not</hi> or that <hi>Erreth,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not that <hi>another Knoweth,</hi> or is in the <hi>Right,</hi> when
he is in the wrong; therefore he knoweth not whoſe
Judgment to honour and ſubmit to, if he ſhould ſuſpect
or be driven from his own: And therefore is not ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as to be able to chooſe the fitteſt Teacher for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>20. In this Darkneſs, therefore he either <hi>Carnally</hi> caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himſelf on the <hi>Highest</hi> and moſt <hi>Honoured</hi> in the
World, where he hath the moſt advantages for worldly
Ends; or he followeth the <hi>fame</hi> of the <hi>time</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
where he is, or he falleth in with the Major Vote,
of that Party whatſoever it be, which his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
doth moſt eſteem and honour; or elſe with ſome
Perſon that hath moſt advantage on him.</p>
            <p>21. If any of theſe happen to be in the <hi>Right, he</hi> will
be alſo in the <hi>Right materially,</hi> and may ſeem an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
Peaceable, and Praiſe-worthy Man: But where
they are in the <hi>Wrong,</hi> he is contented with the <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of being in the Right, and of the good Opinion of
thoſe whom he concurreth with; who flatter, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
each other in the Dark.</p>
            <p>22. When <hi>Wiſe</hi> Men are but <hi>few,</hi> they can be but in
<hi>few</hi> places; and therefore will be abſent from moſt of
the People (High or Low) that need Inſtruction. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that their ſtudiouſneſs inclineth them (like <hi>Hierom</hi>)
to be more retired than others, that know leſs.</p>
            <p>23. This confidence in an Erring Mind, is not only
the Caſe of the <hi>Teachers,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Flocks;</hi> but
is uſually <hi>more fortifyed</hi> in <hi>them</hi> than in others: For
they think that the Honour of <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> is
due to their <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Calling,</hi> and <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Standing</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59455:6"/>
in the Univerſities; how empty ſoever they be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
And they take it for a double diſhonor (as it is)
for a <hi>Teacher</hi> to be accounted Ignorant; and an injury
to their work and office, and to the People's Souls, that
muſt by their honor be prepared to Profit by them;
And therefore, they ſmart more impatiently under any
detection of their Ignorance, than the common People
do.</p>
            <p>24. It is not meer <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> that will
ſuffice to ſave Miniſters or People from this Ignorance,
Injudiciouſneſs and Errour; There having ever been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the very Godly Miniſters, few <hi>Judicious</hi> Men, that
are fit to inveſtigate a difficult Truth, or to defend it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a ſubtile Adverſary, or to ſee the Syſteme of
Theological verities in their proper Method, Harmony,
and Beauty.</p>
            <p>25. <hi>Morality</hi> hath innumerable Difficulties as well as
School-divinity: Becauſe that <hi>Moral Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
ſuch by <hi>preponderating Accidents;</hi> (Actions as <hi>Actions,</hi>
being <hi>neither;</hi> but only of <hi>Phyſical</hi> Conſideration.) And
the work of a true Caſuiſt is to <hi>compare</hi> ſo many <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
and to <hi>diſcern</hi> in the compariſon which <hi>prepondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth</hi>
that it requireth both an <hi>Acute</hi> and a <hi>Large Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
far ſeeing wit,</hi> to make a Man a true reſolver of
Caſes of Conſcience. And Conſequently to be a <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Paſter,</hi> that ſhall not lead the People into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>26. As few Teachers have <hi>Natural Capacity</hi> for <hi>Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and a <hi>Willingneſs,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> for <hi>long Laborious Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi>
ſo many by their <hi>Paſtoral overſight</hi> of Souls, and
many by the <hi>wants of their Families</hi> (eſpecially in times
or Perſecution, when all their publike maintenance is
gone, and they muſt Live (with their Families) on the
Charity of People, perhaps Poor and Perſecuted as well as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59455:6"/>
they) are hindred from thoſe Studies, which elſe they
would undergo.</p>
            <p>27. It is few that grow to much <hi>Exactneſs</hi> of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without much <hi>Writing</hi> (for themſelves or others):
For Study, which is to be <hi>Exactly</hi> ordered and expreſſed
by the Pen, is uſually (at laſt) the exacteſt Study: As
the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaith, [<hi>Much Reading maketh a Man full;
much conference maketh a Man Ready: and much Writing
maketh a Man Exact.</hi>] There are few <hi>Camero</hi>'s, Men of
<hi>clear Judgment,</hi> and <hi>abhorring to Write.</hi> And there are
few Divines comparatively that have opportunity to
Write much.</p>
            <p>28. They that Err in Divinity, do think their <hi>falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods</hi>
to be <hi>God's Truth;</hi> and ſo will Honour that which
he hates, with the pretence of his Authority and
Name.</p>
            <p>29. Therefore they will call up their own, and other
Mens Zeal, to defend thoſe falſhoods as for <hi>God,</hi> and
think that in ſo doing they do <hi>God</hi> Service.</p>
            <p>30. And the Intereſt of their own Place, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Ends, will ſecretly inſinuate when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
it not, and will increaſe their Zeal againſt Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers.</p>
            <p>31. Therefore, ſeeing <hi>they</hi> are uſually <hi>Many,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe</hi>
Men but few, they will expect that <hi>Number</hi> ſhould give
the precedency to their Opinions, and will call thoſe
<hi>Proud,</hi> or <hi>Heretical</hi> that gain-ſay them, and Labour to
defame them, as <hi>ſelf-conceited</hi> Opinionative-Men.</p>
            <p>32. Therefore too many <hi>Godly Ministers</hi> will be great
oppoſers of many of thoſe Truths of <hi>God,</hi> which they
Know not, and which they Err about, and will help
on the Service of Satan in the World; And will be the
Authors of Factions and Contentions in the Churches;
whilſt too many are [<hi>Proud, Knowing nothing</hi> (in thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59455:7"/>
matters when they think they are moſt Orthodox) <hi>but
doting about Questions, and Strifes of Words, whereof cometh
Envy, Strife, Railing, Evil Surmiſings, Perverſe Diſputings
of Men</hi> of <hi>Corrupt Minds</hi> (in this) and <hi>Deſtitute</hi> of the
<hi>Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>33. And if many Good Men will Erroniouſly ſtand
up againſt that Truth which any Man Wiſer than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
maketh known, the Worldly, and Malicious, that
have a manifold Enmity againſt it, will be ready to
ſtrengthen them by their Concurrence, and to joyn in
the Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>34. Not they that are <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> at a diſtance, but they
that are <hi>Neareſt</hi> the People, and are <hi>always with them,</hi>
are likeſt to prevail to make Diſciples of them, and
bring them to their mind: So great an advantage it is,
to Talk daily and confidently to Ignorant Souls, when
there is none to Talk againſt them, and to make their
Folly known.</p>
            <p>35. Eſpecially if the ſame Men can get <hi>Intereſt</hi> in their
<hi>Eſteem</hi> as well as <hi>Neerneſs,</hi> and make themſelves Eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Beſt</hi> or <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> Men.</p>
            <p>36. Therefore <hi>Jeſuitical, Worldly Clergy</hi> Men, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
get about <hi>Great Men,</hi> and inſinuate into <hi>Nobles,</hi> and
will ſtill defame them that are <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> that they
may ſeem odious, and themſelves ſeem excellent, and
ſo may carry it by deceitful Shews.</p>
            <p>37. And they will do their beſt, to procure all <hi>Wiſe</hi>
and <hi>Good</hi> Men, that are againſt their Intereſt, to be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
from the Palaces of Princes and Nobles, where
they are; leſt their <hi>preſence</hi> ſhould confute their Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
and they ſhould be as <hi>Burning and Shining Lights,</hi>
that carry their Witneſs with them, where they come:
And alſo to bring them under publike ſtigmatizing Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and Sufferings; that their Names may be infamous
and odious, in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59455:7"/>
38. And <hi>Heretical Paſtors</hi> will play a <hi>Lower Game,</hi> &amp; creep
into the Houſes of ſilly People, prepared by ignorance,
and Soul-diſturbers to receive their <hi>Hereſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>39. Between theſe two Sorts of naughty Paſtors (the
WORDLY and the HERETICAL) and alſo the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of <hi>Weak erroneous honeſt Teachers,</hi> the <hi>Soundeſt</hi> and
<hi>Worthyeſt</hi> will be ſo few, that <hi>far moſt</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> (high

of <hi>Erring-Men;</hi> and therefore, themſelves to
be an <hi>Erring People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>40. In that Meaſure, that Men are Carnal; their own

Intereſts,</hi> though not the <hi>ſame Materially.</hi> And the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter

would not ſpare the <hi>Flocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>41. The <hi>Intereſt</hi> then of the WORLDLY Clergy, will
conſiſt in <hi>pleaſing the Great Ones</hi> of the World; for <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi>
and <hi>Worldly Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and to be made
the <hi>Rulers</hi> of their Brethren, and to have <hi>their Wills:</hi>
And the Intereſt of <hi>Hereticks</hi> will be to have <hi>Many</hi> to be
of their <hi>Own Opinion</hi> to Admire them: And the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of upright Miniſters, will be to pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
the Goſpel, Increaſe the Church, and Save Mens
Souls. Yet ſo that they have a <hi>Subordinate Interest,</hi> for
Food and Rayment, and Families, and neceſſary Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59455:8"/>
which they are too apt to overvalue.</p>
            <p>42. Therefore, it will be the <hi>Great Trade</hi> of the
WORLDLY Clergy, to pleaſe and flatter the Rulers of
the World, and by all artificial Inſinuations, and by
their Friends, to Work themſelves into their <hi>Favour,</hi>
and by Scorns and Calumnies, to Work out all other
that are againſt their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>43. And it will be the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that have ſomewhat more

of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>44. And it will be the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Faithful Miniſters,</hi> to
Save Mens Souls. But with ſuch various <hi>Degrees</hi> of
<hi>Self-denyal</hi> or <hi>Selfiſhneſs,</hi> as they have various Degrees
of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>45. Many Great and Piouſly diſpoſed Princes, like
Conſtantine, will think that to <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Advance</hi> the
Clergy, into Worldly <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wealth,</hi> is to Honour
<hi>God</hi> and the Chriſtian Religion: And Great Munificence
is fit for their own Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>46. And becauſe ſuch <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Wealth</hi> cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be beſtowed on <hi>All;</hi> it muſt make a great Diſpari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

            <p>47. And the unavoidable <hi>Weakneſs, Paſſions,</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
of the Clergy, will make Rulers think, that there
is a <hi>Neceſſity;</hi> that beſides the <hi>Civil Government,</hi> there

to keep them in order, obedience, and Peace.</p>
            <p>48. <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> will abuſe this Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

And they will ſet themſelves to <hi>defend</hi> it, againſt all that

            <p>55. The Doctrine and Practiſe of Humility, Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Contempt of the World, forſaking all, taking

it; their <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Intereſts</hi> are at Enmity to it.</p>
            <p>56. <hi>Such Men</hi> will make <hi>Church-Canons</hi> according to

            </p>
            <p>64. That which is but a <hi>Weed</hi> among theſe Flowers, the

much more diſlike the <hi>Loathſome Face of Death</hi> (or <hi>life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs</hi>)
in their Religion.</p>
            <p>65. Theſe differences of <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Practiſe,</hi> will En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
both Parties in ſome kind of Oppoſition to each
other. The <hi>Worldly Clergy</hi> or <hi>Hipocrites,</hi> will have Heart-riſings
againſt the Miniſters and People that think mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of them, and will take it for their Intereſt to bring
them down. For Enmity is hardly reſtrained from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.
And <hi>Cain</hi> will be Wrath, that <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrifice
is better accepted than his own.</p>
            <p>66. The better Miniſters, will be apt through <hi>Paſſion,</hi>
to ſpeak too diſhonourably of the other: And the <hi>raſh,</hi>
and <hi>younger ſort,</hi> and the Heretical Hypocrites that fall
in with <hi>them,</hi> will take it for part of a <hi>Godly Zeal</hi> to
ſpeak againſt them to the People, in ſuch Words as
<hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed of the Scribes and Phariſees.</p>
            <p>67. Hereupon the Exaſperations of each Party, will
be increaſed more and more; And the <hi>Powerful Worldly</hi>
Clergy, will think it their Intereſt, to deviſe ſome new
Impoſitions, which they know the other cannot yield
to, to work them out.</p>
            <p>68. Whether they be <hi>Oaths, Subſcriptions, Words,</hi> or
<hi>Actions;</hi> which they believe to be <hi>againſt Gods Word,</hi> the
Spiritual, and Upright part of the Clergy and People,
will not perform them; reſolving to obey <hi>God,</hi> rather
than Man.</p>
            <p>69. Hereupon the <hi>Worldly</hi> part will take their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and call them <hi>Diſobedient, Stubborn, Proud, Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
Self opinioned,</hi> diſturbers of the publick Peace and
Order, <hi>Peſtilent fellows, and movers of Sedition among the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59455:10"/>
People,</hi> that will let nothing be quiet, but <hi>Turn the World
upſide-down,</hi> Act. 24. 5, 6. And will Endeavour to bring
them to <hi>ſuch Sufferings,</hi> as Men really Guilty of ſuch
Crimes deſerve.</p>
            <p>70. And becauſe the ſuffering, and diſſenting party
of Miniſters, when ſilenced will leave many Vacancies in
the Churches they will be fain to fill them with men,
how Empty and Unworthy ſoever, that are of their own
Spirit, and will be true to their Intereſts.</p>
            <p>71. The Exaſperation of their Sufferings, will make
many, otherwiſe ſober Miniſters too impatient, and to
give their Tongues leave to take down the Honour of
the Clergy, whom they ſuffer by more than beſeemeth
men of Humility, Charity, and Patience.</p>
            <p>72. When the <hi>People,</hi> that moſt eſteem their Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miniſters, are deprived of their Labours, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
of the reſt, and <hi>themſelves</hi> alſo Afflicted with
them; it will ſtir up in them an inordinate, unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
paſſionate Zeal; which will corrupt their very Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and make them ſpeak unſeemly things, and Pray
for the downfal of that Clergy, which they take to be
the Enemies of <hi>God,</hi> and Godlineſs. And they will think
that to ſpeak eaſily or Charitably of ſuch Men, as dare
forbid <hi>Chriſts</hi> Miniſters to Preach his Goſpel, and by
Notorious Sacriledge, Alienate the Perſons, and Gifts
that were Conſecrated ſolemnly to <hi>God;</hi> is but to be
Luke-warm, and indifferent between <hi>God</hi> and the
Devil.</p>
            <p>73. And when they take them as Enemies to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to themſelves, the younger and raſher ſort of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters;
but much <hi>more</hi> the <hi>people,</hi> will grow into a Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all that they ſee their Afflicters ſtand for: They
will diſlike not only their <hi>Faults;</hi> but many <hi>harmleſs
things,</hi> yea many <hi>laudable customes</hi> which <hi>they</hi> uſe; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59455:10"/>
will grow into ſome Superſtition in Oppoſition to them,
making <hi>new Sins</hi> in the manner of Worſhip, which
<hi>God</hi> never forbad or made to be ſins; and taking up
<hi>new Duties,</hi> which God never made Duties; yea ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forſake
ſome old &amp; wholeſome <hi>Doctrines;</hi> becauſe their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicters
own them, and to take up ſome <hi>new unſound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines,</hi>
and Expoſitions of <hi>Gods</hi> Word; becauſe they are
inclined by <hi>Opinion,</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> conjoyned, to go as <hi>far</hi> as
may be from ſuch Men, whom they think ſo bad of.</p>
            <p>74. And the vulgar People that have but little ſenſe of
Religion (that are not by the foreſaid <hi>Intereſt,</hi> United to
the <hi>Afflicting Clergy</hi>) having a Reverence to the worth
of thoſe that are <hi>Afflicted,</hi> and an Experience of the raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and differing lives of many that poſſeſs their Rooms,
will grow to <hi>Compaſſionate</hi> the <hi>Afflicted,</hi> and to think
that they are <hi>injured themſelves,</hi> and ſo to think hardly
of the cauſers of all this.</p>
            <p>75. Hereupon the <hi>Powerful</hi> Clergy, will Increaſe their
Accuſations againſt the Party that is againſt them, and
Declare to the World in Print and Pulpits, their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
unpeaceableneſs, unrulineſs, giddineſs, falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and conceits about the manner of Worſhip, and
how unſufferable a ſort of Men they are.</p>
            <p>76. By this time the Devil will have done the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
part of his Work; which is to <hi>Deſtroy much of
Christian Love</hi> to one another, and make them take each
other for <hi>unlovely odious Perſons:</hi> The one part, for <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
Enemies of Godlineſs, and Hypocrites, and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees:</hi>
The other for <hi>peviſh, ſeditious, turbulent, unruly
Sectaries.</hi> And on theſe ſupoſitions, all their after Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
affections and practiſes towards each other will
proceed.</p>
            <p>77. By this Enmity and Oppoſition againſt each other,
both Parties will increaſe in Wrath, and ſomewhere in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59455:11"/>
Numbers. The <hi>Worldly Afflicting Clergy</hi> will multiply
not only ſuch as are <hi>diſaffected</hi> to them, but downright
<hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and <hi>Sectaries</hi> that will run as far from them
as they can, into contrary Extreams. For when they
are once brought into a diſtaſt of the old Hive, the Bees
will hardly gather into one new one; but will divide
into ſeveral Swarms and Hives. As every Mans Zeal is
more againſt the <hi>Afflicting</hi> party; ſo he will go <hi>further</hi>
from them: Some to be <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi>
ſome <hi>Antinomians,</hi> ſome <hi>Seekers,</hi> ſome <hi>Quakers,</hi> and
ſome to they know not what themſelves.</p>
            <p>78. For the <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Apprentices,</hi> and <hi>Novices</hi> in
Chriſtianity, that have more Paſſion than Judgment,
will abundance of them quite over-run, even their own
<hi>Afflicted Teachers,</hi> and will <hi>forſake them</hi> if <hi>they</hi> will not
<hi>over-run</hi> their <hi>own Judgments,</hi> in forſaking thoſe that do
Afflict them.</p>
            <p>79. And many Hypocrites that have no ſound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
but <hi>Ignorance, Pride,</hi> and <hi>U<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

thruſt in among them, in theſe diſcontents; or ſpring
up in the Nurceries of theſe Bryers of Paſſion, and will
bring in New Doctrines, and New ways of Worſhip,
and make themſelves Preachers, and the Heads of Sects:
By Reaſon of whom, the way of Truth ſhall be Evil
ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>80. And many unſtable Perſons ſeeing this, will dread
and loath ſo giddy a ſort of men, and will turn <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
upon the perſwaſions of them that tell them, that there
is no true Unity nor Conſiſtency, but at <hi>Rome;</hi> and that
all muſt thus turn giddy at laſt, that are not fixed in
the Papal Head. And thus they that fly <hi>too far</hi> from
the <hi>Common Prayer Book,</hi> will drive men to the <hi>Maſs,</hi>
and the <hi>afflicters</hi> will make <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and the <hi>Sectaries</hi>
will make <hi>Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59455:11"/>
81. When the <hi>Violent</hi> Clergy, inſtead of a Fatherly
Government of the Flocks, have driven the People into
Paſſions, Diſtempers, and Uncharitable diſaffections to
themſelves, and have alſo been the great Cauſe of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
Hereſies, and Sects by the ſame means, inſtead
of being Humbled and Penitent for their Sin, they will
be hardened, and juſtify all their violences, by the gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
and miſcarriages of thoſe Sectaries, which they
themſelves have made.</p>
            <p>82. And when they publiſh the faults of ſuch, for
the juſtification of their own violence, they will draw
Thouſands into an Approbation of their Courſes, (to think
that ſuch a turbulent people can never be too hardly called or
uſed) and Conſequently into a participation of their Guilt.</p>
            <p>83. By all this, the Diſſenters will be ſtill more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated
from them; and many will aggravate the Crime
of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> that <hi>Conform to their Impoſitions,</hi> and
obey them; And for the ſake of a <hi>few that Afflict them,</hi>
they will Condemn many Laudable Conforming Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
that never conſented to it; but could heartily wiſh,
that it were otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>84. And the younger, and indiſcreeter paſſionate ſort,
will frequently reproach ſuch, as <hi>unconſionable temporizers,</hi>
that will <hi>do any thing</hi> for Worldly Ends, and that as
<hi>Hypocrites</hi> for a Fleſhly Intereſt, concur with the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters,
and Afflicters of the Godly.</p>
            <p>85. Theſe <hi>cenſures</hi> and <hi>reproaches,</hi> will provoke thoſe
<hi>Conforming Miniſters,</hi> who are not maſters of their <hi>paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
nor Conquerors of their <hi>Pride,</hi> to think as bad of
the Cenſurers, as their <hi>Afflicters</hi> do, and to joyn with
them in the diſplaying of all their Enormities, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their further Sufferings, and publiſhing the folly and
turbulency of their Spirits, with Spleen and Partiality.</p>
            <p>86. By theſe kind of Speeches, Preachings, and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59455:12"/>
Multitudes of the Debaucht will be hardened in their
Sin againſt all Religion: For when they obſerve that it
is the ſame party of Men, who are thus Reproached, that
are the ſtricteſt reprovers of their Lewdneſs, their
Fornicatious, Tipling, Gaming, Luxuries, and Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
they will think that it's no great matter, what
ſuch a defamed giddy ſort of People ſay, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
they are worſe themſelves.</p>
            <p>87. Each party of theſe Adverſaries, will Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
the adverſe Party as Hypocrites: The <hi>Paſſionate Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers,</hi>
will call the <hi>Afflicters,</hi> [<hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
that have no Religion, but a formal ſhew of outſide Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
and Words, and that <hi>Tythe, Mint,</hi> and <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
and waſh the outſide, while within, they are full

loving the uppermoſt Seats, and great Titles, and
Ceremonious Philacteries, whilſt they are Enemies to
the Preaching of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and get Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
to themſelves, and devour not only the Houſes,
but the Peace, and Lives of others, under pretence of
long Liturgies; and that devour the living Saints, while
they keep Holy-days, and build Monuments for the
dead ones, whom their Fathers Murdered, <hi>&amp;c</hi>] And
the <hi>Powerful</hi> Clergy, will call the <hi>others Hypocrites,</hi> and
labour to ſhew that the Phariſees Character belongeth
to them, and that their pretences of ſtrictneſs in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and their long Praying and Preaching, is but a
Cloak to cover their Diſobedience, and Covetouſneſs,
and ſecret Sins; and that their Hearts, and inſide, is
as bad as others, and that their Fervency in Devotion,
is but an Hypocritical, Affected, Whining, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
and that they are worſe, than the leſſer Religious
ſort of People; becauſe they are more Unpeaceable, and

88. The Ignorant, Worldlings, Drunkards, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
deſpiſers of Holineſs and Heaven, being in all
Countrys moſt contradicted in their way, by this ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſort of Men, and hearing them in Pulpit, and Preſs
ſo brandid for Hypocrites, will joyfully unite themſelves
with the Cenſurers; and ſo they will <hi>make up</hi> as <hi>one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
in crying down the <hi>Preciſe Hypocrites;</hi> and uſually
make ſome <hi>Name</hi> to call them by, as their brand of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ignominy: And they will live the more quietly in all

Preciſeſt, that make more ſhew, but have no more Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
but more Hypocriſy than themſelves.</p>
            <p>89. The <hi>Suffering</hi> Party, ſeeing the <hi>Ungodly,</hi> and the

Lead on all the moſt Ungodly, againſt <hi>ſerious Godlineſs,</hi>

            <p>90. And the young and indifferent ſort of People in

be ready to judge of the Cauſe by the Perſons; and
ſeeing ſo many of the Dignified <hi>Advanced Clergy,</hi> and the

            <p>91. All this while the <hi>Nonconforming Miniſters,</hi> will

            <p>Some of them will think theſe Paſſions of the People
needful, to check the Fierceneſs of the Afflicters (which

            <p>Some of the <hi>younger</hi> or <hi>more injudicious hot-brain'd</hi> ſort

            <p>94. And they will carry about among themſelves, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
falſe Reports and Slanders againſt them; Partly becauſe
<hi>Paſſion</hi> taketh off Charity, and Tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and partly becauſe an <hi>Opinionative Modal, and
Siding Religiouſneſs,</hi> hath ever <hi>more Followers,</hi> and a <hi>quicker
Zeal,</hi> than <hi>true Holineſs;</hi> And partly becauſe they will
think that <hi>humane converſe</hi> obligeth them to <hi>believe</hi> the
Reports, which thoſe that are accounted good Men utter;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59455:14"/>
And partly becauſe that they will think, that the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of their Cauſe (which they think is Gods) doth
need the Suppreſſion of theſe Mens Credit, and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that are againſt it.</p>
            <p>95. But the greater part of the honeſt Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
Miniſters, will diſlike the headineſs, and raſhneſs
of the Novices, and the Sectaries; and will approve of
the aforeſaid moderate Wayes. But their opportunities,
and diſpoſitions of Expreſſing it, will be various. Some
of them will do it freely, whatever be thought of it;
And ſome of them that have impatient Auditors, will
think that it is no duty to attempt that which will not
be endured, and that it is better to do what good they
can, than none. And ſome will think, that ſeeing the
<hi>Worldly</hi> Clergy <hi>forbid</hi> them to Preach the <hi>Goſpel of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
they are not <hi>bound</hi> to keep up any of <hi>their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
or <hi>Intereſt,</hi> as long as they have themſelves no
hand in the Extreams, and Paſſions of the People. And
ſome that have Wives and Children, and nothing but
the Peoples Charity to find them Food and Rayment,
being turned out of all publike Maintenance by their
Afflicters, and Proſecuted ſtill with continued violence,
will think that it is not their duty, to beg their Bread
from door to door; nor to turn their Families to be
kept on the Almes of the Pariſh, by loſing the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe People, whoſe Charity only they can expect
Relief from: And therefore, they will think that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
and Preſervation of their Families Lives and
Health, will better <hi>excuſe</hi> their <hi>ſilence,</hi> when they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
not thoſe that would Deſtroy them, againſt the
overmuch Oppoſition of the People; than the Command
of their Afflicters will excuſe their ſilence, if they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to Preach the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> And ſome will think, that
finding themſelves <hi>hated,</hi> and <hi>hunted</hi> by <hi>one party;</hi> if they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59455:15"/>
loſe the Affection of the <hi>other</hi> alſo, they ſhall have none
to do their Office with, nor to do <hi>any good to;</hi> and that
they ſhall but leave the People whom they diſpleaſe, to
follow thoſe paſſionate Leaders, that will tempt them
to more dangerous Extremities, againſt the Peace of
Chriſtian Societies.</p>
            <p>But the moſt judicious and reſolved Miniſters, that
Live not on the Favour or Maintenanee of the People,
or are quite above all Worldly Intereſt, will behave
themſelves <hi>wiſely, moderately,</hi> and yet <hi>reſolvedly;</hi> and will
do nothing, that ſhall diſtaſte ſober and wiſe Men, nor
yet deſpiſe the Souls of the moſt Impotent or Indiſcreet;
but by ſolid Principles, endeavour to build them upon
ſolid Grounds; and to uſe them with the Tenderneſs,
as Nurſes ſhould do their crying Children. But yet they
will not cheriſh their Sin, under the Pretence of profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Souls; nor by Silence, be guilty of their Blood;
nor ſo much as connive at thoſe dangerous Extreams,
that ſeem to ſerve ſome preſent Exigence and Jobb: but
threaten future Ruine to the <hi>Churches,</hi> and Diſhonour to the
<hi>Chriſtian Cauſe.</hi> And therefore, they reſolve not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the Duties of Charity, to the Bittereſt of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors:
And the rather, becauſe that it will prove in
the end, a Charity to the Church, and to the Souls of
the Paſſionate, whoſe Charity they labour to keep alive.
And Silence at Sin, is contrary to their Truſt and Office:
And they will not be Guilty of that Carnal Wiſdom,
which would do Evil, that Good may come by it; or
that dare not ſeek to cure the Principles of Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Diviſions, or Extremities in the People, for fear of
loſing Advantages of doing them Good; or that dare
not diſown unlawful <hi>Schiſms</hi> and <hi>Separations,</hi> for fear of
encouraging thoſe Malignants, that call lawful Practices
by that Name. They will do <hi>God</hi>'s Work (though with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59455:15"/>
Prudence, and not deſtructive Raſhneſs, yet) with Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Self-Denyal. And they will lay at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Feet,
not only their Intereſt, in the Favour of Superiors; and
their Peace; and Safety, and Liberty, and Eſtates, and
Lives, which are expoſed to Malignant Cruelty, among
the <hi>Cainites</hi> of the World: but alſo, all the Good Thoughts,
and Words, and Favour of the Religious ſort of People,
yea, and Paſtors too. And they will look more to the
Intereſt of the <hi>Whole Church,</hi> than of a <hi>Narrow Party;</hi>
and of <hi>Poſterity,</hi> than of the <hi>Preſent Time:</hi> As knowing,
that at long-running, its only <hi>Truth</hi> that will ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-moſt;
when <hi>Malignant Violence,</hi> and <hi>Sectarian Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
are both run out of Breath. And therefore, in Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
and Godly Sincerity, they will have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
in the World; and not in Fleſhly Wiſdom,
or Selfiſh-blinding-Paſſions, or Factions. Let all Men uſe
them how they will, or judge or call them what they
will; they will not therefore be falſe to <hi>God,</hi> and to
their Conſciences. And ſeeing it is their <hi>Office</hi> to <hi>Govern</hi>
and <hi>Teach</hi> the People, they will not be <hi>Governed</hi> by the
<hi>Favour</hi> of the moſt <hi>Cenſorious, Ignorant,</hi> or <hi>Proud;</hi> but
will Guide them as Faithful Teachers, till they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
by them, and diſabled. But the Sober, Antient,
Wiſe, and Experienced, will alwayes cleave to them,
and forſake the Giddy and Sectarian way.</p>
            <p>96. In the Heat of theſe Extremities, the moſt <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
and ſober Part, both of the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi>
will be in beſt Eſteem with the grave and
ſober People; but in the grateſt Streight, with both
the Extreams.</p>
            <p>97. The <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>Peaceable Conformiſts,</hi> will get the
Love of the <hi>Sober,</hi> by their Holy <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Lives:</hi> But
they will be <hi>deſpiſed</hi> by the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> becauſe they <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59455:16"/>
and they will be <hi>ſuſpected</hi> by the Proud and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
<hi>Clergy,</hi> as <hi>leaning</hi> to the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them by their Favour; becauſe theſe Miniſters will,
in all their Pariſhes, more love and honour the Godly
<hi>Non-conformists,</hi> than the Irreligious, <hi>Ignorant,</hi> Wordly,
Dead-hearted Multitude, or the Malignant Enemies of
Godlyneſs.</p>
            <p>98. Hereupon theſe <hi>Conformiſts</hi> being taken for the
chief Upholders of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> will be under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Jealouſies, and Rebukes. And perhaps, new Points
of Conformity ſhall be deviſed, to be impoſed on them,
which it is known, their Conſciences are againſt; that
ſo they may be forced alſo to be <hi>Non-conformists:</hi> Becauſe
Secret Enemies are more dangerous, than Open Foes.</p>
            <p>99. Theſe <hi>Conformiſts</hi> being thus troubled, will ſeel
alſo the ſtirring of Paſſion in themſelves; and by the
Injury, will be tempted to think more hardly of their
Afflicters, than before: And ſo will Part of them, turn
down-right <hi>Non-conformiſts;</hi> and the other Part will live
in Diſpleaſure, till they ſee an Opportunity to ſhew it.
And theſe are the likeſt to croſs and weaken the <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Perſecuting Clergy,</hi> of any Men.</p>
            <p>100. And as for the <hi>Moderate Nonconformiſts,</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<hi>what</hi> they do, and <hi>why,</hi> and ſeek the <hi>Reconciling</hi>
of all Diſſenters; they will alſo be Loved and Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Sober, Grave, and Experienced <hi>Chriſtians:</hi>
But both Extreams will be againſt them. The <hi>Sectaries</hi>
will ſay, as before, That they are Luke-warm, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
Selfiſh, Complying-<hi>Men:</hi> The <hi>proud impoſing-Clergy</hi>
will ſay, That it is they that have drawn the People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
theſe Extreams; and then complain of them, that
they cannot Rule them. And they will tell them, That
till they Conform themſelves, their Moderation doth. but.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59455:16"/>
ſtrengthen the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> and keep up the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sobriety among them. And the nearer they come
to <hi>Conformity,</hi> the more dangerous they are; as being
more able to ſupplant it. And thus the <hi>Moderate</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilers,</hi>
will be as the Wedge that is preſt by both
Sides, in the Cleft of <hi>Church-Diviſions:</hi> And no <hi>Side</hi>
liketh them, becauſe they are not given up to the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Paſſions, or Intereſt of Either.</p>
            <p>101. Only thoſe will, in all theſe Extremities and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
keep their Integrity; who are, 1. Wiſe. 2. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Self-denying. 3. Charitable, and principled with
a Spirit of Love. 4. And do take the Favour of <hi>God,</hi>
and Heaven alone, for their Hope and Portion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
becometh of them in the World. But the WORLD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
Perſecuting, and the SECTARIAN Party, will be
both conſtituted by theſe Contrary Principles; 1. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Error. 2. Pride of their own Underſtandings;
every one thinking, that all are Intollerable, that are not
of their Mind and Way. 3. Uncharitableneſs, Malice, or
want of Love to others, as to themſelves. 4. And over-valuing
their Worldly Accommodations, Honours, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
            <p>102. Hereupon the <hi>Inſtruments of a Fooliſh Shepherd,</hi>
will ſtill be uſed to the greater Scattering of the Flocks.
And becauſe none are ſo able to Diſpute againſt them,
as the <hi>Moderate;</hi> therefore they will be taken for their
moſt dangerous Adverſaries: And when they are <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclined</hi> to the <hi>Healing</hi> of theſe Wounds, the <hi>Violent</hi> and
<hi>Lordly will not ſuffer them;</hi> but will pour <hi>Oyl</hi> upon the
<hi>Flames,</hi> which <hi>Moderate Men</hi> would quench. And (as
if they were Blindfolding and Scourging <hi>Chriſt</hi> again)
they will follow the People with afflicting Wounds; and
then charge the <hi>Moderate Miniſters,</hi> with their Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59455:17"/>
and charge them, to reduce them to Peace and
Conformity. And if they cannot get them to Love and
Honour thoſe that are ſtill Scourging them with <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,</hi>
the Scourgers will lay the Blame on theſe Miniſters;
and ſay, It is all long of them, that the People love not
thoſe that Wound them. And they that <hi>cry out</hi> moſt
for <hi>Peace,</hi> will not <hi>endure</hi> it; nor give the Peace-makers
leave to do any thing, that will accompliſh it: nor will
keep the <hi>Spurr</hi> out of the Peoples Sides, whilſt they look
that others (ſpur'd more Sharply)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould hold the Reins;
which yet, at the ſame time, they take out of their
Hands, and <hi>forbid</hi> them to hold, by forbidding them to
<hi>Preach the Goſpel.</hi> So that, it will be the Sum of their
Expectations, [<hi>Perform not the Office of Pastors, nor Preach
the Goſpel of Peace and Piety to the People, any more: But
yet, without Preaching to them, ſee that you Teach them all
to Love and Honour us, while we Silence you, and Afflict them;
or elſe we will account you Intollerable, Seditious Schiſmaticks,
and uſe you as ſuch.</hi>]</p>
            <p>103. In ſome Kingdomes or Countries, it will be
thought, that the People will be brought to no Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the <hi>Lordly Paſtors,</hi> till their moſt <hi>able</hi> or <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Miniſters,</hi> are kept from them, by Baniſhment, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
or Confinement: Which will accordingly
be done.</p>
            <p>104. When the Miniſters are Baniſhed or Removed,
that reſtrained the Peoples Paſſions, the People will make
Preachers of <hi>themſelves;</hi> even ſuch as are ſuited to their
Minds.</p>
            <p>105. Where <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Hereticks</hi> are ſhut out by Laws,
they will ſecretly contribute the utmoſt of their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
to make the Sufferings of <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants,</hi> as
grievous as poſſibly they can; that in deſpite of them,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59455:17"/>
their own Neceſſities may compel them, to cry out for
<hi>Liberty;</hi> till they procured a common Tolleration for all,
and opened the Door for <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as well
as for <hi>Themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>104. Surely, Oppreſſion will make Wiſe Men Mad, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi>
7. 7.</p>
            <p>107. <hi>Mad Men</hi> will ſpeak <hi>Madly,</hi> and do <hi>Madly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>108. They that ſpeak and do <hi>madly,</hi> will be thought
meeteſt for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and for Chains.</p>
            <p>109. When the <hi>Miniſters</hi> are Baniſhed or Removed,
and the People left to their Paſſions, and their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made-Guides
and Teachers; paſſionate Women and
Boyes, and unſetled Novices, will run into unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Words and Deeds; and will think thoſe Means
lawful, which ſeem to promiſe them Deliverance, though
they be ſuch as <hi>God</hi> forbiddeth.</p>
            <p>110. The Seditions and Miſcarriages of ſome <hi>Few</hi> will
be imputed to the <hi>Innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>111. For the ſake of ſuch Miſcarriages, in ſome King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
the Sword will be drawn againſt them, and the
Blood of many will be ſhed.</p>
            <p>112. Hereupon the miſ-guided, paſſionate Youth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Proud <hi>Clergy,</hi> deprived of the Preſence of that
Miniſtry that ſhould <hi>moderate</hi> them, are like enough to
think Rebellion, and Reſiſting of Authority, a Lawful
Means for their own Preſervation: And will plead the
Law of Nature, and Neceſſity, for their Juſtification.</p>
            <p>113. If any of the Sober, Wiſe, Experienced Paſtors
be left among them, that would reſtrain them from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
ways, and perſwade them to patient Suffering;
they will be taken for complying betrayers of Religion,
and of the Peoples Lives; that would have them tamely
Surrender their Throats to Butchery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59455:18"/>
As in a Parentheſis, I will give them ſome inſtances
for this Prognoſtick.</p>
            <p>1. The great Lord <hi>Du Pl<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſis</hi> (one of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Noble-Men that ever the Earth Bore, that is known
to us by any Hiſtory) being againſt the holding of an
Aſſembly of the <hi>French</hi> Churches, againſt the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
was rejected by the Aſſembly, as complying
with the Courtiers, (becauſe they ſaid, the King had
before promiſed, or granted them that Aſſembly): But
the refuſing of his Counſel, coſt the Blood of many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Proteſtants; and the loſs of all their Garriſons, and
Powers, and that lowneſs of the Proteſtant Intereſt there,
that we ſee at this Day.</p>
            <p>2. The great Divine <hi>Peter De Moulin,</hi> was alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Rochellers</hi> Proceedings againſt the Kings Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions
(and ſo were ſome chief Proteſtant Nobles): But
he was rejected by his own party; who paid for it, by
the Blood of Thouſands, and their ruin.</p>
            <p>3. I lately Read of a King of <hi>France,</hi> that hearing
that the Proteſtants made Verſes and Paſquels againſt
the Maſs and Proceſſions of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> made a ſevere
Law to prohibit it: When they durſt not break that
Law, their indiſcreet Zeal carried them to make certain
ridiculous Pictures of the Maſſe-Prieſts, and the Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
which moderate Miniſters would have diſwaded
them from, but were accounted Temporizers and Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm:
By which the King being exaſperated, ſhut up
the Proteſtant Churches, took away their Liberties, and
it coſt many Thouſand Men their Lives. And the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was, Whether <hi>God</hi> had Commanded ſuch Jears,
and Scorns, and Pictures, to be made at ſo dear a rate,
as the rooting out of the Churches, and Religion, and
the Peoples Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59455:18"/>
4. Great <hi>Camero</hi> (one of the moſt judicious Divines in the
World) was in <hi>Montabon</hi> when it ſtood out in Arms againſt
the King (accounted formerly impregnable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) He was againſt
their Reſiſtance, &amp; perſwaded them to ſubmit. The People
of his own Religion, reviled him as a Traytor: one of the
Souldiers threatned to run him Through: In a Scottiſh
Paſſion he unbuttoned his Doublet, and cryed, <hi>Feri mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
Strike varlet,</hi> or <hi>do thy worſt;</hi> And in the heat, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to get his own Goods out of the City, fell into a
Feavor and Dyed: The City was taken, and the reſt
of the holds through the Kingdom after it, to the great
fall of all the Proteſtants, and the loſs of many Thouſand
Lives.</p>
            <p>114. Where the Devil can bring differences to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of Violence, the iſſues are not hard to be conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
fore-ſeen; but are ſuch as my Prognoſticks ſhall
no further meddle with, than to foretell you, that both
ſides are <hi>preparing</hi> for the Increaſe of their <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,</hi>
and at laſt for <hi>Repentance,</hi> or ruinous Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
if they do, as I have deſcribed.</p>
            <p>115. Carnal and diſcontented States-men, and Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
will ſet in on both ſides, to blow the Coals, and
draw on feuds for their own Ends, and head the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
People to their Ruine.</p>
            <p>116. But in thoſe Countrys, where the difference ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cometh to ſuch diſorders, there will be a War bred,
and kept up in the <hi>Peoples Hearts;</hi> and Neighbours will
be againſt Neighbours, as <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Gibellines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>117. When Kingdomes are thus weakened by inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
diſcontents; it will increaſe the Hopes and Plots of
forreign Enemies; and make them think that one Party
(that Suffer) will be backward to their own defence, as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59455:19"/>
thinking they can be no worſe (which is the Hopes of
the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Hungary.</hi>)</p>
            <p>118. It will be a great injury, and grief, and danger
to Chriſtian Kings and States, to have their Kingdomes
and Common-wealths thus weakened, and the Cordial
Love, and Aſſiſtance of their Subjects made ſo looſe and
ſo uncertain.</p>
            <p>119. And it will be a continual vexation to Wiſe and
Peaceable Princes, to Govern ſuch divided, diſcontented
People; But to rule a United, Loving, Concordant, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
People, will be their Delight and Joy.</p>
            <p>120. A WORLDLY, Covetous, Proud, Domineering,
Malignant, Lazy <hi>Clergy,</hi> will in moſt Chriſtian Nations,
be the great Plague of the World, and troublers of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Dividers of Churches; who, for the Intereſt of
their <hi>Grandure,</hi> and their <hi>Wills,</hi> will not give the Sober,
and Peaceable, and Godly Miniſters, or People, Leave
to ſerve <hi>God</hi> quietly, and live in Peace. And the <hi>Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
Self-conceited, Sectarian Spirit,</hi> which like <hi>Gun-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
takes Fire upon ſuch Injuries, is the ſecondary divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Churches, and hinderer of Chriſtian Love and
Peace; and by their <hi>mutual Enmity</hi> and <hi>abuſes,</hi> they will
drive each other ſo far into the Extremity of Averſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Oppoſition, that they will but <hi>make each other
Mad;</hi> and then like Mad-men, <hi>run</hi> and <hi>quarrel,</hi> while
ſober Men ſtand by and pitty them; but can help nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the one party, nor the other, nor preſerve their
own, or the publike Peace.</p>
            <p>121. The grand Endeavour of the Worldly <hi>Clergy,</hi>
will be (in moſt Kingdoms of the World) to <hi>Engage Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
on their ſide,</hi> and to <hi>borrow their Sword,</hi> to do their work
with, againſt Gain-ſayers: For they have no <hi>Confidence</hi>
in the <hi>Power of the Keys;</hi> but will <hi>deſpiſe</hi> them <hi>ſecretly</hi> in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59455:19"/>
their Hearts, as <hi>leaden, uneffectual Weapons,</hi> while they
make it the <hi>glory</hi> of their <hi>order,</hi> that the <hi>Power of the
Keys is theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>122. If Princes ſuppreſs diſorders by the Sword, the
ſaid <hi>Clergy</hi> will aſcribe the honor of it to themſelves;
and ſay, It was <hi>their order,</hi> that kept up ſo much Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the Churches: And when they have put Princes
to that trouble, will aſſume to themſelves the praiſe.</p>
            <p>123. The Devil will ſet in, and do his utmoſt, to make
both Rulers and People believe, that all this Confuſion
is long of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and the ſtrict Principles
of the <hi>Sacred Scriptures;</hi> and ſo to make Men caſt off
all Religion, and take Chriſtianity to be contrary to their
Natural and Civil Intereſts.</p>
            <p>124. And the <hi>Papists</hi> will every where perſwade High
and Low, that all this cometh by meddling ſo much
with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and buſying the Common People with
<hi>Religion;</hi> and leaving every Man to be a <hi>Diſcerning Judge</hi>
of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> inſtead of truſting <hi>implicitely,</hi> in the
Judgment of their <hi>Church:</hi> And ſo they would tempt
<hi>Princes,</hi> tamely to ſurrender <hi>half their Government</hi> (that
is, in all Matters of <hi>Religion</hi>) to the <hi>Pope;</hi> and perſwade
the <hi>People,</hi> to Reſign their <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Humanity</hi> to him;
(that He who is ſo <hi>far off,</hi> may Rule it all over the

and to make the reſt <hi>thought worſe</hi> of than they are,

Prognoſtication
OF THE
CHANGES
That will be in
CHRISTENDOM,
IN THE
Golden Age,
AND
Time of True Reformation and Unity.</head>
            <p>1. BEcauſe it is made part of our Prayers, [<hi>Thy
Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven</hi>] and
[<hi>We look for a New Heaven, and a New
Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs</hi>] I hope,
their Opinion is not True, who think that
the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhall ſtill grow liker and liker to <hi>Hell,</hi> till the
general Conflagration turn it <hi>into Hell,</hi> and make it the
proper Seat of the <hi>Damned.</hi> Yet, leſt this <hi>ſhould prove
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59455:22"/>
True,</hi> I will place my Chiefeſt <hi>Hopes in Heaven;</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
who ſaid, [<hi>Sell all, and follow me, and thou ſhalt
have Treaſure in Heaven;</hi>] (and not on Earth.) But <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,</hi>
that ever the World will come to <hi>Full Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>Concord,</hi> (which I am uncertain of, but do not
deſpair of) I proceed to my <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> of the way.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>God</hi> will ſtir up ſome <hi>happy King,</hi> or <hi>Governour,</hi> in
ſome Country of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> endowed with <hi>Wiſdom</hi>
and <hi>conſideration;</hi> who ſhall diſcern the true <hi>nature</hi> of
<hi>Godlyneſs</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the Neceſſity and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of <hi>ſerious Religion;</hi> and ſhall ſee what is the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi>
and <hi>Hinderance</hi> of it, in the VVorld: and ſhall
place his <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Felicity</hi> in <hi>pleaſing God,</hi> and <hi>doing
Good,</hi> and attaining <hi>everlaſting Happyneſs:</hi> and ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
all worldly Reſpects, unto theſe high and glorious
Ends. And ſhall know, that <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Godlyneſs,</hi> and
<hi>Juſtice,</hi> leave the moſt <hi>precious Name</hi> on Earth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for the moſt <hi>Glorious Reward</hi> in Heaven: In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of which, all <hi>fleſhly Pomp</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> is Droſs
and Dung, and worthy of nothing but Contempt.</p>
            <p>3. This <hi>Prince</hi> ſhall have a <hi>diſcerning Mind,</hi> to know
<hi>Wiſe Men</hi> from <hi>Fooliſh, Good</hi> from <hi>Bad;</hi> and among the
Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to diſcern the <hi>Judicious, Spiritual, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
Sober, Charitable,</hi> and <hi>Peaceable</hi> ſort, from <hi>Self-ſeeking,
Worldly</hi> Men; that make but a Trade of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
and ſtrive not ſo much for <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Salvation,</hi> as they do for worldly <hi>Honours, Power,</hi> and

<hi>Churches,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and cauſe Diviſions, and ſtir
up Violence, for their own VVorldly Intereſts, and

            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59455:22"/>
4. He will take the Councel neither of <hi>Worldlings,</hi> nor
true <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and dividing Perſons; but of the <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Godly, Self-denying, Sober, Peaceable Divines;</hi> with his
<hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Reverend Senators, Judges,</hi> and <hi>Counſellors;</hi> that
know what is <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and what belongeth to
the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> as well as to the true Intereſt of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and of Mens Souls.</p>
            <p>5. He will <hi>know</hi> thoſe Men, whom he is concerned to
uſe, and to judge of, as far as may be, by <hi>Perſonal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi>
and <hi>Obſervation;</hi> and not by the <hi>partial</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> behind their Backs: And ſo he will
neither be deceived in his Inſtruments, nor diſappointed
by them.</p>
            <p>6. He will call together the wiſe, <hi>peace-making Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi>
and with the ſtricteſt Charge, commit to them
the Endeavours of Reconciling and Uniting the ſeveral
Parties; by drawing their Differences into the narroweſt
Compaſs, and ſtating them rightlier, than paſſionate <hi>Men</hi>
do; and by perſwading them to Love and Peace, and
to all ſuch Abatements and Forbearances, as are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And his own prudent Over-ſight and Authority,
(like <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s at <hi>Nice</hi>) will facilitate the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>7. He, and his People will enquire, what <hi>Terms of
Concord</hi> are meet, not only for ſome <hi>One Corner</hi> or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
but for <hi>All the Chriſtian World;</hi> that when he hath

            <list>
               <item>1. What all Chriſtians are agreed in, as Chriſtians,
in the Eſſentials of their Religion.</item>
               <item>2. What all Chriſtians did agree on, in the Apoſtles
Time, which was the Time of greateſt <hi>Light,

               </item>
               <item>3. VVhat all Chriſtians, in all Kingdoms of the
VVorld, ſince then, to this day, in the midſt of
all their other Differences, have been, and ſtill
are agreed in, as their Religion.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For he will ſee, that there is no hope of Agreeing
the Diſagreeing VVorld, (at leaſt, in many an Age)
by <hi>changing Mens Judgments</hi> from what they are; and
bringing them all in Controverted Things, to the
<hi>Mind of ſome Party;</hi> nor to agree them on any Terms,
in which they do not <hi>really Agree.</hi> But that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
muſt be founded in that, which they are <hi>indeed all
Agreed in:</hi> Leaving the Superfluities or Additions of each
Party, out of the Agreement.</p>
            <p>9. The Peace-makers will then find, that Chriſtian
Religion is conteined in <hi>Three Forms.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In the <hi>Sacramental-Covenant with</hi> God <hi>the Father,
Son, and Holy-Ghost,</hi> as the briefeſt <hi>Formula.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. In the <hi>Creed, Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Prayer, and Decalogue;</hi> as the
Summaries of the <hi>Credenda, Appetenda,</hi> and <hi>Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
Matters of <hi>Faith, Will,</hi> (or <hi>Deſire</hi>) and <hi>Practice,</hi>

               <item>3. In that <hi>Canon of Scripture, which all the Churches
receive,</hi> as the <hi>largest Form</hi> or Continent.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And that he who is <hi>understandingly,</hi> a <hi>Sacramental-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanter
with</hi> God <hi>the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> was ever
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59455:23"/>
taken for a <hi>Viſible Chriſtian.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was
called our <hi>Chriſtening;</hi> and the <hi>Baptized</hi> taken for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
before they knew the <hi>Controverſies</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Church,
or <hi>that:</hi> And that the competent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> explicite Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Creed, Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Decalogue,</hi> was ever
taken for a competent Underſtanding of the <hi>Sacramental-Covenant,</hi>
and more. And that he that <hi>implicitely</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
the <hi>commonly-received Canonical Scripture,</hi> as <hi>God</hi>'s
<hi>Word</hi> (though he underſtand no more than as followeth)
and that <hi>explicitely</hi> underſtandeth the <hi>Creed, Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Prayer,</hi>
and <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and receiveth them, and <hi>conſenteth</hi> to the
<hi>Sacramental-Covenant,</hi> alwayes was accounted, and is ſtill
to be accounted a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> On theſe Terms therefore,
the <hi>Peace-makers</hi> will reſolve to endeavour the Union of
the Churches.</p>
            <p>10. Therefore, they will pare off, and caſt away, (as
the <hi>greateſt Enemy</hi> to <hi>Unity</hi>) all thoſe <hi>unneceſſary Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,</hi>
or <hi>Things doubtful,</hi> which Chriſtians (yea, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines)
were never agreed in; and which never were the
happy and ſucceſsful Means or Terms of any <hi>Extenſive
Concord;</hi> and which have long been tryed, to be the
<hi>great Occaſions</hi> of all the <hi>Scruples,</hi> and <hi>Contentions,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,</hi>
and <hi>woful Conſequents</hi> in the Churches. And they
will once more ſay, [IT SEEMETH GOOD TO THE
HOLY-GHOST, and to Us, TO LAY UPON YOU
NO GREATER BURDEN, THAN THESE NECES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SARY
THINGS, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28.] All Chriſtians ſhall in
<hi>general,</hi> receive the <hi>Canonical Scripture</hi> as <hi>God</hi>'s Word;
and more <hi>particularly,</hi> the <hi>Creed, Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>

and vow, and devote themſelves therein
to <hi>God.</hi> And this ſhall be all the Title, which they ſhall be

forced to ſhew, for their <hi>Viſible, Church-Communion.</hi> And
though a higher Meaſure of the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> of the <hi>ſame
Principles</hi> and <hi>Rules,</hi> ſhall be required in <hi>Teachers,</hi> than
in the <hi>Flock;</hi> and accordingly, the <hi>Ordainers</hi> ſhall try
<hi>their Underſtandings,</hi> together with their <hi>Utterance</hi> and
<hi>Miniſterial Readineſs</hi> of Parts: Yet ſhall the <hi>Teachers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
be (ordinarily) forced to no other <hi>Subſcriptions,
Profeſſions,</hi> or <hi>Oaths,</hi> (beſides their <hi>civil Allegiance</hi>) than
to <hi>Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> to all afore-ſaid; and to <hi>promiſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
Fidelity in their Places.</hi> All <hi>Councils,</hi> called <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
or <hi>Provincial, Canons, Decretals, Articles, Formula's,
Rubricks,</hi> &amp;c. ſhall be reſerved to their proper Uſe; but
be no more uſed for enſnaring and dividing <hi>Subſcriptions,

<hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. When all thoſe <hi>Superfluities,</hi> and Foot balls of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
are caſt out of the way, the Power of the <hi>Keys,</hi>
or <hi>Paſtoral Government,</hi> ſhall come to be better known
and exerciſed, and the <hi>Primitive Diſcipline</hi> ſet up; which
took place, before <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> took up the Sword,
and Pride ſwelled the Biſhops into a Secular State, and
way of Rule. Then it ſhall be <hi>Church-Government,</hi> to
ſee that the People be duely taken in the <hi>Sacramental-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
and <hi>learn the Creed, Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Decalogue;</hi>
and be inſtructed in the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and Live together
in <hi>Sobriety, Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Godlyneſs.</hi> And the Paſtors

be no more troubled, nor corrupted by their uſe of any

Authoritative Exerciſe of Inſtruction, and of Love;</hi> and no
more: Like that of a <hi>Tutor</hi> to his <hi>Pupils,</hi> a <hi>Phyſician</hi> in

their <hi>Courts,</hi> (ſuppoſing the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>) and the <hi>People</hi>
the <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> and the preſent <hi>incumbent Paſtors,</hi> be the
<hi>Judges,</hi> without Excommunicating and Abſolving <hi>Lay-Chancellors,
Surrogates, Commiſſaries,</hi> or <hi>Officials.</hi> And all
the <hi>Materials</hi> of Contention being now gone, they ſhall
have nothing to do in theſe Courts, but to try, whether
the People have <hi>learnt,</hi> and <hi>understand</hi> their <hi>Cathechiſms,</hi>
and <hi>conſent to God</hi>'s <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Communicate</hi> in his <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
with the <hi>Church:</hi> And when any are accuſed of
<hi>Wicked Living,</hi> contrary to <hi>Sobriety, Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs,</hi>
to try, whether theſe Accuſations be well proved:
And if ſo, to <hi>perſwade</hi> the Offenders to <hi>Repent;</hi> and by
plain Scripture-Arguments, to <hi>convince</hi> them of the Sin;
and with <hi>Tears,</hi> or <hi>Fatherly Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> to melt
them into Remorſe, and bring them to confeſs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Sin. And if this cannot be done at once, to try
again and again; and <hi>pray</hi> for their <hi>Repentance.</hi> And,
when there is no other Remedy, [to <hi>Declare ſuch a one
openly uncapable of Church-Communion; and to require the
Church, to avoid Communion with him; and him, to forbear
intruding into their Communion: and to bind him over by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
Denunciation of</hi> God's <hi>Diſpleaſure, (as againſt the
Impenitent) to anſwer it at the Bar of</hi> God <hi>himſelf; as
one that is under his Wrath, till he do Repent.</hi>] And this
is the utmoſt of the Paſtoral Power, that ſhall then be
uſed, (ſuppoſing <hi>private Admonitions</hi>): And this only,
in that <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Congregation,</hi> wherein the Sinner had
before his Communion; and not at a diſtance, nor in
other Churches, or Parts of the World, where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
hath no Charge. Yea, this <hi>Much</hi> ſhall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
Irregularly, and at Randome, to the Injury of the

12. The <hi>Primitive-Church-Form</hi> ſhall be Reſtored: And
as (where there are Chriſtians enow) no Churches ſhall be
too <hi>ſmall,</hi> ſo none ſhall be <hi>greater</hi> for Number or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

Church.</p>
            <p>14. Neither Magiſtrates nor other Biſhops, ſhall make
the Biſhops or Paſtors Sermons, and Prayers for him;
but leave it as the work of the ſpeakers Office, to <hi>word</hi>
his own Sermons and Prayers; and to chooſe a ſet form
or no ſet-form, the ſame or various, as the caſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:
yet ſo as to be reſponſible (as after) for all abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and mal-adminiſtrations, and not ſuffered to deprave
<hi>Gods</hi> Worſhip, by confuſion or hurtful Errours, or paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
and perverſe Expreſſions: But to be aſſiſted, and

ſuch kind of helps, as his perſonal weakneſſes ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
And where ſet-forms are uſed, none ſhall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel

15. None of the People ſhall have the high <hi>Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
of <hi>Church Communion,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> beſtowed on

and <hi>unwilling,</hi> ſhall be Miniſterially <hi>Abſolved</hi> from
the Guilt of Sin. For every Sacramental Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether of Baptiſm, or of the Body and Blood of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> is as full an Act of <hi>Miniſterial Abſolution</hi> as any

Collation</hi> or <hi>Investiture:</hi> And thoſe that are but
<hi>conſtrained</hi> by the apparent danger of a <hi>Fine</hi> or <hi>Jail,</hi>
are not to be accounted <hi>Voluntary Conſenters</hi> by the Church;
when the Lord of the Church will account none for
<hi>Conſenters,</hi> that will not <hi>forſake all,</hi> and endure Fines and
Jailes, rather than to be deprived of the benefits of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
and Viſible Church-Communion. The Magiſtrate
therefore will Wiſely, and Moderately, bring all the
People to <hi>Hear</hi> that which is neceſſary to their good;
but will not by Penalties, force the <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>receive</hi>
either <hi>Abſolutions</hi> or <hi>Communion</hi> with the Church, in
its ſpecial priviledges. But if the Baptized refuſe Church-Communion
afterwards, they lamentably puniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
And if it be found meet to declare them Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
it will be a terrible penalty, ſufficient to its
proper uſe.</p>
            <p>16. The Magiſtrate will not Impriſon, Harm, Confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
Baniſh, or otherwiſe puniſh any of his Subjects, <hi>eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
becauſe they are Excommunicate: For that is to
puniſh his <hi>Body,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>puniſhed.</hi> Nor will
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59455:26"/>
he hearken to thoſe <hi>unbelieving</hi> Clergy-Men, that cry
up the <hi>Power of the Keys</hi> as <hi>their Office;</hi> and when they
have done, <hi>ſcorn it</hi> as an <hi>uneffectual ſhaddow</hi> of Power,
which will do nothing without the Magiſtrates <hi>force.</hi>
But he will <hi>himſelf hear,</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> before he Puniſh,
and not be debaſed to be the Clergies <hi>Executioner,</hi> to
puniſh before he have <hi>tryed the Cauſe:</hi> Becauſe Clergy-Mens
Pride and Paſſions, may elſe ingage him to be the
Inſtrument of their Vices and Revenge. Yea, as he that
ſeeth a Man puniſhed in one Court, will be the more
<hi>delatory</hi> to bring him to puniſhment in another, for the
ſame Crime; ſo the Magiſtrate that ſeeth a Man <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated</hi>
for his fault, will rather <hi>delay</hi> his civil force
againſt that Man, to ſee what effect his Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will have: Becauſe the Conjunction of the <hi>Sword</hi>
againſt the <hi>Excommunicate as ſuch,</hi> doth corrupt <hi>Chriſts</hi>
Ordinance, and make the Fruit of it utterly undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
ſo that no one can ſee whether ever it did any
thing at all, or whether all was done by the fear of the
Sword. And verily, a faithful Miniſter, that ſeeth a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
come to Confeſſion of his fault, but when he muſt
elſe lye in <hi>Jail</hi> and be <hi>undone,</hi> will be loath to take that
Man for a true Penitent. And to force Paſtors to <hi>abſolve</hi>
or give the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> to every one that had <hi>rather take
it,</hi> than <hi>lye in Jail</hi> and be <hi>undone,</hi> is to ſet up ſuch new
Terms of Church Communion, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> will give
Men little thanks for. <hi>Church Communion</hi> is only a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
due to <hi>Volunteers</hi> and <hi>Penitents.</hi> But yet the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
may puniſh Men with Fines or other Penalties,
for the <hi>ſame faults,</hi> for which they are Excommunicate,
having Tryed and Judged them in his own Court: But
not <hi>quaterus Excommunicate,</hi> but according to the nature
of the Crime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59455:27"/>
17. The Schools of Learning and Academies, ſhall not
Educate Youth, either in Idleneſs, Luxury, or Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
formality; but under Learned, Pious Tutors, in
Learning, Sobriety and Piety; From whence they ſhall
not over-haſtily leap into the Paſtoral Office.</p>
            <p>18. None under Thirty Years of Age (at what time
Chriſt himſelf entered on his publick Works) ſhall take
a Paſtoral Charge, except in caſe of meer neceſſity of
the Church, no not on pretence of Extraordinary fitneſs:
But till then ſhall imploy themſelves as Learners, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſts,
School-Maſters, or Probationers. Nor ſhall they
meddle in the Pulpits, with matters of ſuch Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,
as the Church is in Danger to be troubled
with.</p>
            <p>19. Miniſters ſhall all be commanded by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and adviſed by the Neighbour Paſtors, to forbear
all <hi>unneceſſary Controverſies</hi> in the <hi>Pulpits;</hi> and to teach
the people the foreſaid Subſtantials, the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi>
the <hi>Creed, Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Decalogue,</hi> the Duties of
<hi>Faith, Love, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Obedience:</hi> And ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their <hi>Subtiler</hi> and curious Speculations, for Schools
and Theological Writings; And ſo the Chriſtian People
ſhall be bred up in the Primitive, Plain, Simplicity of
Doctrine and Religion; And their Brains ſhall not be
heated, and racked with thoſe new-coined Phraſes and
Subtilties, which will but diſtemper them into a proud,
contentious, wrangling Diſeaſe; but will not be truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by them, when all's done. And ſo when it is
the peoples work, to hear only (uſually) the Doctrine
of the Catechiſme, and ſimple old Chriſtianity, and to
talk of no other; 1. Their time will be employed in
promoting Faith, Repentance, Love, and Obedience,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59455:27"/>
which was wont to be ſpent in vain Janglings, and ſtrife
of Words. And, 2. Religion will be an <hi>eaſier</hi> thing;
and conſequently, will be more <hi>common,</hi> (as cheap Food
and Rayment is every ones Penny-worth): And Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
may hope to bring the <hi>generality</hi> of their People, to
be ſavingly and practically Religious: Whereas the
Fine ſpun Religion of <hi>Novelists,</hi> and <hi>Wranglers,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
new Light and Increaſe of Knowledge, doth not
only dwindle into a Cob-web of no Uſe, or Life, or
Power; but muſt be confined to a <hi>Few,</hi> that can have
leiſure to learn to Talk in new Phraſes, and will but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Matter of ignorant Men's Pride and Oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and make them think, that they only are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
People; and all that cannot talk as they, are
Prophane, and not to be admitted to their Communion.
When as the <hi>Apoſtolick, Primitive, plain Religion,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Laces, and Whimſies, that Dreamers have ſince
introduced, would make Men <hi>Humble, Holy, Heavenly, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
Meek,</hi> and <hi>Patient;</hi> and ſpare Men the Loſs of
a great deal of Time.</p>
            <p>20. The Maintenance of the Miniſtry ſhall neither be
ſo <hi>poor,</hi> as to diſcourage Men from devoting their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to the Office, or diſable them from a total Addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs
to their proper Work, by any diſtracting Wants
or Cares; or yet wholly diſable them from Works of
Charity: Nor yet ſo <hi>Great,</hi> as may be a ſtrong Bait to
Proud, Covetous, Worldly minded Men, to intrude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Miniſtry for fleſhly Ends. It ſhall be ſo <hi>much,</hi> as
that the <hi>Burden</hi> of their Calling may not be increaſed by
Want: But yet not ſo <hi>much,</hi> but that <hi>Self-denyal</hi> ſhall
be Exerciſed by all that under-take the Miniſtry; and
of the Two, the Burden of the Miniſterial Labors, with
its proper Sufferings, ſhall to Fleſh and Blood, ſeem to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59455:28"/>
preponderate the worldly Advantage. So greatly need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is it to the Church, that all Miniſters be Self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men; that valuing Things ſpiritually, can practiſe
Humility, Mortification, and Contempt of the World, as
well as preach it.</p>
            <p>21. There ſhall be a <hi>Treble-Lock</hi> upon the Door of
the Miniſtry:
<list>
                  <item>1. Whether they are fit to be <hi>Miniſters in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
the <hi>Ordainers</hi> ſhall judge.</item>
                  <item>2. Whether they are fit to be the <hi>Paſtors of this,</hi> or
that <hi>particular Church;</hi> the <hi>Members of the Church</hi>
ſhall ſo far judge, as that none ſhall become their
Paſtors, without their <hi>own conſent.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Whether they be fit for the <hi>Magiſtrates Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
Maintenance,</hi> and <hi>Protection,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>
himſelf ſhall judge.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, all Three ſhall ſeverally try, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
each Paſtor: Yet ſo, that the <hi>Two Firſt</hi> only be
taken, as neceſſary to the <hi>Office it ſelf;</hi> and the <hi>Third</hi>
only, to the <hi>Maintenance</hi> and <hi>Encouragement,</hi> or <hi>Defence</hi>
of the Officer. And though ſometimes, this may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
Diſagreements and Delayes, for a time; yet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
the ſecuring of a Faithful Miniſtry, and other
good Effects, will countervail many ſuch Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>22. No <hi>One Church,</hi> ſhall have the Government of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Church:</hi> And the ſecular Differences of <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
Patriarcks,</hi> &amp;c. which was ſet up in one Empire,
upon ſecular Accounts, and from ſecular Reaſons, ſhall all
ceaſe. And no Differences ſhall be made <hi>neceſſary</hi> among
them, which Chriſt hath not made neceſſary. But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Princes ſhall take warning by the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59455:28"/>
Churches, and by all the Calamities and Ruins, which
have been cauſed in the Chriſtian World; by Biſhops
ſtriving who ſhould be the Greateſt, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> decided
the Controverſie long ago, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>23. As Chriſtians hold <hi>Perſonal, Christian Communion,</hi>
in their ſeveral <hi>particular</hi> Churches; ſo <hi>Churches</hi> ſhall hold
a <hi>Communion of Churches,</hi> by neceſſary Correſpondencies,
and Aſſociations: Not making a <hi>Major Vote</hi> of Biſhops in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi>
to have a proper <hi>Government</hi> over the <hi>Minor Part.</hi>
But that by <hi>counſel</hi> and <hi>concord,</hi> they may <hi>help</hi> and <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
one another; and ſecure the <hi>common Interest</hi> of
Chriſtianity. And that he that is a Member of one Church,
may be received of the Reſt; and he that is caſt out
of One, may not be received by the Reſt, unleſs he be
wronged. So that, it ſhall not be <hi>One Politick Church;</hi>
but a <hi>Communion of Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>24. The Means of this Communion ſhall be,
<list>
                  <item>1. By <hi>Meſſengers.</hi>

in them, ſhall be improved;
<list>
                  <item>1. To the Directing and Counſelling of one another,
in matters doubtful; eſpecially of Diſcipline.</item>
                  <item>2. To edify each other by Conference, Prayer, and
Diſputations.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Younger may be Educated under the
grave Advice and Counſels of the Elder.</item>
                  <item>4. That the Concord of Themſelves, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

But if they would grow Imperious, Tyrannical, Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
or Contentious, the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſhall hinder their
ſtated, ordinary Meetings; that it be not accounted a

            </p>
            <p>26. He that taketh himſelf to be wrongfully Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated

                  <item>1. To have his Cauſe heard by the <hi>Aſſociated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi>
of the Neighbour-Churches; though not

whoſe Judgment bindeth to <hi>Concord</hi> in lawful

                  <item>2. To be <hi>admitted</hi> by <hi>another Church,</hi> if it appear

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>27. The <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſhall appoint ſome of the moſt

due Admonition, ſo groſly miſ-behave themſelves in
<hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> or <hi>Converſation,</hi> as to be the Plagues
of the Churches, and to do apparently more hurt than
good. But as to all worthy and able Miniſters, if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any fault, they ſhall be puniſhed as other Subjects,
only with ſuch Penalties as ſhall not by ſilencing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
be a puniſhment to the innocent peoples Souls,
nor hinder the Preaching of the Goſpel of Salvation: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as if the common Bakers, Brewers, Butchers, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters,
perform their work perniciouſly (Poiſoning their
Beer, Bread, and Meat) they ſhall be forbid the Trade:
But for other faults, they ſhall be ſo puniſhed, that the
People be not left without Bread, Beer, Meat, Houſes,
for <hi>their</hi> faults.</p>
            <p>33. If any <hi>Hereticks</hi> (as <hi>Arrians, Socinians,</hi> &amp;c.) would
creep into the Miniſtry, there ſhall not be <hi>new-forms</hi> of
<hi>Subſcription</hi> made to keep them out (which its like,
with their vicious Conſciences would be uneffectual, and
would open a Gap to the old Church-Tyrannies and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions);
nor an <hi>uncertain Evil</hi> be <hi>uneffectually reſiſted</hi> by
a <hi>certain greater Miſchief.</hi> But while he keepeth his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to himſelf, he is no <hi>Heretick</hi> as to the Church (<hi>non

his <hi>Hereſy,</hi> he is reſponſible all the ways aforeſaid, and
may be by the <hi>Magiſtrate puniſhed</hi> for his Crime, and
by the <hi>Churches</hi> be branded as none of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59455:31"/>
which is the regular way of reforming Crimes'
<hi>viz.</hi> By <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Execution,</hi> and not by making

though <hi>Laws</hi> could be made, which no Man can
break.</p>
            <p>34. The Magiſtrate ſhall <hi>countenance</hi> or <hi>tolerate</hi> no Sin
or Errour, ſo far as he can cure it by juſt Remedies,
which will not do more harm than good: But he ſhall <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
tolerate many tolerable</hi> Errours and Faults; becauſe
it is not in his Power to remedy them, by ſuch means.
But,
<list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Sound and Concordant Ministry only,</hi> ſhall
have his <hi>Countenance</hi> and <hi>Maintenance.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Smaller Errours</hi> and <hi>Diſorders,</hi> ſhall be beſt cured
by gentle Rebukes, and <hi>Diſcountenance,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal
of <hi>Maintenance;</hi> together with the <hi>diſgrace</hi>
that will be caſt upon them, by the judgment
and diſſent of all the united Concordant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and Churches (which two together will do
more and better, than Exaſperating Cruelties will
do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>publiſhing</hi> of <hi>pernicious Principles,</hi> ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
more ſeverely.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But though Men may be <hi>reſtrained</hi> from <hi>venting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Falſehoods,</hi> they cannot be <hi>Conſtrained</hi> to <hi>believe</hi>
the Truth (we are not ſo happy;) Nor ſhall they be
<hi>Conſtrained</hi> to lie, and <hi>ſay</hi> that they believe it when they
do not.</p>
            <p>35. All matters of Quarrels, diviſion and cruel uſage
of each other, being thus cut off and gone; bitterneſs,
and revengeful thoughts will ceaſe, and Love will revive
in all Mens Breaſts, and Unity, and Peace will follow
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59455:31"/>
of its own accord. And if any Heretical or contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sect ariſe, the Hearts of all United People will ſo
riſe againſt them, that <hi>deſertion</hi> and <hi>ſhame</hi> will quickly
Kill them.</p>
            <p>36. Then will the Hearts of the People cleave to their
Paſtors: And they will be no more put on the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of <hi>Loving the Biſhops that hurt them,</hi> or of <hi>Loving
them in Jailes;</hi> But it will be as <hi>eaſy</hi> to Love them, when
they feel the Love to their Souls in the labours and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Paſtors, as to Love their deareſt and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Friends. And then Love, will open the Peoples Ears
to the Teachers Doctrine, and it will do them good:
And then the labours and lives of faithful Miniſters, will
be ſweet and eaſy, when the Love, and the Unity, and
Faithfulneſs of the People, is their dayly Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
O how good, and how happy will it be for
Paſtors and People, thus to Live in Love and Unity!
It will not only mind us of <hi>Aarons</hi> perfume, but of the
Spirit of Love that dwelt in our Redeemer, and which
he promiſed ſhould be his <hi>Seal and Mark</hi> upon all his true
Diſciples! Yea, and of the <hi>Celeſtial Society,</hi> and Life of
<hi>perfect Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>37. Then ſhall Neighbours exerciſe their Charity, for
the help of the Ignorant about them, without the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
of venting Hereſies, or Sedition, or Encroaching
on the Paſtors Office. And Neighbours when they come
together, ſhall not take Praying together, or holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
or ſinging Gods Praiſe, or Reading good Books,
or repeating their Teachers Sermons, or Counſelling each
other, to be a bad or dangerous work: But the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that cannot ſpend the Lords day in holy Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
at home (becauſe they cannot Read or remember
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59455:32"/>
much) ſhall joyn with the Families of their more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
Neighbours, who can help them; (as they
met <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 12. for Prayer; and as Neighbour-Families
were to joyn in Eating the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> with the Family
that had not enow to Eat it.) For <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> ſhall
end theſe Jealouſies. And all ſhall be done under the
Guidance and Over-ſight of their Paſtors; and not in
Enmity or Oppoſition to them, or to the Concordant
Church-Aſſemblies. And, O what Helps and Comfort
will this be to all Faithful Paſtors, when all the Work
lyeth not on them alone! but every one ſets his Hand
to Build, in his proper place! And when they that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
together all the Week, are ſeconding that which
he more ſeldom teacheth them in Publick.</p>
            <p>38. The Younger ſort of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that are now
Bred up in <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s <hi>Forge,</hi> ſhall be then Trained up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>grave</hi> and <hi>peaceable Men;</hi> where <hi>uniting,</hi> and <hi>peace-making</hi>
Principles, ſhall be the Rudiments of their <hi>Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>39. And the <hi>Younger</hi> ſort of the <hi>People,</hi> ſhall be no
more tempted into envious Heats againſt their Afflicters;
nor into contentious Sects, becauſe of Controverſies:
But ſhall be fed with the Milk of peaceable Principles,
and be Educated in the Love of <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf. And the
<hi>names</hi> of <hi>Sects,</hi> and <hi>Church-Diviſions,</hi> and proud Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſhall by uſe, be made as diſgraceful, as now the
Names of <hi>Swearing, Drunkenneſs,</hi> and <hi>Whoredom</hi> are.</p>
            <p>40. And, O how Dear! how Amiable! how Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
will their Governours be, to ſuch a People! (Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
that Bleſſed <hi>Prince,</hi> that ſhall firſt perform this
Work!) How heartily will they Pray for them, Plead
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59455:32"/>
for them, and Fight for them! And, How freely will
they Contribute any thing in their Power, to their
Aids! And, How impatient will they be againſt every
Word, that would diſhonour them! How Bleſſed will the
People be under ſuch a <hi>Prince!</hi> And, How Sweet and Eaſie
will the Life of that <hi>Prince</hi> be, that is to Govern ſuch
a People!</p>
            <p>Grant, O <hi>Lord,</hi> that this great Honour and Comfort,
may fall into the Hands of the King of <hi>England,</hi> before
all others in the World! Kings will then ſee, that it
is their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> their <hi>Honour,</hi> and their greateſt <hi>Happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
on Earth, to be the <hi>Wiſe, Pious, Righteous</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
of a <hi>Wiſe, Pious, Juſt, United</hi> People; that Love
them ſo much, that ſtill they would fain ſerve them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than they are able.</p>
            <p>41. The Ignorant, Vulgar, and Ruder ſort, obſerving
this Amiable Concord, and all the bleſſed Fruits thereof,
will admire Religion, and fall in Love with it: And
Multitudes, that ſhall be ſaved, will be dayly added to
the ſeriouſly Religious; and the Houſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> will be
filled with Gueſts.</p>
            <p>42. Hereupon the Scandalous and Flagitious Lives of
Common <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> will be much cured: For the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>Flagitious,</hi> will grow ſmall; and Crimes
will be under common Diſgrace. Beſides that, they will
be puniſhed by the <hi>Magiſtrate:</hi> So that, groſs Sin will be
a Marvail.</p>
            <p>43. The Books of plain Doctrine, and holy Living,
with the <hi>Pacificatory Treatiſes</hi> of <hi>Reconcilers,</hi> will then be
moſt in <hi>Eſteem</hi> and <hi>Uſe;</hi> which now are ſo Diſ-reliſhed
by turbulent, diſcontented, ſiding Perſons. And abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59455:33"/>
of Controverſal-Writings, about Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Liturgies,</hi> Ceremonies, and many other Matters,
will be forgotten, and caſt aſide, as uſeleſs Things: For
the <hi>Swords</hi> ſhall be made into <hi>Plow-Shares,</hi> and <hi>Pruning-Hooks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>44. The happy Example of that happy <hi>Prince,</hi> and
Country, that ſhall begin and firſt accompliſh this
Work, will be Famous through all the <hi>Proteſtant-Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi>
and will enflame ſuch Deſires of Imitation in them
all, and be ſuch a ready Direction in the way, that it
will greatly expedite their anſwerable Reformation. And
the Famous Felicity of that <hi>Prince,</hi> in the <hi>Reformation</hi>
and <hi>Concord</hi> of his Subjects, will kindle in the Hearts
of other <hi>Proteſtant-Princes</hi> and States, an Earneſt Deſire
of the ſame Felicity. And ſo, as upon the Invention of
<hi>Printing,</hi> and of <hi>Guns,</hi> the World was preſently poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of <hi>Guns,</hi> and of <hi>Printed-Books,</hi> that never before at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
any ſuch thing: So here; they that ſee the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſs
of one Kingdom brought about, and ſee how it
was done, will have Matter enough before their Eyes,
both to excite their Deſires, and guide their Endeavours,
in the Means to bring all this to paſs.</p>
            <p>45. The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Kingdoms and States, being thus
Reformed, and United in themſelves, will be enflamed
with an earneſt deſire of the good of all other Churches,
and of all the World: And therefore, as Divines have
held ſomething called <hi>General Councils</hi> for the Union of
all thoſe Churches; ſo theſe Princes will by their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
hold Aſſemblies for maintaining Correſpondency,
to the carrying on of the common good of the World,
by the Advantage of their <hi>United Counſels,</hi> and <hi>Strength:</hi>
And then no Enemy can ſtand long before them. For,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59455:33"/>
they that Love, and ſerve them Zealouſly at home, will
venture their Lives for them Zealouſly abroad, if there
be Cauſe.</p>
            <p>46. The excellent, and ſucceſsful uſe of the <hi>Magiſtrates
Government</hi> of the <hi>Churches in their Dominions,</hi> will quite
ſhame all the uſurping claims of the <hi>Pope, and General
Councels,</hi> and their mungrel Eccleſiaſtick Courts, and all
the train of <hi>Artifices</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> by which their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World is managed: And the World, and
eſpecially Princes will plainly ſee how much they were
abuſed by their Uſurpations; and that there is no need
of <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Cardinal,</hi> nor any of thoſe Officers or Acts at
all: But that theſe are the meer Contrivances of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Policy, to keep up an Earthly Kingdom under the
name of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church. And alſo the <hi>Purity and
Unity</hi> of the Reformed Churches, where the vulgar have
more Religion and Union, than <hi>their Monaſteries,</hi> will
dazzle the Eyes of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Princes, States, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
And when they ſee better, and eſpecially the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of the Princes, they will forſake the Uſurper that
had Captivated them by fraud, and will aſſume their
freedom and felicity; And ſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Church-King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
will fall.</p>
            <p>47. The deluded <hi>Mahometans</hi> ſeeing the Unity, and
Glory of Chriſtendom, as they were before kept from
Chriſt by the <hi>Wicked</hi> Lives, and the <hi>Diviſions</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
(thinking that we are far worſe than they) ſo now
they will be brought to <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Name, and <hi>fear</hi> the Power of the Chriſtian Princes.
And one part of them will turn Chriſtians; and the reſt,
even the Turkiſh Power, the Chriſtians force by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God, will eaſily break. And ſo the Eaſtern
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59455:34"/>
Churches will be delivered, and reformed; and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi>
come into the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>48. The poor ſcattered <hi>Jews</hi> alſo, when they ſee the
Glory and Concord of Chriſtians, will be convinced that
Chriſt is indeed the true <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And being Converted
perhaps, ſhall by the Chriſtian Powers, be ſome of them
Re-eſtabliſhed in their own Land: But not to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>peculiarity,</hi> or <hi>policy</hi> and <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>49. And then the Chriſtian Zeal, will work to the
Converſion of the poor Idolatrous, Heathen World; And
part of them will yield to Reaſon and Faith, and the
reſt by juſt victories be ſubdued. And ſo the Kingdoms
of the World, will become the Kingdoms of the Lord,
and his Chriſt; And the Goſpel ſhall be Preached in all
the World.</p>
            <p>50. And when the Kingdom of Grace is perfected,
and hath had its time, the Kingdom of <hi>Glory</hi> ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
upon the Glorious appearing of Chriſt our King;
and the Dead ſhall Ariſe; and they that have overcome,
ſhall Reign with Chriſt, and ſit with him upon the
Throne, even as he overcame, and is ſet down with the
Father on his Throne. <hi>Amen. Even ſo come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
