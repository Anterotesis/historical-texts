            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Thirty Governours, commonly called the Thirty Tyrants of <hi>Athens,</hi> werechoſen at the firſt by the people to compile a body of their Law, and make a collection of ſuch ancient Statutes as were meet to be put in practice; the condition of the City ſtanding as it did in that ſo ſodain alteration. To this Charge was annexed the Supream authoritie, either as a recompence of their labours, or becauſe the neceſſity did ſo require it, wherein the law being uncertain, it was fit that ſuch men ſhould give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in particular Cauſes, to whoſe judgement the very Lawes themſelves (by which the Citie was to be ordered) ſhould become ſubject.</p>
            <p>But theſe thirty having ſo great power in their hands, were more carefull to hold it, then to deſerve it, by farthfull execution of that which was committed to them in truſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore apprehending ſuch troubleſome fellows as were odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the City, though not puniſhable therefore by law, they condemned them to death; which proceeding was by all men highly approved, who conſidered their lewd conditions, but did not withall bethink themſelves, how eaſie a thing it would be to theſe thirty men, to take away the lives of innocents, by calling them perturbers of the peace, or what elſe they liſted, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation without due triall &amp; proof had been once well appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of.</p>
            <p>Having thus plauſibly entred into a wicked courſe of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they thought it beſt to fortifie themſelves with a ſure Guard ere they brake out into thoſe diſorders, which they muſt needs commit for the eſtabliſhing of their authority. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſpatching two of their own company to <hi>Sparta,</hi> they infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that it was the full intent of the 30. to keep the City free from all rebellious motions, to which purpoſe it behooved them to cut off ſuch as were ſeditious; and therefore deſired the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to ſend them a Garriſon, which they promiſed at their own coſts to maintain. This motion was well approved, and a Guard ſent, the Captain of which was ſo well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the Thirty, that none of their miſdeeds could want his high commendations at <hi>Sparta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon the Tyrants began to take heart, and looking no more after baſe and deteſted perſons, invaded the principall men of the Citie, ſending armed men from houſe to houſe, who drew out ſuch as were of great reputation, or likely, or able to make any head againſt this wicked form of Government: whereby there was ſuch effuſion of blood, as to <hi>Theramenes</hi> (one of the 30.) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very horrible, and unable to eſcape vengeance: his diſlike of their proceedings being openly diſcovered, cauſed his fellows to bethink themſelves, and provide for their own ſecurity, and his deſtruction, leaſt he ſhould make himſelf a Captaine of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented (which were almoſt the whole City) and redeem his own peace with their ruine, wherfore they ſelected three Thouſand of the Citizens, whom they thought meeteſt, and gave unto them ſome part of publick Authority, the reſt they diſarmed, and having thus increaſed their own ſtrength, and weakened their oppoſites, they began afreſh to ſhed the blood not onely of their private enemies, but of ſuch whoſe money, or goods might inrich them, and enable them for the payment of their guard. And to this purpoſe they concluded, that every one of them ſhould name one man, upon whoſe goods he ſhould ſeize, putting the Owner to death. But when <hi>Theramenes</hi> uttered his deteſtation of ſo wicked intent, then did <hi>Critias,</hi> who of all the 30 was moſt tyranicall, accuſe him to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, as a treacherous man, and (one main priviledge of the 30. was, that no one of them ſhould ſuffer death at the appointment of the reſt, but have the accuſtomed tryall) he took upon him to ſtrike out of that number the name of <hi>Theramenes,</hi> and ſo reduced him under the triall and ſentence of that Order. It was well alledged by <hi>Theramenes,</hi> that his name was no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e eaſie to be blotted out of the Catalogue then any other mans; upon which conſideration, he adviſed them all to conceive no otherwiſe of his Caſe, then as of their own, who were liable to the ſame form of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: but every man chooſing rather to ſave his own life by ſilence, then preſently to draw upon himſelf the danger, which as yet concerned him little (and perhaps would never come neer him) the Tyrants interpriting Silence as Conſent, condemned him forthwith, and compelled him to drink poyſon.</p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Theramenes,</hi> the 30 Tyrants began to uſe ſuch outrage as excelled their former villanies, for having 3000. (as they thought) firm unto them, they robbed all others without fear or ſhame, deſpoiling them of lands and goods, and cauſed them to flie into baniſhment, for ſafeguard of their lives; This flight of the Citizens procured their liberty, and the generall good of the City. For the baniſhed Citizens, who were fled to <hi>Thebes,</hi> entred into conſultation, and reſolved to hazard their lives in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting free the City of <hi>Athens.</hi> The very thought of ſuch a practiſe had been treaſon at home, which had no other danger abroad, then might be found in the execution. Seventy men, or thereabouts, were the firſt undertakers, who with their Captain <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> took <hi>Phyla,</hi> a place of ſtrength in the territory of <hi>Athens.</hi> No ſooner did the Thirty hear of their exploit, then ſeek means to prevent further danger; aſſembling the three Thouſand and their <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> guard, with which force they attempted <hi>Phyla,</hi> but were with ſome loſſe of their men repelled: finding the place too ſtrong to be taken by aſſault, they intended to beſiege it, which purpoſe came to naught by means of Show that fell, and other ſtormy weather, againſt which they had not made proviſion. Retiring therefore to the City, which above all they were to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> good, they left the moſt of that guard, and two Troops of Horſe, to weary out them which lay in <hi>Phyla,</hi> with a flying ſiege. But it was not long ere the followers of <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> were increaſed from ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſeven hundred which adventured to give charge upon thoſe guards, of whom they cut off about an hundred and twenty: theſe ſmall, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous beginnings added more to the number of thoſe in <hi>Phyla,</hi> who now with a Thouſand men got entrance into <hi>Piraeus</hi> the ſuburb of <hi>Athens,</hi> lying on the port. Before their comming, the Thirty had reſolved to fortifie the Town of <hi>Elewſine,</hi> to their own uſe, whereinto they might make an eaſie retrait, and ſave themſelves from any ſodain danger. It may well ſeem ſtrange, that whereas their barbarous manner of Government had brought them into ſuch danger, they were ſo far from ſeeking to obtain mens good will, that contrariwiſe, to aſſure themſelves of <hi>Elewſine,</hi> they got all of the place that could bear Armes, into their hands by a traine, and wickedly (though under form of juſtice) murdered them all. But <hi>ſceleribus tutum per ſcelera eſt iter,</hi> the miſchiefs which they had already done were ſuch, as left them no hopes of going backwards, nor any other apparant likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of ſafety, then by extending their cruelty unto all, ſeeing few or none were left whom they could truſt. When <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> and his fellows, who as yet were termed Conſpiratours, had taken the <hi>Piraeus,</hi> then were the Three thouſand armed again by the Tyrants, and brought to aſſault it; but in the enterpriſe <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> had the better, and repelled his enemies, of whom although there were ſlain to the number of ſeventy onely, yet the victory ſeemed the greater, becauſe <hi>Critias,</hi> and another of the Thirty peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in that fight. The death of <hi>Critias,</hi> and the ſtout defence of <hi>Peraeus,</hi> together with ſome exhortations uſed by <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> to the Citizens, wrought ſuch effect, that the Thirty were depoſed. Nevertheleſſe there were ſo many of the three Thouſand, who having communicated with the Thirty in their miſdeeds, fearing to be called to a ſharper account, that no Peace nor quiet form of Government could be eſtabliſhed: for Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were ſent to <hi>Sparta,</hi> who craving ayde againſt <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> and his followers, had favourable audience, and a Power ſent to their aſſiſtance, both by Land and Sea, under the conduct of <hi>Lyſander</hi> and his brother; whom <hi>Pauſanias</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> King did follow, rayſing an Army of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties confederate with the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> and here appeared firſt the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, wherein ſome people held the ſtate of <hi>Sparta,</hi> The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who in the late warres had been the moſt bitter enemies to <hi>Athens,</hi> refuſed to follow <hi>Pauſanias</hi> in this expedition; alledging, that it ſtood not with their Oaths to make war againſt that people, who had not hitherto broken any one Article of the League: But fearing ineed leaſt the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſhould annex the Territory of <hi>Athens</hi> to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines. It is not to be doubted that <hi>Pauſanias</hi> took this anſwer in good part, for it was not his purpoſe to deſtroy thoſe againſt whom he went, but onely to croſſe the proceedings of <hi>Lyſande,</hi> whom he envied. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having in ſome ſmall ſcirmiſhes againſt them of <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, made a ſhew of warre, finally wrought ſuch means, that all things were compounded quietly: the Thirty men, and ſuch others as were like to give cauſe of Tumults, being ſent to <hi>Sparta:</hi> The remainder of that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranicall faction having withdrawn themſelves to <hi>Elewſine,</hi> were ſhortly after found to attempt ſome innovation, whereupon the whole City riſing againſt them, took their Captains as they were comming to parley, and ſlew them: which done, to avoid further inconvenience, a law was made, That all injuries paſt ſhould be forgotten, and no man called into queſtion for wrongs committed. By which order wiſely made, and caretully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, The City returned to her former quietneſſe.</p>
