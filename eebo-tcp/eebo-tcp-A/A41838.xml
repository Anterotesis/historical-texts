            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

First, it is an excellent way to keep the grace of love in exercise, this is clear in <hi>Psal. 116. 1. I love the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.</hi> O but love in some hath emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently taken fire when they have reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, that their prayers are heard.</p>
               <p>There is this second Advantage that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hath, It is an excellent motive and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to make us constant and frequent in the exercise of prayer, this is clear in <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 2. where hee reflecteth upon the hearing of his voice, <hi>therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</hi> I am perswaded of this, that our little exercise in prayer, doth much proceed from this, that we wait not for a return of prayer, and therefore oftentimes it is so that we do not receive a return. Believe me, there is more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oy and Divine satisfaction to be found in the solide and spiritual convictions of this that our prayers are heard, than we will have in the exercise of many prayers that we pray.</p>
               <p>There is a third Advantage that a Christian hath from the return and answer of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it is an evident token from the Lord that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is prayer is accepted by him, when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can read his reconciliation by the gracious returns of his <hi>prayer,</hi> and that he is in a gracious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

First, Because when ye are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, ye have then least strength; and is there any amongst you that dare say but the devil then assaults you most bitterly? and when your heart is lying in security, it speaks that ye are in a carnal frame. Secondly, If ye keep not your hearts when ye are secure, then ye may bid faith, love and joy farewell untill some other time, as ye may see in the practice of <hi>Foelix, Go away, and I will hear thee at another time, Acts</hi> 24. 25. I would not desire a more sad case to an enemy then not to keep his heart when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he is under security, for he may bid the graces of the spirit farewel untill another time.</p>
               <p>The last <hi>time</hi> when a Christian ought espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to keep his heart, is, when strong and subtile temptations appear plausible, honest-like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

but yet, alace, many of us drowneth our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions with the sin of tippling, and buries them in the sepulchre of drunkennesse; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, if ye go on so and continue therein, God will plead with you for the samin. The third evidence, one that hath a silent, hardned and deceiving conscience, and whose conscience is silent: By all appearance the devil hath that persons heart in his hand, for the devil intiseth many to sin with greedinesse, and will make their conscience not to reprove them, so that they delight in no better, for he hath taken away the tongue of their conscience, so that it cannot speak: But believe it, the day is coming when your conscience shall be the greatest foe and enemy that ye can or shall have: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, there are many of you here who hath your hearts so hardened, as those that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Ephes. 4. 17, 18. Who walk in the vanity of their own mind, having the understanding dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their hearts.</hi> Your conscience when it is cauterized, it will not speak to you, although ye would commit that damnable <hi>sin against the holy Ghost:</hi> And yee think your selves well enough when it doth not reprove you: But alace, yee sleep with a false witnesse in your bósome, it hath many alluring delusions, but one day the words of it will be as sharp as swords; it will cry, <hi>Peace, peace, when behold sudden destruction:</hi> It will make you sleep sound for all the danger that is hanging above you.

               </p>
               <p>The second <hi>consideration</hi> is, that if ye were to live eighty years, and though ye would weep and mourn fourty of these years perpetually, if it could be possible, and pray other fourty of these years, yet all that would be for nought, if ye will not give him your hearts: Believe me, if ye give not him your hearts, that sentence shall be pronounced upon you, <hi>Depart:</hi> Oh! will ye not give him your hearts who ought to have them, both by Creation and Redemption.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>consideration</hi> is, did ye ever finde any difficulty to believe, or to pray, or to love God?

               </p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>consideration</hi> is, I would propose these three things unto you: First, What is the cause (O atheists) that ye cannot endure hypocrisie, why ye cannot look upon Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? The cause is, You hate not onely the Image and Picture of Christ, but the very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christ: Why hate ye not the rest of sins as well as hypocrisie? It is because the rest of sins looks rather like the devil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye love them, but hypocrites seem to have something of God in them, therefore ye hate them. Secondly, (O atheists) do ye believe that there is a heaven and a hell, and an eternity of pain, and a day of judgment? If ye believed those things, yee would not be so prophane. Thirdly, Did yee ever finde any delight in praising and commending of him? Your hearts saith, no, and your practice saith, no, O wo, wo to you eternally!</p>
               <p>The fifth <hi>consideration</hi> is, the day is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the least iniquity shall be preached in the hearing of angels and men that ever ye committed, there shall not a jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of sin be passed by, and of all sinners, the hypocrites shall have the saddest countenance, because they shall be disappointed of a joyful end, and lose the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Saints which will make them to look with a sad countenance, in that day: A hypocrite will be more moved for the lose of the approbation of the Saints, then for the lose of divine approbation. O! know and consider


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:39050:56"/>
these three things, First, Know that all your iniquities shall be read in the hearing of angels and men: The very thoughts which you have had at midnight shall be known: What will be your thoughts then (O atheists) in that day? Secondly, Know that hypocrisie may win easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the world under the name of grace; but in that day there shall be a clear distinction made. It is hard to rid marches betwixt hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and grace, but God shall take your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorn off your face, and let you be known, and ye shall get the name which ye deserve, O hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites! Thirdly know, That wo shall be to such which shall not be found in Christ at that day; O will you take him and give him your hearts: I take all the Angels in heaven, and all the Saints about the throne of God to witnesse; yea, I take the very stones of these walls, and the timber of this house, and this book in my hand to witnesse against you that ye were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to give your hearts to Christ.</p>
               <p>The last <hi>consideration</hi> is, he that will not give his heart to Christ, believe it, These four things are coming upon him: First, He shall be no more intreated to keep his heart, neither shall he be intreated to give his heart to Christ any more, for the devil shall have it. Secondly, O Atheists! These four things shall overcome you. First, Sin it shall have dominion over you, you once delighted mightily in sin, but alas, it shall be a heavy burden to you in that day. Secondly, The wrath of God shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you, O that shall be a mighty Prince! Thirdly, The devil: And lastly, The lusts of your own hearts, all these shall tread you in the myre. Thirdly, There is this which is


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:39050:56"/>
coming upon you (O atheists) there shall be a sentence of eternal excommunication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against you which would not give your hearts to Christ: These blessed and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lips that alwayes did delight in speaking good to lost sinners, shall then pronounce that sad and woful sentence against you, <hi>Depart from me ye cursed, I know you not!</hi> The last thing which is approaching unto you is, the day is coming when you shall be sent away to that prison, out of which there is no redemption, ye shall be a number of miserable comforters one to another in that day: ye shall not have a grain weight of comfort for all the joy and pleasure which many of you hath had in a world: <hi>you shall be Physicians of no value,</hi> and gnash your tongues for pain! We would say this to you, O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> let the other terrifie you to this noble duty of giving him your hearts, and if ye give him not your hearts, ye shall curse the day that ever you were born, or that ever there was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet amongst you. And ye shall lament that ever ye heard tell of Christ if you make not use of him: Now I would only read the Text over again, <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.</hi> But if you do not keep it with all diligence, out of it shall be the issues of death, ye shall get eternal torments for your reward! Now to him who can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you to give your hearts in keeping to him, and who can anoint your eyes with eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve to see your lost estate, to His blessed Name we desire to give praise.</p>

               <p>THere are two great Books which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian ought mainly to study, there is God, and his own heart: and he would study to know the unspeakable goodness of the one, and the desperat wickedness of the other: And we may say, the first time that a Christian turns over the first page of his heart, and looks upon that desperat wickedness which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he might be constrained to cry out, <hi>Wo is me, I am undone.</hi> Yea, there is as much wickedness in every ones heart who is here, as might be a quarrel to destroy a whole world, if God would contend with us in his just judgement! I think Christians can never trust their hears too little, &amp; they can never trust God to much. And have we not received many proofs of both these? I may say as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> said, <hi>The heart is deceitfull above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> O but a sight of the evil temper of our hearts, and a sight of the goodness of God, would make many of us renounce our self-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and our spiritual pride, and admire his transcendant righteousness. I think a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian ought to be as these four beasts which is mentioned in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. where the four beasts that are spoken of there, may relate to the Ministers of the Gospel, and may also be taken for every real Christian: First, We should be full of eyes before to wait on Christ and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:39050:57"/>
upon him <hi>as an hand-maid upon her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,</hi> and not to reflect upon these things that are behind, as to rest upon them, according to that word of the Apostle, <hi>I presse hard toward the mark, forgetting the things that are behind, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, A Christian should look to those things that are behind; to guard against enemies, and to be much in searching his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wayes, to see how much of them hath been given to God, and how much of them hath been given to the Devil. Thirdly, Christians should be full of eyes within to examine themselves and to see their own corruptions. There are many who have eyes without to take notice of other peoples carriage, but they have no eyes to look within to themselves: O would to God that there were fewer markers and observers of other peoples carriage, and moe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminers and lookers to themselves, <hi>Purifying our selves, even as he is pure.</hi> Fourthly, We should be as a <hi>Lion</hi> in our walk, to point out our boldness against the devil and his temptations. Fifthly, We should be like a <hi>Calf,</hi> or an <hi>Oxe,</hi> to point out our laboriousness. Sixthly, We should be like <hi>the face of men,</hi> to point out our understanding and knowledge. Lastly, We should be like a <hi>flying Eagle,</hi> to point out our heavenly mindednesse, all our conversation should be directed by the Law of God, all our thoughts and all our actions, and all our words should be conformable to his mind, and as the Eagle hath wings, so also ought we to have wings, even as they had six wings, we should have two of them to cover our face, to point out the reverence which we ought to give to God; and we should have two wings to cover

                  </gap> Imperfections, and the crooked paths we walk into. O Christians, will ye study these three following things, and ye will not have so high thoughts of your selves as oftentimes ye have. First, It is through the restraining grace of God, that those grievous sins which ye commit, comes not up to the perfection of <hi>Adultery, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy</hi> and <hi>Incest.</hi> Secondly, There is no sin which ye commit, but there is some secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to it, although ye think ye hate it much. Thirdly, It is impossible for you to comprend, take up, and remember those ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities that you have committed since ye were born, as <hi>David</hi> is convinced, <hi>Psal. 51. 2. Cleanse me from my sin,</hi> &amp;c. which we conceive to be not only from his known sins, but from his sins which he had forgotten: And therefore he bids God make them known unto him, and I would say this to you, <hi>David who was a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods own heart,</hi> he knew not the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his sins: and O how much lesse can we that never came the hundreth part so far? And also you may see it in the practice of <hi>Joh. How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we come to the words, and there is four things which we spoke to from them at the last occasion: First, The duty commanded, <hi>Keep thy heart.</hi> Secondly, The qualification how this duty of keeping the heart should be gone about, and it is <hi>with all diligence.</hi> Thirdly, That the heart of man hath many temptations seeking it, which is likewise presupposed in


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:39050:58"/>
that word, <hi>keep thy heart with all diligence.</hi> Lasty, The reasons why we should keep it, for <hi>out of it are the issues of life.</hi> Now for the first thing in the words, we spoke to two things from it, First, That it was a Christians duty to keep his heart. Secondly, What was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under this for a Christian to keep his heart, and likewise of those disadvantages which a Christian hath from the not keeping of the heart. Now for the first thing, to wit, that it is a Christians duty to keep his heart. We shall speak yet to some Considerations to perswade you to this duty.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Consideration</hi> is, Take notice of the had qualifications of the heart, and there is six or seven bad qualifications of it. First, The heart is exceeding deceitful, <hi>Jer. 17, 9. The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperatly wicked, who can know it!</hi> and likewise <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaks of a <hi>deceived heart</hi> which leads people aside, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 20. The heart of man is a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, it will preach <hi>peace, peace,</hi> when there is none. O it is deceitfull, it will make us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinne when there is no outward pleasure therein. Secondly, That <hi>the heart is desperatly wicked, who can know it?</hi> that is, if there were threatnings, commands, promises, and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of sin, yet the heart will cause you to sin, if hell were put in your way, yet for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of an idol, ye would run to the sin. Thirdly, That there is a cursed union betwixt the heart and idols, <hi>Hos. 4 8. And they set their heart on their iniquity.</hi> Hos. 4. 17. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to his Idols, let him alone.</hi> And that word is thrice repeated in <hi>Ezek. 14 3, 4, 5. They have set up their Idols in their hearts:</hi> Keep your hearts

with all diligence, I say, lest that union be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained. Fourthly, There is many of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> they go to the dead.</hi> Alas, there is nothing bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> their Idols.</hi> Certainly the madness of our heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> speaks that we keep not our hearts. Fifthly, Our hearts are divided, as in <hi>Hos. 10. 2. Then heart is divided,</hi> &amp;c. which speaks a great neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of keeping our hearts. Sixthly, Our hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> are exceeding whoorish, <hi>Ezek. 6. 9. Because I am broken with their whoorish heart which hath departed from me,</hi> &amp;c. Lastly, Our hearts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dull and ignorant in the wayes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, as in <hi>Eph. 4. 18. Having the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindnesse of their heart.</hi> There is such an Egyptian darknesse upon our hearts, that wee cannot know sin, there is some of us that (I fear) knows not good by evil.</p>
               <p>The second <hi>consideration</hi> is, that there is such a difficulty to keep our hearts, therefore wee ought strongly to guard them: <hi>Adam</hi> had his heart but a short time in keeping, and yet hee could not keep it; which shews the difficulty in keeping of it, <hi>Psal. 25. 20. O keep my soul, and deliver me, let me not be ashamed, for I put my trust in thee. 1 Pet. 4. 19. Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithfull Creator.</hi> I would say to you, pray that prayer which Christ prayed when he was

                  </gap>eart, and then it was brought forth.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>consideration</hi> is, That the heart is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng of our hearts, is the cause of many of your walkings so prophanely as we do; It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for you to walk with God aright, if ye have not your hearts keeped: if ye would keep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

take the idol than Christ: I would only say this by the way to you, Are there not many here, that if they would tell that which is their practice, they might condemn themselves, for this, that absence and distance with Christ was never so great a burden to their spirits as the want of the actual enjoyments and fruition of an idol, and doth not this speak that ye prefer your idols before Christ? <hi>not this man, but Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rab as,</hi> is the cursed divinity of many of your hearts.</p>
               <p>The second thing which I would speak to you, is this, a Christian should not delay to give obedience to this precious and soul-concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing command of keeping his heart: I know there are some that doth not simply deny obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this command, but they postpone the giving obedience unto it untill another time.

them, when there is no peace to them from God; and in speaking to this, that a Christian should keep his heart from the deceivings of his own heart. I shall speak a little to two things, First, what are these deceits that lodges in the heart of man.</p>
               <p>And there is this first deceit of the heart of man, the most sinfull thing that can be; wee can put a favourable title and name upon it, there are few sins which any are lying under, but they can put a favourable title upon them. Do not many call their presumption faith? Are there not many that call security peace? Are there not many that call passion zeal? Are there not many that call their lukewarmnesse, and indifferency in things of godlinesse, their spiritual wisdom? Are there not many that call their misbelief humility? And are there not many which call their vain prodigality morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to the things of a world? And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, are there not many which call their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindedness fraugality? This was the deceit of <hi>Jehu,</hi> that called his proud loving of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom zeal: <hi>Come see,</hi> saith he, <hi>and behold my zeal for the Lord,</hi> whereas if he had spoken the language of his own heart, he might have said, <hi>Behold my zeal for my self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is this deceit of the heart of man, that the most excellent &amp; choise things of God, our hearts can put an unpleasant name and construction upon them; as for instance, Are there not many who call tendernesse hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie? And are there not many who call humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of spirit stupidity? And are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who call zeal for God rashnesse? This was the cause that caused <hi>Ahaz</hi> fall, he called believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in God, tempting of God: <hi>I will not tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> pressed to faith in God; it is a cursed practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the hearts of many, they put a false rob up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> godlinesse, and studies then to flee from it: J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> like the practice of the Jews, they put <hi>a scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let rob upon Christ, and then mocked him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this third deceit of the heart of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that it doth present as impediments and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions to hinder us from the exercise of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I would pose you, O Christians! Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> your hearts proposed a diversion from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of that duty? This is clear, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 13. <hi>The sloathful man saith, There is a Lion in the way, a Lion is in the streets:</hi> He presents to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an imaginary impediment to divert him from his duty, which words points out the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the excuse, seeing there uses not to be Lions in the streets nor in the high-wayes; they frequenting more in solitary and desart places; this is also clear in <hi>Song</hi> 5. 3. where the carnal and secure heart of the Spouse, when she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> called to open to Christ, she presents this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, <hi>I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?</hi> I shall only in speaking of these impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, which our cursed hearts doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to divert us from duty, instance them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the exercise of prayer, that our heart doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose several impediments to divert us from that precious and soul-concerning duty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> prayer, and I shall name five impediment which our cursed and carnal hearts doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to hinder us from that duty, after God hath presented to us a golden opportunity for doing of the duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:39050:68"/>
First, Our carnal heart doth propose this impediment, O say ye, I am not in a praying frame, and so I must desist from this duty of prayer at this time: I would say to such that desist from prayer, because they are not in a praying frame, these two words: First, Do ye suppose the way to attain to a praying frame, is to desist from prayer; should ye not go to prayer, that ye may be helped to win to a praying frame. Secondly, Do ye never go to prayer but when ye are in a praying frame? I suppose ye pray not once in a week then, and it is much if ye pray once in a month, if ye pray not but when ye are in a praying frame.</p>
               <p>The second impediment is, our hearts tells us, it will be more advantage not to pray, than to pray: Sometimes a Christian will be under that conviction that he doth more offend God in prayer, than in desisting from prayer, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that accompt we do fold our hands, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects this duty. First, I would say this to such, It is indeed a sad and afflicting thing, the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of God so much in prayer, but it is far sadder to give over prayer. Secondly, I would say this to such, I can hardly believe that ever ye can offend God so much in prayer, as by the total neglect of that duty.</p>
               <p>There is this hard impediment which our hearts doth propose to divert us from duties, and especially from the exercise and duty of prayer: we argue thus with our selves, we are not under the sensible necessity of what we need; and so we say, we will not go to God at this time, for if we pray under such a case, we will turn but complementers with God, we will but flatter him with our mouth, and lie to


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:39050:69"/>
him with our tongue. I would say this to such, the best way to bring up your hearts to the sensible conviction of your necessity, is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> much in the exercise of prayer; a Christian must pray for sorrow of sin, if he want it, a Christian must pray for sense of necessity, if he want it, and a Christian must pray for tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse when he wants it: Prayer is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall messenger which we must constantly send to God for the supply of all our necessities: There is not a case which a Christian can be in, but prayer may go to God as a messenger for a remedy to such a case, when he stands in need.</p>
               <p>The fourth impediment which our carnal hearts proposeth to divert us from prayer, is, our hearts are not under an right majestick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of God, and so ye say, if we go to prayer at this time, we will be guilty of the third command, <hi>in taking his holy Name in vain:</hi> If we go to prayer at this time, saith our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving hearts, we will but run our selves into that sin, <hi>To speak to God as to our companion:</hi> I confesse it is a sad thing to go to God without some divine impression of his Soveraignty and Majesty; and I would say this to you, I think it is one of the most sad and undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the little grace of God which is in the hearts of many; that constantly in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they speak to God as to their companion; but I would ask this question at you, When went ye to prayer but ye might find your hearts short-coming in the due apprehension of the Majesty of God?</p>
               <p>The last impediment which our carnal hearts doth propose to divert us from the exercise of prayer, is this, We say (many of us) that it is


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:39050:69"/>
an inconvenient time for the exercise of that duty, therefore our hearts saith, that we should delay the time of praying til a more convenient season, according to that practice in <hi>Hag. 1. 2. The time is not come, the time that the Lords house should be built.</hi> It is the cursed practice of our hearts, that when God presents an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to pray, we delay praying at that time under the expectation of a more convenient season for going about that duty; just like that word which <hi>Felix</hi> spoke to <hi>Paul,</hi> we speak that to our occasions. O occasion that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to me to pray in, <hi>Go away at this time, and at a more convenient occasion I will call for thee again:</hi> I would say this to these which doth so much slight the opportunities pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to them to pray: I would only say these three words unto you who doth so; First, What know ye, even ye which slights the call of God to go about prayer? What know ye, I say, but that may be the last call from heaven that ever ye shall get to pray? I would have Christians, and all of you that is here, meditating upon this, that when occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are presented to you, ye may argue thus, with your selves, I must imbrace this occasion, for I know not but this may be the last occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, I would say this to you which slights your occasions to pray, when the next occasion is presented to you, ye will be more unfit for the exercise of prayer; and when the convenient time that ye did propose to your selves is come, ye will then defer it till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. Thirdly, I would say this unto you who slights these golden opportunities that are presented to you to pray, know this

in God, or peace with God? I suppose there are not many, but their hearts would say, they have peace with God: O that is a damnable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the heart, that oftentimes it preaches peace to a man or a woman, when there is no peace to them from God. I shall only to make this deceit appear more lively in its native co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, say this of it. 1. That is a most myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and strong deceit of the heart that will so speak peace to a man, sometimes the word will speak war to a man, and yet his heart will speak peace to him: And O is not that a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious deceit, that I suppose if an Angel from Heaven, would preach that doctrine to you, that there is no peace betwixt God and you, many of your hearts would (for all that) preach and speak peace to your selves. And, 2. This makes it a most mysterious deceit, that sometimes your consciences doth declare and preach to you, that you are not at peace with God, yet over the belly of that assertion, your hearts will preach peace to you. 3. This makes it a most mysterious deceit, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding your lives and conversations that they testifie to your selves and others that you are at enmity with God, yet your hearts will preach peace to you.</p>

                  </gap>hat is under the spirit of bondage and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, they cannot pray as they ought, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement makes prayer a most unpleasant duty, as is clear, <hi>Psal. 77. I am so troubled, that I cannot speak.</hi> Discouragement (as it were) hinders and obstructs the exercise of prayer. Secondly, Discouragement doth exceedingly interrupt the exercise of faith, as in <hi>Psal. 42. 5. Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

If you would not interrupt the lively acting of Faith, ye would study to guard against discouragement, that ye do not sit down and draw desperate conclusions against your selves, I know ye may call a Christian <hi>Marah,</hi> now; because he is indeed under bitternesse; but the day is approaching when we may call a Christian <hi>Noami,</hi> when he shall be comforted with the consolations of God.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Consideration</hi> to press you to guard against discouragment, is, there is no duty that a Christian is called to when he is under dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement but it makes it a burthen to him, according to that word <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 9. discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought forth that resolution, then I said <hi>I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his Name</hi> &amp;c. A soul that is under the exercise of Faith moves swiftly as the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots of <hi>Aminadab;</hi> but a soul that is under the exercise of discouragement, moves as the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> heavily.</p>
               <p>Lastly, there is this <hi>Consideration</hi> to presse you to guard against discouragement, and it is this, misbelief and discouragement is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Apostacie, as is clear in <hi>Lam. 1. 8. she sigheth,</hi> and what followeth upon? <hi>and turneth backward.</hi> And it is no wonder discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grow big with child of Apostacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it makes duties become tastelesse.</p>
               <p>Now the rest of the things which we would have a Christian keeping his heart from, we shall onely but name them briefly unto you.</p>

                  </gap> of the sin of slighting known duties.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Aggravation</hi> is, when a perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> against thy judgments.</hi> I confesse, sinning against convictions of conscience (especially when they are sharp) is a greater sin than to sin against light, this is indeed to sin with a lifted up hand, and not to blush, nor be ashamed, nor yet to be afraid to commit iniquity. Know now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there are many here that slight known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties notwithstanding of light, and the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of conscience which they have had for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so: I would only say to that person, be afraid and stand in awe lest the day may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, when God shall cease to be a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto you, and the reinyies shall be laid on your own neek, and you shall be <hi>as a wild Asse snuffing up the wind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second <hi>Aggravation</hi> of slighting known duties, is when a person slights known duties after God hath been discovering discontent with another person for that sin, when we see the justice of God overtaking another person for slighting of a known duty, and yet the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which stands beside, is not afraid to persist in the same sin. This is clear, <hi>Jer. 3. 8. And I


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:39050:78"/>
saw, when for all these causes whereby back-slid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Israel committed adultery, I had put her away, and give her a bill of divorce: yet her treacherous sister</hi> Judah <hi>feared not, but went and played the Harlot also.</hi> As if he had said, though <hi>Judah</hi> have beheld what I have done to <hi>Israel</hi> for her whoorish carriage, yet notwithstanding of this, <hi>she went and played the harlot also.</hi> I confesse this is a greater aggravation than the former, and it speaks that such a sinner (in a manner) hath given a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iance to the justice of God, and hath cryed out (in a manner) I care not what God will do, I will do my pleasure.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Aggravation</hi> of the sin of flight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known duties, is, when persons flights known duties after God hath begun to contend with them for so doing, this is a mighty aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of sin, as is clear, <hi>Isa. 57. 17. For the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his covetousnesse was I wroth, and smot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ighting such a duty, yet to persist in it, O that is a scarlet and mighty transgression, and yet are there not many here who are such?</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Aggravation</hi> of flighting known duties, is, when a person slights known duties upon very smal temptations, is not this certain, a word of a temptation, the half of a word; yea, the very nod of a temptation will put us from the doing of known duties? Yea, sometimes we will be glad of a temptation to divert us from the exercise of duties; yea, sometimes it is known, when temptations are not present to divert us from the exercise of known duties,


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:39050:79"/>
we will go forth and seek a temptation. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the devil needs not to be at much pains i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> not them, they will seek him!</p>
               <p>The fifth <hi>Aggravation</hi> of the sin of slighting known duties, is, when persons does not so much as set about well doing of them, that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> great aggravation, this is clear, <hi>Luke 12. 47. He that knowes his masters will, and doth it not, neither doth prepare himself to do it, is worthy of double stripes.</hi> He will not take pains to prepare his heart for duty, that is a mighty aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Some they are content to be under their setters as though they were bound of God, some they are content to live under their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as though it were impossible for them to answer them; and they say <hi>there is no hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sixth <hi>Aggravation</hi> of slighting known duties, is, when a person slights duties after God hath commended the beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of such duties; that is no doubt a great aggravation, as when God doth commend pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and discovers the beauty thereof to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, O then it is a sad and lamentable thing for that person to sit down and slight his duty, that is (as it were) to slight prayer when it hath on all its ornaments.</p>
               <p>A seventh <hi>Aggravation</hi> is, of slighting known duties, is when persons slight duties after they have been convinced of the advantage which waits upon the doing of them: Are there not some that slight prayer, notwithstanding they have been convinced that prayer hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a <hi>mount tabor</hi> in which they have seen Christ transfigured? some they will slight


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:39050:79"/>
prayer, after they have been convinced that prayer hath been the trysting-place betwixt Christ and them, and after they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that prayer hath been as the top of mount <hi>Pisgah,</hi> on which they have gotten a view of the promised land, O that is a notable aggravation of slighting of known duties, when the person hath this to say, Now I am slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my own advantage?</p>
               <p>There is this last <hi>Aggravation,</hi> when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son slights known duties, yet with very little resentment and grief of heart: Are there not many that have slighted their morning prayer here to day, and yet not have convictions therefore? And are there not many persons here to day, that oftentimes goeth to bed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out saying their prayers, and yet have as much peace of conscience as if they had done it? I think a person hath gone a great length in hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heart, when he can slight known duties, and yet not be grieved; yea, and it is a token that they have not only to do with a hardned conscience, but with a hardned will: Are there not many persons that notwithstanding of the slighting of known duties, yet never had a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart therefore? Doth not the misbeliever slight the commandement of faith, and yet not weep for it? Doth not the secure Christian slight the commandement of prayer, and yet not be grieved therefore? Doth not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous sinner slight self examination, and yet is not much grieved? And doth not the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute sinner that is under the power of his idols slight the commandement of mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet not have a sore heart for it?</p>
               <p>Now the second thing which I shall speak


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:39050:80"/>
from the scope, is, I shall propose some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to presse you to the exercise of all known duties.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Consideration,</hi> it is the Christian which practises, and not the Christian which knoweth, to whom the promises are made: Would ye know the Christian which hath a right to the promises? It is not the Christian which knoweth his duty, but it is the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that doth his duty; This is clear in <hi>Matth. 7. 21. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> I think if the promises had been annexed to knowledge of duties; then doubtlesse <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> had been in heaven; it is not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christian, but it is the practising Christian to who the promises are made.</p>
               <p>The second <hi>Consideration</hi> to presse you to the exercise of known duties, it is the Christian that is taken up in practising, and not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christian that is blessed; would ye know the blessed Christian? It is not he that knows his duty only, but it is he which knoweth his duty and doth it; according to that word, <hi>Joh. 13. 17. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> Where ye may see happinesse is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to doing, and not to knowing: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, if ye could speak your duty like an Angel, and if ye knew the smallest command in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be a command lying at your door, yet if ye do it not, ye shall never be blessed. O, know it, there are many knowing persons in hell to day!</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Consideratirn</hi> to presse you to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it, is the practising Christian, and not the


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:39050:80"/>
knowing Christian that is approven and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of God; This is clear, <hi>Song 7. 1. How beautifull are thy feet with shoes, O Princes daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c. Christ takes first notice of the Brides feet, which is her practice, and commends her from that; believe it, Christ commends a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians feet, more than his eyes, that is, his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, more than his knowledge: It is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising Christian which shall have that word spoken to him in the day of the Lord, <hi>Well done good and faithful servant;</hi> it is not said, well known good and faithfull servant, but it is said, <hi>well done,</hi> for if you know never so much, and yet not practise it, Christ will never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you.</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Consideration</hi> to press you to the doing of known duties, it is not the knowledge, put the practice of duties which will give peace to a Christians conscience, if ye would know all the commandements in the Bible, and yet never do one of them, it is nothing, it is not your knowledge that will give your conscience peace. I say this to you, many others knowing and their slighting of duty, in one day will make their conscience roar like a Lion, and they have nothing to answer it. I say unto you, O Christians! if ye would have peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the great and terrible day of the Lord, then practise what ye know, and desire to know what ye ought to practise.</p>
               <p>The fifth <hi>Consideration,</hi> it is the practice of your duty, and not the knowledge of your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by which ye rise up in conformity with God; it is the practising of what ye know, and not the knowledge of what ye should do, that raises you up in conformity with him; if ye


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:39050:81"/>
know all that ye should do, and do it not, ye may be strangers to God, in respect of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with him, as if ye were meer ignorants. I wish there were in these dayes lesse know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and more practice, or rather I wish there were more knowledge and practice both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I think the Christians of this time sins against a witnes in heaven, and a witnes against their own conscience: I think there are some (but few amongst us) in these dayes that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth out of ignorance, but I would say this, the person that sins out of knowledge, condemns himself, but the person that sins out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the law condemns him.</p>
               <p>There is this, thirdly, that I would say to you from the scope, I would have you obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving these six things concerning known duties.</p>
               <p>And first, many persons are more desirous to know what they should do, then to do what they know: Some persons cry out, <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord?</hi> and the Lord may answer them with this, <hi>Have I not shewed thee? O man!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this second thing which I would have you knowing, the question which shall be proposed to you in the great and notable day of the Lord it shall not be, O man! what knowest thou? But it shall be, O man! what didst thou? This shall be the question which Christ shall put home to you in that day, What didst thou in thy lifetime, and not what knowest thou in thy liftime.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I would say this, believe it, A grain weight of sincerity and practice, is worth a talent of knowledge: it is better to practise as the weakest Christian, than to know as the


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:39050:81"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ost excellent angel, not practising what we know: Christ weight not our grace by quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, but by quality; not by degrees but by the truth and reality of them: I say, if thou knew never so much, a grain weight of sincerity and practice in Gods sight, is more worth than it all: If thou were as eloquent as <hi>Appollos,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>s wise as <hi>Solomon,</hi> and could ye speak with as many tongues as <hi>Paul,</hi> and if ye knew and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood all mysteries, yet if ye do not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise your duties, it is all to no purpose.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I would say this, the slighting of known duties hath many sad disadvantages waiting upon them, and I shall name these four unto you. First, The slighting of duties, it is that which makes Christians weary in duties; Is there any person here that slights duties at such &amp; such a time, I prophesie this to thee, thou shalt weary of duties ere long, this is clear, <hi>Isa. 43. 22. But thou hast not called upon me, O Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, but thou hast been weary of me, O</hi> Israel. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> say, slighting of duties, and wearying in duties they will not be long asunder: Secondly, slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of known duties brings on much hardnesse and stupidity of heart, according to that word in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 16. where disobedience and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart are knit together: Would you know the reason why so many persons are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so much deadnesse, and under so many bonds? It is because they slight known duties. Thirdly, The slighting of known duties doth these three things to our conscience. It either marres the peace of Conscience, or else it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the conscience. Or thirdly, It luls our conscience a sleep. I wonder how many of us can cal our selves render, since there is so much


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:39050:82"/>
slighting of that we ought to do. Are ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not many Christians, which may soon tell al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their privat prayers that they make to God. There is a fourth disadvantage which waits o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the slighting of known duties, and it is this the Christian who slights duty sometimes, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> duty which a Christian doth, it is exceeding formal: There are some Christians which slights prayer one day, and the second day, and it is one to a hunder but the third day whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> that Christian prayes, but it be meer forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. O what makes Christians pray so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? It is because they teach their hearts th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> arte of praying formally by slighting of duty.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I would say this to you, the slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of known duties is the first step of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> against the Holy Ghost. This is clear in <hi>Heb. 10. 26. For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more sacrifice for sin.</hi> Ile tell you what is betwixt the sin of slighting known duties, and the sin against the Holy Ghost, there is no more betwixt them both but that word <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</hi> And what knowest thou, but thy slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of duties may come to wilfulness ere long? Ye would know this, that under the Law there was Sacrifices for sins of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for sins of <hi>infirmities,</hi> but there was no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for presumptuous sins, now if this be the first step towards the sin against the holy Ghost, I am sure there are some here which have gone this length, yea, and I fear a little further: Now will ye take home this conviction, and I would say this, let the person which is not guilty of this offence amongst us, take up the first stone and cast at us: I suppose our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

might accuse us, and we might steal out one by one. O! the dreadfull disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which attends that person that slights known duties! This is a strange thing, our consciences are no more moved at what one can speak of that which is our sin indeed, than though it did not concern us: I suppose there is not one here, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they may write this on their fore-heads, <hi>Guilty, guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there is this lastly which I would say unto you. The day is coming when the slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of known duties, shall be forced to cry out, Ah that I had been an idiot &amp; had never known my duty! I confesse the slighting of known duties, and the sinning against Light, shall be a mighty aggravation of our sin. O what terror was it to <hi>Judas</hi> conscience when he came to think of this, <hi>I sold my Master, and I know I have sinned in so doing!</hi> And O what terrour likewise will it be to you, when ye shall be convinced of this, my conscience told me that this was my duty, and I would not do it!</p>
               <p>Now the next thing which we shall speak to from the words in general is, that God (in the depth of his condescendancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) hath many various wayes in making known duties unto a person or people, this is clear from the words, where God having pressed duties upon this people by the voice of his Ministers, now he sends a more sad and terrible preacher to them; even a <hi>threatning Rod.</hi> Now this is clear that God hath many wayes in pressing people to their duties, <hi>Isa. 5. 4. What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it,</hi> &amp;c. This is also eminently clear, <hi>Songs 5. 2. Open to me my sister, my Spouse,</hi> and if that will


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:39050:83"/>
not do it, he will knock at the door and say, <hi>it is the voice of thy beloved that knocketh,</hi> and if this will not do it, he will use arguments to perswade her; <hi>open to me my sister,</hi> is not that an argument? yet he will give her another, <hi>for my head is filled with dew, and my hair with the drops of the night,</hi> and if all these will not do it, Christ will put in his hand by the hole of the door, which speaks this, that Christ in the depths of his condescendency, leaves nothing unassayed to presse people to their duty. This is also clear, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 26, 27, 28. where <hi>he sets life and death, blessings and cursings</hi> before them to presse them to their duty. I confesse there are many in heaven to day that Christ never took the half of the pains on them as he hath taken on some of us, and there are many in hell to day, upon whom Christ took never half so much pains as he hath done on some of us: and is it not then a wonder that we are not sent away to hell likewise? Now I will tell you six great voices or means wherewith God presseth people to their duty.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>voice</hi> is, the voice of threatnings, all the threatnings which is in the Scripture, this is the voice of them all, O give obedience to your duty! This is remarkably clear from that choise and remarkable place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. ver. 3 6, 7. <hi>Therefore go thou and read this roll which thou hast written from my mouth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Baruch,</hi> he is commanded to read all the threatnings of God to his people, and what is the precious end he hath before him? <hi>It may be they will present their supplication before the Lord, and will return every one from his evil way,</hi> &amp;c. This is the very end and scope of Gods threatnings, that persons


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:39050:83"/>
may present their prayers before him; and he will shake the Rod over our heads for this end. Therefore I say, give the threatnings of God (who are his Messengers) that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and it is, to put the Rod by the door.</p>
               <p>The second great <hi>voice</hi> whereby God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times presses home duties upon folk, is by the voice and Rod of these sad afflicting dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we meet with: This is (indeed) the end of them that persons would give obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the commands of God, this is clear in the very scope where he presses them to hear the voice of the Rod, that they might give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their duty. And it is also clear from that sweet and excellent promise, <hi>Ezek. 20. 37. And I will cause you to passe under the Rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant.</hi> I say the very great end and design of God in sending Rods, is, that persons may be engaged to their duty.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>voice</hi> wherewith God presses people to their duty, is by the voice of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, what is the great voice of the Covenant of promises? It is, give obedience to commanded duties: This is clear, <hi>Ezek. 11. 19, 20. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; And I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and I will give them an heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them,</hi> &amp;c. As it were, all the great promises of the Covenant have this promise, obey, and ye shall have, it is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that leads us to the possession of the promises.</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>voice</hi> whereby God presseth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the doing of known duties, is, by the


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:39050:84"/>
voice of all the mercies which we meet with; I say, the voice of them all is this, <hi>O give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his commandements:</hi> Yea, this is the very language of mercies: All the great things which God hath done to you, what is the scope and end of them all? It is, <hi>O will ye come and obey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Doth not the great <hi>voice</hi> of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> consciences, and of all the convictions which God rooves upon them, do they not say, O give obedience, and <hi>obey him with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this last <hi>voice</hi> whereby God presses people to the doing of known duties, and it is by the voice of all the publike Ordinances; what is the great voice of all these preachings which we daily preach unto you, but this, O give obedience to the Commands?</p>
               <p>Now I would say this unto you, O people in <hi>Glasgow!</hi> hath not God spoken to you by all these voices? Hath he not spoken unto you by mercies? Hath he not spoken unto you by threatnings? by the voice of promises? by the voice of the rod? by the voice of our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? and by the voice of publike ordinances? Oh! look that the 26. Chapter of <hi>Leviticus</hi> be not <hi>Glasgows</hi> plagues! Lord keep this place from Gospel-condemnation. <hi>For it is a fearful and dreadful thing to fall in the hands of the living God! yet seven times more, yet seven times more,</hi> I fear be your plague, Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what can God do more to us nor he hath done? Have we not pressed this duty upon you that ye would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Christ, and that this duty might be your delight! If Christ cannot allure us to give our hearts away to him, (in a manner) he will


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:39050:84"/>
force us to give our hearts to him. I confesse it is sad to slight and disobey the voice of the Rod. God hath two times fearfully shaken the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s it not known that we stop our ears to this precious invitation and cry which Christ hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o us, <hi>O take me.</hi> Therefore, I say, O give Christ your hearts, and then he will hear your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oice.</p>
               <p>There is a second <hi>step</hi> of judgement which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly befals these who slight these great and precious voices by which God is speaking to us: and it is, Be afraid that at last thou come not to this, that thou shalt have no answer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, I would have you taking notice of this, that it is exceeding much of the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Christian to believe and close with this truth, that there is not a grain weight of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o hear) this is an help to patience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I would have you taking notice of this, I think there are some Christians that is forced to blesse God more for their crosses than for their mercies, &amp; that they have been forced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> their darkest nights to cry out, <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this fourthly which I would have you taking notice of, that the crosse of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, it hath two faces, an outward face, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> inward face, and the outward face of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>osse seems oftentimes the most unpleasant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut O if a Christian could win to see the inside of his crosse, He might sit down by the River of <hi>Babel,</hi> and there pen songs of praise to God, even praise for this that he hath been afflicted; O it is comfortable to the Christian that Christ hath gone to heaven by the way of the cross, that his blessed feet hath troden that way, and that his precious lips hath drunk of that cup.</p>
               <p>But to come to the words, we told you, that there was five things in the words to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. First, that here was an excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ortation given to the people of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Samariah,</hi> which in short is this, <hi>Hear the voice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f the rod, and who hath appointed it;</hi> and from


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:39050:89"/>
this exhortation ye may take notice of these five things. First, That every cross and sad dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation which a Christian meets with, it hath a voice and language in it, therefore sayes he <hi>hear the voice of the rod,</hi> as if he had said, take notice what the Rod sayes, and what it cals for from you. The second thing to take notice of from this command and exhortation is this, that it is the duty of a Christian to observe &amp; give obedience unto what the Rod speaks a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cals for; therefore is the command given forth <hi>hear the voice of the rod.</hi> The third thing that we take notice of from this command is, that there is a great unwillingness in persons to hear what the Rod speaks, and therefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is put home, <hi>hear the voice of the rod.</hi> Fourthly take notice of this, that the voice of the Rod, and the voice of him that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, are one and the same very thing therefore these two are knit together, <hi>hear the voice of the rod, and of him who hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.</hi> There is this lastly which we would have you taking notice of from this command and exhortation. It is a great point of spiritual widsom for a Christian to take up and hear the voice of the Rod, therefore it is said, <hi>the man of wisdom shall see thy Name.</hi> It is not every man that can take up what the Rod speaks, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the man that is indued with much heavenly wisdom from God.</p>
               <p>Now as for the first thing that we spake from the words, <hi>viz.</hi> That every rod which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian meets with, it hath a voice in it. Before I speak to this, I would have you to take along these considerations.</p>
               <p>First, It is a singular and most remarkable step

                  </gap>se of a disease is known it is half healed? So when the end that God hath in sending rods, is known and taken up, we may say it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>emoved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Christians of old hath taken much pains to know the voice of the Rods that they meet with, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap> where the land of <hi>Israel</hi> being three years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der famine, <hi>David</hi> went and enquired the cause of that Rod, and it is likewise clear from <hi>Job.</hi> 7. 20. where <hi>Job</hi> is exceeding desirous to know why God set him up at a mark for his arrows, and that he was become a burden to himself.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We would have you to take notice of this, that it is exceeding anxious for a tender Christian to be under a silent Rod, to be under such a dispensation that he knows not the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of it, this is clear in <hi>Job</hi> 3. 23. where <hi>Job</hi> makes this the capestone of his sorrow, that his way was hid, that is, he knew not what was the reason of Gods contending with him after such a way, as likewise it is clear in <hi>Job</hi> 10, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

where <hi>Job</hi> is put to propose that question to God, <hi>Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Consideration,</hi> that we would have you taking along with you, is this, It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> exceeding hard for a Christian to profite by a Rod till once he take up the meaning of it, and I shall give you these three grounds, why it is so hard for a Christian to profite by a Rod till he know the voice and meaning of it: First, Because it is hard for a Christian to win to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Rod, till he know the voice of it, it is the knowledge of the meaning of the Rod that makes a Christian cry out, <hi>I was dumb and opened not my mouth:</hi> Secondly, Because as long as the meaning of the Rod is hid from a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, he knoweth not what remedy to go about to deliver himself from that Rod, but when he knoweth the reason of Gods contending with him, he hath a clear way before him how to win out from the crosse. Thirdly, This is the reason why a Christian cannot profite by the Rod till he know the voice and meaning of it; he cannot win to a solide closing with this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruth, that God is in the Rod, till he win to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he knowledge of the voice of the Rod in some measure; there is nothing will help a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an more to cry out, God is in the Rod, than this, his knowing the reason of Gods contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him.</p>
               <p>There is this fifth <hi>Consideration</hi> that we would propose, a Christian may be long under a Rod before he know the voice and language of it; we conceive this is clear in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 2. where the land of <hi>Israel</hi> is under three years famine before <hi>David</hi> could take up the reason of Gods contending with them: It is


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:39050:90"/>
not to be supposed but <hi>David</hi> had made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent supplications to God for understanding the meaning of that Rod, and yet there are three years interveening before he can know it.</p>
               <p>The last <hi>Consideration</hi> that we would propose unto you, When a Christian wins to take up the voice and language of the Rod, he ought not to delay, but presently go about and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it, this is clear in the practice of <hi>David,</hi> when he knew the reason of Gods contending with him he immediately sets about to remove it. I confesse it is a fault amongst many, they are more desirous to have their crosses removed then to have their crosses sanctified unto them; some prayeth to have the bitterness out of the crosse, more than to have the bittenesse of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> removed out of the crosse.</p>
               <p>Now in speaking to the first thing in the words, <hi>viz.</hi> That every Rod and Dispensation of God hath a voice and language in it: I shall speak a little to these four things. First, How a Christian may win <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o take up the meaning of the Rod in particular afflictions. Secondly, I would speak a little to some mistakes in taking up the voice and language of such a Rod and afflicting dispensation. Thirdly, I would speak to this, how a Christian may be helped to give obedience to the voice of the Rod. Fourthly, I shall speak a little to eight or nine special voices which the Rod oftentimes hath; As for the first of these, <hi>viz.</hi> how a Christian may win to take up the meaning of the Rod and sad Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, I shall prescribe unto you these six wayes.</p>
               <p>First, Be making serious application to the throne of grace, that God would give you light


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:39050:91"/>
concerning such a Rod; This is remarkably clear in that instance in <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 22. where <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi> being under such a particular Rod, and she knew not Gods way in it, therefore she went and enquired of the Lord, and she received a particular and distinct answer to her case; and it is also clear in the practice of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 1. <hi>Israel</hi> being under a Rod of famine, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> went and enquired of the Lord concerning the meaning of it, and he met with a distinct answer: And this is likewise clear in <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 2. where <hi>Job</hi> being in the dark, concerning the meaning of the Rod, he desires <hi>that God would show him wherefore he contends with him.</hi> I will tell you seven sad cases which a Christian may be put to, of which Christ is an excellent resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: The first case which a Christian may be put to, which Christ hath exceeding good skill to resolve, and it is that, <hi>Song</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flocks to rest at noon,</hi> &amp;c. When a Christian knoweth not where Christ is feeding, to go to him, he will sweetly resolve that question, for ye may know this, a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may be brought to these two steps of diser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. First, Christ may be gone, and secondly, ye know not in all the world where to finde him, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 13. in that instance of <hi>Mary,</hi> and in <hi>Job</hi> 23. 3. <hi>Job</hi> hath not only lost God, but also he knoweth not where to finde him. The second case which Christ hath exceeding good skill to resolve, is this, <hi>Who is the Lord that I may believe in him?</hi> That case or question which the blind man was put to, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 36. O will not Christ sweetly resolve that question, Is there any person that hath this question,


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:39050:91"/>
                  <hi>Who is Christ that I may believe in him?</hi> The third case or question which Christ hath excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good skill to resolve, <hi>Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternall life?</hi> Is there any here that is put to that question? go to Christ, and he can sweetly solve it you. The fourth question which Christ can best resolve, is that question which <hi>Paul</hi> had, <hi>What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> The fifth case in which it is best to go to Christ to get it resolved, when a person is brought to this strait, <hi>I know not the mind of the Lord,</hi> go to God and humbly ask, <hi>O why am I thus?</hi> There is this sixth case, and it is <hi>Job</hi> 7. 20. <hi>I have sinned, and what shall I do to thee, O thou preserver of men?</hi> When thou art put to this case, Christ can answer it sweetly thus, <hi>Only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thy iniquity.</hi> The last case which Christ can sweetly resolve, is in the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Text, <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord?</hi> If thou be put to this question, no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer can be given unto it but this, <hi>The sacrifices of the Lord are a broken a contrite heart.</hi> Now this is the first way how a Christian may win to know the voice and meaning of the Rod, even to make serious supplication to God that hee would make known to them his Name.</p>
               <p>There is this second way, by which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may win to know the voice and meaning of the Rod, if the Rod was timed to thee when thy heart was under much distance from God, that probably is the meaning of the Rod, <hi>It is good for thee to draw near to God;</hi> or if the Rod be timed unto a Christian when hee is much taken up in pursuit after the things of the world, and if thy Rod tryst thee when thou art under much formality in going about duties.


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:39050:92"/>
then by all appearance that is the voice of the Rod to thee, to <hi>stir up thy self to take hold on God:</hi> So if a Christian would win to know the meaning of a Rod, let him compare his present frame with the timing of the Rod unto him.</p>
               <p>The third way how a Christian may win to know the voice and meaning of the Rod, is by reflecting on the manner and circumstances of the Rod; for this is certain, the sins of a people or person may be engraven on the Rod in very legible letters, <hi>so that he that runs may read them:</hi> There are sometimes that the Rod doth preach our sins so plainly, that we need not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it; this is clear, <hi>Judges</hi> 1. 6, 7. there is such a relation betwixt <hi>Adoni-bezek's</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his sin, that he might read his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as he did his sins in his stroak; saith he, <hi>Threescore and ten Kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table; as I have done, so God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited me,</hi> &amp;c. For now was he taken prisoner, and his thumbs and great toes cut off: and it is clear from that word that <hi>Solomon</hi> hath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 13. <hi>He that stoppeth his ear at the cry of the poor, he shall cry, and God shall not hear him.</hi> Zach. 7. 13. <hi>Therefore it is come to passe that as he cryed and they would not hear, so they cryed and I would not hear, saith the Lord of hosts:</hi> Where ye may see a divine proportion and analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Rod and the sin.</p>
               <p>The fourth way how a Christian may win to know the voice and meaning of the Rod, and it is by observing what hath been the mind of the Lord, and what he called for from his people in Scripture, when they were put under such a Rod and anxious dispensation: Search what


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:39050:92"/>
was Gods mind to the godly in Scripture under such a Rod, and by all appearance it is yet his mind in the same crosse, according to that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, <hi>Rom. 15. 4. For whatsoever things were written afore-time were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth way for a Christian to win to know the meaning of the Rod, is to be much in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the circumstances of the Rod, there may be circumstances in a Rod by which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may win to exceeding much light concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what is the Lords mind by such a Rod: It is known the observing of the circumstances of a Rod will help a Christian to these three things. First, That such a Rod is from the hand of the Lord. Secondly, That God in the midst of wrath remembreth mercy. Thirdly, It will help a Christian to know the voice and language of the Rod, sometimes in the crosse it self, a Christian cannot read love, and yet in the circumstances of the crosse he may win to read very much love.</p>
               <p>There is this sixth and last way how a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may win to the knowledge of the voice and meaning of the Rod, and it is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that all the Rods and dispensations which a Christian meets with, hath one of these three ends. First, The Rod is either sent to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian that he may mortifie his predominant idols. Or, secondly, for exercise of his predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant grace. Or else thirdly, that he may be put to the exercise of that which ought to be his predominant duty: These are voices and languages of the crosse which a Christian meets with. And I would only by the way say these


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:39050:93"/>
two things to you. First, It is easier to bear a Rod patiently which is for the tryal and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of our predominant grace, than to bear a Rod patiently which is for the mortifying of our predominant idols, there is no Rod which a Christian can bear worse, than the Rod which strikes at the root of his predominant idols; so a proud man he can bear any crosse better nor reproach, and a worldly minded man can bear any crosse better than poverty, so the cross which stands in direct opposition to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant idols, we have great difficulty to bring our hearts to a patient submission under it, are there not many that when their idols are strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, they cry out with that man in <hi>Judg. 18. 24. They have taken away my gods, and what have I more?</hi> Is it not certain that when God strikes somtimes at the root of our predominant idols, we cry out with <hi>Jonah, That it is better for me to die, than to live?</hi> Though I may say, the crosse which we have least will to meet with, is ordinarly best for us: For (if so we may speak) our will and our well are seldom or never knit together; but precious Christ, his will and our well are oftentimes knit together. Secondly, I would say this by the way, There are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily some Analogy betwixt our cross and our sin, if the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did kill all the male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Israelites</hi> by casting them into the River, God doth likewise kill all the first born into the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and if <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abih<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:39050:93"/>
Now the second thing which we promised to speak a little unto, was to some mistakes which Christians have concerning the meaning of the Rod.</p>
               <p>And first, many thinks (indeed) the crosse speaks wrath when it speaks love, and some when they cannot read love in the hand of God, they think it is impossible to read love in his heart, some thinks that love and the Rod can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be together at all: I say, God may never love a person more nor when he is correcting him. But first, I would say to a person under that mistake, we never know by any of these things whether love or hatred belongs to the person that is afflicted; <hi>For all things happen alike to all, as it happens to the fool, so happens it to the wise man, to the righteous even as to the wicked.</hi> Secondly, I would say this to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever that is under this mistake, he reads wrong that reads wrath onely upon the crosse, for it is certain, love is written in dark characters upon it, and the spirituall man he may read them: Hence it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5, 6. We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to remember the exhortation th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> speaks unto us, as unto sons: <hi>My son, despise not thou the chastnings of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him, for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second mistake concerning the meaning of the crosse, is, some thinks God can never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer their prayers so long as he is plag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing them, according to that strange divinity, <hi>Job 9. 16. If I had called, and he had answered me, yet would I not believe that he had hearkned unto my voice.</hi> So this is the mistake, all the answer


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:39050:94"/>
of their prayers are nothing, if God be contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them.</p>
               <p>The third great mistake concerning the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Rod, is when persons begins to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their interest when they meet with such a Rod and sad dispensation, and when they do not (indeed) see what is the reason of Gods contending with them: When he puts them in the furnace, presently to fit down and reject their confidence, and cast away their hope, this is certainly a great mistake of the meaning of the Rod.</p>
               <p>The fourth great mistake of the voice and language of Gods threatning Rod, is for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to think Religion but van<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iy and an empty thing under the crosse, a Christian may be brought to this: Now I would not give a plack for godliness, it is nothing worth at all: as is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 13. when he takes notice, <hi>He was plagued every morning, and the wicked was in prosperity about him,</hi> he cryes out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>verily I have washed my hands in innocency, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my heart in vain:</hi> Yea, it is hard for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son not to cast at Religion when God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with him, O it is hard to have a great respect unto the wayes of godlinesse under the crosse.</p>
               <p>There is this fifth mistake under the crosse, and it is to dispute the fellowship a Christian hath with God, according to that word of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon, Judges 6. 13. If the Lord be with us, how then is all this evil come upon us?</hi> The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will cry out, I cannot reconcile Gods heart and his hand; I cannot reconcile love in God, and his being with me, and this cross and Rod.</p>
               <p>Now thirdly, I would speak a little to this,


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:39050:94"/>
how a Christian may be helped to obey the voice of the Rod, and we conceive if you will take along these things with you, ye may be helped to obey what the rod cals for at your hands.</p>
               <p>And first, then if the rod call for the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of such a particular lust and idol, it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent for you presently to sit down and bring up your hearts to a spiritual detestation of such an idol, that if God be punishing you for your idols, ye must subscribe a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce to them, and cry out, <hi>What have I any more to do with idols?</hi> and say to them, <hi>Get you hence, and cast them away to the moles and to the bats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a second way or help how a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may win to the obedience of the voice of the Rod, and it is, if the voice of the rod be for the mortifying of such an idol, I intreat you sit down &amp; study the disadvantages of such an idol, and study also what hazard there is by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy soul constantly knit to it, that when the voice of the Rod is this to thee; O quite such an idol, or such a <hi>Delilah,</hi> thou must then study to know what it is to thy disadvantage to keep such an idol, and what it is to thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to quite it: I confess there are some that their idols are mortified to their light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be mortified to their affections; yea, there are some, they have a constrained mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, their idols are mortified and die to them before they be mortified to their idols.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the voice of the Rod be this, stir up such a grace, and be much in the exercise and practice of it; then I say, study to know that there is as much spiritual advantage in the


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:39050:95"/>
real and spiritual exercise of such a grace, as ye can lose by all the Rods ye can meet with. Is it not certain that <hi>Job</hi> gained as much spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all advantage by the exercise of his faith, and of his patience; yea, much more than in losing all the things which he lost? if a Christian once knew that his riches consisted in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his grace, there would not be a rod sent for the tryal and exercise of his grace, but he would take it chearfully in his arms.</p>
               <p>The fourth way how a Christian may be helped to win to obey the voice of the rod, and it is, If the voice of the Rod be for the tryal of thy predominant grace, &amp; for the exercise of it, then, I say, consider this, that the tryal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of thy predominant grace by the Rod it shall have (if it be sanctified) a glorious and excellent issue and peace, it is the Rod that hath most noble advantages that is immediatly errected for the tryal of thy predominant grace.</p>
               <p>The sixth way how a Christian may win to obey the voice of the Rod, and it is, If the voice of the rod be that thou should set about the exercise of such a duty, then endeavour seriously that all impediments and lets to that duty be laid aside; as if the crosse call for the exercise of faith, or if the cross call for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of prayer, then I say, remove all things which may be impediments to hinder thee from the exercise thereof, or from the exercise of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith: Leave (as it were) thy servants and thy asses at the foot of the mount, and go thou up and sacrifice all thy idols and lusts.</p>
               <p>The seventh and last way how a Christian may be helped to win to obey the voice of the


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:39050:95"/>
Rod, If the voice of the rod be to be much in the exercise of such a duty, then study to have the luster of that duty, and the beauty thereof commended unto thee. O but prayer is a thing which doth much good to us! I think this is the reason why God hath contended with many; he would make duties sweet to them, and he would make sin bitter.</p>
               <p>Now the fourth thing that I shall speak a little unto, is to what ought to be a Christians duty while he is walking under a silent Rod, and knoweth not the voice of it; and I would give you these five di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ctions how a Christian should carry himself under a silent Rod.</p>
               <p>First, he would know God to be just, though hee knoweth not for what he contends with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he would be serious in making sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to God, to know the distinct mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such a Rod; I confess sometimes we take the rod to be silent, because wee cannot hear the voice of it; but oftentimes the silence of the rod is from this, that wee know not the voice of it, and we hear it not though he speak to us in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dible language, but if a Christian be under a silent Rod, it becomes him then to go to God with this, <hi>I have sinned, I will do so no more, shew me wherein I have offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this third direction which I would give to a Christian under a silent Rod, he would be serious to know what is the reason of Gods keeping up his mind from him in such a Rod; I say, when the rod is dark, and the crosse is silent, it is suitable then to say, What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this that God doth not let me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the voice and language of the Rod? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:39050:96"/>
there may be sad things hinted at when God puts a Christian under dark and dumb crosses, however although it be so, I think it is good for us to be walking submissively in the dark, for hee will guide the blinde in the way that they know not; sometimes it is better for us to have dumb and silent crosses than to have a speaking crosse.</p>
               <p>The fourth direction, The Christian would study to bring his heart to a tender and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all frame; for sometimes our not understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the voice of the Rod, it is because we are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> spiritual.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I would give this direction to the Christian who is under a dark and silent crosse, study at that time to have thy heart most united to Christ, for at that time thou is most ready to fall: O that is a time when the devil fishes most, because that is the Christians drumly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (so to speak) O it is known, the devil never gets any advantage over a Christian so much as when he knows not the meaning of the crosse! I confesse the devil will tell you a false mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a crosse, he can interpret the language of a crosse after another way th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> God doth interpret it.</p>
               <p>Now being to choose our discourse, I shall name these eight or nine Observations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the crosse, which I would have you taking notice of.</p>
               <p>First, When a Christian doth first meet with a crosse, he may be patient and submissive under it, and yet if the threed of the affliction be spun out to any length, hee may turn impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. I confesse it is not much the first day that the crosse meets with us to be patient; but let


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:39050:96"/>
the crosse ly on us, then we will cry out, why is it that God deals thus with me? this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> clear in the practice of <hi>Job,</hi> when first he met with the crosse he could take it in his arms, and cry out, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be His Name.</hi> But let the crosse ly a little while on <hi>Job,</hi> then he will cry out, <hi>I choose strangling and death rather than life:</hi> A green wound is half whole (as we use to speak) but let once our wound begin to feaster, then we will be impatient.</p>
               <p>The second Observation which we would have you to take notice of concerning the crosse, There are five sorts of blasphemy which one that is under a crosse may fall into. First, He may fall into that blasphemy of calling God unjust, according to that word, <hi>Ezek. 18. 25. Yet yee say the way of the Lord is not equal,</hi> &amp;c. The second sort of blasphemy is, when we call God unfaithful; according to that strange word, Jer. 15. 18. <hi>Wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?</hi> O do wee not think that God is not half so good as his word under the crosse? The third sort of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is, when wee call God weak; there are sometimes we are brought to that, <hi>Is there no balm in Gilead? and is there no Physician there? my stroke is grievous, and my wound is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>able.</hi> Sometimes when wee are under the crosse, we think it is above Gods power to set us free from it. The fourth sort of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy which a man may have under the crosse, and that is, when he chargeth God with chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> the land beside them is moving, stirring; so when first we come under the erosse, we think God is changeable, but wee are still the same. The fifth sort of blasphemy which one may have under the crosse, and that is, when he chargeth God with forgetfulnesse; you know that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnesse is the property of an ingrate man and O if you call God ingrate or unthankfull you may call him any thing, I confesse, I thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

there are strange expressions in the Scripture that may make out to a Christian that the cross is not such a thing as many takes it to be. The first expression is in that word, <hi>James 1. 2. My brethren count it all joy when ye fall into diverse temptations.</hi> There are two things in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, which may make it strange. First, A Christian should count it all joy: It had not been so strange if he had said, count it joy or rejoyce when you are afflicted, but O that is strange! <hi>Count it all joy when you are afflicted.</hi> That which secondly makes it strange, <hi>Count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations,</hi> that is, rejoyce ay more and more when you meet with many crosses. There is this strange expression which may commend the crosse, and it is that word, <hi>Job 5. 17. Happy is the man whom God correcteth, &amp;c.</hi> There is very much happinesse in such a lot and dispensation: Some of us thinks there is no people so cursed, as these who are afflicted; But I say, a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans afflictions are no smal mercies and blessings. The third strange expression which may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the crosse, <hi>Job 5. 22. At destruction and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The fourth strange expression which may commend the crosse, is that word, <hi>Rom. 5. 3. We glory in tribulation, &amp;c.</hi> The last expression which may commend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>t, and it is the glorious ends that waits upon these persons which is exercised under the crosse: According to that word, <hi>Jam. 1. 10. Blessed is the man that endureth temptations, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
