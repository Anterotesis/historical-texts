            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>EDification, as applied to the whole Body, is in
Scripture-Notion the Uniting of the Church;
but now by a very unhappy, tho' a very common
Mistake, it is made the great Pretence for
Dividing it. For that wherein our Dissenting
Brethren hope to shelter themselves in forsaking us, is <hi>their
Edifying more in Separate Congregations.</hi> This is thought
a Good Answer to all Laws requiring Communion with the
Parish-Churches; for no Law, they think, can hinder them
from Edifying, and saving their own Souls: and a sufficient
Reason for their rejecting of any Imposed Pastors; which
they fancy are not to be appointed by the Will of the Patron,
or the Prescription of the Church, but by every Mans own
Choice, because no other is so much concerned for his Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as he himself is. To remove this Cause of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
some Worthy<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See a</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse of Profiting by Sermons: <hi>and another</hi> Of Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Persons have taken very Pious and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Pains, in shewing how unjust the Charge of an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying
Ministry</hi> is upon our Church, and how partial they
are in ascribing more Edification to their Meetings. And if
our Brethren will peruse what they have said with impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Minds, and see this, as they may if they will lay aside
all Prejudice, there will be no need of saying any more to
satisfie them in this Business. But if after all they will be
Judges themselves where they Edifie most, and in their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
prefer their own Ministers: yet still there is enough
to with-hold them from Separation on this account, because
they are to edifie and build up the Church of God as well as
<pb facs="tcp:95792:3"/>
themselves, and must not break the Publick Unity and Peace
to carry on their own Profiting in Private Graces. And
therefore, referring them to the forementioned Discourses
(whose Principal Design I think that is) to convince them
that their Assemblies are not more, and ours less Edifying:
in that part of this Sermon which concerns this Case, I have
applied my self more expresly to those who shall still be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convinced,
and think they are: and shewn them, that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
what indeed is otherwise, that among them Particular
Men have better Means of Edification, yet will not the search
of that warrant them to divide the Church, and betake
themselves to Separation.</p>
            <p>And as it will not justifie the <hi>People</hi> in <hi>Hearing:</hi> so,
which is the only thing I shall add further, much less will
it justifie their <hi>Ministers</hi> in <hi>Preaching</hi> in a Separate Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For the Preachers are not less, but more obliged than the
People are, to edifie the <hi>Church of God</hi> in the first place.
And whatever Necessity they may think lies upon them to
Preach the Gospel, in Places where there are no other
Preachers: yet where there are, (and our Brethren will not
deny there are store of Sound, and Profitable ones among us,)
the Care of Edifying the whole Church ought surely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them from breaking Unity by Preaching, and from
drawing Men off from hearing us, only in Hopes they may
Profit more by joyning with themselves. The Duty, and the
Desire, (as of <hi>reaping</hi> greater Profit themselves, so) of <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring</hi>
to the greater Profit of any other Particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
must stop, as this Discourse shews, in Peaceable ways.
And therefore till our Brethren can Conform, and preserve
Unity under their Preaching; they ought to be silent, as the
<hi>Old</hi> Peaceable <hi>Nonconformists</hi> were, and quietly suffer the
People to be taught by others; and not exercise their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
out of any Hopes of doing more Good with it to their
Particular Hearers, when thereby they must cast off the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of their Lawful Superiors, and make a Rent and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
in the Church.</p>

               <bibl>1 COR. XIV. 12.</bibl>
               <q>—Seek that ye may excel to the edifying of
the Church.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Rule is here laid down in the Case of <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
and <hi>Miraculous Gifts,</hi> such as <hi>Prophesie</hi> or
Inspired Preaching, <hi>Tongues, Miracles,</hi> and the like,
which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> zealously coveted, to amuse
Beholders, and get themselves a Name, more than
to Do Good with them to others, and Edifie their Brethren. But
it is equally applicable to all <hi>Ordinary Gifts,</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Endowments,</hi> as <hi>prompt</hi> and <hi>penetrating Wit, clear Understanding,
sound Judgment, Prudence in Conduct, Fluent</hi> and <hi>Elegant Speech,</hi> and the
like: for God's Design is the same in both; he entrusts us with
them, not to feed Vanity, and only seek Praise to our selves, but
to Profit and Edifie our Neighbours. And as it holds in all sorts,
either of Natural, or Miraculous <hi>Gifts;</hi> so also in all <hi>Places</hi> and
<hi>Offices,</hi> which make room for the Exercise and Employment of
them. For as Edification is here made the End of all Gifts and
Abilities; so is it elsewhere of all Offices and Dignities in the
Church. <hi>God gave some, Apostles: and some, Prophets: and some,
Evangelists: and some, Pastors and Teachers; for the Perfecting of the
Saints,</hi> and <hi>the Edifying of the Body of Christ,</hi> Eph. 4. 11, 12. So
that <hi>Edification</hi> is the Great End of all those Gifts wherewith God
endows Men, and of all those Stations and Capacities whereto
he calls them to shew their Gifts in. It is the main thing, which
all are to seek and propose to themselves in all opportunities, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of doing, or receiving Good. <hi>Forasmuch as ye are zealous of
Spiritual Gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Discoursing upon these Words, I shall,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Explain the Nature of Edification, and shew what Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
it implies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Press it as the Great Point whereat they are to aim, on all
sorts of Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95792:4"/>
First, I shall <hi>explain the Nature of Edification, and shew what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
it implies.</hi> And this well deserves to be distinctly and
clearly stated, both for its <hi>own sake,</hi> because God has made it the
Prime End whereto all Mens Parts and Opportunities are to be
directed; and also for the <hi>Churches,</hi> because the lamentable Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
that have so long prey'd upon the Vitals of Religion, and
the Bowels of this Church, are in great part owing to Mens
Mistakes about it. For one of the Commonest, and, I think, of
the most Specious Pretences our Dissenting Brethren give for their
leaving our Parish-Churches, is that <hi>they Edifie and Profit more in
their Private Meetings.</hi> If this Pretence were true, it seems very
plausible. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs all Men to make Edification their
Aim in these things, and it seems to argue a great Goodness, and
a great Wisdom; and so to be most commendable in any Man, to
desire to be better'd by all the Prayers he uses, and every Sermon
which he hears. And whether it be true or no, they think they
are fittest to judge, and that no other Persons are so able to tell
them what Prayers and Sermons they are most benefited by, as from
their own Experience they are able to tell themselves. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
fancying it is for their greater growth in Grace and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
they take heart, and think no Good Man, who knows how
bad he is at best, and is careful to grow as good as he can, will
blame them for it, to break the Unity of the Church, and joyn
themselves to Separate Congregations. Whereas, were they
truly inform'd in the Scripture-Notion of Edification, they would
see clearly that there can be no Pretence of Edifying in a <hi>Schism,</hi>
and that supposing in some Respects, they could edifie more, as they
say, by their own Preachers, yet would not that authorize them to
make a Rent in the Church, and separate from us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edification</hi> in Scripture-sense is the same as <hi>Benefiting</hi> or <hi>Profiting.</hi>
A <hi>Neighbour,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> notes, is <hi>Edified,</hi> when <hi>he is pleased to his
Good,</hi> Rom. 15. 2: and strange <hi>Tongues,</hi> he says, do <hi>not edifie the
Church,</hi> because they <hi>do not profit it.</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 5, 6. So that by
our being <hi>Edified in Religion,</hi> is meant our <hi>Profiting and advancing
in it;</hi> when we attain, either <hi>some Particulars which before we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
or <hi>more Strength and Firmness in those we have already.</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why this <hi>Benefiting in Religion</hi> is call'd <hi>Edifying,</hi> is because both
every <hi>Private Christian,</hi> and the <hi>Whole Church,</hi> is compared in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to a <hi>Building.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes <hi>Particular Christians</hi> are called the <hi>Temple of God.
Know ye not,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, that your Body is the Temple of the Holy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95792:4"/>
Ghost?</hi> which is spoken of Particular Persons. <hi>1 Cor. 6. 19:</hi> and
again, <hi>What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> 2 Cor.
6. 16. <hi>The Temple of God,</hi> i. e. a believing Husband; <hi>with Idols,</hi>
i. e. with an unbelieving Wife who worships Idols, that being plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Case there treated of <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15.</p>
            <p>And at other times, which is the most general use, the <hi>Whole
Church</hi> or Community of Christians is styled so. The Church is
called the<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 3. 19.</note>

<hi>you,</hi> as it did in the Temple among the Jews. <hi>1 Cor. 3. 16:</hi> and

Temple in the Lord, builded for an Habitation of God thro the Spirit.</hi>
v. 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>And this Application of it to both these, is well noted by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>The Temple of God,</hi> says he, <hi>is a Title given in common,
both to the Church or Collection of all the Faithful, and to every Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christian.</hi> And because in Scripture-Language, both the
Whole Church, and Particular Christians, are thus call'd God's
Building; pursuant to that Metaphor, the adding and laying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
those Excellencies that are to integrate either the Whole
Body or any Good Man, or the giving Strength and Firmness to
them, is call'd Edification.</p>
            <p>Now in explaining this Profiting and Spiritual Edification, I
shall shew</p>
            <p>1. Wherein lies the Edification of Particular Men and Private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
and that is in any Growth or Improvement, either in Faith, or
Manners.</p>
            <p>2. Wherein lies the Edification of the Whole Church; and that is
mainly in the setled Peace and Union of its Members.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That</hi> this latter is to be preferr'd, and must give Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
to all Means of promoting the former: So that no Man must
ever seek to edifie in Schism, or break the Peace of a confessedly Sound
and Lawful Church, upon pretence that he can edifie more in Separate
Meetings.</p>
            <p>1. I shall shew <hi>wherein lies the Edification of Particular Men and
Private Christians; and that is in any Growth or Improvement, either
in Faith, or Manners.</hi> This <hi>Benefiting of Particular Men,</hi> is one
sort of Edification the Scripture speaks of. <hi>He that prophesies,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95792:5"/>
saith St. <hi>Paul, speaketh unto men to edification,</hi> i. e. to the benefit of
every one that hears him. <hi>1 Cor. 14. 3. Let no corrupt communication
proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying,</hi>
i. e. to improve your Brethren as you converse with them. <hi>Eph.
4.</hi> 29. And <hi>let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
i. e. to profit him in Religion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 2. In these, and
other Places, the Edification spoken of is that of Particular Men
and Private Christians, when they are any ways furthered and
assisted in those Things, which may please God, and save their
Souls.</p>
            <p>Now Religion consisting of <hi>two</hi> Great Parts, <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
the Spiritual Profiting and Edification of every Man, must
consist in his being any ways assisted, encouraged, or improved in
either of these Duties. So that then every Person is edified, when
his Life and Practice is any thing amended, or his Knowledge of
Religious Matters is more clear and perfect, or his Belief of them
more firm and setled, or his Affections for them more fervent, or
his holy Resolutions and the Religious bent of his Heart more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably
establish'd, or his Conscience more freed from Doubts,
or fuller of Comfort and Joy in God, than it was before.</p>
            <p>1. The chief Instance of any Particular Mans Edification, and
that which, indeed, is the End of all the rest, is <hi>when his Life and
Practice is any thing amended.</hi> And thus 'tis, when he is more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
and resign'd to God, more Just and Charitable to all Men,
more Humble, Temperate, and Mortified to this World, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
in any other Parts of Good Life and Conversation. When
he gains more Virtues, or gets a greater Degree of Constancy
and Firmness in them, having fewer Escapes; and standing in hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Trials, and doing his Duty with more delight and easiness,
than he was wont to do. This Amendment of Life is one way of
Edifying. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> says of <hi>Church-Censures,</hi> whose End is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Manners, that they are <hi>given for edification,</hi> 2 Cor.
13. 10; and of <hi>vain Questions</hi> and <hi>Disputes,</hi> which make none the
better Livers, that they do <hi>not minister to godly edifying,</hi> i. e. to Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
in Godliness. <hi>1 Tim.</hi> 1. 4. Yea, it is the principal point,
and the main thing in Edification. For the Religion of a Good
Life is that which, thro the Merits and Grace of Christ, must save
us all at last, and which God will<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 13.</note> look at in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It is the very End and Accomplishment of Faith and
Knowledge, for <hi>by Works,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>Faith is made perfect.
Jam.</hi> 2. 22. It is the Casting Point, and the One thing necessary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95792:5"/>
in Religion; so that when Men seek to edifie in Religion, they
must seek above all to be better'd and improved in Holy Living.</p>
            <p>And when they seek to be edified in an Holy Life, that must
not only be in some Parts and Virtues, but in the whole Compass
and Extent of it. With Zeal for God, they must joyn Charity
to their Neighbours, yea, even to their Enemies, and Men of most
opposite Opinions. With a serious owning of Religion, Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Temperance, they must joyn a Peaceable Temper, and
Submission to their Governours. And with Obedience to the
Higher Powers, and the Decency and Heartiness of Devotions,
they must joyn all the Duties of Morality, of a sober and just Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
This I note, because the World is generally prone to measure
their Edifying in Religion, by their Edifying only in some Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:
nay, alas! many times by their Edifying only in the Beloved
Notes of a Party, whilst they are altogether barren and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
in the Broad Lines, and Great Instances of Morality. When
a loose and debauch'd Man, for instance, shews himself a Favourer
of the Dissenters, and espouses their Schism; how ready are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
among them, and perhaps he himself is not the last in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, to cry him up for a Saint, and a Precious Person? And
again, if a licentious wicked Liver shew a Zeal for the Churches
Service, and for Submission to the King, (which are things as truly
Good, as the other by mistake are supposed to be) how apt are
others to overlook all his Vices, and, as if these were not only
some, but all Vertues, to set him up for a Right Good Man. When
any thing Men count a Part of Religion is opposed, and they are
put more concernedly to espouse and contend for it; because
others unworthily sleight it, they fall oft-times too much to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
and place all Religion in it, and judge themselves or others
to be Religious from it alone, whilst in other things they are ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religiously
Wicked. They magnifie on all hands the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they oppose each others, and make them the chief Notes of
Virtue, and of the Religion of Persons. So that the Religion
of a Good Life is too often drown'd in the Particular Notes and
Virtues of a Party, and so long as a Man is true to their Side, he
passes for a Good Man, whether in the wide Compass of other
Duties he be true or false to Almighty God.</p>
            <p>But these Particular and Partial Notes are not the Standard of
Edification, nor the way to measure our Improvement in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by. If we take any one particular Grace and Vertue, it is but
one thing, not all Religion, and so is but one Part, not the Whole
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95792:6"/>
of Edification. All the Duties of Good Life are equally Parts of
Christianity, and all necessary to our Salvation: and therefore as
it is, and ought to be our Duty and Aim, to explain, and press; so
is it the Duty, and ought to be the Aim and Care of all our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to learn and practice, and then they must judge themselves to
edifie rightly, when they profit and improve in all of them.</p>
            <p>2. A second Instance of Particular Mens Edification, is when
their <hi>Knowledge of Religious Matters is more clear and perfect,</hi> or their
<hi>Faith and Belief of them is more firmly setled.</hi> And thus the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
tells us, that <hi>Prophesie</hi> or <hi>Preaching</hi> edifies, because it instructs
and convinces Mens Understandings, and so improves Faith and
Knowledge. <hi>He that prophesies,</hi> says he, <hi>speaks unto men to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
1 Cor. 14. 3; he edifies those that hear him, because they are
<hi>taught,</hi> and <hi>convinced</hi> by him. <hi>v.</hi> 19. 24. Whereas, on the contrary,
strange <hi>Tongues,</hi> he says, are very <hi>unedifying,</hi> because <hi>no man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
them.</hi> v. 2. 4.</p>
            <p>And thus again a Man is edified in Religion, when he is any
ways improved in Light and Conviction, when he more clearly and
fully understands the Doctrines and Duties of it, or is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
persuaded of them. And this Improvement in Belief
and Knowledge, he must not measure so much by the <hi>Number,</hi> as by
the <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Usefulness</hi> of Particulars. It is no Edification at
all, or next to none, to load our Understandings with an heap of
nice, curious, and unprofitable things; to lose our selves in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Mysteries; to hunt after Conjectures, and scan doubtful
Questions, about Angels, and the State of Separate Souls, and the
Time of the Worlds ending, and Gods Secret Will and Decrees,
which are not necessary for us to know, and which perhaps no Man
will be able to decide till God determine them. These things
make us no better, nor holier. For nice Disputes, and curious
Conjectures, and aery Notions, never strike down a Lust, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
a Sin: they are light things that swim at top, and float only
in the Brain, but never sink down into the Heart, or reform the
Life of any Man. And since our Heart and Life is not made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by them, they are very unedifying. For the End of all Faith
and Knowledge, is to guide, and improve Good Life and Practice;
so that then we truly edifie in our Understandings, when we learn
things of weight and use, that are like to affect our Hearts, and
direct, stir up, and help us on in the Course of a Godly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
And thus it is, when we are instructed in the Great Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our <hi>Creed,</hi> about Almighty God, and Jesus Christ, and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95792:6"/>
Future Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fully persuaded of them: When we
are enlightned in all the Points of <hi>Practice,</hi> discerning plainly what
is the Nature of all Particular Duties, and what is implied in
them, and what Means are like to help us most in attaining of
them, and what are the most powerful Motives and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to quicken our Care and Endeavours after them. When
we are clearly informed in the Nature of Repentance, and in the
Readiness of God's Spirit and Grace to help on all our Good En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
and in any other things, whereon either our Growth in
Grace, or Peace of Conscience depends, and which are either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Parts, or helpful Means, or prevalent Motives to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Our Minds, I say, are best edified, when they are stored
with such useful things.</p>
            <p>Especially, which is the only thing I will add further, if they
have an <hi>usefull knowledge</hi> of them; i.e. if they know them by <hi>Plain</hi>
and <hi>Clear Accounts,</hi> and not under a Dress of <hi>obscure Phrases,</hi> and
<hi>Allegorical Descriptions.</hi> For some Christians, especially among
our Separating Brethren, think they are much edifyed in Spiritual
knowledge, when they have learn'd to talk much about <hi>Christ,</hi> or
<hi>Grace,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or other most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Points, in dark Phrases, and far-fetch'd, and, very oft, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Metaphors, and affected Allegories, which are very unfit for
Definitions of things, and are not a way to improve and Clear, but
Darken Knowledge. And when men are improved only in such
mysterious Speeches, which, though they may excite some good Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
yet, I presume, can give no clear Apprehensions to their
own minds, since they are very puzling when others, even the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,
come to examine them: I think they cannot give them a Claim
to any extraordinary Edification. For many fine Figures, and
pretty Allegories may be used in setting off a thing, and yet there
shall not be much knowledge in them. They amuse the mind with
pleasing Ideas, and strike the fancy with lucky hints whilst they
are recited; but they give us no just Apprehension of the thing,
and upon examination, a man shall find himself little the wiser, or
more able to explain it unto others, after he has heard them.</p>
            <p>3. A <hi>Third</hi> Instance of Particular mens Edification, is when
their <hi>Affections for Religious matters are made more Fervent,</hi> or their
<hi>holy Purposes are more unalterably fix'd and established.</hi> This exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and increase of Religious Affection, and Godly Resolution, is
another way of edifying. And so St. <hi>Paul</hi> says of him that <hi>speaks
in the Church in an unknown Tongue,</hi> that he <hi>edifies himself,</hi> i.e. in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95792:7"/>
Prayers and Affections, (for such Enthusiasms were ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
express'd in <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praise—he that speaks in an unknown
tongue, speaks not unto men, but unto God. v. 2. 1 Cor. 14. 4. And profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
communication, which ministers Grace,</hi> i.e. a Gracious bent of Heart
and Good Affection, <hi>to the Hearers,</hi> he sayes <hi>is good to the use of
edifying. Eph.</hi> 4. 29. And their <hi>comforting</hi> or<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>exhorting themselves
together</hi> to be Firm and Resolute in the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> amidst all
the Dangers and Persecutions which then environed it, he tells the
<hi>Thessalonians</hi> is the way to <hi>edifie one another. 1 Thes.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
            <p>Good Resolution is the very Strength and Vigor of the Soul,
which prepares it for Tryals; putting it upon all the Pains, and
enabling it to conquer all the Difficulties in Religion. So that
then we are mightily confirm'd in any Graces, when we are more
resolute, and bent upon them. Especially, if this Resolution be
not a rash Act, made hastily in some Religious heat, but the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of serious and due Consideration: as it is, when we foresee
the Pains, and Self-denials we are to undergo in any Duties; but
yet, being fully convinced of the perfect Reasonableness, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Necessity, and the incomparable Advantage of them, we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
resolve upon them notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>And Fervor of Desire and Devout Affection, will enable us
more chearfully, and strongly to resolve upon any Good thing.
It will make us careful and intent to please God, and ready to
deny our selves for his sake, and give us not only Ease, but Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Delight in well-doing; it being natural for Men to be
inwardly satisfied when they have what is desired, and take delight
in things, when once they have an affection for them. So that
then also we are furthered and edified in any Graces, when we are
stirr'd up to a greater quickness in devout Affections, and find in
our selves more ardent Desires, and a higher Passion for them.
Especially, if these Affections were kindled in us, not only by
pleasing Similitudes, and pretty Sayings, or solemn Looks, or
melting Tones, or the Preacher's Passion and Vehemence; but by
the Weight and awakening Force of the Reasons and Things
themselves, which touch'd our Hearts, either when they came
from him, or afterwards when we reflect and dwell upon them in
our own Meditations. If we are put into a Religious Heat and
good Affection, only by Voice, and Vehemence, and the Shew
and Solemnities of Action: that, indeed, is something if a Wise
Man have the government of it, who will apply it to the embet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of his Life, and fix and fortifie his holy Resolution whilst
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95792:7"/>
that Religious Heat is upon him. Tho, I confess, if he stops in
the Affection, and doth not take advantage thereby to be thus
resolv'd; he is much more pleas'd than profited with it, and
gains not much of Edification. But when the Conviction of
our Understandings goes along with this Agitation of our Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the affecting of our Hearts, and we are struck by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the Greatness of the Motives, and the Weight of the
Things: then we have such an holy Affection, as is much more
strong and lasting, and more apt to edifie us. When only Voice
and Vehemence begot the Affection in us, a very small time will
wear it off, as they wear out of our Fancies, which they will
quickly do of themselves, or thro our Fancy's being diverted
and taken up with other things. But when the Weight of Things
and Arguments affected us: those are embodied into our Minds
and Judgments, and so are like to stay with us; and also mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
startle and convince our Consciences, and so are like to have
great power over us. These Convictions are both <hi>Potent,</hi> and
<hi>Durable</hi> things, which greatly affect us for the present, and stick
by us to affect us equally when we reflect upon them at any time
afterwards.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>A</hi> Fourth <hi>Instance of Particular Mens Edification, is when
their</hi> Consciences are more freed from Doubts, and Scruples, and are
fuller of Comfort and Joy in God, than they were before. <hi>And thus
the</hi> weak Brother's <hi>being</hi> confirm'd in Conscience <hi>(tho that was in a
wrong case)</hi> and emboldned, <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>calls his being</hi> edified. If any
see thee, who hast knowledge, fit at meat in the Idols Temple; shall not
the Conscience of him that is weak, <hi>i. e. scruples it,</hi> be embolned
<hi>(the word is</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> edified, <hi>i. e. made to lay aside his Doubts and
Fears by the Authority of thy Example)</hi> and eat <hi>also?</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 10.</p>
            <p>Vexatious Scruples and distrustful Fears, are the Pain and
Sickness, the Swoonings and Faintings of a Religious Soul. They
are a heavy Burden to it, putting it into great Uneasiness, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and Disquietude: and also a great hindrance; for by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartning
they beget a Feebleness and break its Strength, they
keep its Thoughts and Intention employ'd mainly upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which are things that do not profit, and detain them
from making a progress in those which are truly good. And
since Doubts and Despondencies are so truly a Disease and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
to our Spirits, and so great a Discouragement and
Stop to all Religious Service and Improvements; it must needs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95792:8"/>
be an high part of Edification to be clearly resolved about Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Cases, and to have Peace of Mind upon safe Grounds, and
well-satisfied Consciences. So that then our Souls are much edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
when our Doubts are clear'd, and our Consciences truly
resolv'd and comforted. And thus it is, when they are loaded
with a just sense of necessary things, and freed from the vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of needless Scruples; when they are better satisfied, either
about their <hi>Duty,</hi> being resolved whether some Doubtful Cases
are either allowed of forbid by some Laws; or about the <hi>Safety
of their State,</hi> being satisfied upon good Grounds of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Acceptance, which will give them Peace and Joy in
God, and comfortable Expectations.</p>
            <p>And thus we see wherein lies the Edification of <hi>Particular Men</hi>
and <hi>Private Christians,</hi> viz. in <hi>any Confirmation or Improvement,
either of Faith or Manners.</hi> So that then a Private Person may
know himself to be edified, when he gathers strength, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
in the practice of any, or of all Virtues; when he thrives
in plain, and clear Understanding and Belief, especially of
weighty and useful Things; when he is more fervent in Godly
Affections, chiefly if they are accompanied with Convictions of
Reason, and rais'd by powerful Arguments; when he is more
unalterably fixed in virtuous, and holy Resolutions; more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in Practical Cases, and Doubts of Conscience; or more
comforted with Joy in God, and the Hopes of Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>I proceed now</p>
            <p>2. <hi>To</hi> shew wherein lies the Edification of the Whole Church, and
that is mainly in the settled Peace and Union of its Members.</p>
            <p>Edification in the Scriptures doth Principally, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
refer to the <hi>whole Church.</hi> For it, as I have noted, is
most usually styled, and most properly resembled to a Building,
since it contains in it such a Number of Particulars, which, as
so many <hi>live Stones,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, <hi>are built into this Spiritual
House. 1. Pet.</hi> 2. 5. And this Edification of the Church or Body
of Christians, is spoken of by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text—<hi>Seek that
ye may excel to the edifying of the Church:</hi> and so again to the
<hi>Ephesians—Christ gave Apostles and Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Saints, and for the edifying of the Body of Christ. Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now this edifying of the</hi> whole Church, lies mainly in the settled
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95792:8"/>
Peace and Union of its Members; <hi>and the</hi> Great instrument of that
is Love, which makes us look, not altogether at our own things, but
at the things of others.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The edification of the whole Church,</hi> I say, <hi>lies mainly in the
settled Peace and Union of its Members.</hi> The Church indeed is
edified in the edification of its particular Members, when they
grow in Faith and Manners; because it is not barely a <hi>Body of
Men,</hi> but a <hi>Body of Men professing Faith and Holiness,</hi> so that
then it is perfected and improved, when they grow in these
Virtues. And so those Gifts which were most instructing, and
most apt to improve Knowledge and Good Life, as <hi>Prophecy;</hi>
are said here to be more for the edification of the Church, than
other Gifts less instructing, as <hi>Tongues.</hi> But the edification Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to it as it is <hi>one Body,</hi> and a <hi>Church,</hi> is the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union
of its Members.</hi> For Peace and Unity edifies and builds up, as
Separation and Division dissolves and plucks asunder all Societies.
The laying together and cementing Wood and Stones builds
up, as the dividing and scattering them abroad pulls down a
House; and so do Unity, or Division, build up, or destroy all
Communities. <hi>A House,</hi> or <hi>City divided against it self,</hi> says our
Saviour, <hi>shall not stand; and every Kingdom divided against it self
is brought to desolation. Mat.</hi> 12. 25. So that the edification of the
Church, which consists of such a vast number of Members, is the
keeping and establishing them in Unity and Peace, and nothing
is more opposite to edifying, than Schisms and Divisions. St. <hi>Jude</hi>
opposes <hi>Edification</hi> to Separation. <hi>These be they, who separate
themselves—but,</hi> contrary to that, <hi>Ye Beloved, building up your
selves on your most Holy Faith,</hi> &amp;c. intimating, that to edifie or
build up, they must forbear to Separate. <hi>Jude v.</hi> 19. 20. St.
<hi>Luke</hi> says the Churches were edified, when they ceased to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
and Dispersed, and were suffered to be settled and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>Then,</hi> says he, <hi>had the Churches rest, throughout all</hi> Judea,
Galilee, <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>and were edified.</hi> Acts 9. 31. where by <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
I think we may well understand their being settled in Peace,
and established; not only, because their <hi>Rest</hi> is given as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it, to intimate that then they were edified when they were
no longer scattered; but also because the <hi>increase in Grace</hi> and
<hi>Spiritual Comfort</hi> (the other meaning of Edification) is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
besides and added to it—<hi>were edified, and walking in the fear
of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied. v.</hi> 31.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95792:9"/>
And St. <hi>Paul</hi> says the Church edifies it self, not only when by
the supply of all the Parts there is an <hi>increase in Goodness,</hi> but
when moreover it preserves <hi>Unity,</hi> and the <hi>Whole Body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted</hi>
by what every part supplies: So that Edification must
imply Unity and Compactness in the Body, as well as other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Personal and Private Virtue. <hi>From Christ,</hi> says he,
<hi>the whole Body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every
joint supplies, makes increase of the Body unto the edifying of it self.</hi>
Eph. 4. 16.</p>
            <p>Thus in the <hi>Scripture Notion</hi> doth the Edification of the Church
consist in the Unity, Peace, and Compactness of its Members.

Man will please himself, and gratifie his own Humour, there is

that which works this Peace and Union, must be Love of others.

               <hi>The
Members of Christ,</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin, are coupled to
each other by the Charity of Union,</hi> it being Love
which unites them; <hi>and by the same Charity they
cohere to Christ their head too.</hi> 'Tis Love that is
the Publick-spirited Virtue, which, as the <hi>Apostle</hi>
says, <hi>seeks not her own, 1 Cor. 13. 5;</hi> and carries
us to deny our selves out of care and kindness for
our Brethren. And this <hi>care of others</hi> is the only
thing, which can maintain Unity, and prevent <hi>Schism. The
Members</hi> must <hi>have the same care one of another,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,
that there be no Schism in the Body.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 25.</p>
            <p>And thus also it appears wherein lies the Edification of the
whole Church, namely, <hi>in the settled Peace and Unity of all its
Members.</hi> For the Church, being a Spiritual House, is edified
and built up by Unity and Peace, but plucked down and broke
to pieces by Divisions and Separations. And this Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is not to be had whilst we all seek to please our selves, but
only by Love, which is a self-denying Virtue, and the care of
others.</p>
            <p>And thus having explained both the Edification of particular
Men in Faith and Manners, and of the whole Church in the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Peace and Unity of all its Members: I proceed in the</p>
            <p>3. <hi>And last Place, to shew that</hi> this latter is to be preferr'd, and
must give Laws and Limitations to all means of promoting the former:
<hi>So that</hi> no man must ever seek to edifie in Schism, or break the Peace
of a confessedly sound and Lawful, much less of an excellent and very
edifying Church, upon Pretence that he can edifie more in separate
Meetings.</p>
            <p>The latter of these, <hi>I say,</hi> is to be preferr'd, and must give Laws
to all means of promoting the former, <hi>and</hi> particular Mens using any
ways, or seeking any helps to edifie in particular Graces, must always
be in subordination to the Unity and Edification of the Church.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>all the Duties of Christianity,</hi> they are bound to them
absolutely, and no care of maintaining Peace and Unity must
ever draw them to forego them. So that when any Sins are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95792:10"/>
in any Church as the Conditions of Communion, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
of the Host, Worship of Images,</hi> and <hi>Profession of false Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
are in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though thereby they break the
Peace and Unity of that particular Church, yet must every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christian stand out, and not comply with them. For such
Peace with that particular Church upon such corrupt terms,
were nothing less than entering into a Conspiracy, both against
the Universal Church which disclaims these Corruptions, and
against Jesus Christ the Head of it, seeing it is upon Conditions
expresly forbid by his Laws.</p>
            <p>But when all these Doctrines and Duties of Christianity are
left free, nay, openly taught and pressed on all men, which in
Truth is, and our Brethren confess to be our Case: then, as for
<hi>all the helps</hi> and <hi>outward opportunities of improving them,</hi> as <hi>what
Prayers they shall use,</hi> and <hi>what Sermons they shall hear,</hi> and such
like; these must give way to publick ends, and be subordinate
to the Churches edification. To use the best Prayers, and hear
the best Sermons, and be under the most edifying Helps, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
desirable things indeed; and he is very careless of his own
Soul, who, when he wants them, doth not seek them if they
may be had; and unthankful to Almighty God, if he doth not
prize and value them when he is placed under them. But when
we desire, and, in all Peaceable ways, endeavour to have as
good as we can; we must at the same time be content to take up
with such as we may have, and not separate and divide the
Church to find better. We may be sensible of the want, and of
our great unhappiness under a less edifying means in any Church,
when that is truly the Case (though, God be thanked, however
our Brethren mistake it, it is not so with us) and both wish
and fairly endeavour to remove the unhappiness. But when we
are sensible of them, and wish they were removed, we must not
fall into Schism to remove them, nor break the Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Church for better means of private edification.</p>
            <p>To evince this, I observe,</p>
            <p>1. If a Man breaks Unity and publick Peace for better means of
private Profiting, he cannot be said so much as to improve in private
Edification.</p>
            <p>If we allow all Men to reject the established means, which
stand by publick Wisdom, and to chuse any which they fancy
better at their own Discretion; they will not be likely to chuse
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95792:10"/>
such as are really more edifying. I know 'tis Natural for Men
to think well of themselves, and that, unless they are wise, they
will be apt to fancy he undervalues them, who would beget in
them an humble Opinion of their own Judgments. But in truth
the generality of Men are unmeet, and ill Judges in these
things; so that to set them free from the publick means, and
bid them chuse better for themselves, is not the way to put
them under such as are more profitable for them. For some
would still be changing for <hi>varieties</hi> sake, not to have a <hi>more
useful,</hi> but a <hi>New Man:</hi> it being the Property of itching Ears,
as well as of wanton Appetites, to be cloy'd with the best En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
when they are held to them, and never to like of
any thing long. And others would think to edifie <hi>more,</hi> by those
which really are <hi>less</hi> edifying. They would too often chuse to
themselves a Pastor, either from his Gesture and Actions, the
cadence of his Voice, his Zeal and Vehemence; or from his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
in affecting Phrases, and taking Similitudes; or from
his Preaching pleasing things, and insisting most on their beloved
Opinions: and for their sakes reject others, who treat of more
useful and weighty matters, and lay out the great Points of
Religion in all plainness, and speak more to Mens Consciences,
whose Discourses, though less pleasing, perhaps, to some Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
are yet I am sure the more profitable Sermons. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
number of Hearers are observed to be very injudicious in
their choice and applause of Teachers, and to prefer those who
can do them less good, before such as are really fitted to do more.
This is observed by men of the best esteem among
our<note n="†" place="margin">It grieves my very Soul to think, what pitiful, raw, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant kind of Preaching is crowded most after in many places, for the mere affectionate manner of expression, and loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Preachers voice. How oft have have I known the ablest Preachers undervalued, and an ignorant man by Crowds applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when I that have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Preacher <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incunabulis,</hi> have known him to be unable well to answer most Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions in the common Catechism? Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> Cure of Ch. Divis. p 215.</note> Brethren, as well as by others amongst us.
And 'tis no wonder it should be so observable of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hearers, when the <hi>Apostle</hi> tell us the very
same of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in his own case. He was
qualified, sure, in all respects, as one of the most
Powerful and Edifying Teachers, and the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
had known him well enough to see it, and
believe so of him. But yet, such Judges were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
among them, of edifying Preaching, as to
prefer others before him, and desire rather to be
under their Ministry than his, which put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
speaking so much in his own Praise, as he doth

Wisdom,<note place="margin">

            <p>But if they were all so wise, as to fix on proper
means, and, when they reject the established helps,
chuse such instead of them as really are more
edifying; yet if they break the publick Peace
to come at them, they cannot account themselves
to improve in private Edification. If a Man breaks <hi>Peace</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
in <hi>Knowledge,</hi> he loses more than he gets; for in Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Love is better than Learning, and a peaceable Temper in the

he disolves Unity and incurs Schism, to profit better in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

very chief of them. <hi>If it be possible,</hi> and <hi>as much as lies in you,

most perfect in it self, and that which perfects all other Virtues.
<hi>Col. 3. 14. And above all things have fervent Charity among your
selves, for Charity shall cover the multitude of sins, i. e.</hi> it shall
stand you in more stead at the Great day, than any other Duties.
<hi>1 Pet.</hi> 4. 8. And <hi>now abideth Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity, these three,</hi>
all Chief and Cardinal Graces, <hi>but the greatest of these is Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>

very top of Christian Duties, and the most edifying things in
all private Persons; so that they are first to be secured, and
must not be parted with in hopes thereby to improve in any
others.</p>
            <p>Nay, without them we cannot edifie in any others to any
purpose. For if we throw aside Charity, which <hi>seeks not her
own,</hi> but has a care of other Men, <hi>v.</hi> 5. (and that <hi>care of others,</hi>
as he declared<note n="†" place="margin">c. 12. v. 25.</note> just before, will keep out <hi>Schism)</hi> the greatest
Proficiency in <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>other Virtues,</hi> is unprofitable and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95792:11"/>
useless. We have no profit at all by <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments
of our Understandings. <hi>Tho I have the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
and understand all Mysteries, and have all Knowledge, and
the Tongues of Men and Angels, and Faith to remove Mountains,</hi> If
after all I <hi>have no Charity; it profits me nothing.</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2.
Nay, we have no profit by the bravest Actions, but even the best
and costliest things we do, (a sad Case, God knows) are thrown
away, and will not avail to save us. <hi>Tho I</hi> am Heroically liberal
in Alms, and, leaving my self naked, <hi>bestow all my Goods to feed
the Poor;</hi> yea, <hi>tho I</hi> die for Religion, and <hi>give my Body to be burned</hi>
a Martyr; yet, <hi>if I have not Charity, it profits me nothing.</hi> v. 3. So
true was that Observation of the Primitive Christians, that <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Schism,</hi> that consummate Breach of Charity and Union, is
the same among other Virtues, that the Dead Fly is among the
Costliest Oyntments; it will mar all that any man doth, and is
not to be expiated by any thing, no not by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.

not one of the Churches Members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus are Charity, Peace and Unity, the most excellent, and
edifying things in every private Christian; nay, of that necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that no other Gifts or Graces, not the deepest Knowledge,
nor the noblest Alms, nor Martyrdom it self, are of any use, or
able to profit us without them. So that when to edifie in other
Duties, Men transgress them, they give away more than they
get, and are not so truly advanced forward as set back, and so
cannot pretend to go on in Private Edification.</p>
            <p>But besides that they are thus really made worse as Private
Christians, I observe,</p>
            <p>2. That if they were as much improved, as really they are
hindred, yet <hi>would it by no means be lawful for them to make a
Schism, and break the Peace and Unity of the Church to be better edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95792:12"/>
For though it be well, that Men should seek to edifie and
profit themselves in particular Virtues, and do this with care,
seeking after the best means; yet at the same time it is equally
true also, that in so doing they must secure the Peace and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the whole Church. They must not be so zealous for
any means of better edifying and profiting themselves, as for
its sake to make a Rent in the Church, and create Publick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance.</p>
            <p>And this may appear from these Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Because</hi> it is against the Fundamental Law of all Societies, which
is, That no Man shall seek his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Private Profit and Enrichment, by
the Publick Loss and Dissettlement. <hi>And particularly, 'tis against</hi>
the Laws Christ has made for the Peace and Preservation of his
Church, who engages his Members to forego their own Private Profit
for the Publick Peace and Benefit, more than any others.</p>
            <p>2. This breaking Unity to redress and supply less edifying Means
in the Church, is like Sedition in the State for Redress of Civil Defects
and Grievances, and subject to a like Condemnation.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis against the End even of the best Helps and Means of Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which is to establish Peace and keep out Schism, and so are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
perverted when they are made the Ground of Separation.</p>
            <p>4. When the <hi>Corinthians</hi> broke the Unity of the Church on this
Ground, the Apostle charg'd the great Sin of Schism upon them.</p>
            <p>5. If this Pretence would acquit from Schism, there can be no such
thing as Unity in the Church, nor any stop to Separation.</p>
            <p>1. I say, thus to break Unity and Publick Peace, only that we
may have better means to edifie and profit our selves in private
virtues, is <hi>against the Fundamental Law of all Societies,</hi> which
is, <hi>That no Man shall seek his own private profit and enrichment, by
the publick loss and dissettlement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Publick Interest in all reason deserves to be more regarded,
than any Mans Private Benefit. For it is infinitely of greater
weight, and contains more in it: So that if any private profiting
may claim to be pursued, the publick much more, wherein
every single Mans share weighs as much as that, and has the vast
number of all the rest added to it. And the subsistence of all
society and good order requires it should be so prefer'd, since
otherwise it would evermore be some Mans turn, for his own
particular profits sake, to break it. And when any Men embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and combine in Societies, by so doing they all virtually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95792:12"/>
and profess to do it. And in all Communities he really
is, and is generally held an ill Man, who doth otherwise. He is
a bad Member in a Family, that will please himself in some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet
or unseasonable delight, to the disturbance of the whole
Houshold. And he is an ill Man in any Neighbourhood, and a
bad Subject in any Country, who will seek his own private gain
and emolument, tho it be at the general loss, and when the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
suffers by it. It is ill in any Member, for some private end,
to bring any Detriment to the Publick; but especially to make
Seditions, and break the Peace and Unity, which is the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by which it stands, for that is the Civil Death and Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of it.</p>
            <p>But as this is against the Fundamental Law of all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
so particularly <hi>against the Laws Christ has made for the
Peace and Preservation of his Church, who obliges his Members to
forgoe their own Private Profit for Publick Peace and Benefit, more
than any others.</hi> He puts us in mind, that we stand in his
Church, not as independent individuals, who have only our
own gain to look to, but as Parts and Members.—<hi>God has made
us the Body of Christ,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, and Members in particular,
1 Cor.</hi> 12. 27. And being <hi>Fellow-members,</hi> he would have that
beget in us a general care of all that are the same Body with
us, making us sensible, not only of our own, but of others
wants, and ready to denie our selves, or forgoe our own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
or profit, for their advantage. <hi>If one Member suffer, all the
Members suffer with it; or if one be honoured,</hi> saith he, <hi>all the rest
rejoyce with it,</hi> v. 26. <hi>And the Members should have the same care
one of another,</hi> v. 25. <hi>and let no Man seek his own, but every Man
anothers wealth, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 24. And this looking beyond our
selves, and having a mutual care of others, will keep us from
all Schisms, and dividing the Church for our particular satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
or advantage. <hi>When the Members have the same care one
of another, there will be no Schism in the Body,</hi> v. 25. Among all
the Duties he has injoyned, he lays greatest weight, as I have
observed, on those which make for Love and Peace, so that they
must be secured in the first place: they are set as the Ruling
Virtues, which must give Laws; which utterly excludes all Plea
of breaking them, upon pretence of Greater Profiting in any
others: In Religious Matters, says the Apostle, <hi>let us follow after
the things which make for Peace, and things whereby one may edifie
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95792:13"/>
another.</hi> Rom. 14. 19. <hi>Above all things,</hi> says he again, <hi>put on Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which is the Bond of Perfectness:</hi> i. e. which by binding us
together perfects us, for all other Graces are imperfect, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
noted, without Unity and Peace, and it must be added to
them to gain acceptance. Col. 3. 14. And <hi>let the Peace of God
rule in your Hearts, whereto you are also called in one Body:</hi> i. e.
of all others Peace must give Laws, and be the Ruling Virtue,
because it secures that which is the greatest Profit, and most to
be aim'd at in all Societies, viz. <hi>Unity.</hi> v. 15.</p>
            <p>Thus are Men in all Societies, and the Members of Christ's
Church more than any, obliged to be most tender of Publick
Benefit and Peace, and to deny themselves in any Private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
and Advantages, rather than in pursuit of them, to break
Unity and work Publick Disturbance. When they are Members
of Publick Bodies they must have Publick Spirits, and not seek
their own Benefit against the Benefit of the Community. So
that if any man seeks only to please himself, and to carry on
his own Profit and Satisfaction, he can only be Good then,
when there is none in the World besides himself, and he lives
alone, but is an ill man, and an awkward mis-form'd Member in
all Society and Communion.</p>
            <p>2. This breaking Unity to redress and supply less edifying Means
in the Church, is like Sedition in the State for redress of Civil Defects
and Grievances, and subject to a like Condemnation.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Sedition</hi> is in the <hi>Civil State,</hi> that <hi>Schism</hi> is in the <hi>Church
of Christ.</hi> It breaks one Society into many Pieces, and makes
them no longer one Body, but so many several Bodies as there
are disjoynted Parties. And therefore <hi>Church-Schisms</hi> are call'd
<hi>Seditions,</hi> both by St. <hi>Paul—the Works of the Flesh are Heresies,
Seditions,</hi> i. e. Heresies and Schisms, <hi>Gal. 5. 20:</hi> and by St. <hi>Clement</hi>
ordinarily, and other <hi>Apostolical</hi> Writers.</p>
            <p>And when this is made in any Church for Means of better
Edification, because the established Helps happen to have some
Defects, and are not so fitted to our Profit as we would have
them: it is such another way of Redress, as when a Sedition is
made in a State, to remedy the Defects and Grievances of any
Kingdom. In both which, as the Remedy is most <hi>sinful,</hi> being
such an high and open Breach of Peace, which God has made
the most sacred of all Duties: so is it withal most foolish, and
a way of Cure incomparably worse than the Disease. For surely
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95792:13"/>
the tearing Things to pieces, is the worst way of mending
Faults; and Sedition, and the utter loss of Peace, are among
the worst of Grievances that can befal any Communities.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis against the End even of the best Helps and Means of Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<hi>which is</hi> to establish Peace, and keep out Schism; and so are
utterly perverted when they are made the Ground of Separation.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Private Graces</hi> and <hi>Improvements themselves,</hi> the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
even of them is oft-times subject to this End, and they are
always best and most perfect, when they are so used, as that we
may not only profit our selves with them, but edifie the Church
too. Love and Peace are the Ruling Virtues, as I have shew'd,
which must guide the rest, and the Great End whereto all others
must be made subservient. This Rule St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
for the management of themselves in other Duties—
<hi>Let all your things be done with Charity;</hi> so that even other Duties
are in danger of losing their Grace, when they are exercised
uncharitably. <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 16. 14. And the Exercise of <hi>Devotion,</hi>
even in <hi>inspired Prayers</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> when Men were acted by
them, he tells them must be with deference to Peace and Publick
Edification. <hi>Every one,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath a Psalm, but let all things
be done to edifying.</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 26.</p>
            <p>But as for all the <hi>outward Means</hi> and <hi>Helps of Edifying</hi> in these
Private Graces, they are more absolutely subservient to Peace,
and must be so used for profiting Private Men, as that they be
sure at the same time to edifie the whole Church, and maintain
Union.</p>
            <p>These Means of Edification, are either those <hi>Publick Officers</hi>
God has appointed in his Church, or those <hi>Gifts</hi> he bestows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them for the Edification of Believers. And tho it be a great
Design of both these, to edifie particular Persons in Faith, and
Practice; yet is it an higher End to edifie the whole Church in
Peace and Unity, and keep out Schisms.</p>
            <p>1. This Edification of the whole Church, and preserving
Peace and Unity, is the main End of <hi>Gifts.</hi> Thus we are told
of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> rejects when it is used only to
build up and please our selves, and is not govern'd by <hi>Charity</hi>
that <hi>edifies</hi> others. <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 8. 1. And thus also of <hi>Prophesie</hi> or
Preaching, that great Means of Edifying Believers. For tho
it was then an <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>inspired Gift,</hi> yet was it to be
limited by Publick Ends, and the Spirit of Prophecy to be stinted
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95792:14"/>
and suppressed, when it came unseasonably upon them in the
Church, and, by moving several to speak at the same time, bred
confusion and Publick disturbance. <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets
are subject to the Prophets,</hi> i. e. to govern them in subserviency to
the Churches Peace: <hi>For God is not the Author of Confusion,</hi> i. e.
he bestows no Gifts to serve that end, <hi>but of Peace, as in all
Churches of the Saints.</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 32, 33. And to name no more
in this case, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as I have shewed, makes <hi>Charity,</hi> that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Virtue, and sure obstacle of all Schisms, the most<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>excellent
of all Gifts.</hi> So that when the gifted Men themselves are zealous
to exercise their Gifts, or others are zealous to be under them;
they must both have a higher zeal to shew their Charity, and
maintain it in the first place. <hi>Follow after Charity,</hi> says he again,
<hi>and desire Spiritual Gifts:</hi> So that in all exercise and pursuit of
them, they must not fail to follow Love, and take it along with
them. <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
            <p>2. It is also the great end of those <hi>Officers,</hi> whom God has
appointed and empowered, and whom he has endowed with
these Gifts for the edification of his Church; such as <hi>Apostles,
Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers.</hi> For they are <hi>given,</hi>
says St. <hi>Paul, for the perfecting of the Saints, and the edifying of the
Body of Christ.</hi> Eph. 4. 11, 12. They are given for the <hi>perfecting
of the Saints,</hi> i. e. for the edifying particular Christians in Faith
and Practice: but yet so as to be given also <hi>for the edifying of the
Body of Christ, till we come in the Unity of the Faith to a perfect Man.</hi>
So that when these Officers seek to edifie particular Believers,
they must be sure at the same time to secure another end, <hi>i. e.</hi> the
edification of the Body, and Unity of the Church. They are
<hi>given as Members,</hi> which shews evidently they must make up but
one Body, and keep Unity with the other parts: Nay, they
are <hi>given as joynts,</hi> which are the very Ligaments of Union and
Compactness.</p>
            <p>These Officers are <hi>given as Members of the Church,</hi> and that
shews they must make up one Body, and keep Unity with the
other parts. For the Unity of the Body is to be the care of all the
Members, especially of those which excel in Gifts, or are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in Dignity and Office. Thus it is, as the Apostle observes,
<hi>1 Cor.</hi> 12. in the <hi>Natural Body.</hi> It has several Members very
different in endowments, and destined, some to more, some to
less honourable Offices. But because of this difference, the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95792:14"/>
more able and honourable Members do not set up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and seek a Separate Profit or applause, or make a Schism,
and divide from others. Tho there be <hi>many Members,</hi> says he,
they all make up <hi>but one Body.</hi> v. 20. <hi>And the Eye,</hi> tho a more
Honourable Member, <hi>cannot</hi> separate Interests, or <hi>say to the
Hand</hi> (tho less Honourable) <hi>I have no need of thee: nor again the
Head to the Feet, I have no need of you.</hi> v. 21. And none seek
only themselves, which would cause Divisions; but they <hi>have all
the same care one for another, if one suffer, all the rest suffering; or
if one be honoured, all the rest rejoyceing with it; that there be no
Schism in the Body.</hi> v. 25, 26. And like to this in Natural Bodies,
is the difference of Officers in the Church. Tho that have <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Gifts,</hi> as <hi>Wisdom, Knowledge, Prophecy, Faith, Miracles,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10. And <hi>variety of Officers</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> some gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more, some less; some higher, some lower in Authority
than others: for <hi>there are differences of Administrations, v. 5;
God having set first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
after that Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Gifts of Healing, i. e.</hi> Persons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with them, <hi>Helps (i. e.</hi> some distributing Charity, as
Deacons, or attending on Impotent and Orphans) <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
as Bishops and Presbyters, <hi>Diversities of Tongues. v.</hi> 28.
Tho, I say, in the Church there be this difference, both of
Gifts and Ministries; yet must not those differently Gifted or
Authorized Officers draw different ways, and form divided Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but all aim at the Unity of the whole Body as its Natural
Members. <hi>As all the Members in the Body</hi> Natural <hi>are one Body;
so also is Christ,</hi> the different Ministeries and Members making
but one Body in him likewise. <hi>v. 12:</hi> And the several <hi>Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
as <hi>Apostles, Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are all the Body of Christ,</hi> says he,
<hi>and Members in particular,</hi> which therefore must cement toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not fall off and divide from each other. <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28.
And, <hi>as we have many Members in one Body</hi> Natural, <hi>and yet all
these Members,</hi> though the Body be but one, <hi>have not one and the
same Office,</hi> more than these Members of the Church: <hi>So we being
many</hi> Members and Officers (the variety whereof is described,
<hi>v. 6, 7, 8.) are</hi> still to be <hi>but one Body in Christ, and every one
Members one of another</hi> (the difference in Offices giving no more
liberty to divide the Church, than the same difference in the
Natural Members doth to divide the Natural Body) <hi>Rom.
12.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:95792:15"/>
Nay these Officers are not set only as <hi>Members,</hi> which, as we
have seen, is enough to prevent Schism; but they are <hi>set in the
Church as joynts,</hi> which are to compact all the other parts, and
are the very Bonds and Ligaments of Union. <hi>The whole Body,</hi>
says St. <hi>Paul, fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
joynt supplies.</hi> Eph. 4. 16. <hi>Every joynt, i. e.</hi> Every Officer and
Church-governour; for in them the other Members are joynted
and united to one another. And since they are joynts, they
must fasten and unite all the other parts together, not tear
them from each other; what <hi>they supply,</hi> says the Apostle, must
compact the Body, and therefore must in no wise divide it, and
of one make many. So that as for the extraordinary Abilities,
and edifying power of some Pastors and Teachers, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
occasion or head Schisms and Divisions. But must be so
applied by them, and so sought to by others; that whilst it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to build up Faith and Good Life in particular Persons,
at the same time it build up Unity in the Church and Body of
Christ. When an increase is endeavoured, by the effectual
working in every part; that must be in such measure, as the
Apostle says again, as secures the whole Body, and consists with
Publick Peace and settlement. <hi>The effectual working in the measure
of every part, makes increase of the Body to the edifying it self in
Love. Eph.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p>4. When the Corinthians broke the Unity of the Church on this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of greater profiting, the Apostle charges the great sin of Schism
upon them.</p>
            <p>Under their Divisions they had this to plead, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
means were unedifying, and that the Publick Assemblies
were not so ordered, as that they might receive the greatest
profit by them. <hi>When they came together, every one had</hi> a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
<hi>Psalm,</hi> or <hi>a Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>a Revelation,</hi> or <hi>an Interpretation;</hi>
the uttering whereof all at once bred nothing but confusion,
and was not, as he says, a <hi>doing things unto edifying. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 26.
They were generally so forward to shew their <hi>Gifts of Tongues,</hi>
that every one in the Assembly that could, was for uttering a <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
or <hi>Revelation,</hi> or an <hi>Exposition in a strange Language.</hi> And
this made their <hi>understanding Unfruitful</hi> unto others, <hi>v.</hi> 14. So
that <hi>the unlearned, not understanding what was said, could not say A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
at their giving of thanks, v. 16;</hi> that the Speaker only <hi>edified
himself, v. 4;</hi> but that the Congregation was <hi>not edified. v.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95792:15"/>
Nay, there was then, not only much unedifyingness in their
Publick Assemblies, but they divided on this pretence, to asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
themselves with more edifying Teachers. They were
<hi>Zealous,</hi> as my Text says, <hi>of Spiritual Gifts,</hi> and mighty admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of Gifted Men, but very prone to slight others, who were
inferiour to them. They were all for setting up the most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
and edifying Pastors—they <hi>gloried in Men. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 21.
They would flock to those they most admired, where they
thought to edifie most, and become their followers, but separate
from others—<hi>they were puffed up for one against another.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 6.
Yea, for the sake of their admired Teachers, they would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
even St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, alledging that he was <hi>rude in
speech,</hi> i. e. made less elegant, clear, and Edifying Sermons;
and less gifted, than some other more followed Ministers, <hi>2 Cor.
11. 4. 6:</hi> which put him upon speaking so much in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and commendation, as he doth, <hi>2 Cor. c.</hi> 11. and <hi>c.</hi> 12.
For so he excuses all that glorying, and setting forth his own
Praises—<hi>I am become a fool in glorying, but</hi> by such unjust pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
them above me, <hi>ye have compelled me.</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 11. But
when they broke the Unity of the Church, and burst thus into
Strife and Division to set up the most Powerful Gifted Men, and
seek better means of edifying: he tells them they are guilty of
the great sin of Schism. <hi>Whereas there are among you</hi> these <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
tho shelter'd under these pretences, <hi>ye are Carnal, and walk
as Men.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 3.</p>
            <p>5. And lastly, <hi>If this Pretence of Edifying better by the Rent
they make, be a good and warrantable Reason for it, there can be no
such thing as Unity in the Church, nor any stop to Separations.</hi> For
this Pretence will serve almost all men, and that almost at all
times, to break loose, so that no fast hold can be taken of them
in any Church. If the Rule be, to break off from others, and
still to unite with that Teacher by whom he edifies most: the
next Question is, Who shall judge who that is; and that must
be every man for himself, for every man seems best able to tell
his own Gains by what he finds, and one is not a fit Judge of
anothers Profit. And when every man must seek a Teacher
whom he fancies most, tho in opposition to such as the Law has
appointed; since mens Fancies are infinitely various in this
Point, how can there be any Bond of Union in any Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?
For one is most pleas'd with melting Tones, and Voice,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95792:16"/>
and Vehemence; another with pretty Sayings, choice Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes,
and affected Allegories, thinking there lies much Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality
in affecting Phrases; a third thinks Figures and Phrases
only amuse the Fancy, but darken Knowledge, and is for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Weighty and Useful things deliver'd in Intelligible and Plain
Discourses. In Sermons, some seek witty Conceits, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances;
others, ostentation of Learning in citation of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Sentences: Some again think lightly
of both these, and seek more to be inform'd in Deep and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Points, or to be fed with Discoveries of new Notions;
others, to hear a clear State of hard Cases; a third prefers the
most pathetical, moving Preachers; a fourth is for the subtilest
Disputants, who shew most Dexterity and Skill in Controversies.
Thus various are Mens Judgments in these things. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if every Man be at liberty to chuse that Preacher, by
whom he edifies most in what he fancies best, there is not like
to be any setled Union in Parishes or Churches. Nay, the same
Man will not be at unity with himself at different times. For
Mens Humours, and Opinions of these Matters daily alter;
and when they change, by this Rule they must also change their
Teachers; and so are never like to be true and constant, even
to their own admired Congregations. If Men then are free to
leave the Establish'd Ministry, and adhere to any whom they
think they can hear more profitably; 'tis plain the Church can
be no such thing, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> every where<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4. 4. Col. 3. 15.</note> declares it is,
viz. <hi>One Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus upon all these Accounts it appears, that the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Unity of the Church must be preferr'd, and sought
in the first place, and limit us in seeking out the best Means and
Helps of Edifying in Particular Virtues. So that we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seek to supply supposed Defects, and get better Means of
Private Edifying by a Schism. We may labour after them as
we can in all Peaceable ways; but must in no wise for their sakes
break the Unity of the Church, and make Divisions. For
this, as I have shewn, is against the Fundamental Law of all
Communities, which forbids Men to seek their own Private Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
at the Publick Loss; it is against the Fundamental Laws of
Christs Church, who ingages all his Members to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and forego their Private Profit for Publick Peace, and
to be careful of it before all other Duties; it is like raising Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95792:16"/>
in the Civil State for Redress of Grievances, which is a
most Foolish, as well as Sinful Course; it is an utter perverting
of the true End of all Helps and Means of Edifying, whose
main Design is to maintain Peace and prevent Schisms; it makes
Separation endless, and renders it impossible that there should
be any such thing as Unity in the Church; and when Men have
divided the Church on this Pretence, they have been charged
with the great Sin of Schism in the Scriptures. So that in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the best Means of Private Edification, every Good Man
must stop in Peaceable Ways, which are the onely Ways that
are Innocent; yea, and the Ways that are best too, all things
consider'd, and the Benefit of Peace being cast into the Scales,
tho some others should happen to be better when consider'd ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly
in themselves. And therefore no Conscientious or Wise
Man, must ever attempt to procure a Means more edifying to
himself by Separation.</p>
            <p>From this it may plainly appear, how unwarrantably our
Dissenting Brethren act in Separating from us, whom they
confess to be a <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> Church, upon pretence that
they can edifie more in Separate Meetings. To satisfie them
wherein, it may be very fit to consider,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Whether that is indeed true, which is supposed by them,</hi> viz. <hi>That
their Preaching is in it self fitter than ours is for edification.</hi> It is an
invidious thing to make Comparisons, especially when they are
to commend our selves: but we may very innocently, and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
admonish them, to examine this Point well before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
thus of it: Do they come to hear us, before they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the unedifyingness of our Sermons? And if they come at
all, is it only now and then by fits, or often, if not constantly,
for so long at least, till they have heard all the Parts, and so can
comprehend the whole Design, and bear away the Connexion of
our Discourses? And when they are at Church, do they give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
heed, and attend to what we say? And in attending, do
they hear us without prejudice against our Persons, and a design
to find faults, and pick up something to complain of? Yea, what
is more, do they hear us, as I presume they do their own Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
with Reverence and composed Thoughts, which greatly
prepare the Mind to profit and edifie by any Discourses, and
which, tho sometimes perhaps undeserved by the Preachers skill
and eloquence, are yet always most due to the Religion and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95792:17"/>
of the Service, and are Tempers that all Men ought to put
on, whilst others are speaking to them in Gods Name, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
his Message? And after they have heard, do they give
themselves the trouble to make what they heard their own, and
apt to stick by them and affect them, by meditating upon it,
and applying it to themselves, and so bringing it close to their
own Consciences? Without this Honesty and Impartiality, and
Godly care in hearing, they would not be edified if the Holy
Ghost himself were to preach to them; and when Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was upon Earth, his Sermons were unprofitable, and did
not edifie the generality of his Hearers, for the want of them:
and if they are in the same fault in hearing us, no wonder they
are little edified by our Preaching. And after all this, when
they pass Sentence, by what Rule do they try the profitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Discourses? Do they judge a Sermon edifying, only
as it speaks according to their Opinion; or insists most on
some things, and delivers them in such forms of speech as most
please them; or is full only of the glorious Priviledges of the
Saints (which, though fit to be treated of sometimes, must not
ingross all our Discourses, or be more insisted on than those
Duties which are to secure them to us,) and gives comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
intimations that they are all theirs, which may feast their
Fancies with the delightful Thoughts, of their being more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and dear to God than others? Do they judge it to be
edifying, I say, only from such things as these; or as it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
the foregoing Description of Edification? Do they hear
Discourses of weightier matters, or more plain and intelligible
Accounts, less darkned with Phrases and Metaphors, or strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Reasons for any Doctrines, or clearer Explications of any
Duties, or more perspicuous and careful states of any Cases, or
wiser Directions for any Points of Practice, or more forcible
Motives to ingage to the use of them, or more satisfactory So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of any important Questions and Doubts of Conscience in
the Separate Meetings, than they might hear in the Parish
Churches? If they try the Point by these Measures, 'tis like
they will not be so forward to pronounce against us, nor talk
so much of the edification of their own Preachers, and the want
of it in ours.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>If, as they suppose, their Sermons were fitter than ours are
for edification, yet are not they sure to edifie more by them.</hi> For
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95792:17"/>
we are but the Means and Instruments, but the Effect of all
proceeds from Gods Blessing. <hi>We are only Ministers,</hi> says St.
<hi>Paul, by whom you believed. I have planted, and</hi> Apollos <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
but God gave the increase,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 5, 6. And we are
most sure of Gods Blessing, when we keep in Gods own way,
and wait upon him in those Means which he has allotted us.
For God is wont to bless most his own Appointments; and
that not only when they best answer the end of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and are most useful and edifying; but even when
they are degenerated, and edifie less; and accordingly our
Saviour referred Men to them, when that was really the Case.
The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> in his time, were far from the most
<hi>edifying Teachers;</hi> being both <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>ignorant, two</hi> most
unedifying Qualities. They were <hi>Blind Guides,</hi> Mat. 23. 16;
and <hi>bad Livers,</hi> being full of <hi>Vain Glory, Rapine, and Hypocrisie,</hi>
&amp;c. v. 5, 6, 14. But yet unedifying as they were, since they
<hi>sat in</hi> Moses <hi>Seat,</hi> he refers the <hi>Jews</hi> to their <hi>Ministry,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the Blessing of God in their due attendance upon it.
<hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. The <hi>Priests</hi> in those Days, by the <hi>Scripture</hi>-accounts
of them, were far from the Holiest Men; so that if the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of him that brings it be any recommendation of the
Gift, they were not in themselves the fittest to present an
Offering. But yet, because they were the Means of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing,
when the <hi>Leper was cleansed,</hi> and was to return God
an <hi>Oblation,</hi> Christ orders him to carry it <hi>to the Priest,</hi> because
thro his Hands God would accept it of him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 4. Thus
is Gods Blessing, which is the great cause of our profiting,
to be looked for in Gods own ways, and in attendance upon
the means which he has allotted us; and we have not a like
reason to expect it when we reject them, especially if we
run into a plain Breach of that Unity and Good Order he has
established in his Church, in pursuit of others. And when
Gods Blessing goes along with them, we shall edifie more by
weaker means; so that a more edifying Sermon in an unedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
way, such as <hi>Schism</hi> is, is not so like to profit us.
But</p>
            <p>3. If they could edifie more by them, yet is it in no wise
lawful thus to break the Unity and Peace of the Church for
better Edification. There is no breaking Publick Peace, as
we have seen, for better means of Private Profiting: so that no
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95792:18"/>
Man must ever seek to edifie in Schism, or to grow in Grace by
joyning in Separation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus I have explained the</hi> Nature of Edification, <hi>and
shewn what Improvements it implies;</hi> viz. Any increase in
Private Virtues, <hi>or in</hi> Publick Settlement and Peace. <hi>So that
then any Man</hi> edifies in Religion, <hi>when he is</hi> bettered in any Point
of Faith or Manners, or made more complying with innocent Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Constitutions, <hi>and a</hi> more peaceable Member of the Church.</p>
            <p>And having thus shewn what it implies, I am now</p>
            <p>2. To press it as the Great Point whereat they are to aim, on all
sorts of Christians.</p>
            <p>And here had I time, I should urge <hi>all Christians</hi> to lay out
themselves in improving useful Knowledge, and obedient
Practice, and peaceable Inclinations; to stir up and cherish in
themselves devout Affections, and daily renew and strengthen
Holy Purposes, and express in the whole course of their Lives
the power of Godliness, in all due submission to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and tender care of the Churches Peace, as well as in all
Duty towards God, and exercise of Private Virtues. For this
is truly to grow in Grace, and be edified Believers.</p>
            <p>I would intreat you, my <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> in the Name of
Christ, whose <hi>Ministers</hi> we are, not only to be exemplary and
shining Lights in edifying thus your selves; but also to be
wise and unwearied in your Labours, in carrying on this Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
among all others you can any ways work upon, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those committed to your Charge. That you would instruct
the ignorant with all assiduitie and plainness; convince the
erroneous, with all gentleness and calm arguings, yea with
all Patience and Perseverance, remembring that it is an hard
matter, and a work of time, for a Man to cast off old and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
Opinions, and that any one is troubled enough in being
shewed his error, without hearing of it in Anger and Invective
Speeches; and labour to win all Men over to an universal
Holiness with your utmosh skill and diligence. That you would
study to be plain, and useful in all your Sermons: Prudently
bold, and impartial in Reproofs; warning Men against all,
even their beloved Vices, with such freedom, as may keep
their Consciences awake, and yet with such shew of tenderness
and prudent timing of Reproof, as may not tempt them to fly
out from us: endeavouring to reclaim them from Schism,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95792:18"/>
which is most mischievous to the Church, and which nothing
can excuse before God but an honest Ignorance, and the piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of unmasterable Prepossessions; and from all Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Immoralities, which, without particular Repentance
and Amendment, are most surely mischievous to their own
Souls, which have no Plea of Pardonable Ignorance and Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntariness,
and for which there is no Excuse at all. In all
which, by the Love of Christ I would beseech you, to shew all
Wisdom, and Diligence, and Patience, and unwearied Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and compassionate Tenderness and Love for Souls.</p>
            <p>I would in all Christian Love beseech our <hi>Dissenting Brethren,</hi>
and be instant with them, since it so nearly concerns both the
Church and them, that they would seek no longer to build up
only themselves; but to edifie the Church of Christ, which
they certainly pull down by their Separation.</p>
            <p>In very deed they may have great Means of Private Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in our Church, and need not seek for better in any other
Place. They will edifie sufficiently by our <hi>Sermons,</hi> as I have
noted, if they bring along with them prepared Minds; and
and without them the <hi>Jews</hi> could not edifie by the Sermons of
<hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> And if they cannot edifie by the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Prayers</hi> too, the Fault, I am sure, is not in the <hi>Prayers,</hi> but
in <hi>themselves.</hi> For consider, Brethren, the Prayers we use are
not to give Affections to us, but to express those we have; so
that when we come to Pray, we must bring them along with us.
And if we come with an awful sense of God in our Minds,
with serious and good Purposes, and devout Affections; we
need no better Helps to express them, than the Churches Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
For therein are sound, suitable, and well-composed
Prayers, which extend to all Necessities, begging all needful
Graces, and praying particularly both against Sins and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and requesting outward Blessings, and giving Thanks
for Receipt of Mercies, and interceding for all States and
Conditions of Persons, and suited to the Great Periods and
States of Life. In all which they pitch upon the most pertinent,
and proper things; and express them in Grave, Plain, and
Significant Language; and are intermixed with <hi>Responses</hi> to fix
Attention, and call back wandring Thoughts; and are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd
into Collects to give Breath, and not weary us out with
an uninterrupted continuance of intense Affections. So that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95792:19"/>
if we bring with us a Heart to desire these things, here we have
Prayers to suggest, and express our Desires of them; yea, such,
as whilst they do express, are greatly fitted to increase them.
Thus fit are they to edifie in themselves, and this great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of truly Pious and Devout Souls have found, and from
their own Experience can testifie concerning them. And now,
if any shall still charge such excellent Prayers as unedifying;
where lies the blame? whether in the Deadness of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or the Indevotion and Unpreparedness of their own Hearts?
If a Man thinks the most wholesom and substantial Food dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasteful
or insipid, 'tis a sign he has a depraved Appetite. And
if he feels no Devotion in the use of such Pious, Wise, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Forms, 'tis a sign his Soul is sick, and that his Spiritual
Sense has lost its Taste, since the most agreeable Food is no
better rellish'd by it. He is Indevout, not because the Prayers
do not suggest Devout things, nor cloath them in Proper and
Devout Expressions; but because he doth not hold his Mind
attent, or has not prepared his Heart to be affected with them.
So that if these our Brethren will take the Godly Care and
Pains to mend this Fault which is in themselves, and come with
Reverent and Prepared Minds; they will not, I believe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
any longer of Deadness and want of Edification in the
Churches Prayers, which are not only Good, but, as those who
use them without prejudice, and with Devotion in their Hearts
can testifie, very excellent for that purpose.</p>
            <p>But tho they could not so well edifie themselves in them;
yet, by the Love of Christ I would beseech them, to seek no
longer to build up only themselves; but to edifie the Church
of Christ, which they pull down by their Separation. Make
Conscience of Peace and Unity, Brethren, and think them as
Necessary things, as any others in Religion. Remember it is
one of the necessary Properties of Charity to have such care of
others as keeps out Schism; and that without this Charity there
is no Benefit in any Services, no not in Martyrdom: and how
then can you account to your selves the throwing that away,
for any other thing? Esteem your selves as Members of the
Body, and consider that the Body is built up by Unity. This
Christ has founded upon himself, and the Apostles, those Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Builders, have edified, by compacting it into one: and
how then will you look either upon him or them, who pluck
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95792:19"/>
asunder what they put together, and pull it down by Division?
The Design of God in all the most Powerful Gifted Ministers,
is to build up the Body, and keep out Schism: and what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
will you give to him for crossing that Design, in making
these not only the Heads of Parties, but the Pretence of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
If you had lived in <hi>Corinth,</hi> when Men separated, as
you do here, to follow more Gifted Guides, would not you
have returned again to the Unity of the Church upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's
Admonition? And why then should you not do the same
now, upon this Intimation, that his Reproof reaches you, as
much as it did them? The Way of Separation, my Brethren,
is a most unedifying Course; for Unity builds up, but Schism
destroys the Church, and all Societies. So that if you would
edifie the Church, which is Christ's Spouse; if you will be
at any pains to build it up, as he was at the pains to die for
it; it must be in the way of Peace, and by submitting to any
thing, which you think may be done with a safe Conscience
(as this Plea it self shews you do think in our Case, it being
against our Way only because, as you say, less Edifying, not
because of any Unlawfulness) rather than upon account thereof
to divide, and form separate Parties.</p>
            <p>I would exhort you the <hi>Church-wardens</hi> to be careful of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
not only as Private Christians, but also in the faithful
discharge of your Oaths, (considering that Perjury has in it
a most horrible Guilt) and in the Duties of your Places.
That when you endeavour to suppress Vices, you would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial,
and intire in such endeavours; considering, that all
Notorious Swearing, Drunkenness, and Immoralities, as well
as staying away from Church; and that all staying away out of
Irreligion and Carelessness, as well as out of Scruples and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Conscience, is equally a matter of your Oath, and a
Point wherein you may do God, and the Souls of Men Service.
The <hi>Church-wardens</hi> swear, indeed, to discharge this only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the best of their Knowledge; but then they must
use a competent endeavour to know it, and this is no warranty
at all to affect Ignorance; and much less to pass over what
they do know, in negligence, or connivance. And many, it
may be of those that fail, would discharge it so far as they
know, were it not that they are afraid to anger, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
their Neighbours. But 'tis most unreasonable any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95792:20"/>
Man should be angered with them for performing their Oaths,
and discharging a Good Conscience. Can any Man, if he has
left the Conscience, have left the Modesty withal so far, as to
desire them to forswear themselves, and destroy their own Souls
to do him a kindness? Or will any Man that is Conscientious,
and stays from Church out of Conscience, take it ill that they
should be tender of their Consciences as well as he is of his, and
dread the horrid Sin of Perjury, the greatest wound to a Good
Conscience? They have no liberty of Connivance, being bound
up by Oaths; so that if any favour and indulgence be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it must not be from them, but at higher Hands. And
therefore no Man, in any Reason or Modesty, can be angred
at them for acting faithfully according to their Oaths. But if
any be; that Anger at Men for performing Oaths and a Good
Conscience, is nothing less than frighting them from their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and laying Stumbling-Blocks before others, and putting the
Burden of the Cross on Good Mens Shoulders for good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which has so many Woes denounced to it in the Scriptures.
And as for the <hi>Church-wardens</hi> themselves, when they incur
any Displeasure or Malice of Men on this account, they may
encourage themselves with this, that therein they suffer for
Righteousness sake, and endure the Cross for keeping a Good
Conscience, wherein they may comfortably commit themselves
to God, expecting, that either his Providence will prevent
any ill effects, or infinitely make them up to them afterwards,
because they have thus exposed themselves only to be faithful
in his Service.</p>
