            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The
Speech of the Earl of Shaftsbury then Lord
Chancellor, when Serjeant Thurland was
made Baron of the Exchequer.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Serjeant Thurland,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe King of his Grace and Favor, hath made
choice of you to be One of the Barons of the
<hi>Exchequer.</hi> He designed to place you in a Court of
more Profit, though not of more Dignity; but your
own Modesty and Vertue hath chosen this Court,
where you thought you could serve the King best.
And I could not omit to mention it here to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
it being the greatest instance of a good Man, That
he had rather be found serviceable than rich. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
hath had large proof of your former Services; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
He takes you upon the credit of that Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
that hath <hi>Justly</hi> the best place with Him, I
mean His <hi>Royal Brothers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some few things it is fit I should here mention to
you, and leave with you as Admonitions, or rather
Remembrances. In the first place, you are to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the <hi>Kings Prerogative;</hi> and let not the <hi>Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi>
and the <hi>Law,</hi> be two things with you. For the
<hi>Kings Prerogative</hi> is <hi>Law,</hi> and the Principal Part of the
<hi>Law;</hi> and therefore in maintaining that, you maintain
the <hi>Law.</hi> The Government of <hi>England</hi> is so excellently
interwoven, that every part of the <hi>Prerogative</hi> hath a
broad mixture of the Interest of the Subject; the ease
and safety of the People being inseparable from the
Greatness and Security of the Crown.</p>
            <p>In the next place, let me advise you, that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
your self with the <hi>Revenue,</hi> as also with the
<hi>Ancient Records, Precedents,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of this Court.
For want of which knowledge, I have seen this Court
a most excellent <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> when at the same
time, I could not say so much for it as an <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place, let me recommend to you, so to
<pb facs="tcp:61939:2"/>
manage the <hi>Kings Justice</hi> and <hi>Revenue,</hi> as the King may
have most <hi>Profit,</hi> and the Subject least <hi>Vexation.</hi> Rak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for old Debts; the number of Informations; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
upon Concealments: I could not find in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years experience I have had in this Court ever
to advantage the Crown. But such proceedings have
for the most part delivered up the Kings good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
into the hands of the worst of men.</p>
            <p>There is another thing I have observed in this
Court, that I shall mind you of, which is, When the
Court hearkens too much to the <hi>Clerks</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> of
it; and are too apt to send out <hi>Process,</hi> when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
may be raised by other ways more easie to the
People. I do not say, That the Kings duty should be
lost, or that the strictest course should not be taken,
rather than that be: But when you consider, how
much the <hi>Officers</hi> of the Court and the <hi>Under-Sheriffs,</hi>
get by <hi>Process</hi> upon small Sums, more than the Kings
duty comes to; and upon what sort of People this falls,
to wit, the <hi>Farmer, Husbandman,</hi> and <hi>Clothier</hi> in the
Countrey, that is generally the <hi>Collector, Constable,</hi>
and <hi>Tithing-man;</hi> and so disturbs the industrious part
of the Nation, you will think it fit to make that the
last way, when no other will serve.,</p>
            <p>Give me leave also to mind you of one thing
more, which is in your Oath, <hi>That the Kings needs ye
shall speed before all others:</hi> That is, the business of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of the Crown</hi> you are to dispatch before all other,
and not turn your Court into a Court of <hi>Common Pleas;</hi>
and let that justle out what you were constituted for.</p>
            <p>In the last place, let me conclude with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
all my <hi>Lords</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> as well as you, let me
recommend to you the <hi>Port,</hi> and way of living suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the dignity of your place, and what the King
allows you. There is not any thing gains more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and Respect to the Government, than that
doth: And let me tell you, <hi>Magistrates</hi> as well as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi>
are supported by <hi>Reputation.</hi>
